Gartner predicts a tipping point in 2022 when two out of three companies will have deployed at least one digital twin to optimize some facet of their business processes. In manufacturing, digital twins can help equipment operators anticipate breakdowns, refining maintenance timing and reducing unexpected maintenance shutdowns, thereby dramatically lowering costs. The process is a simulation that allows engineers and designers to create virtual replicas of physical systems and devices, then introduce variables such as temperature, speed, and pressure. Digital twinning is different from creating a computer aided design (CAD) model in two ways: its real time connectivity and its variance, or ability to dynamically change the object's design and operating conditions.\u00a0For example, \u00a0 aircraft engine digital twins combine sensor, performance, and environmental data with historical data from similar engines. The digital twin can then predict the life span of various engine components under different scenarios.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $260.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $244.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ANSS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $262.18/share today.\n\nBecause the $260.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?  -- Thank you Lee. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you are healthy and safe during these uncertain times. I would like to start by thanking the entire ANSYS team.Their professionalism, commitment during this crisis has been exemplary and it made a tremendous difference for our customers. Let me first talk about how ANSYS responded to COVID-19 and describe our Q1 performance and how we are operating our business in these unusual times. Then I will take a step back and discuss the ANSYS business as a whole, specifically why ANSYS is important to customers and why the business is resilient. Finally, I will provide some color on key elements of the business going forward including a description of some of the headwinds that we are seeing before I turn the call over to Maria.Of course, ANSYS' first responsibility is to the health and safety of our employees and their families and to the ANSYS community around the world. In mid-February, we closed our offices in China and enabled our employees to work from home. As the crisis spread, we closed other locations around the world. Today, with the improving situation in China and Korea, our offices in those countries are open with our employees maintaining appropriate social distances and health and safety protocols.Our offices elsewhere remain closed or open only to essential staff with the vast majority of employees worldwide continuing to work from home. Our employees have quickly adapted to the challenge, and we are fully engaged in driving our business forward in the work-from-home model. In the last several years, we have invested in our infrastructure and business applications including our networking and remote access capabilities as well as collaboration technology. These investments have turned out to be invaluable and are helping us run our business today.We are continuing to pay all our salaried and hourly workers, and we are not planning any job action. In fact, we are onboarding new employees remotely and provisioning them to work from home. We have a number of open job requisitions and are seeing a strong flow of candidates who are looking for the stability that a company like ANSYS can provide. We believe that our ongoing investments in our growing team put ANSYS in a strong position to capture additional opportunity once this crisis is abated.As you may recall from when we guided in February, we were expecting the first quarter and the first half of the year to be challenging because of tough year-over-year compare, the effect of China sanctions and a back-end loaded full year. Of course, worldwide economic conditions worsened through March. Nonetheless, I am very proud that the solid execution by the ANSYS team, our revenue, earnings and operating margin for Q1 came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance. In Q1, we saw strength in a number of industries including automotive, high-tech and energy.In these verticals, our solutions that support the key initiatives of autonomy, electrification and 5G continue to resonate with our customers. For example, in Asia, we inked a new three-year contract with an existing consumer electronics customer to expand its usage of our flagship multiphysics solutions as well as to expand into digital twins. In North America, we closed several large deals in the high-tech and semiconductor sectors including at a global hardware provider that agreed to standardize on ANSYS, displacing several competitors. We also closed a seven-figure deal with NuScale Power to bring its small modular nuclear reactor designs to reality through the power of simulation.We were also able to forge new relationships with organizations that have not previously used ANSYS. For example, we signed a seven-figure contract with a new customer, Software Motor Company or SMC. By using ANSYS multiphysics solutions supported by ANSYS Cloud, SMC is developing an automated workflow to rapidly design and analyze motors to be used across industries. The enhanced workflow can compress the weeks of simulation and months of protype testing typically required for these virtually silent motors.In Q1, we delivered Ansys 2020 Release one and despite working from home, we will deliver our release to the customers in the summer as originally scheduled. These are major releases and include new capabilities across our multiphysics product portfolio. All products continue to receive recognition and accolades from our customers and partners. For example, industry leader, TSMC recently certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC next-generation system-on-chip power noise sign off-platform for TSMC's FinFET process nodes.This helps customers verify the power requirements and the reliability of chips we use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and high-performance computing applications. Similarly, Samsung foundry has certified the ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for design using its new 3-dimensional integrated circuit packaging technology. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and ANSYS flagship HFSS into a single chip packet system design environment. By validating electromagnetic effects in Samsung's 3D assembly, RaptorH empowers designers to eliminate critical points of failure and accelerate the rate of new technology adoption.We are continuing to look at opportunities to expand our portfolio through M&A. We recently closed our acquisition of Lumerical which will enable ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. This is critical as 5G applications and autonomous vehicles are producing massive amounts of data, forcing organizations to handle even more information faster than ever. Lumerical's products enable designers to develop new, high-throughput optical networks by modeling the most challenging problems in photonics including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects.We were able to virtually onboard the Lumerical team, and I'm excited to welcome them into our ONE Ansys family. I'd now like to discuss the ANSYS business and explain it to the zodiacs. The ANSYS value proposition is compelling, both in good times and in tough economic times because simulation helps our customers drive both top-line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Using ANSYS simulation, customers can rapidly innovate, easily validate design ideas and improve cycle time.This means that they can launch more of the right products, and do so at a faster pace which translates to top-line growth. In addition, simulation can help customers get more impact from tight R&D budgets by giving engineers the tools to evaluate multiple design options cost effectively and in parallel and by reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing. That is particularly relevant during this global crisis when some customers cannot get access to their labs physically test products. The compelling value and the mission-critical nature of simulation is why customers continue to rely on ANSYS even during periods of uncertainty.It is important to note that the bulk of customers' investments in simulation comes from their research and development or R&D budgets. R&D is the lifeblood of our customers. It's the key differentiator. Our experience is that in tough economic times, R&D is typically the least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored primarily because it drives future growth and market success.We believe that this is a commonly accepted perspective, and it is corroborated by studies in the Harvard Business Review and by the consulting firm, MacKenzie. This ongoing investment in R&D and in simulation in tough economic times is best illustrated in the automotive industry, where softening demand and worker safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 crisis have forced manufacturers to shut down factories and cut budgets. However, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other automakers have publicly reported continued investments in R&D, especially in next-generation technologies, such as autonomy and electrification. If you recall from earlier discussions, these next-generation technologies are exactly where ANSYS has been making strategic investments through both organic development and acquisitions.At ANSYS, we continue to see investments in simulation by automotive OEMs and their suppliers across geographies. Let me give you two examples from Q2. In Asia, DENSO, the Tier 1 automotive supplier, recently signed a three-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy as well as for our platform technologies. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, recently inked an important deal with a major automotive OEM for the adoption of LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing a competitive product.This is exciting news, indeed, coming just a few months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC. As I also discussed at last year's investor day, ANSYS is a resilient model due in part to the number and diversity of customers we serve. We have thousands of customers across multiple industries including high-tech, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial and energy. And we are well balanced across the geographies with about 40% of our business coming from the Americas and the rest split roughly evenly between Europe and Asia.That diversity means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. And it also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any individual customer, industry or country. Furthermore, our sales channels are diversified with about 75% coming from our direct force, with the remainder coming from channel partners. We are very flexible in our licensing and consumption models, and customers can purchase a perpetual license, a lease license or a pay-as-you-go elastic license and can consume our technology on-premises or in the cloud.We believe this diversity and flexibility allows us to reach and support a broad range of customers around the world. I'd now like to give some color on the challenges our users are facing and how we're accommodating them and provide additional comments on the demand environment including a perspective by industry and by geography. It is important to note that our analysis of demand has already been factored into our Q2 and full-year guidance. Let me also caution that with the unprecedented market volatility we are all experiencing, demand could change in either direction as the global situation continues to evolve.We expect the most significant business disruption to occur in the second quarter when our teams and those of our customers work remotely. We are currently assuming a modest recovery in the business environment during the third quarter as states and countries slowly reopen, and business and consumer sentiment begins to improve. We also assume business activity and customer sentiments will continue to improve through the fourth quarter. Comparing this period of disruption with the pre-COVID environment, we expect different kinds of customers will be impacted in different ways.First, it is likely to be more challenging to close deals with brand new customers primarily because of the difficulty in building new relationships and driving demand with new prospects remotely. Fortunately, for ANSYS, over the course of our 50-year history, we have built a large and loyal customer base. And so while new customers are important, the majority of our business comes from existing customers. Second, we expect larger accounts to perform more strongly than small- and medium-sized businesses.This is to our advantage as the majority of our business comes from these larger accounts. Larger customers have stronger liquidity and capital position, and we believe that a majority of them will be able to maintain their R&D cycles. In contrast, smaller customers tend to be more sensitive to liquidity constraints and are more likely to delay purchases. So however that we believe government programs, especially in Europe, will mitigate some of this risk.Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new business will come under incremental pressure. We also expect customers to prefer leases over perpetual because of the smaller initial financial commitment of the lease. And we will see additional scrutiny given to large multiyear contracts which could result in delays in signing or perhaps smaller commitments than we had previously expected. This could introduce incremental timing uncertainty into our top line.Our prepared remarks contain a more comprehensive discussion of the attributes affecting our pipeline conversion and their related impact. With that backdrop, I'll shift to an industry view. We are seeing little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical which accounted for about a third of our business in 2019. Many of these customers have deep pockets and are developing products against a multiyear road map, and they are not willing to let a few quarters of uncertainties slowing down.Other companies in large markets such as 5G are in a global race for leadership positions within their industry and are unwilling to delay their R&D efforts and thus see their future to a competitor. Let me now move to aerospace and defense. We anticipate investments will continue for defense and military aerospace driven by long-term government programs, and we expect to see little to no reduction in demand for ANSYS technology in this vertical. Commercial aerospace and contracts will be impacted in the short term driven by both pre-COVID challenges faced by some companies and by the dramatic reduction in passenger air travel as a result of this pandemic.However, in the medium to long term, I believe this will be somewhat mitigated by the continued need of long-term R&D initiatives that address environmental issues and government regulations. In the automotive industry, although there has been widespread idling of manufacturing plans, R&D are still receiving funding. And that is particularly true for emerging solutions like autonomy and electrification where ANSYS plays a key role. However, we are expecting to see headwinds on more traditional R&D activities in the sector.Given the need for competitive differentiation, we expect to see ongoing investments in new product introductions for industrial equipment. Although we anticipate a reduction in R&D spending on existing products in this vertical. The low price of oil is causing headwinds in the energy sector. Fortunately, this vertical accounts for a relatively small portion of our business.Let me turn now to a geographical view. Relative to our expected performance of the geographies at the time of our last earnings call, we believe North America will fare the best. North America has a largest installed base of big enterprise customers, and a number of these customers are due to renew their leases of ANSYS products in 2020. We expect a high renewal rate for those leases, and we also expect to attach new product sales to the renewals.Our North America customer base includes a good percentage of high-tech and semiconductor companies, and we expect their R&D and simulation initiatives to continue to receive funding. Asia Pacific entered the COVID-19 crisis a few weeks before the rest of the world. We did see an initial reduction in demand activity there, but we're now seeing a return of demand. For example, we saw China end Q1 stronger than we had expected, and it continues to have momentum in Q2.The high-tech and semiconductor industry remains strong throughout the region. However, we do see some headwinds in the more traditional automotive investments and the heavy industrials. We're expecting some disruptions in business in EMEA, in part because of headwinds related to industrial and traditional automotive activities and in part because we saw some customers struggle with the transition to a work-from-home model. Still, we see relief coming in the form of government programs designed to help companies, especially smaller ones deal with the near-term financial stress.With all these uncertainties, we are reducing our full-year revenue and ACV guidance by mid-single digits, with the greatest impact coming in Q2. Maria will go through guidance in more detail. Before I finish, I would like to mention that we are preparing a simulation world, our exciting new online conference that brings together simulation thought leaders and users from around the world. Simulation World will feature a who's who event as customers including Volkswagen Motorsport, Baker Hughes, Ericsson and Porsche Motorsport.Simulation World already has more than 10,000 registrants, demonstrating the value of simulation in the marketplace. I'm very excited that this forum gives us a new and unique opportunity to generate demand for our multiphysics portfolio. Despite the uncertainties in the market, we believe that our strategy of pervasive simulation and the value that we deliver to our customers is more important than ever. Our strategy accelerates customers' key research and development initiatives which are not typically impacted by economic slowdowns, and we support critical emerging areas like electrification, autonomy, 5G and the industrial Internet of Things.And our value proposition is compelling to customers, both in good times and in tough economic times because we can help our customers drive both top-line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. I am confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term growth. And with our continued investment in the business, I believe we are well positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q1 and provide more detail around our outlook and assumptions for the remainder of 2020.Maria? -- Thank you Ajei. Good morning everyone. I'll begin with a perspective on our first-quarter financial performance. Then I'll also provide qualitative and quantitative color and context around our outlook assumptions for Q2 and the remainder of 2020.In connection with our updated outlook, I will encourage you to please review all of the earnings documents that we have posted to our investor relations website. Before I get started, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to my ANSYS colleagues, who have all successfully navigated the work-from-home transition to enable us to continue to operate our business, support our customers and to be able to meet all of our financial reporting deadlines including all of the efforts that have gone into supporting today's earnings call. Your teamwork, flexibility, dedication and innovation have been personally inspiring. And for that, I just want to say thank you.Although we faced a more challenging customer demand environment in the latter part of March as compared to our expectations at the time that we provided our February guidance, our financial results reflect solid execution which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all toward the midpoint of the guidance ranges that we previously provided for the quarter. Our start to the year is very encouraging when considering the tough Q1 2019 comparable, in which we reported double-digit revenue growth and the negative impact that COVID-19 inflicted on global economies in the first quarter. Our key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $301 million, with 82% coming from recurring sources and total revenue of $309 million. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first-quarter guidance.We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $835 million, representing a 24% increase over last year's first-quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline which yielded a solid first-quarter gross margin of 88% and an operating margin of 29%, in line with our Q1 guidance. Margins were positively impacted by a slower pace of hiring than we had planned as well as reduced travel and corporate event spending. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.The net result was first-quarter EPS of $0.83 which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19.5%. And going forward, we have adopted a normalized effective tax rate approach for non-GAAP reporting and expect our effective tax rate to remain at 19.5% for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $147 million, and we ended the quarter with a total of $718 million in cash and short-term investments.In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 690,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $233.48. We have 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global markets, we will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions as they continue to evolve in determining when might be the most opportune time to reinstate any future share repurchases. Through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we believe that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the current environment.Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. As this crisis has evolved, our team has created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe is the most appropriate framework for giving investors a forward-looking view of the business based upon everything that we currently know. That being said, because of the very significant market and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, our ranges for outlook are wider than those that we have historically provided. Let me also add that the entirety of our guidance reduction relates to the expected effects of the global pandemic.Factoring in our Q1 results, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and updating our revenue, EPS, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This update reflects our current views for the remainder of the year as well as the minor contribution from the Lumerical acquisition that we closed on April 1. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $375 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.01 to $1.33. This outlook assumes that we will experience the most significant business disruption in the second quarter.Based upon discussions with our customers and channel partners, we anticipate delays in the timing of closing certain transactions and, in particular, larger enterprise deals may be especially challenging. We have also assumed that some customers will delay certain purchases until later in the year. For the full year, we are updating both the revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.630 billion or constant currency growth of 2% to 7%, and EPS in the range of $5.61 to $6.23. We are also updating our full-year ACV outlook to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.575 billion.This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 3% to 9%. With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a modest recovery in the business environment in Q3 as employees return to work and businesses begin to resume operations. Our current assumptions anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a combination of sales transactions that may have been deferred from earlier quarters, and the sales outlook for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4. With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are updating our outlook for 2020 to a range of $425 million to $470 million.This is reflective of our updated full-year ACV, revenue and profitability estimates. We have also factored into our outlook an incremental $10 million to $20 million of customer payments that would have otherwise been made in 2020 that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term requests on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. For modeling purposes, we're expecting second-quarter operating margins of 33.5% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%.These charges are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year. They include a slower pace of hiring and reduced discretionary spending, as well as decreased spending on certain noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects. On the other hand, we will continue to invest in certain digital transformation projects such as our global CRM and HRIS initiatives, as these projects are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term. Further details around specific currency rates and other quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.In our effort to provide greater insight and transparency to investors, we have added additional commentary to our prepared remarks and Form 10-Q, specifically related to the impacts of COVID-19. As a caveat, I will remind everyone that this information is based upon everything that we know as of today. And given the uncertain and unprecedented environment that we are operating under, our assumptions are subject to change. Our current expectations, as reflected in our updated financial outlook, is that there will be a delay in business with an adverse impact on our Q2 and full-year results.Beyond the points that Ajei mentioned earlier, regarding the various elements that have contributed to the resiliency of our business model over the long term, from a financial perspective, I'd also like to highlight our high level of recurring ACV, historically stable renewal rates for both leases and maintenance and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow. We are trying to be as transparent as we can and appreciate that you are all seeking information, details and perspectives on our future outlook. We have tried to take into account the uncertainty, particularly around the timing of larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that things will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how will this situation continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiment and purchasing decisions as it has since this global pandemic first began in Q1.We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, trying to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term success. In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with solid first-quarter financial and operational results. Being able to deliver on our Q1 financial commitments, despite the extreme volatility is a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of the broader ANSYS ecosystem that includes our employees, customers and partners. As we look ahead, we remain committed to invest in our business and to continue to execute against our long-term strategic priorities.Our focus and commitment to the long term, combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, long-standing customer relationships and resilient business model give us confidence that we will emerge from this crisis better positioned to capitalize on our long-term growth aspirations. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.[Operator instructions] And our first question today comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Ajei, for you, let me ask a longer term question about where you and the engineering software industry are going as though COVID did not exist? Meaning where you and your peers seem to be going or ought to go over the next half decade or more.So the question is, there seems to be an incipient arms race going on among engineering software companies in terms of their underlying architectures and data platforms as their future architectures. You have Minerva, PTC recently alluded to Atlas, AUTOBEST Forge. And so of course is 3Dx. So the question is, how are you thinking about the long-term impact or importance to you in terms of maintaining or gaining share from this new architecture that you have? And are there any implications in terms of your moving from a highly discrete deliverable schedule, as you just alluded to in your remarks, to more of a continuous flow of deliverables over time? And then secondly, the question has to do with COVID.And at the risk of extrapolation, are there any attributes of the business that you think might go on indefinitely or that you would have to think about doing more on an ongoing basis? For example, investing more in inside sales, potentially even an e-store or some kind or in some way, all three or doing things differently with your many partners like Microsoft, Rockwell, etc.? -- So Jay, that's a long question. Let me try to address that -- address the second part first, and then I'll get to the first part. With respect to what you do in a COVID world, as you may have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a very large event Simulation World that we're running online. And that is I think one of the largest, if not the largest simulation event online.And we have a number of speakers signed up for that. We have I think over 10,000 people who have registered and the month is about -- and the event is about a month away. So there's a lot of interest in the technology and the capabilities. And obviously, we're driving demand from online events to -- excuse me, from in-person events to online events.With respect to our partnership relationships, we continue to drive our relationships with our partners and with our customers and the importance of what we do together remains unchanged. With respect to the first part of your question, the long-term view of our industry, I think it's important to note that the part of the industry where ANSYS lives which is simulation, we believe, is the most important aspect that customers are dealing with. They need simulation in order to be able to validate the design of the products to be able to design the products. Some of the other companies that you mentioned are in other parts of the end-to-end ecosystem.We're in the simulation space. And we believe that this is an extremely valuable part of the end-to-end ecosystem is something that customers do need. Now to your point about platforms, look, I think that there is some in the industry who believe that you need to have a single monolithic platform which is a single source of truth and ideal single vendor monolithic environment. We don't believe that's the case.Our strategy is completely open. We believe instead in an authoritative source of truth which is an ecosystem of open, federated and purpose-built domain-specific solutions, and we participate in that. And I think that's a much more realistic way of addressing the digital transformation needs of scale. It's not about picking one platform and locking a vendor or locking a customer into a particular platform, it's vendors like ourselves playing in an open environment, recognizing that we need to be in a position to support our customers as they understand how to create these complex products of the future. -- And Jay, just one thing that I'll add to that is, as you spoke about, as we think about our own business and how our models will transition or our ways of interacting with customers, that is the primary reason that for the past several years, we have been aggressively investing in our own digital transformation so that we can enable automation and build a platform that will allow us to efficiently scale our business from $2 billion to $5 billion and beyond. So that is the primary driver of why we've been pushing so much of our own digital transformation. -- Thank you.And our next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question guys. So I just wanted to I guess touch on a couple of comments you guys made. So in the prepared remarks, you guys highlighted not seeing any material impact on your business from COVID-19.And then also, Maria, when you talked about guidance that it was based entirely on just how it relates to expected effects of the pandemic. So it seems to suggest that you guys currently aren't exactly seeing any erosion to your business. I guess I want to maybe dig into that a little bit, make sure I'm understanding that correctly in terms of how you're forecasting. And then to the extent that there is any concern -- well, in terms of the lower guidance, I just wanted to understand kind of what's coming from maybe just push out those deals and maybe what is coming from contraction of potential contracts that you guys are looking to renew or sign? Thank you. -- So Ken, just to clarify, I think you needed to take a look at prepared remarks again. What we said is we didn't see a material impact only in Q1. So if you look at our Q1 results, they came -- all of the key metrics came in at basically the midpoint or a little bit better than what we had forecasted when we gave guidance at the end of February. Now that being said, when we gave that guidance, we were basically assuming that COVID-19 was somewhat limited to China and perhaps South Korea.But just like everyone in the world, as March progressed, things got progressively worse as this really became a global pandemic. So as a result of that, a lot of stuff has changed in the past six weeks. And so that is why we've modified our full-year outlook which now does factor in what we believe is an elongated impact from COVID-19 the most dramatic being Q2. -- OK. Got it. And then in terms of kind of where that impact is coming from, any sense of if that -- again, is this more of a customer pushing out stuff or is the reduction in ACV more due to customers I guess kind of bringing in deal sizes, not attaching as many new products? Just trying to understand kind of where the softness is coming from in terms of the outlook. -- So I'd say it's a combination of, yes, deals being pushed out as our customers are dealing with their own responses, but I'd say probably the majority of where we're seeing it, particularly in Q2 is at the SMB level. And so in two aspects. -- Small and medium business. -- Small and medium business. Two aspects. One, some of those customers that traditionally were paid up customers are shifting toward taking a look at annual leases just because their access to capital is a little bit more constrained in this environment. And then just in certain cases, they're just delaying.So as we've modeled, as we've worked with our field teams, we believe the largest impact we're going to feel across the business is Q2. And if you recall, when we built our outlook for 2020, even before COVID, we were assuming a very back-end loaded year just because the timing of when those multiyear leases were scheduled to renew, largely in Q4 around customers' year-end purchasing cycles. -- Great. Thank you for the clarity.And our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Good to hear from everyone. Maria, can you maybe go into more details about this because you mentioned multiple scenarios in your guidance.Can you just frame the low end and the high end? -- So yeah, if you look at for the full year, basically, we've reduced to revenue. Now we're at the low end 2% and at the high end 7% in constant currency, we ran a variety of scenarios. And if we also used what happened to our business in 2009 as another illustration of a global economic shock. And based on everything, all the scenarios that we came to, we believe that the current guidance that we provided is a good proxy for where we will end the year.And I will caveat that by saying that's based on everything that we know today. Should things transition either way, improve quicker than we've estimated or unfortunately detract, we will continue to -- as the rest of our software peers assess our business every single day and every single week, work our way through it. And then as we exit Q2, we will give you a fresh update on all of the data that we've collected during the second quarter. -- OK. And if I could ask one quick follow-up. The perpetual license decline of 20% in the quarter. Maybe can you talk about linearity of that, maybe how January and February were compared to the latter end of the quarter? -- So yeah -- so what I'd say is the -- if you look at the linearity of any quarter, the third month is always the largest volume for leases and paid up. So relative to the decline is paid up, it shouldn't come as any surprise because if you think about a large impact on the business in Q1 was the COVID situation in China, and China today still is largely a paid up market. So when we see pressure on the business in China, you'll also see it reflected in the results in the paid up line. -- Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.And our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead. -- OK. Great. Hey thanks for taking my questions here guys. And also thanks by the way for the detailed guidance during this uncertain time, certainly not everybody is doing that, so I wanted to acknowledge.Maybe first for you, Maria. And I think you touched on this in a prior question, but just to ask it expressly. Clearly, we've seen more of a shift to lease contracts in this environment versus perpetual for a range of reasons. But I'm wondering what you've seen on contract terms and how are you thinking about that in the guide this year? So specifically, are your lease customers still largely opting for multiyear contracts or have some maybe opted to shorten that given the current environment? -- So Saket, what I'd say is, if you think about our customer base, you should really kind of bifurcate it. At the enterprise level, we are still seeing our large customers thinking long-term because R&D is really a long-term investment. And so an example that Ajei spoke to in his remarks is DENSO, a very long-standing customer that just entered into a three-year multiyear lease. Where we're really seeing the biggest dynamic right now and what we built into our outlook for 2020 is that at the small-medium business level, that those customers are probably -- and we're seeing some of this going to choose an annual lease versus a paid up just given the current economic environment and their access to capital.But I will also just comment that today, the majority of our leases are still annual leases. That transition to multiyear leases has really been the journey at the enterprise and strategic level because that customer tends to think longer term than perhaps smaller businesses do. -- Got it. That's very helpful. Ajei, maybe a quick follow-up for you. Understand that you've already given the guide for Q2 and the full year.But a question that's being asked of a lot of companies here is just obviously, the end of March was a very dramatic time, let's say. Some companies have seen a little bit of a bounce back in the month of April. Can you talk qualitatively of course to sort of how activity levels have been here in the month of April at all? -- I think it's important to recognize that when you think about the actual linearity within the quarter of our business, most of it is back-end loaded. So the earlier part of the quarter, there's a lot of customer activity in terms of meetings and things of that nature. But in terms of actual closed contracts, that starts to come in toward the third month of the quarter. And what we're seeing in April of course is as customers were transitioning to a work-from-home model, there was obviously some disruption I would say March, as people were thinking through the transition process and trying to make sure that they could get there.But today, we are seeing a number of our customers working from home. Our teams are effectively working from home. We can engage. A lot of the challenges are around being able to do things like demos and so on in our ACE organization which is our technical customer-facing organization is able to deliver those demos and those capabilities.So we feel very confident in our ability to continue to support our customers as they work from home and the activity levels that we're seeing are consistent with that. -- Very helpful. Thanks guys.And our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi from Berenberg. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess on the first, I wanted to look at a long-term picture. When it comes to the physical prototyping and how that's potentially transitioning under the current conditions, have you already seen engagement from some of these customers or any type of discussions with them that might indicate to you that this sort of transition might accelerate? -- Well, I think there are two -- there are a couple of things that I think are worth sharing. Number one is that some customers are not able to access physical labs or were not able to access physical labs. And as a result of that, physical experimentation is suffering. And obviously, simulation does not require you to access a physical lab.You can do all your work on the computer and in a work-from-home scenario. So that has clearly swings away from physical testing toward more simulation activity, and that's obviously a tailwind for us, and that's helpful. The other thing is -- and I think this has been very well established, part of the value proposition, what part of the value proposition of simulation is really being able to address cost, and in particular, you can reduce the number of physical prototypes, and you can test in parallel instead of serializing a sequence of events, you can test a number of things in parallel on the computer. And the fact that you can reduce cost is an important driver.And again, in these tough economic times, people are looking to reduce costs. And that again is a good guide to tailwind for simulation. So I'm pretty excited about those dynamics. Another point I'd actually like to make which is kind of interesting is we've been able to deliver that unique pass situation as the pandemic as we've been able to deliver a number of simulation-based insights to out there.People have been using our technology to come up with ideas or assessments of things like social distancing, the creation of PPE, the creation of medical -- rapid creation of medical devices and a lot of that is being done because of the speed and the rating case at which of this work is being done, it was unexpected. A lot of that work is being done through simulation as well. And that also demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation if you start to think about the agility that we can bring to bear. -- Thanks for that. And if I may, on a follow-up. I mean, can you maybe help us think through your M&A strategy at this stage? I mean, I know you're not changing your long-term plan at all, but has the current crisis sort of changed your thinking around that in terms of deal making? -- Well, I think it's really very premature to talk about M&A, exactly what the long-term implication on M&A is going to be. Obviously, we continue to have a pipeline of customers of potential companies that we're continuing to evaluate. And we -- and B, we're evaluating those customers, I mean, if those companies, if you look at what we did with the acquisition of Lumerical, we just closed Lumerical a couple of -- a few weeks ago. During the lockdown period, we were able to onboard all their employees remotely.But we continue to engage with potential acquisition targets. We'll see what happens as the situation plays out. -- Very helpful. Thank you.And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks. -- Thank you very much. So I'd like to close by saying that while there is uncertainty in the market, I know that ANSYS has the right team, the best products in the market and strong customer commitments. With our investments in infrastructure and collaboration technologies, the special accommodations for our customers and with our continued fiscal discipline, I believe that ANSYS is well positioned to help our customers during this critical time and well into the future.

Recently, I had the good fortune to jump on the  podcast with Brightline Interactive's Tyler Gates and Sophia Moshasha to talk about investing in immersive technology, the upcoming implications of 5G, and a whole lot more.Tyler is the managing principal of Brightline Interactive and president of the Washington, DC, chapter of the VR/AR Association. Sophia is the director of immersive platforms of Brightline and also the vice president of the Washington, DC, chapter of the VR/AR Association. And what unfolded was a really fun and enlightening conversation. I learned a lot and I think you will too. So I hope you enjoy this week's - podcast mashup. We are joined here today by our good friend Jason Moser, who's a senior analyst at The Motley Fool. Welcome, Jason. Happy to have you on this call with us today. Very happy to be here, as I've been hearing the music and I'm waiting to hear the podcast, then I realized, I'm actually the guest on the podcast. It's really cool. That's right. Finally, you are a guest on our podcast. I know I've been over to your offices over in Alexandria, right down the street from our office. And you have a really cool studio, and we are looking forward to getting on your level of your five podcasts that you guys have out by professional production over there.And before we go into your background and to how you got into your current position, can you just explain a little bit about who The Motley Fool is? Because it does sound like a Shakespearean character. [laughs] Well, it is. You know, we oddly enough, I mean, the name did come from the Shakespeare play . We are a company, we've been in existence for about 26 years now, I think. We're founded by David and Tom Gardner, and that ultimately was the idea behind the name. The Motley Fool is, you know, Wall Street is full of esoteric language and tough-to-understand concepts, and our goal is really to bring financial literacy, financial education, and financial independence to the masses. And so, we're kind of like the jester: We can come speak truth to power without fear of having our head lopped off, so to speak. And so, that's where the name The Motley Fool really came from, is just being able to actually speak truth to power.And we've really enjoyed the ride; we've been at it for a while now. So appropriate for the industry that you're in. Love it. So going back, then, start at the beginning -- not the beginning, beginning of your career, but beginning of relevance of what you're doing now. How did you get to The Motley Fool and how did you get to be the lucky one to be able to be the advisor on and now immersive technology? Yeah. I mean, I've had a pretty long and convoluted, sort of, work history. So I've worked in a number of different industries. I was a golf professional for a while, I was at a bank for a while, I was at an insurance company for a while, I actually even worked for the State Department for a while as well. And that all led me ultimately to The Motley Fool about 10 years ago. I was a member of The Motley Fool's investment services and, really, I just found my tribe, so to speak. I knew when I signed up that this was just a community of like-minded folks who just enjoyed investing and learning.And at some point, I made some connections and got lucky enough to get my foot in the door for an interview with the company and was able to join the company. And I just celebrated my 10th year there in February. And so, my time there has been spent really as an investment analyst the entire 10 years, learning how to be a good analyst, learning how to be a good analyst in all sorts of different markets, whether it's healthcare or tech or retail or what have you.And all along the way, we've had our podcast family that's grown and developed, and I've been very lucky to be a part of that from the start. As you mentioned, we have five different shows now that we do, and I'm a part of actually three of them, which is really fun.And then a year ago, almost a year ago, we opened up the  investment service, a service geared toward investing in the opportunities that augmented reality presents. And my interest in the space, I think, was part of what got me in there as being the advisor for the service and just my general interest in learning more about it. And so I've really enjoyed the last year and a-half diving into the space, learning as much about it, and then being able to bring that to our members in the form of investable ideas, because ultimately, we're trying to help them make money at the end of the day and achieve their financial independence by building a portfolio of great publicly held companies. And we're just finding more and more that there are a lot of businesses out there that are making a lot of investments in augmented reality and immersive technology, and so that's gotten me where I am today. Yeah. And, Jason, you know, I think I want to pause here for a second and say that what's so valuable about what you're saying is that it's quite a stamp of validation for the augmented reality market to have you all, specifically you all, be focused in on the advancements, the growth, and then being able to communicate that out to investors. It really, sort of, allows augmented reality to stake its claim inside this market as a validated technological vertical.And so, what I'm kind of curious to know before we get into, from your professional opinion is, what was it from the personal side, what was that, sort of, personal interest in augmented reality, and what do you see in it that makes you so confident for its future? Yeah. I think growing up, I mean, I always, like I grew up in that video game era where you had the Atari, the , and you could see how technology and entertainment was playing a bigger role in our lives. And then, you know, when the smartphone came around, I mean, I think the smartphone is really that lightning-in-a-bottle product or concept that has opened up. I mean, it's essentially a window, it's a portal to the entire world and the potential that technology can do for us as a world, as a global society.And so, for me, I've always been very interested in tech and stuff like that. I wouldn't call myself necessarily an early adopter, but I'm kind of an early adopter, maybe the second-level early adopter. When new technology comes out, I love to fiddle with it and see what the prospects are there. And so, when I take that mindset and my interest in those sorts of things and then you look at the actual numbers behind it.For us, we felt like, at The Motley Fool, that augmented reality and immersive technology was coming to its moment. I mean, we are in a moment now where technology has gotten so good and so fast and so cool, that we're seeing all sorts of different changes in the ways that we do things, whether it's in healthcare or retail or engineering or entertainment. I mean, we could see just from the numbers, when we were looking at the augmented reality market in specific, that in 2017 it was valued at around $4.2 billion. But when we look forward and we see these estimates, and there's a research company called MarketsandMarkets that's done some research there and shows that this opportunity in augmented reality is expected to top $60 billion by 2023. And so, for us, as investors, one of the things that we're always looking for is large and growing market opportunities, because that represents opportunities for investors. And we see augmented reality as one piece of that, but then you take a step back and you look at immersive technology, in general, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, all of that combined, it's presenting a phenomenal market opportunity in all sorts of different verticals. Again, whether it's entertainment or engineering or healthcare, what have you. And so, for me, as an investor, that's really exciting. And then you couple that with something that I'm interested in, in technology, in the development of this immersive technology market. It was just really a win-win from that perspective, which was why I was so excited to have the opportunity to do it. You know, we're happy to have you join us in this market, in this exciting industry, Jason. Thanks. Yeah. And so, to ask specifically, what are you seeing, what are the trends that you're seeing? I mean, we certainly see trends from our perspective, but we tend to see that from the perspective of the actual technology and the actual capability. And so, you have a particularly intriguing perspective, especially for those of us who are working inside this industry, because your perspective really helps us see, sort of, what the end customer, what the investor is interested in and what kind of markets are, sort of, developing outside of the direct ecosystem of that particular technology. And that's kind of what we're seeing a lot happening right now is, these technologies that used to be, sort of, used in this one form or fashion is now applicable across the board.For example, our partners we've had in the podcast a bunch, Unity Technologies. Unity Technologies started out as a game engine for video games, but is now, and Unity calls it a creation engine, and that creation engine is now focused on, because it is a way for us to develop content, that content development is now not so singularly focused on video games. It's now, sort of, spreading out and becoming content that's being developed for large-scale training simulations, large-scale enterprise solutions, and then beyond video gaming, into the entertainment market, into the on-demand market. And so, what is it that you see from the investor's perspective that is so attractive about the capabilities of augmented reality? Well, yeah, I think you really hit in on the two different sides of the coin there, right? I mean, I think we see on the one side, immersive technology for the consumer, and on the other side, immersive technology in industry. And I think that up to this point, it feels like augmented reality and virtual reality, they've been cool concepts, they've been neat in theory, but it's been difficult to really bring it over to the consumer side. It's hard for the everyday consumer to be able to understand how or why this immersive technology affects them, how it plays into their lives.And so, you know, we look at what I call the big four in this space, and I'm talking about companies including , , , and . These are the big four tech companies out there that are making big investments in immersive technology on both the consumer side and the industrial side, as you know. Which has always been really interesting to see for us. I mean, they hold terrific competitive advantages just in their scale and their financial resources. They can pretty much do whatever they want. And these are companies that can bring a lot of this technology in-house and develop it on their own.And I think, you know, that when we saw the game  come out, you remember the success that that game witnessed as it rolled out, and it took the world by storm. And, you know, we were talking about this before, Tyler, I mean, really, that's not the most comprehensive application of augmented reality, it's a pretty simple concept. But all of a sudden, what that did, it put that augmented reality technology into the consumer's hand in such a way that they were utilizing it, they were using it day after day after day, and they were having a lot of fun with it. And so, all of a sudden there, you start to see at least one application where consumers are getting a better understanding of how this technology could play a role in their lives.But then, if you take it further into something like the retail space, for example. I'll use  as an example, you know, the online home furnishings company. And I think Wayfair is a company that when it first went public, a lot of people didn't really give it much of a shot. And the main reason why was that it was hard to grasp that you would be able to buy a couch online without actually being able to see that couch in person or being able to see how that couch might fit in your room. Most people, they kind of want to go to the store, sit on the couch, get an idea of what it looks like. And so, I think, people thought maybe Wayfair was going to have a problem with that.Well, Wayfair, what they've done is they've incorporated augmented reality into their app so that you can actually go and shop in Wayfair and you can take your phone and you can hold it, you know, showing a picture of your room, you can hold in your room and angle it where you think that couch might go, and then you can actually, using their augmented reality, you can place that couch in your room so that it's actually occupying that space. The length, the width, the depth, whatever it may be, you can actually get an idea then of how that couch might fit in your room, and that was another consumer application where we said, OK, that's another step beyond something like a , for example. You can see more and more how consumers might be able to benefit from this technology.But what really opened my eyes in learning about this space, that I didn't expect, and it took me a little bit by surprise, was the industrial applications. The affects, the impact that it's having on industry and manufacturing and development and training applications and whatnot. I mean, you're seeing companies with workers on assembly lines utilizing smart glasses and headsets to do their jobs on a daily basis, utilizing immersive technology to do their jobs and to do them better, to do them more quickly and more efficiently. Or new hires, you know, we talked before about going in there and utilizing training platforms that bring immersive technology into the mix.And so, for me, the consumer applications, I think, are still maybe just getting started. I think people are really starting to understand more and more the potential there, but what really opened my eyes was what we're already seeing in the industrial side with companies like  or , companies that are utilizing this technology on a daily basis.And it's really making a difference. I mean, you can see it when we study these companies. I mean, you can actually hear from management themselves talking about the impact that this technology is making on their business to do things better, to do them more quickly, to do them more efficiently. And that really is the name of the game when we're looking for good investment is companies that are leveraging technology to really save money and grow the business. And that's naturally the result of immersive technology, which has been interesting for us to watch over the last six or seven years. And I just want to go back, Jason, to what you're talking about when you talk about how people adopt the technology, how people understand it. I think what we're seeing happen is, there really is sort of these three phases to the adoption or, sort of, the awareness of the technology, the usage of that technology and then the innovation of it. So I have to be aware of what it is, and then I have to try it, and then after I try it, at that point, it's depending on my level of expertise and awareness in the industry, it's going to take me some time to give new language to this new experience, this new way that I'm experiencing content.And so, what tends to happen as we often say, people understand a new thing through the lens of an old thing. And so when you take something like , which is an incredibly entertaining application, but you're right, it's significantly limited in terms -- and it never really started out, never aimed to be the, sort of, answer for all augmented reality, but it sort of became that because -- Serendipitous, wasn't it? I mean, I don't know that that was the intention, but bam! There it was, and it opened it up to millions and millions of people. I mean, for the next couple of years, people say, \"Augmented reality, you know, like .\" And people know, \"Oh, I get it.\" And even that reference is a reference to understanding a new thing through the lens of an old thing. And so, as somebody is explaining the new capability of augmented reality, people then draw from their reference of the next closest thing that they do understand and then they pull from that and then limit the capability of that new thing, because the old thing has obvious limitations, thus there is a new thing.And so, you know, it's interesting for us, when we talk about adoption and how users are using augmented reality, the part of it that I think is meaningful is that the time that it takes for somebody to be aware to use it and then to innovate it is significantly expedited with immersive technology. And not just immersive tech, but the process of creating the technology, the process of standing up an application that has global-scale capability to do location-based entertainment with AR, you can stand that up in less time than [laughs] it takes to open a physical store. And so, it is, from a capability standpoint, to come up with an idea off of having tried it first.Like, one of my favorite parts about interviewing people on this podcast is that we talk to people all the time who say, \"Two years ago, I didn't even know this industry existed.\" And then \"I took my significant industrial design capabilities or my significant engineering capabilities or my experience with NASA or whatever the cases and I pointed it at this new enabling capability of immersive technology and realized that I really just used it to accelerate what I already was able to do.\" And so, what we can do is build new things really quickly, new capabilities, new awarenesses. And what that does is it removes us, forcibly, it removes us, from understanding that we experience this technology in one way, and it moves us into this world where maybe we don't -- because I think what's interesting even about Wayfair is, before the augmented reality, before depth-sensing AR technology existed, and you could place objects in depth in your room, even before, I mean, people would actually take their whole computer, pick it up from their tabletop and, sort of, place it on the wall and try to hold it, because in that moment, we understand, even though we don't -- everyone doesn't understand technologically why that doesn't happen or can't -- we understand in our minds, it's on computer, it's on two dimension, it can exist in my three dimension.And so, we just know, OK, a website like Wayfair is not going to work, because nobody is going to be able to understand spatially how objects fit in their room, but the reason that they don't understand that yet is because they don't understand the actual capabilities of the technology, that we can, that the phone actually can understand depth in the room and that we can identify tabletop surfaces, and then on those surfaces we can place graphical three-dimensional content pieces that are relevant to what that user wants to see. And that technological capability allows us to take that thing that the user wants to do, instead of holding up the computer screen, and then allows them to place that object there.And then when we do it, like, when somebody sees that happening, it's not like it's this brand-new thing that they couldn't conceive of, they see it happening and go, \"Oh, yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's exactly how that couch would look. Perfect! That's awesome!\" And it's so utilitarian and it's so known and understood, because it's using the technology in a way that actually communicates the original context in the original context. And so I'm seeing the furniture in spatial value inside my room. As long as I'm getting to see what it's going to look like in a box, check for me, I'll purchase it online. Great! And so it totally changes the market.So we see the adoption rate shifting and, sort of, becoming more exponential as people have an awareness, the ability to use it and then the ability to innovate with it. And I think also, the neat thing about technology like this is, technology ultimately it compounds, right? I mean, the more and more we use it, the better and better it gets more and more quickly. And so, I mean, maybe this capability didn't exist, necessarily, eight years ago or whenever. I mean, we've gone through iPhone all the way up here to iPhone 11, right? I mean, they didn't always have those 3D sensing capabilities maybe that we have now, but you do see now -- I mean, if a company like Wayfair, I mean,  is another, I mean, a lot of retailers that are out there, are now using this technology, and the main reason why is because they're seeing results, they actually see that customers utilize this technology, and it results in conversion of sales. And ultimately in retail, that's the goal, you want to sell stuff. And so if they can see that the tools they're producing with their technology are resulting in actual sales conversions, well, they're going to double-down on investments in that technology, they're going to make it better and better and better.And then, you pan all the way over to another market, something like healthcare, and that's a market to me, that has just been fascinating to watch. I mean, my father is a physician. He's a 77-year-old doctor, still practicing. And when I was talking to him about this new service, about immersive technology, and he's asking me, what are you talking about, how does this apply? And I'm showing him something as simple as just, like, learning anatomy. I mean, there are apps out there now where you can actually -- there are AR apps out there that can teach you anatomy just through using an app on your phone. But then you go all the way over to other companies. There are little companies out there, like Medivis, they're utilizing immersive technology actually in the operating room to prep for surgery in order to achieve better outcomes. , another company that has actually developed a training platform that utilizes augmented reality immersive technology in order to help people train and prepare and, ultimately, looking to just achieve better outcomes.I mean, if you're a physician, if you're a surgeon and you can actually go into a surgery fully prepped and knowing where you need to be focused on and what you're getting ready to encounter and what you need to do before you've ever even had really to go in there to do it. I mean, you're likely going to achieve better outcomes.And so we see companies like these doubling down on the investments in this technology, because the bottom line is, whether it's in gaming or whether it's in retail or whether it's in healthcare, it's ultimately achieving better outcomes, and that really is the goal.And I think that now we're getting to the point where we're seeing immersive technology, it's more than just entertainment, it's more than just a cool little bell or whistle that's on our phone that we can fiddle around with while we're trying to waste some time. I mean, these are having real-life implications that are affecting people's lives. And that to me, it's a fascinating thing to watch and as investors, it's a fascinating market to be a part of, because again, like I said, that technology, it compounds and it's all about, kind of, trying to skate to where the puck is going. You know, we talk about the market being a forward-looking mechanism, we're trying to skate to where the puck is going. And we see the puck going in the direction of that immersive technology, which is why we're so focused on it now. Yeah. And I like just the awareness of how immersive technology is -- I agree with you, in its capability to grow exponentially, but it's like it's growing in different soil then the rest of technology, because it in itself -- and I don't mean the rest of, maybe the rest of communications technology. Because immersive technology, specifically, we have the ability to use the technology to make the technology smarter. And our ability to use virtual reality to actually make virtual reality faster is a pretty impressive thing. And that's true of it as a communications technology.And so, to me, what's fascinating is that what ends up happening is you have these capabilities, it's sort of the distributed economy where the distributed knowledge occurs, distributed information where you have the cell phone's capability to understand images, for example, and to be able to recognize. As long as there's a database running on the phone that understands what images it's seeing, then it can use image recognition to identify objects. And then if the phone is also able to deploy augmented reality content based on that image recognition and be aware of that object in space, then all of those examples that you're talking about in the surgical room, in the medical space, you can have on-demand learning where physicians can be inside a hospital setting and just by holding their phone over an object, we can deploy augmented reality content that's training them on the nuances of how to use that tool, let's just say inside the nuance situation of COVID-19.So as procedures change, as tools change, as the ways that we understand the operational environment changes, as that changes in real-time, we can also adjust and shift the content in real time, and then that content is completely on demand to the user.And so, you see how just even in that -- I mean, that's just an off-the-cuff example just based on what you're saying. And so, in that example we're talking about using augmented reality, but we're also talking about using a variety of other immersive technology, sort of, frameworks to be able to provide an overall awareness scenario where the medical facilities now can create, sort of, distributed learning on demand, but it can be based on the actual tools and implements inside the facility, instead of it being off of an education system that requires logistics and planning and scheduling and travel and all of that type of stuff. With inside immersive technology, we can remove those barriers and make it faster, smarter and more comprehensive.And so, what I like about what's happening in that, sort of, exponential nature of -- the reason why I say, it feels like it's growing in a different soil is because it's not just a technology like the phone, it is a technology that enables a variety of other technologies to be created and built and leveraged and a variety of other communication platforms to be built on top of the ability to distribute information through augmented reality. And so it is itself a technology, but it is also an enabling technology that generates other technologies. And that's where we see it, sort of, growing exponentially. Yeah. And I'm glad you said that, because it does feel like, I mean, it seems like every year till we hear, OK, we're talking 2G, now we're talking 3G, now we're talking 4G, and now, of course, we're talking 5G. And that's been one of the buzzwords in the investment world for a while now, the 5G technology. You know, Apple incorporating this into their phones, and 5G is going to make everything faster, we're going to be able to stream our videos faster, we're going to be able to get access to things more quickly.I mean, it does seem like the value proposition that's communicated to just us, as everyday consumers, is that 5G, it's going to make things faster. But you and I, I mean, we all know that it's not just about speed, what 5G ultimately is doing beyond, you know, close to zero latency, it's really expanding the amount of data, the amount of information that could be transferred in these quick time frames.And so, if you don't mind, actually, [laughs] I'd like to ask you a question, because I mean, you have a lot of experience in this space, you all do. And I hear both arguments, I hear both sides of the coin. Some who feel like 5G maybe isn't as big of a deal as some might think it could be. And I hear others say that 5G really is going to be revolutionary from a number of stances. I personally I think that 5G, given the opportunity to be able to transfer more data, more rich content, more robust data, I think it could have a profound impact, but I'd be curious to know yours all take on 5G and what do you think the impact of 5G ultimately will be before we start focusing on 6G and ultimately. I mean, I'm already hearing talk about 10G, but let's focus on 5G for now. How do you feel about 5G? I mean, this is going to be as revolutionary as something? Yes, I certainly think so. And I think that way because of, I will start out by saying that, a lot of our listeners know, but outside of hosting the VR/AR Association podcast, I have a company called Brightline Interactive, and we do a considerable amount of work specifically with 5G, we build technology that leverages 5G, so that we can help the general population and other audiences understand the value propositions for 5G. And so we are boots on the ground and have definitely been rolling up our sleeves over the last year-and-a-half and building out some impressive technology experiences. We get to work with , and we do a lot of really fun exciting activations with them and build out a lot of products that use 5G. And so we work a lot with the technology, and so I want to start out by saying that.But at the same time, sort of, beyond just the capability of the technology, it is in terms of what does it do for the consumer, what it's doing for the larger, sort of, I would say global economy is, to me, what is more valuable to talk about. So I mean, to the consumer, I can totally understand it, because a lot of telecom companies have spent years communicating the message of data plans being faster. And so, it's natural that people understand that, OK, well, it's another G, so it's 5G, OK, so it must be even faster.And so, that makes total sense, but the truth is that 5G creates both speed and capacity and it's the \"and capacity\" part that is missing from a lot of people's understanding of what 5G will do for the economy, [laughs] for the global economy. And that is, the way that I usually describe it is -- it's when we have the convergence of 5G, cloud computing and immersive technology, you have the ingredients, those three ingredients, you have ingredients to completely transform the way communication is currently, sort of, mainstream. Because what we open up is the ability to what 5G does as an enabling technology is, it allows us to create applications that are pulling in data from the real world and then allowing us to use that real-world data in real time inside virtual worlds. And so, this is just one example of the enablement capabilities of 5G.But because 5G has the ability for us to build sensor systems that are ingesting -- like, for example, we do a lot of work with a fun partner of ours, Teslasuit, and it's a full-body haptic suit that does motion capture, biometry, and electrical muscle stimulation, and we can track your movement in space. We tested the suit with 5G, and so the suit is able to understand its position in space, but it's also able to understand the body mechanics, the motion of the body in real time. And so we understand the volume capacity of how somebody is moving and translating that information wirelessly in real time into a virtual environment. And the capability of being able to do that allows us to have live real-time digital-twin scenarios. And if you think about having that for an entire global corporation or an entire logistics supply chain, those types of things, we can significantly increase efficiency inside enterprise systems, as well as entertainment systems and, sort of, communication systems at large. But the reason that we're able to do that is we have a foundational technology, a data transfer technology that allows us to transfer information so fast and at such high volumes that it allows us to create immersive content and lay that content on top of the real world.So how you see that, how you visualize, we often call it virtual layering. And it's just the idea that we have, in the real world, we have virtual layers of the real world, but you can only access and see those virtual layers through some sort of device, because you're looking through a device, the device like your phone, your tablet is allowing you to see that content in augmented reality. The only thing that stops us from having content that blankets the whole earth in augmented reality is bandwidth and data transfer speed capability. And so what this enables us to do is to help people understand that we can present data visually in its original visual context, and that content is typically called augmented or virtual reality, because we're talking about creating graphic content that's at human-size scale, that makes you feel like you're in it. And that capability of doing that allows you to understand that information in the same way that you understand it in the real world.And so, the ability to create that level of awareness, imagine having a Google where you could google for the awareness of any environment. Like, whereas right now, like, now we think about it as this, like, totally normal thing to -- if you need to know something, I mean, I have a google pulled up on my second screen here. If I need to know something, I can just google it and I can get the awareness of it in a two-dimensional context. I can be aware of that information two-dimensionally as it's listed on the page. And that information helps me understand new things, new things I didn't understand before. See, with immersive technology and 5G, we can do that same capacity where we can have a catalog of all of the information, but instead of that information existing two-dimensionally in written form on pages, I can just actually represent that information in its original visual, spatial context. And so, from your phone, let's say, you could look up the awareness of a spatial context that you would like to know really quickly before you walk into a meeting or before you make a big decision at a global scale. So that you can understand something at university or so that you can train better or whatever the case is, it's the same level of, like, same sort of ambulatory way that we approach Google, it's so easy to do this, to get this awareness. We can create that awareness with immersive technology.But the thing that stops us or slows down the progress is the ability to display the information and transfer the information. And that's what 5G enables us to do. So it's not just another G, it's not just a way to make your phone faster, see your YouTube video faster, you know, whatever the case is, it's a way for us to bring the contents of that YouTube video into your living room like it was a normal, regular, everyday occurrence, on demand. And I think that can be one of the most profound impacts, because I think we, as people, generally speaking, we process so much visually. I mean, when we see, I mean, that's what this does, it's enabling us to see or to visualize data. And we're seeing companies like , you even see big banks,  even, they're figuring out ways to incorporate augmented reality and immersive technology into just being able to visualize data. Take data that if you were to just to look at, it would seem to be all Greek, you would have to decipher it and try to parse it. But this technology allows you to visualize it and you can process that, you can understand that so much more quickly when it's presented in a visual form that makes more sense. Yeah. And just on that point specifically, I mean, that's exactly -- I mean, you're so spot on. And on that point specifically, we got the pleasure of working recently with American College of Preventative Medicine, ACPM, and we did something very similar, where they have a lot of data that represents really, really critical information in inner-city scenarios where they're talking about social determinants of health. And so, they want to take that critical information to the Hill, to Congress, and they want to advocate on behalf of, sort of, generating awareness around social determinants of health. And so, it's a relatively complex data story, because you're talking about data points across the entire United States.So how do you tell that story in a really short period of time and demonstrate the impact? Well, we took all of that data and we just created a virtual environment. So instead of that data, like you said, Jason, I mean, if you were to look at the raw data, you're talking about numbers and figures in two dimensions on a screen and how does that -- you would ask yourself by looking at that data, unless you understood how to read that data, in other words, unless you understood how to translate that data, you wouldn't actually know what it represents. But the irony of the whole scenario is that that data is actually not the original context, that data is a translation of the original context. The original context of that data has some sort of physical -- not necessarily physical, but has some sort of spatial capacity. It represents something in space.And so what augmented reality is doing is really just skipping the step of translating the data, translating the information using the written form. And so, if you can just have the information. So if you're talking about live collaboration on designing a vehicle, let's say, and traditionally, you create the three-dimensional design and then you pass that three dimensional design through the process, through the team, people give feedback, but how do they give feedback? In written form. So they, sort of, distill the physical version of that car, and they write about what they want to do in terms of design for that car, but what if you didn't have to do the writing part? What if you could skip that, but it's really, really difficult for us, for human beings to think that way, because it's so ingrained in us that we learn information and we communicate information in a two-dimensional context.And part of that barrier is the barrier that we see to the growth in the industry. And so, as people become more aware that you can actually entirely remove holistic processes that used to exist in the communication process, because augmented reality can communicate information in its original context, that's how we make communication faster. That's why immersive technology is faster as a medium to learn information, because it's skipping all of the translation steps and it's just giving you the original context. The easiest way to think about it is, we do this example all the time, but if you think about it, Jason, or if you're listening, think about going in your kitchen and grabbing a glass of water. Like, right now, everyone who's listening has created that image in your head, that spatial image of what it's like, what does your kitchen look like, which cabinet is that glass in, and are you pulling water from the fridge or from the tap? I mean, people have thought through that whole process in a matter of seconds. And you've created a spatial image inside your head of what that -- and almost, sort of, like a feeling. And what we're saying is, the power of augmented reality, enabled by 5G, because it can be distributed across the globe on demand, is that we can deliver that level of spatial awareness that you just created in five seconds in your head, but instead of using written form of communication, we can just communicate that spatial representation.It's hard for folks, at times, to place that capability in line with where we are in the industry, but that capability is upon us right now. Well, and it feels like, it's just going to consist of a lot of \"Aha!\" moments, right? I mean, there's going to be just a sequence of \"Aha!\" moments along the way where describing it, explaining it sometimes can be tricky. You come up with good real-life examples, like the glass-of-water example right there that you just offered up. And I think , as simple as that was, I think that was an \"Aha!\" moment, and I think we'll see more of those \"Aha!\" moments as time goes on, as we proceed forward, you know, I mean we go from 5G to 6G to 10G or whatever.I mean, technology is only going to become more profound and there will be more \"Aha!\" moments along the way. And it's just, you have to have that sort of kinesthetic \"Oh, wow! There it is, I get it now,\" you know, \"I feel that, I see it, I understand it better now that I've actually experienced it.\" And I think that we're starting to see some more of those little \"Aha!\" moments along the way. Sort of, they occur, whether it's in healthcare and retail or in gaming or entertainment. And I think that's the exciting part, is watching all of these little \"Aha!\" moments unfold and seeing how that technology, those concepts proliferate.And like you said, ultimately it is, I mean, the world is really smaller than it ever has been thanks to technology, and I think that's only going to continue as time goes on. Yeah, we agree. So Jason, I have to ask you, just pivoting a little bit, when you're talking about \"Aha!\" moments, have you seen any of those, or have you experienced any of those in the immersive technology industry as it pertains to the COVID-19 response? I just have to ask, because we're in the heat of it right now, and I know there's a lot going on from our perspective, and I know that you probably have come across a lot of it yourself. So I just want to know from your perspective. Yeah. I mean, this has really been a fascinating time. I mean, I don't think any of us have really lived through a pandemic of this sort of nature before, so it's a little bit of a new experience for all of us. And I think, I don't know if I've necessarily seen the \"Aha!\" moment, but I think we're on the cusp of it. When we see companies like Apple and Alphabet, and even the co-founder of , developing apps that are helping to actually locate where hot spots may be, where outbreaks may be, being able to be able to gather that data and present it in a visual form. Maybe that's just an app on your phone, where you're looking and you're actually seeing an app or a map of where particular outbreaks might be. I think you're seeing a lot of potential there.And it's something, obviously, that would not have been possible 20 years ago. You would have just been watching the evening news or reading the newspaper the day after the actual event happened, whereas now, you are seeing actual real-time data, heat maps showing you the higher-risk areas. And I think ultimately what that does is it allows states, it allows countries, it allows governments to make better decisions. I mean, you may not necessarily have to shut down an entire location, if you know that really the higher-risk areas are in one place and there are lower-risk areas over here.So I think, it's really, to me, that has been a little bit an \"Aha!\" moment, watching these companies build these tools to help us deal with this particular crisis.And I mean, you know, there is a little bit of a garbage-in, garbage-out risk there. I mean, it is dependent on the information that's input, but generally speaking, I think that's been pretty fascinating to watch. And I can only imagine, I would imagine that 5 to 10 years from now, assuming that something like this will happen again, I mean, unfortunately, that's just, Mother Nature, she controls all, I think. [laughs] So we'll see something like this happen again, but I think we'll also have even better tools to cope with it and respond to it than we do now, just like we have those better tools now than we had 10 or 15 years ago. Yeah, I mean, I got to say, definitely makes me proud to be in the industry now and be able to be on the leading edge of helping in the response of all the social distancing that we've had to encounter now and kind of had to figure out ways to overcome, like, some of the webinars and live podcasts and live events that we've attended and also hosted. So I'm excited to see where it goes. And such a short time, I think this is just the start of where we're going to be in the mid and long term. And I think it's definitely going to propel our industry forward very fast, faster than we thought we would. Absolutely. I think the investments that have been made into immersive technology, in general, I mean, that to me -- we're going to be bearing the fruit for many, many years to come. But I mean, this technology, it compounds, I mean, as it gets better, it only accelerates. And I think we passed, really, the tipping point of whether or not people believe it's actually something real and can matter in their lives. I mean, there was an example of a trial that was being done, a test that was being done at a university out of California, I believe it was, where augmented reality is being used to help the blind see.And I mean, that's something that for me, before I even really got started in this space, I would have never thought of that, because I think most people, when they think of immersive technology, they think visual, they think that it's something that they're seeing, but they're not thinking about things like auditory cues or haptic technology, all of these things that exist now that didn't exist before. I mean, these are little things that are augmenting our physical world through technology. And I think people are starting to become more educated about what augmented reality is, what virtual reality really is, what immersive technology really is, and they're seeing that there are a lot of little examples that have existed in our lives for a few years now, but they never really connected the dots. So I think those dots are becoming easier to connect now. Yeah. No, we agree, Jason. Listen, I think if there's one thing that could be said about it is that there's a significant amount of hope in immersive technology. Just even what we've been talking about here today, it's just that immersive technology combined with 5G allows us to invent worlds, invent scenarios, invent solutions that were not previously even understood. And by previously, in some cases, I mean six months ago.And we have a front-row seat. We're working on a regular basis inside these spaces and we are developing technologies that can service millions of people, and we're recognizing the need for those technologies in a five-week period over the last five weeks, and then pivoting really fast and coming up with ways to now build new variations of those technologies, but actually leveraging augmented and virtual reality to do that.We're at my company, we're meeting on a regular basis in virtual reality, even though we're all at home. We're a creative design technology company that's making a lot of stuff, but making it all from home. And the way that we found it to be fastest to meet and get full context together is to meet inside virtual reality. So we're actually using virtual reality in environments that we've built for ourselves to actually help expedite and create a more efficient process to make immersive technology for our clients.And those are, we're using virtual reality in ways that we're being forced to use it, that we didn't have to use it, even as we are creators, in the past. And so what we're seeing coming out of this is the forcing nature of innovation. And there is a lot of hope in immersive technology.And, look, Jason, we appreciate your expertise and your thought and all of your background information, in terms of also, sort of, validating augmented reality in terms of an immersive technology, and look, I can't wait to have you back. [laughs] [laughs] Well, listen, as soon as we get back to normal. I mean, I'm really excited, because you've already extended the invitation to come over there and check out your office, check out the Teslasuit and the HoloLens too and everything. And I can't wait to do that because, you know, at the recommendation of a friend of mine, I read the book a little while back. And just the pictures, the things that go on in my mind from reading that book. I never saw the movie, and I don't want to see it, because the book, I've got this romanticized version of immersive technology now just from that book alone. I mean, I'm really excited to get over there and see that stuff.Because, again, I mean, this is the marrying of the two worlds for me, I mean, the investing side that I know so well, and really, the technology side that you all know so well. And I'm excited to do more with you guys and learn more along the way. And, I mean, let's reciprocate here, because I think next time, you guys come over to our studio at Fool HQ and we'll do this again. Deal, deal. Looking forward to doing, yeah. This was fun, Jason, thank you. Absolutely. Thank you.As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.Thanks to producer extraordinaire Austin Morgan for constantly making magic happen for us.

If an investor was to purchase shares of ANSS stock at the current price level of $231.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $240.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.06% if the stock gets called away at the May 15th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ANSS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Ansys Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ANSS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $240.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $240.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

[Operator instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Annette Arribas. Please go ahead. -- Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks document have been posted on the homepage of our investor relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our fourth quarter and our full-year 2019 financial results and business update, as well as our initial Q1 and fiscal-year 2020 outlook and the key underlying assumptions. I would like to remind everyone that today's presentation contains forward-looking information.In addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information. During this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated.When investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?  -- Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS, capping a stellar year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Let me focus on annual contract value, or ACV, which we believe to be the best indicator of the underlying health of our business.Q4 ACV had well over $0.5 billion in the quarter for the first time in our history, represented growth of 13% in constant currency, which was particularly gratifying considering the strong baseline set in Q4 of 2018. For the full year of 2019, ACV grew a robust 12% in constant currency. As we look to 2020, we are guiding to over 12% growth in ACV in constant currency at the midpoint of our range. This gives us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022 while maintaining our industry-leading margins in the 42 to 44% range.Maria will provide more detail in just a few minutes. Now let me provide insight into some of the growth drivers in the fourth quarter and for all of 2019. During Q4, 10 long-standing customers made eight-figure commitments, and nearly all of the deals over $1 million included offerings from at least three of our product lines. From a geographic perspective, we saw strength in all our major territories last year.While North America led with 26% revenue growth for the year, I'm delighted that revenue in Europe grew 29% in Q4 and 14% in 2019, both in constant currency. For the full year, Asia Pac revenue grew 15% in constant currency despite a modest 2% revenue growth in Q4, which was attributable to variations in deal timings. In Japan, we grew revenue 20% in Q4. From an industry standpoint, high-tech continues to be our largest sector, fueled by electronics and our semiconductor solutions and supported by a multiphysics portfolio.And as you will hear shortly, we are continuing to add new capabilities to our product offerings so our customers can keep driving innovation in this key industry. Moving to automotive. Other vendors have signaled weakness in the sector, perhaps because of their focus on legacy programs or their inability to pivot to emerging customer requirements. For ANSYS, however, automotive is an area of strength, in part because we have successfully broadened our offerings to address key growth drivers, namely solutions for autonomous and electric vehicles.We have seen repeated evidence of that success in electric vehicles, first with Volkswagen, which we have previously discussed; and now with Porsche. In Q4, we announced that Porsche Motorsport is using ANSYS to create an advanced electric powertrain for its electric racecar. After proving itself on the track, Porsche expects to use the car's electric powertrain to usher in a new era of commercial e-mobility vehicles. Moving to other industries.Although energy is going through a transition, we are seeing increased demand in that sector, including an extended collaboration with leading energy technology company, Baker Hughes. This longtime customer signed a new agreement in Q4 to use ANSYS simulation to drive down design and development costs, including additive manufacturing while sparking innovation. We continue to see success in aerospace and defense, driven by increased customer investment in North America. In fact, the aerospace and defense industry is responsible for four of our top deals in Q4.The complex product challenges facing aerospace and defense organizations require a true multiphysics approach, including solutions for electromagnetics, fluids and next-generation materials. For example, a leading North American gas turbine manufacturer signed an eight-figure deal in Q4 to shorten its design cycle using faster, more reliable and accurate combustion simulations. By deploying our Mosaic Meshing and enhanced workflows, this industry leader reduced preparation time from hours to minutes while getting more consistent and robust results twice as fast. By using ANSYS solutions, we expect this global leader to save millions of dollars a year in reduced labor and related costs.Another large aerospace company is also benefiting from our comprehensive multiphysics portfolio. This company faced a complex set of operating conditions that made identifying potential failure mechanisms a challenge. It is using our best-in-class electrical, thermal and mechanical products, as well as our electronics reliability simulation solution from last year's acquisition of DfR to improve designs and to mitigate possible failures. This resulted in an eight-figure deal in Q4, and it demonstrates our ability to efficiently integrate new technologies into our selling motion.As you can see, our customers are benefiting from the formidable combination of ANSYS solutions across physics. This is a powerful endorsement of the strength of the full portfolio, and it is one that we believe other vendors cannot match. We continue to extend our product leadership across the entire portfolio with our recently launched ANSYS 2020 R1. R1 accelerates company's digital transformation by enhancing the interfaces, functionality, workflows and scalability of our products.R1 includes multiple products and technology advances. But in the interest of time, I'll focus on areas of particular interest to the high-tech industry. To make 5G a reality, the industry must develop new array and beam steering technologies that overcome millimeter wave impediments such as signal propagation at 28 gigahertz. To overcome those challenges, we continue to make major investments in ANSYS HFSS, our flagship product for designing and simulating high-frequency electronic products.R1 includes groundbreaking new phased array antenna technology that enables 5G designers to model complete antenna arrays, a task that was previously computationally prohibitive. Developing modern antennas is only one challenge in realizing 5G systems. Chip designers must develop new architectures to co-locate the chip and the antenna, which introduces topology constraints and electromagnetic cross-dock challenges that did not previously exist. We recently announced new product, ANSYS RaptorH to solve these challenges.With its unparalleled accuracy, its unmatched capacity and speed and its smooth design flow integration for advanced nanometer integrated circuit design, we believe RaptorH is the most feature-rich electromagnetic tool in the market for system-on-chip flows. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition, and ANSYS HFSS into a single-chip package system design environment. Helic was acquired in Q1 2019, and this product shows the speed at which the ANSYS R&D teams can incorporate new technologies into our portfolio. Our platform strategy is based on an extensible, vendor-neutral architecture that works both on-premises and in the cloud.ANSYS Minerva is based on this architecture and empowers companies to solve the seemingly intractable problem of dealing with the enormous amount of data created by multiphysics simulations of complex systems, such as 5G components and equipment. In R1, Minerva's scalable traceability, configuration management and versioning system ensures reliability and connectivity of simulation data to drive collaboration and insights across the product life cycle and across departmental silos. That traceability is critical to companies like Eaton Corporation that rely on Minerva to streamline the user experience when designing and manufacturing parts using additive manufacturing and other processes. These innovations are empowering our customers to solve some of their most challenging product problems.Our ongoing commitment to improving our best-in-class solutions is further widening the technology gap between us and our competitors. That gap is certainly evident with ANSYS Discovery Live, where we have significantly broadened structural use cases and expanded generative design capabilities while adding a GPU-based, steady-state computational fluid dynamic solver. This breakthrough enables design engineers to predict air flow and heat removal at rates 100 times faster than the previous GPU solver within Discovery Live. One customer told us that they reduced component design time from three months to less than two weeks.Q4 marked the first large renewals for the Discovery business, and we are happy to see our early adopters expand their commitment to Discovery. On its most recent , our strategic partner, PTC, announced that it was also seeing a ramp-up of adoption in average deal size with its Creo simulation live product, which incorporates Discovery Live. As I mentioned previously, we expect the near-term financial impact of Discovery Live to be modest, but we see a strong long-term opportunity. Over the course of Q4, we also expanded our relationships with industry leaders, Autodesk, Microsoft and Rockwell Automation.With Autodesk, we built on our previously announced automotive workflow between our lighting simulation solution, ANSYS SPEOS and Autodesk VRED. Our new connection between ANSYS mechanical and Autodesk Fusion will drive revolutionary design and engineering agility for our customers, helping them expedite products to market. Our partnership with Microsoft also expanded, growing beyond our initial collaboration where we empowered customers to access high-performance computing on demand via ANSYS Cloud, which runs on Microsoft Azure. In Q4, we grew our collaboration to make it easier for customers to adopt and deploy Digital Twins.Through our expanded partnership, manufacturers that model and connect ANSYS using Azure Digital Twins can optimize asset production and operations using ANSYS Twin Builder. That enables users to slash product maintenance costs and speed, high-quality products to market. Similarly, with Rockwell Automation, we're enabling customers to benefit by creating a digital twin of their full manufacturing process to create and test virtual what-if scenarios. In doing so, industrial companies can adapt to market demands with more agility and minimize risk.We are also continuing to expand the market for simulation by reaching future users. Over 3,000 universities use our technology for research and teaching, including students at Carnegie Mellon University, who are building and testing their own simulations in the newly opened ANSYS Hall. More than 150,000 people have enrolled in Cornell University's massive online course in simulation based on ANSYS. And I'm pleased to announce that we have seen over 1 million downloads of our student products.I'd like to take a moment now to recognize my colleagues at ANSYS. As you know, the coronavirus is a rapidly evolving situation. Our No.1 priority remains, of course, the safety and the well-being of our employees and their families around the world. And I am humbled and grateful for the commitment that our colleagues in China and elsewhere are showing as they continue to drive business execution in difficult circumstances.Switching to our commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives for just a moment. I'm proud that Newsweek recently named us to its 2020 list of America's Most Responsible Companies. And I'm delighted that 2020 Women on board recognized ANSYS as a winning \"W\" Company for 2019 with at least 20% women on our board of directors.To summarize, building on double-digit ACV growth in 2018, 2019 was a record-breaking year for ANSYS. These results, combined with our 2020 forecast of double-digit ACV growth and our continued investment in our market-leading products, give us further confidence that we will achieve our goal of $2 billion in ACV by 2022.So you can understand why I'm excited for 2020 and beyond. As I have told you before, the future for ANSYS is brighter than ever. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria? -- Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me start off by saying that, financially, 2019 was our strongest year ever, and we are very encouraged about 2020, given the momentum in our business. For the full year of 2019, we delivered either above the midpoint or well above the high end of the range on our initial financial guidance, and we raised full-year guidance three times throughout the course of the year.Even more exciting is that we closed the year with a very strong fourth quarter, which included record Q4 results across all of our key financial metrics. This is quite a testament to both our resilient business model and our team's ability to execute, particularly when you consider the very strong comparables for both Q4 and the full-year 2018. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to provide some additional color on our financial performance, and then I will close with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q1 and 2020. And consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.For the fourth quarter, we delivered constant currency revenue growth of 18% and ACV growth of 13%, coupled with operating margin and EPS results that will grow above the high end of our Q4 guidance ranges. These record results were driven by strong market demand for our industry-leading multiphysics portfolio and by continued positive customer and business momentum. Now let's turn to some of the key financial metrics that I'd like to highlight for the quarter and the year, beginning with total revenue. We delivered 492.5 million in Q4, and for the full year, we recognized a record 1.5 billion in total revenue, growing 19% in constant currency.Q4 ACV totaled 541 million with 78% of ACV in the quarter coming from recurring sources. Notably, this is our first quarter ever reporting over $0.5 billion in ACV. For 2019, our ACV totaled 1.46 billion, representing constant currency growth of 12% with recurring sources making up 77% of the total. We remind investors that we believe that our annual ACV is a key metric for gauging our operating performance over time.In the quarter, an increase in software lease license sales, combined with strong maintenance renewals, bolstered our deferred revenue and backlog total to $871 million, a 32% increase over last year's comparable balance. Moving on to profitability. In Q4, we continued to build on our solid performance throughout every quarter of 2019 with strong top line results that helped to drive a fourth-quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 48%. For 2019, we finished the year with a gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 45%.These results are evident that, first and foremost, we are committed to managing our business with discipline and, secondly, that we are successful in integrating tuck-in acquisitions into our business model while still delivering best-in-class margins. These strong margins helped to drive record fourth quarter and full year EPS of $2.24 and $6.58, both well above our guidance ranges. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 17% as compared to the 20 to 21% range that we had expected. The Q4 rate was favorably impacted by a $6.7 million benefit related to a December tax law change in a foreign jurisdiction.Please keep in mind that this nonrecurring benefit will impact year-over-year comparisons in 2020. Our cash flow from operations totaled 139 million for the fourth quarter and 500 million for 2019, and we closed the year with a total of 872 million in cash and short-term investments. Let me add that the acquisitions of LSTC and Dynardo had a relatively insignificant impact on the results for the quarter, contributing 9 million of revenue and 7 million of ACV. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance.Before I get into the specific numbers, I would like to briefly comment on China, which accounted for just above 4% of our overall revenue in 2019. First, although the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have somewhat improved with the completion of the Phase I deal, our full-year guidance assumes that the U.S. sanctions on the China restricted entities announced in 2019 will not be lifted.We estimate that the sanctions resulted in approximately 20 million of both ACV and revenue primarily booked in the first half of 2019 that we have assumed will not be repeated in 2020. Second, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus is bringing new challenges to China and to other countries in the region. The outbreak could potentially delay some deals originally planned in the first half of 2020 to the second half of the year. This has an insignificant impact on our annual outlook and is factored into our Q1 guidance.Before moving to our outlook for 2020, as I have consistently communicated over the past several years, our focus will be on progress against our annual targets as opposed to short-term quarterly results. You should expect, as we do, variability in quarterly financial results because ASC 606 revenue recognition rules could affect both revenue and related growth numbers based on the number, timing, size and duration of multiyear leases. As I described in detail in our last call, in any given quarter or year, there can be a disconnect between the revenue and ACV metrics. In some quarters and years, one metric can be ahead of the other.But eventually and often in the subsequent comparable quarter or year, the other metric must be ahead because the two metrics sum to the same number in the long term. In 2019, constant currency revenue growth of 19% disproportionately outpaced ACV growth of 12%, driven by large multiyear lease deals. In 2020, however, we expect constant currency ACV growth of 11 to 14% to outpace annual revenue growth of 8 to 12%. Note also that in both 2018 and in 2019, the second half of the year was stronger than the first, and Q4 was by far our largest quarter.We expect that this trend will continue in 2020. Going one level down, there are three reasons for why the second half will be stronger than the first. First is seasonality. The second half of the year, most notably the fourth quarter, continues to get seasonally stronger with a number of large multiyear lease deals in the pipeline.This is aligned with the timing of many of our customers' annual budgeting and spending cycles. Second is timing of specific deals. Q1 2019 saw a small number of large multiyear lease contracts that contributed significant revenue in that quarter. Naturally, these contracts will not renew this year and, thus, will not contribute significant revenue in this quarter.Even though we expect the total revenue contribution of our multiyear leases in 2020 to increase as compared to 2019, this timing of Q1 2019 deals, coupled with the seasonality of large deals, means that the first quarter's revenue from multiyear contracts will be lower than Q1 of 2019. Third, the combined effect of the China sanction and coronavirus, which I described earlier, delays first half revenue and further strengthens projected revenue growth in the second half of 2020. Let's move on to the details of our outlook. We are initiating our guidance for Q1 and expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of 300 to 320 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.88.For 2020, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of 1.64 billion to 1.7 billion or constant currency growth in the range of 8 to 12% and EPS in the range of $6.19 to $6.71. Our ACV outlook for 2020 is a range of 1.605 billion to 1.650 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 11 to 14%. With respect to 2020 annual operating cash flow, our initial outlook in the range of 500 to $530 million, which considers a full year of interest expense on our term loan.Looking ahead to Q1. We are expecting operating margins of 27.5% to 30%, which are reflected on the lower revenue contribution in Q1 combined with a lower proportion of variable cost. And for the full-year 2020, we expect margins in the range of 42 to 43%. This aligns with the target range of 42 to 44% that we communicated back in September 2019 at our investor day event.To close out from the topic of our outlook for 2020, let me just say that we have a strong pipeline, diversified business model and a high level of recurring revenues, all of which contribute to our confidence that 2020 will play out similar to the past two years. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document.In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of record financial performance with strength across our key financial metrics. Our continued track record of delivering on our financial commitment gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of record financial performance in 2020. In addition, we will continue to invest in our business while we execute against our strategic priorities in support of delivering on our longer-term 2022 ambition.Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks for taking my question guys. Maybe the first question for you, Ajei. You guys have historically been pretty conservative in terms of how you guys think about your business. And when we look at that ACV guide of 11 to 14% growth, help us understand maybe kind of what type of conservatism has been baked in and where you might see some opportunities for improvement as we work our way through the year.And then, Maria, any way to help us with what the organic ACV growth of the business is for fiscal-year '20? -- So I'll let Maria jump in as well. But a couple of assumptions that we've built in perhaps that might help for the 2020 ACV assumptions. Firstly, as you know, as I said in the comments, Q4 was an amazingly strong quarter in terms of ACV. So I'm excited about the performance.I'm excited about the pipeline. I think we have a very strong pipeline. Built into assumptions that there are a couple of headwinds, which perhaps might be relevant. One is we've assumed that currency is approximately a point, so that's approximately $15 million of a headwind, and that might be relevant to the conversation.And the other is, of course, is we're assuming from the China sanctions that there's a headwind from a growth perspective, and Maria mentioned that on the call as well, and that's approximately $20 million. And so taking that -- taken together, that's approximately 2.3% or about 35% -- $35 million headwind coming into ACV for the year. And of course, that mitigates what we have in terms of an amazingly strong pipeline. -- Yes. And Ken, with respect to inorganic contribution, we're expecting currently about 3 to 4% both to ACV, and revenue will be the inorganic component. -- Great, thanks a lot guys.Our next question comes from Jackson Ader with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks for taking my questions this morning. Just a quick follow-up. Maria, the inorganic contribution, what about for 2019 to both ACV and revenue? -- It was roughly about 3 to 4% as well for the full year. -- Yes. OK. That's helpful. And then the cash flow outlook, looks like, again, you guys are looking for kind of low single-digit cash flow.And if we look at that as a percent of -- I know revenue can bounce around, but even as a percent of ACV, it's kind of coming down again. Can you just comment on maybe free cash flow conversion relative to what you would expect in kind of normalized years outside of all the 606 noise? -- So let me talk about a couple of the primary factors that we built into our current outlook for operating cash flow. So first and foremost, as you heard me say on the call, the slightly reduced margin in 2020 as compared to 2019. I also mentioned, this is the first year that we have interest payments on long-term debt that we entered into in connection with the LSTC acquisition. That's about $13 million impact.The stronger U.S. dollar. The expectation that we'll have increased tax payments in 2020 related to our strong profitability last year. And one other nuance that you may or may not be aware of that relates to another accounting change, there is a new accounting standard that we adopted and that others will adopt that impacts the treatment of certain items that move from -- historically were treated as investing items that now move into operating, and so those will also have a negative impact relative to the cash flows in 2020.So the combination of all of those elements is what leads us to the 500 to 530 million that we currently are projecting.Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, good morning. Ajei, in your prepared remarks, you referred to the new features and capabilities in the 2020 release, including the incorporation of some acquired functionality. The question then for that is, could you talk about how you have evolved or may yet have to evolve your internal development processes, R&D management and the like? I've asked this question of other companies like Adobe, for example, that have large complex portfolios, that have also been acquisitive. I'd be curious to understand how you, particularly for multiphysics and the non-solver business, have perhaps made some changes, if any, to R&D.And then secondly, also for you. Talk about, if you could, the interplay as you see it between services, including, in particular technical consulting on the one hand, and your solver and non-solver businesses. What is the connection there in terms of services as you see it as either a leading indicator or coincidental indicator to support and enable the software business? -- So if I understand the question about R&D, and I'll try to answer it as best as I can, and hopefully, this gets to the gist of your question, we -- as any sophisticated company with a broad portfolio of technologies, we rely on a combination of both organic development, where we have a road map that we execute against. And in certain occasions, we rely on acquisitions, and the acquisitions could be because there's a technology that we've decided we need, which might be better served by going out and buying a company, which has already developed that as opposed to developing ourselves. We have an amazingly engaged and capable R&D organization, and we continue to drive innovation after innovation, and I gave you an example of some of the innovations in HFSS. And if you look at the R1 release, you'll see a chapter and verse of all kinds of new features and capabilities that continue to enhance our products across a number of different dimensions.But at the same time, we believe that acquisitions are an important aspect, that there are a number of start-up companies that have interesting ideas. There are other companies that perhaps maybe a little bit more established that have developed great technology like LSTC had. And we are able to bring them in and rapidly incorporate them into our R&D processes and our development processes. We have an internal mechanism to be able to share information.We have a technical conference, for example, where our R&D leaders from around the world and technical leaders can come get together and share information. There's a lot of collaboration. And you're seeing that in the results. I gave the example of RaptorX.You've seen the results in some of our optics technology where we announced ANSYS SPEOS, which brought together some of the work that we had on solid modeling, on the SpaceClaim side together with the SPEOS capabilities and so on. You can see that in our autonomous offerings, where we have brought together core technology that we've developed over the years, as well as acquisitions that came in, as well as technology that came in from acquisitions. You see that in our platform strategy, which includes capabilities that we've developed, as well as other things that we've acquired. So it's a complex equation, but I think that our team is incredibly sophisticated, and we're able to deal with that complexity very well.So I think that's the first piece of the -- that's the first piece of your question. The second piece is with respect to services. We have a -- we are not a services company, a professional services company. That is not our business model.We're a software business. And for us, while we do services, services are fundamentally in support of driving software sales. Now we do have a small services organization that supports some of our larger opportunities. And especially when it's in a broad -- a new emerging area, we can certainly see an incremental set of requests for the services capabilities that we provide.That's not our business, and we work with service partners around the world who can add to the ecosystem. So many of our large channel partners and others can add to the ecosystem to provide service delivery to our customers. This is obviously not an area where we are focusing on trying to significantly increase our share of the business. As I said, our business model is that of a software company.Our next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. The dynamic around eight-figure deals continues to be very impressive. Do you think your performance within a specific industry vertical or with the existing eight-figure customers, is that a point where ANSYS is maybe benefiting from a referral sale dynamic? -- If what you're saying in the question is do you believe that customers are seeing that ANSYS has technology that can help other people in the marketplace and therefore could help themselves, in other words, the customer says, look, I can see what ANSYS is doing elsewhere, and therefore, they're in a position to help me, I think customers look to work with winners. I think we're a winner in the marketplace, and customers like to work with us. We certainly see customers who appreciate the fact that we've invested ahead of the curve, for example, in areas like autonomy and electrification, IoT, where we have great capability, and we can demonstrate customer success in the conversations that we're having with customers. I hope, does that answer your question? -- Yes, yes, it does. And then going back to the strong pipeline for FY '20. Can you maybe just discuss how business conditions outside of China, outside of the affected areas, have changed year to date maybe relative to your expectation for the ACV pipeline and close rates at the start of the year? -- Yes. So Joe, what I would say is on a global front, we don't see -- outside of China, we don't see any huge changes from the macro environment that existed when we exited Q4. And I think for us, the -- what gives us confidence relative to our outlook for 2020 is that -- to the topic that you just spoke to Ajei about, every single one of those eight-figure deals that were closed in Q4 were in the pipeline when we came out with guidance in November. So we successfully were able to close every single one of those, and we know that we've got a strong pipeline of deals that are scheduled to close in Q4 of next year just because of the renewal cycle.They're lighter in Q1 just because of the ones that we closed this year that will not repeat. But we are very confident that based on everything that we know today, we've got a strong pipeline. We've got customers that are investing heavily in their own digital transformation to keep pace with market expectations. And so while it may appear on the surface that Q1's light, when you look at the full year and the fact that we're putting up double-digit ACV and revenue growth at the midpoint for the full year, we're very excited about the opportunity that we see ahead.Our next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question I'll have one follow-up as well. On the Q4 specifically, it looks like constant currency, you were just about at the midpoint of your guide. I'm wondering, could you comment that's for ACV. Can you comment on what factors could have gotten you to the high end of guide? And conversely, what factors could have led you more toward the low end? You came right down in the middle and the fair way, it looks like. -- Yes. So Steve, what I'll say is there were two primary factors that contributed to where we ended up on ACV, and both of those, unfortunately, were outside of our control. The first being currency. And the second, if you'll recall, we closed the LSTC acquisition right before we gave guidance in November.And about 100% of that business came through their channel. We were not able to engage with the channel during the diligence, and so as a result, what we discovered once we closed that deal, that the forecasting methodologies that their channel used were not necessarily aligned with what a public company would do. And so as a result, that ended up -- the contributions from the acquisitions were a little bit less than we anticipated. So if you take the combination of the forecasting negative, which we have now fixed and have been resolved as we head into 2020, and the impact currency, the two of those essentially would have brought us closer to the midpoint. -- Got it. That's helpful, Maria. And then for my follow-up, you explained in some pretty good detail why second half looks -- should be somewhat stronger than the first half. I'm wondering specifically relative to the coronavirus assumptions and the statement that the full year shouldn't be impacted, I'm wondering what inputs are you considering there in terms of the second half bounce-back in making that forecast.What kind of -- are you looking at the news? Or does it come from your channel in China? Or what's giving you confidence in that assumption, specifically around the outbreak? -- So let me take a crack, and then I'll have Maria jump in as well. We are in -- obviously, as you can imagine, we are in very close contact with our team in China, and we're working closely with them, as well as we're in contract with our channel partners in China. We're a software business. And as you can imagine, a lot of the activity that needs to be done in order to communicate with customers and work with customers can actually be done over the network, it can be done over telephone calls and so forth.And we are seeing that our team in China, and I alluded to this in my comments, our team in China is able to -- despite the fact that some of our offices are closed, our team in China is able to go in -- to be able to work from home and to reach our customers, who are also working from home and are able to get access to businesses and so forth. And so based upon that and what we're seeing in terms of our ability to move our business forward, we've taken a -- we're somewhat conservative. We're moving -- we believe that there will be obviously some impact in the sense that there will be some business that will be delayed from the first half to the second half. But we believe that the underlying dynamics of the market continue to be strong.The demand for our products continues to be high. We're continuing to be able to make progress against opportunities, and so we've modeled this as essentially a delay of activity that might have otherwise been scheduled for the first half, delaying into the second half. Maria? -- Yes. And I'll just say, Steve, relative to that commentary, we have factored in into our Q1 outlook some prudent caution relative to the coronavirus and the impact that it will have on our Q1 business in China specifically.Our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi with Berenberg. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for taking my question. First, on your partnership with Rockwell. I was just wondering when do you think you expect to see some progress there. Should it be consistent with the Digital Twin opportunity you highlighted at your investor day? Or would it potentially materialize sooner than that? -- So our partnership with Rockwell is very much about the opportunity to help with the manufacturing process, and it's the use of Digital Twins in the manufacturing process to be able to optimize that. So yes, it is related to the deployment of Digital Twin technology. But at the same time, this is not an esoteric long-term multiyear activity we are working actively with customers today. And customers, I think -- working together with customers, I think we can demonstrate the benefit of the use of Digital Twins and being able to optimize their manufacturing processes.And I'm not sure if we could talk about specific customers today by name, but there's one particular large CPG customer, for example, that we're actively engaged with that I'm very excited about. -- Great. And just the last one on the -- in terms of the energy sector, you mentioned it was a low growth cycle last year, and -- but it picked up in the second half. Can you mention what's changed? -- Yes. I think when you look at energy, what's happening is that the industry is transitioning some of its investments from where they've historically been, so looking at things like digital transformation, they're looking at predictive analytics, material intelligence, additive manufacturing, robotics, autonomous systems. So it's not only what they've traditionally looked at, but they're starting to broaden. And of course, these are areas where we can now -- we've historically had a lot of investments, and then we can continue to broaden our conversations with these service providers in the energy sector to include all of these new capabilities where they're seeking to broaden their own solutions.And that's continued to drive -- that continue to drive opportunities.Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you Ajei, I appreciate your comments on Discovery Live. Just wondering, you mentioned you didn't expect it to be sort of material near term, but if you could give us any sense of when you think that might be able to be a material contributor. And then what other opportunities might you have beyond the PTC arrangement now, either to sort of broaden that agreement as they've broadened out their product line or potentially to partner with other players in the cat industry? -- Well, as far as our relationship with PTC is concerned, look, I'm excited about the relationship with PTC. I think that they're a great partner. And obviously, they have recently gone through the acquisition of Onshape, which is the great technology they brought onboard, and we continue to have conversations with them about how our relationship can evolve and grow. So that's an ongoing dialogue we continue to have with our partners at PTC.As far as the first question in terms of the Discovery business in the aggregate, I mean I think that the technology is incredible, and we're going after a market opportunity that continues to evolve and develop, and that's one of the reasons why we've been incredibly cautious about how we imagine the financial impact of this business is going to be. And I think we've been very consistent in saying that this is going to be a relatively modest piece of our business for a long time, and that's in part driven by the fact that the audience that we're going after is a relatively conservative audience. And adoption of these kinds of technologies, unlike the consumer technology, adoption takes time. We continue to drive the new innovation and the innovations that we -- I described some innovations before, I don't want to go through them again, but we continue to drive new innovations and new capabilities and that continues to broaden and strengthen our capability in the market.So I'm excited about where we are. I believe we've made great progress. We have seen progress with customers who have come through the enterprise renewal process. So it wasn't like they were just buying it to evaluate it.They're buying it and they're rebuying it. So that's a really positive sign, and we continue to see that as a tailwind for the business as we go forward.Our next question comes from Matthew Pfau with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. I just wanted to ask on the LSTC acquisition. How is the integration of that business progressing? You mentioned that, historically, they've done a majority of their sales through the channel. Are you working on transitioning that sales motion more to your internal sales force? And then I do know they have some exposure in automotive, and you mentioned that the autonomous and electric was good for ANSYS.How about LSTC and their automotive exposure? -- So firstly, the area that -- let me start with the last piece. The area where LSTC has a lot of strength in automotive is in crash testing. Crash testing, when I meant the more legacy areas, I was talking about potentially a transition from electric to the internal combustion engine. And if you start to think about that transition, customers are spending more money on electric drivetrains and thinking about that change versus internal combustion engines.However, when you consider now the fact that you have, say, a battery inside a car, and as I've described in previous calls, the transition to an electric drivetrain and to a battery-operated car fundamentally changes the nature of the design. The chassis changes. Weight assumptions change. There's a fundamental redesign taking place across the car in the aggregate.But that means that you have to rethink what it means for collision and response to collisions. And then, of course, the battery, you have to worry about battery explosions and battery fires and things of that nature. So you have to really rethink and spend a lot of effort understanding how collisions because collisions might happen. You have to make sure that the collisions are not going to be catastrophic, and that means there continues to be significant demand even in the new world of electric cars for the kind of work that we're doing, and I'm very excited about the opposition there in the marketplace.So that's with respect to the actual end market in automotive for LSTC. As far as the integration of the technology and the product is going, the integration is going really well. We are -- the technology is very consistent with what we expected. We were a longtime reseller as well of the technology, so we certainly understood it before we did the acquisition.It's consistent with what we expected, and it's a great team, and they're great people. As far as the channel partners are concerned, we're working with those channel partners. They're integrating into the ANSYS ecosystem, and we're working with the channel partners. We're honoring those relationships and supporting those channel partners because they have some really valuable customer relationships and incredible skills and capabilities that we want to maintain within the ANSYS ecosystem.So we want those channel partners to grow and thrive within the ANSYS ecosystem. And the good news is that we have a vibrant channel relationship already, and those channel partners can grow inside, and we are very supportive of them continuing to be able to grow their business as being part of the broader ANSYS family.Our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I understand the lower revenue dynamics driving the lower margins in Q1, but expense growth looks to be the highest in Q1. Can you maybe talk about acquisition integration costs, investments or core cost timing? -- Yes. So what I'll say, Jason, is, please keep in mind that Q1 is the first quarter of all five of the acquisitions coming into play that we did last year. So the combination of the acquisition, along with our own organic hiring and a number of digital transformation activities that we've got going in our own business, just result in Q1 having a lot less variable cost than if you look across the entire year. So we're excited that we will continue to run our business with diligence, that we'll continue to deliver best-in-class margins.But we really encourage you to look at the margins over the course of the full year as opposed to just a 90-day period. -- Great. And then relative -- actually following back to the coronavirus and that pushing some ACV in the beginning of the second half, I understand that it might delay some work. But can you maybe talk about second half resources that would be devoted to that? -- When you say resources that would be devoted to that, what specifically you're referring to? -- Well, if you think about what it takes to close a deal, if you have got work that was supposed to close and keeping first half that is closed in the second half, would there be a second half work that would be delayed as a result? -- I understand what you're saying. No, we don't see any significant impact. I mean when you consider the aggregate of our business, it's so large. We're talking about a relatively de minimis amount relative to the overall value of our business.So it's a tiny -- it's noise in the big scheme of things from a back-end deal closing perspective, the people who actually close the deals as far as the books are concerned. As far as the actual work with the customers, as I said, a lot of that work is taking place right now, where we are able to work with the customer virtually. We are able to do -- continue with telephone calls. We're able to continue working over the Internet.We can do webinars. We can do webcast. Customers have access to demo systems as they need to. All of that activity continues to take place.As I said, our colleagues in China -- and once again, I want to acknowledge our colleagues in China who've been working on the difficult circumstances for a while. Our colleagues in China are able to continue to drive the business forward, and they are actively working to do that. And so we feel like a lot of the spade work that we need is continuing to happen. We will continue to see -- we will continue to close business in Q1.And -- but we've modeled -- for the sake of being prudent, we've modeled the slippage of some business into the second half of the year. And that's, of course, already in the guidance.Our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one, in the prepared remarks, it was interesting to see some increasing momentum in the healthcare vertical in North America. Maybe you could just talk a little bit more about what's driving the strength and what efforts you're devoting against that in 2020. -- Yes. So let me just try to take that for a second. Look, we see simulation is becoming increasingly important for a sector of the healthcare market. And while it's a relatively small vertical for us today, I think we're making significant progress there, especially in Q4.And in the physics, in physics that's based on the healthcare sector, specifically that we're focused on, which is the like device manufacturing medical devices and so on, we've been working with the regulator of the FDA. We've been working with the EU. And we believe that the healthcare industry is heading more toward things like in silico trials and outcomes like personalized medicine, and then physics space simulation will play an even more active role. And we've, frankly, been very active in this field for a long, long time, maybe for the last decade.And we've been engaging globally with policymakers, with academics, with consortia to try to make sure that we can explain to the industry and bring the industry and the regulations along to the use of in silico trials, and I think we've made significant progress. Now in Q4 specifically, as I said, we had several larger deals with medical device market leaders, specifically focusing on the use of simulation and leading to products that could be deployed more rapidly and products that could get regulatory approval more rapidly. So that translates into a very specific value proposition to the customers, which is they can get new product to market faster and at lower cost with greater probability through the regulation process. And so that's a low-hanging fruit for us, but we see all kinds of opportunity in the healthcare space that we're working toward.Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Just two quick ones for you, Maria. So I just wanted to clarify the question on ACV performance in Q4. I thought you said that if you had the currency play out as you'd originally expected and then some of the pipeline forecasting issues with the acquisition, you would have kind of come in, in the midpoint of guidance.I guess what kind of prevented you from -- sorry, go ahead. -- Near the midpoint? -- Yes. I guess what would have prevented you from going toward the high end? Were there any types of deals that slipped? Or what's kind of the factors there? And then just a quick follow-up. As I think about the divergence between operating cash flow, margin and operating income margin, over time, would you expect those to kind of triangulate kind of in the same neighborhood? I think they're north of a 10-point delta today, but just how to think about those in the long run. -- So Tyler, what I'd say is like any year end, there are customers that will apply pressure to get better discounts or better terms and conditions. And so if you decide to take those deals, then you can always end up at the high end of guidance. And if you decide to think about our business as a long-term play and not give in to the pressures of giving away software and services that are highly valuable for discounts that make a number in Q4 look better, we just choose to run our business for the long term. And so there's always ways to make the numbers look better, but are they the right ways for the business in the long term? So as we said, we're very excited about our performance in Q4.We closed the deals that were in our forecast that mattered. We had a record quarter, and we're excited about what we see ahead for 2020.Our next question comes from Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just one question, Ajei. Could you just clarify your prepared remarks around the improvements you saw in the energy sector? Are you seeing broad-based improvements in that industry? Or did your comments just pertain to the big deal with Baker Hughes? -- No. As I said, I think I mentioned this in one of the earlier questions as well, we are seeing customers in the energy sector. And again, we have a definition of the energy sector. We have customers in the energy sector who are looking to broaden what they were previously interested in.So it wasn't just the conversations that we've been historically having. There are broader conversations about things like predictive intelligence and materials and robotics that I mentioned before. Another area that continues to be of interest is emissions reduction, things like carbon capture. And so we saw some new opportunities that emerge from things like carbon capture with applicability for renewable energy and energy storage, battery management, battery systems and things of that nature.So all of those are outside of the traditional business that you might have perhaps associated with the energy sector, and those represent incremental opportunities for us as we think about our business going forward.Our next question comes from Matthew Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, thanks for taking my question. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt Hedberg. You performed really well in the automotive sector in 2019 by going after some of those new dollars around electrification and automation. So far in 2020, it seems like PMI data might be improving, areas like Germany, Brexit.It seems like there's less uncertainty from the U.K. Could you talk a little bit about the return, maybe if some of those old dollars, and what that could mean to the space? -- Well, as I said, I think that some of the directions that we've talked about in the automotive industry, for 100 years, the automotive industry has been based on an assumption that it's an internal combustion engine, and it's driven by a human being. And both of those assumptions are being challenged at the same time. So we expect -- so a significant amount of the R&D spend is going toward these next-generation technologies. It is going toward electrification.It is going toward electric systems. It is also going toward electric driving. It's also going toward autonomy. And while we may not necessarily see full autonomy in the short term, as we go on this journey to autonomy, we have improved safety systems, we have autonomy and limited circumstances and so forth.So that level of investment is an ongoing stream of investment that we see happening for multiple years, and we're excited about that. That being said, when you look at the full portfolio, I think that we have some tremendous strength in the automotive industry outside of these new areas that we've talked about. We talked briefly about crash. That's an area that we continue to be strong.That's obviously through the acquisition. And we continue to be strong in other areas with the portfolio that we've driven. Some other interesting areas like optics have also come into our portfolio through acquisitions. So we have a very strong footprint in the automotive industry today.We have good capabilities, both for the emerging areas, where there's a lot of R&D spend, as well as the more traditional areas. And we're very excited about our position.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks. -- Great. Thank you. 2019 was another outstanding year for ANSYS, and we exceeded expectations on many of our key financial metrics. We continue to improve execution across the geographies and our go-to-market strategies.We broadened our product capabilities, and we announced several new partnerships and collaborations. These are important accomplishments, and they continue to move the business in the right direction, and they give us confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. We are looking forward to another exciting year in 2020. And in closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners for their support.And of course, a shout-out to my ANSYS colleagues. Thank you all for your efforts, and thank you for another exceptional quarter and an exceptional year. Thank you all for joining the call.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $220.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $219.50 (before broker commissions).

After some further research, I elected to start a position in .Nearly three years later, I stumbled across that list again. The results in my original seven-ticker group were all over the place, but one of them soared well above the rest with a 130% return. That's what it took to remind me of   .For those keeping score at home, the  had gained 32% over the same period while my hapless maker of optoelectronic components took a 7% haircut instead. This discovery made me curious about two things:Ansys entered 2017 with a stable but quite unremarkable wind in its sails. Revenue had grown at an average annual clip of 7.4% over the preceding five years while adjusted earnings posted yearly gains of 9.3%. The stock rose 61% across the same five-year period, trailing behind the S&P 500's 78% increase.All of that changed in a hurry. With the benefit of hindsight, the best marker for Ansys' soon-to-be-unleashed gains appears to be a surging order backlog. Keep in mind that we're talking about a software company here, not some asset-heavy manufacturing business. In other words, the order backlog has nothing to do with slow production lines. Instead, it's all about subscription fees to be collected in the future, tied to long-term contracts.The company's total backlog rose by 78% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2016, accelerating to an 80% clip in the next quarterly report. The company was also bagging a much larger number of million-dollar contracts, paving the way toward stable relationships with enterprise-level clients. That was the latest news on the table when Ansys first caught my eye.Those pent-up order reserves translated smoothly into surging revenue in the years that followed. Gross margin widened at the same time, helped by improving economies of scale. In the recently reported third quarter of 2019, Ansys posted 19% constant currency sales growth and record-high earnings of $1.42 per share.With trailing gross margin of 89% and net margin just north of 30%, Ansys feeds those growing revenue streams into an efficient cash machine. Market interest in simulation tools is at an all-time high these days, and the market as a whole is expected to grow by 15% a year over the next five years. Ansys is an established leader in this space and likely to gain market share even as the total revenue pie expands.I couldn't see all of that from the vantage point of 2017, but the healthy market plus surging order backlogs may have been all the clues I really needed.Image source: Getty Images.I don't think so.This company is powering through a sluggish global economy with double-digit revenue growth and expanding margins. Ansys serves as the name to beat in a fantastic target market, and I can't imagine a future where simulation software isn't enormously important.

We surpassed the high end of our guidance in both revenue and earnings per share. Our annual contract value, or ACV, came in at a robust 14% growth in constant currency.Based on our continued outstanding financial performance and the ongoing strength of our pipeline, I'm excited to announce that we are again increasing our 2019 revenue, EPS and ACV guidance.

This strong across-the-board performance highlights the robustness and the resilience of the ANSYS business.Considering sales activity from a geographical perspective, the Americas has contributed strong, consistent performance throughout the year. As we had expected, Europe had a slower first half of the year, but Q3 was strong and we expect Q4 to also be robust based on some larger deals in the pipeline. Asia has also performed well this year, but full year growth in China is expected to be muted as a result of the ongoing trade restrictions. Our guidance, of course, takes this consideration into account.Our channel, which continues to represent about 1/4 of our sales activity, grew consistently with our direct business. From an industry perspective, the semiconductor and high tech, automotive and aerospace and defense verticals continue to lead the way. As has been the case in many quarters, our larger deals are driven by the strength of our multiphysics portfolio. In fact, over 80% of our largest deals in Q3 included four or more products across our physics suite.Our enterprise and strategic accounts performed well and included three customers with orders in the eight-figure range. Let me share a few of our Q3 successes. A leading innovator in high tech materials and processes signed at $12 million multiyear agreement to develop next-generation OEM components. With increased access to simulation, more engineers of the company can use ANSYS to provide tailored solutions for its customers.Through a new multimillion dollar deal, ANSYS' multiphysics solutions are enabling an electronic leader to be the first-to-market. This company has demonstrated that ANSYS can materially reduce the number of physical prototypes saving $5 million in one of its business groups alone. Another large technology company signed an 8-figure agreement to drive innovation in new markets while growing its footprint in existing business segments. The company is using ANSYS from silicon through the entire platform to innovate, reduce time to market and mitigate the risk of next-generation mobile phone and data center chips.Only ANSYS could fulfill its demand for fast, high fidelity multiphysics modeling, resulting in a nice win over our competition. On our recent calls, I've highlighted specific product or solution areas in the ANSYS portfolio. For example, in Q1, I discussed our leadership in electronics with products such as ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RedHawk. On our last call, we discussed our multiphysics autonomy solution which includes core products like ANSYS HFSS coupled with leading technologies that we've obtained through recent acquisitions including Medini and OPTIS.With so many recent advances in ANSYS Mechanical as well as the acquisition of LSTC, on this call, I would like to focus on our mechanical and structures products. ANSYS was founded as a mechanical and structural simulation company, and nearly 50 years later, that product line continues to accelerate. Customers use our mechanical simulation to validate the design, structural integrity and the performance of their products across a broad spectrum of applications, from jet turbine blades to offshore oil pumping platforms and everything in between. That's due in part to our ongoing focus on accuracy.We are also consistently driving new functionality and ease of use into ANSYS Mechanical, including innovations that we added in Q3 for streamlined and simplified workflows as well as the prediction of electronic hardware failure gained from our acquisition of DfR Solutions. Those enhancements and many more are resonating with new and existing customers. Our recent acquisition of LSTC is further broadening our footprint in the structures space. LSTC is the world's premier provider of explicit dynamics and other advanced finite element analysis technology.LSTC's flagship product, LS- DYNA, is used to simulate high-speed, short-duration events, for example, a cellphone drop or an automotive crash. In fact, the automotive industry has widely adopted LS-DYNA to accurately predict a vehicle's behavior and the effects on occupants during a collision. Over the years, LSTC has evolved its solutions from a leading explicit dynamics solver to a broad multiphysics suite that can solve a range of use cases, from automotive impacts to airbags to aerospace and defense applications and beyond. The LSTC technology and customer use cases are complementary to and dovetail nicely with the broader ANSYS Mechanical products with solve for a longer-term phenomena like structural loads and vibrations.While ANSYS has partnered with LSTC for nearly 25 years, we had focused on a limited set of LS-DYNA use cases and not on the primary use cases such as automotive crash testing. Now that LSTC is part of ANSYS, our comprehensive go-to-market capabilities will enable us to better serve the automotive, aerospace and defense and other markets with the full breadth and depth of the LS-DYNA suite. And by combining our product portfolios, we will be able to solve even more challenging customer problems than either company could individually. Industry legend, John Hallquist, founded LSTC and he will remain part of the ANSYS team.Both LSTC and ANSYS share a similar culture based on a profound respect for technology and an unwavering commitment to customer success. And I'm excited that the combination will allow ANSYS customers to deliver more sophisticated products, faster and more efficiently than ever before. We also closed on our acquisition of Dynardo, a leading provider of multidisciplinary analysis and optimization technology. An existing ANSYS partner Dynardo develops state-of-the-art solutions for optimization, uncertainty quantification, robustness, sensitivity analysis and data mining.And while this acquisition isn't financially material, adding Dynardo's products into the ANSYS portfolio will give customers access to the full suite of process integration and robust design tools, empowering users to identify optimal product designs faster and more economically. I'm delighted to welcome the LSTC and Dynardo employees into our ANSYS family. We also continue to make strong progress with integrating technology from our earlier acquisitions into our portfolio as we saw in a newly released ANSYS 2019 R3. On the materials side, we introduced ANSYS Granta materials data for simulation, which increases the number of off-the-shelf materials available directly in our flagship products.With DfR Solutions, we have upgraded the Sherlock preprocessor and cosolving engine using ANSYS technology. Our sales teams have embraced these upgrades helping us to expand existing accounts, open sales opportunities at new customers and accelerate pending deals. On the partnership side, we recently announced an alliance with Microsoft to help mutual customers improve operations through digital twins. This collaboration will empower customers to more accurately predict an asset's future performance and reduce unscheduled downtime expenses using Azure Digital Twins and ANSYS Twin Builder.We also announced an exclusive partnership with Motor Design Limited to distribute its Motor-CAD software. Mortar-CAD enables design engineers to evaluate motor topologies and concepts across the full operating range and to produce designs that are optimized for performance, efficiency and size. By combining their electric motor design software tool with our multiphysics analysis capabilities, we are extending simulation into the design phase of the electric machine product life cycle. Our previously announced partnerships continue to build momentum.In its most recent , PTC reported 126 transactions, a 66% increase in the number of deals from the previous quarter for Creo Simulation Live, its CAD solution powered by ANSYS Discovery Live. PTC expects adoption to further accelerate in its next fiscal year. Turning now to our environmental, social and governance initiatives. Stem education remains a key element of our ESG focus.I was excited last week to attend the opening of ANSYS Hall, a new engineering building complete with state-of-the-art maker space on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University here in Pittsburgh. As part of our partnership with CMU, we are providing students with access to the ANSYS portfolio, enabling them to prepare for life outside of academia by solving real-world engineering challenges. We have also expanded our Women in Technology efforts through a grant to Lila Poonawalla Foundation, which provides scholarships and training for aspiring female engineers in India. These initiatives are incredibly exciting to all of us at ANSYS as we help to train the next generation of engineers and scientists.In summary, I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in the third quarter and frankly for all of 2019. We recorded another quarter of double-digit top line growth and best-in-class margins. We are in a growing market with a winning strategy of Pervasive Simulation and a world-class product portfolio bolstered by a strong pipeline and an established track record of execution. That gives us tremendous confidence as we close out 2019 and prepare for 2020.And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria? -- Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our very strong third-quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q4. Consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.Before we dig into the details, I would like to point out that we have increased our 2019 guidance, not only to include the impact of our recently closed LSTC and Dynardo acquisitions but also to take into account the strength of the stand-alone ANSYS business and our improved outlook on the organic pipeline of opportunities. Our record Q3 results reflect continued customer and business momentum, combined with solid execution across the enterprise. We finished the quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 19% and operating margin and EPS results that were also above the high end of our Q3 guidance ranges. The revenue performance in Q3 was driven by strong sales execution, including a larger dollar value of multiyear lease transactions than we initially forecasted coming into the quarter.This is reflected in the strong lease revenue growth that we reported for Q3 and a continuation of the growth trend that we have seen throughout this year. The combination of our success in delivering on our 2019 financial commitments and the strength of our sales pipeline gives us confidence that we are on a path to continue to execute against our strategic priorities and to deliver another year of record financial performance in 2019. Key financial metrics for the quarter begin with total revenue of $345 million. Q3 ACV totaled $291 million or constant currency growth of 14%, with 73% of ACV in the quarter coming from recurring sources.The increase in software lease license sales combined with strong maintenance renewals contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q3 total of $650 million, a 19% increase over last year's comparable balance. Moving on to profitability. In Q3, we continued to build on our great first half financial performance with strong top line results that helped to drive a third-quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 43%. We also reported record third-quarter EPS of $1.42, which increased 8% despite an $0.08 tax benefit in the prior year quarter related to entity restructuring activities.With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q3 was 21%. And for Q4, we expect our rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Our cash flow from operations grew 9% and totaled $120 million for the third quarter, and $360 million for the first nine months. And we closed Q3 with a total of $733 million in cash and short-term investments.Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We are pleased to, yet again, increase guidance for the full year, while also initiating our Q4 outlook. First, focusing on the existing business, we have increased our full year outlook to reflect the very strong performance in Q3, combined with positive business momentum and our ability to continue to execute and deliver on our commitments as we look ahead to close out 2019. Second, we've incorporated contributions to our full year guidance from the recent acquisitions of LSTC and Dynardo, deals that have both closed in the past week.This includes an incremental $10 million in revenue for 2019 as well as the impacts from both the use of the capital and the issuance of new debt and equity to fund the acquisitions. In connection with the acquisition of LSTC, we recently added $500 million in term debt at an initial interest rate of approximately 3% and we also issued 1.4 million shares. Before I get into the specific numbers, let me just provide a brief comment with respect to the impact of the ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China.Consistent with what we had previously communicated, our outlook for the remainder of 2019 takes into consideration our reduced expectations from China. We are also assuming that the current export restrictions and the entity list will remain in effect throughout the remainder of this year. Moreover, we remind investors that China accounted for less than 5% of our total revenue in 2018, and accounts for approximately 4% of our revenue in the first nine months of 2019. Now let me move to the details of our outlook.For Q4, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $454 million to $479 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $2.05. For the full year, we're increasing both revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.515 billion, or constant currency growth in the range of 16% to 18%, and EPS in the range of $6.20 to $6.38. We are also increasing our ACV outlook for 2019 to a range of $1.460 billion to $1.480 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 12% to 13%.With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are also increasing the midpoint of our outlook by $7.5 million for 2019 to a range of $485 million to $510 million. Looking ahead to Q4, we're expecting operating margins of 45% to 46.5%, and for the full year, we're increasing our forecast for annual operating margin to a range of 44.5% to 45%. Further details around specific currency rates and the other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q4 and 2019 are contained in the prepared remarks document. Just to close out on the topic of guidance, our outlook for the remainder of 2019 factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions, geopolitical situation and customers' sentiment across our geographically and industry-diverse customer base.It also reflects continued investment related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation projects, increased sales commissions and personnel-related cost as well as the financial impacts of the two most recent acquisitions. As we look ahead into 2020, I'd like to remind you that on our recent Investor Day, I shared our longer-term financial metrics in the form of an ACV target for 2022. Given the increased variability in revenue under ASC 606, due to the accounting treatment of multiyear leases, we provide ACV as a supplemental financial metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. Summed over the long term, ACV and revenue lead to the exact same number.However, it is important to note that there will be years where ACV growth lags revenue growth, as we will see in 2019, and the other years where ACV growth will lead revenue growth. Consistent with this dynamic, we will continue to encourage you to gauge the operating strength of ANSYS by focusing on our annual ACV performance in addition to our other key financial metrics. In line with our practice from the past few years, we will provide more detailed guidance on 2020 once we finalize our annual planning process and close out 2019. And in summary, we delivered another quarter of excellent financial performance with strength across our key financial metrics: ACV, topline growth, operating margins, EPS, operating cash flows and deferred revenue and backlog.The strong third quarter and year-to-date results give us confidence that we are on the path to deliver on our increased 2019 financial commitment as well as our longer-term 2022 financial targets. And operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maria, could you give us a sense for the inorganic contribution to ACV in 3Q? How are you thinking about 4Q? And how much of the ACV guide increase was organic versus inorganic? -- Yes. So with respect to Q3, the ACV was -- you had about 3%-4% of the quarterly growth was from the acquisitions. You saw we broke out relative to the two new acquisitions where for the remainder of 2019, we broke out separately in the prepared remarks. So with respect to their contributions, it's about $10 million from those two for the remainder of the year. -- And you're looking at it from a perspective of both revenue and ACV for the $10 million, or... -- Yes. -- OK. And maybe just as a quick follow-up on that. It looked like LSTC was more in the range of $60 million in terms of ACV. I would have thought the ACV portion in 4Q would be a bit higher than what we're recognizing... -- It's only two months. It's only two months. -- OK. Thank you.Our next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. -- This question is for Ajei. So we all get asked about the sustainability of this big deal momentum that you guys have been having. Any reason to think that the surge in activity these past 18 months would impact next year's pipeline and beyond? -- Thanks for the question. So as you -- as I said at the Investor Day, which we had in September, we have started to focus on these larger accounts or these so-called enterprise accounts. And we've increased the census of the number of those accounts from just a handful, a little over dozen, a couple of years ago to around 85 today. And as I mentioned during Investor Day, and I think I've walked through a case study of a particular customer, which shows how by focusing on that customer as we would with -- as we do with enterprise accounts.By focusing on the customer, we're able to deliver significantly incremental value to that customer based upon the capability and the full suite of our portfolio. And that translates into incremental growth opportunities. So for that particular customer that I walked through, we had had -- we had a modest growth for a number of years. And then as we started to focus a bit on the enterprise account, we grew ACV by about 10%.And in the first couple of years, it was an enterprise account. And then subsequently, we've grown ACV at about 17% CAGR over the couple of years afterwards. And there is significant opportunity ahead because in the case of that particular customer, there are opportunities of electrification in a number of other areas. And we're seeing this story being repeated across our enterprise account base by focusing.On the accounts, we can deliver incremental value to our customers and, of course, that translates to incremental growth. So that's the dynamic that you're really seeing taking place in our businesses as we look forward. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Maybe for you, Maria. This might be a tough -- excuse me, tough to break down because so much of what ANSYS does is multiphysics.But a couple of the big deals this year, I feel like they've been geared toward sort of a semi space or have been very electrical to heavy. So I guess I'm wondering if you could just talk about the general growth in the business maybe segmenting between the electrical portfolio versus all the other physics if that makes sense. -- It does, Saket, but what I'll say is we don't report on any individual physics family because that's not really the lens through which we view the opportunity. You've mentioned in your comment about multiphysics, and that's really the strength of the breadth and depth of our portfolio and how we think about our go-to-market opportunity. One data point I'll point you to is the comments that Ajei had in his prepared remarks is that if you think about the large deals in Q3, 80% of those deals included products from four or more major physics families. So we really are going to market and enabling our customers to solve incredibly complex problems because the problems are really multiphysics and no longer single physics-oriented.Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, let me start with you and ask how do you see any or all of your new businesses being leading indicators of or leading-edge drivers to new business? Meaning specifically Minerva for SPDM, Granta for materials, and even LS in the mechanical area. Do you see any or all of those, perhaps, becoming the good leading indicators of new business? And then second is just a follow-up on a comment you made regarding the channel business.It's quite interesting that proportionately it's staying the same in spite of your obvious focus on large deal business. So what have you done or what do you intend to do to sustain that momentum in SMB to continue to grow that business, particularly from a multiphysics perspective and not just a single solver perspective in the SMB market? -- So Jay, thank you for the questions. So if I just focus on the second one for a moment and talk about the channel, you're absolutely right, the channel has grown consistent with the direct business. And as you would imagine, the channel partners tend to -- given our go-to-market, some of them tend to be more transactional in nature, smaller deals in nature. Some of them, of course, a very strategic relationships with their customers.It really depends on the channel partners. And as Rick may have mentioned again during our Investor Day when we were talking about our go-to-market strategy, we continue to invest in the channel partners and we have continued to increase the number of channel partners as well as -- as far as our channel partners are seeing significant opportunity. So they themselves are increasing the number of people within individual partners who are selling our technology. So there's more feet on the street in the aggregate from the channel partners selling our technology, which typically ends up at a -- at some of these lower transaction levels.Furthermore, as you know our go-to-market is differentiated and so we have an opportunity to, yes, address the enterprise accounts, but with our momentum motion and our inside sales activity, we can address more of this volume business, more of the transactional business. And so we have -- our go-to-market and one of the hallmarks, as I said, of the business is the fact that we have this pretty sophisticated and well-developed go-to-market that allows us to address the needs of the largest customers as well as the more transactional business that we have discussed. And they're both very important to us and we continue to make sure that we are successful across both of those motions, which you saw in the CR and I made clear in my commentary. With respect to your first question with -- regarding the products, certainly some of the newer products that we have in the marketplace and perhaps some of the acquisitions, you're absolutely correct.Our strategy, as I have described, is to make simulation pervasive, which means we want to make the simulation capabilities, we want to inject them into multiple ecosystems, into multiple use cases. If you look at some of the work we have done with our platform, and in particular with the Minerva, that allows us to take the ANSYS simulation capabilities and to inject it into other phases of the product life cycle and to be -- and to drive the broader use of simulation and certainly our acquisition of Dynardo fits right into that. So that gives us access to more customers, help us solve more problems. Some of the acquisitions that we've been, you mentioned Granta.I think materials is a very important aspect of the end-to-end product equation. In many ways, materials has a life cycle unto itself that's very closely related -- it's almost a platform unto itself that's very closely related to our Minerva activities. But the materials gives customers a real understanding of where the true costs are and what the design implications are. And that exposes us to different levels in an organization in a customer as well to different sets of customers.You mentioned LSTC and I was pretty broad in my comments. I think in my script I went through this in some detail, but the fact is that the LSTC technology, because of the nature of the technology and because of our-go-to market, we had not been focusing on the core LSTC use cases that -- like, for example, automotive crash testing and now that LSTC and LS-DYNA is part of the ANSYS portfolio, we have an opportunity to position the breadth and the depth of LSTC across industries -- of LS-DYNA across multiple industries. And by putting our technologies together, we think we can solve -- we could help our customers really solve the most amazing problems and do so very efficiently. So we're excited about those acquisitions.They all fit with our strategy of Pervasive Simulation. They fit with our go-to-market and our go-to-market supports the acquisitions and then their relationships that these customers have had with their own channel partners, with their own customers further supports our go-to-market. So it's a mutually reinforcing outcome that we are excited about.Our next question comes from Matthew Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hey. guys. Thanks for taking my question. There's been a lot of consternation over the macro environment.But clearly, I think the breadth of your portfolio and global diversity was able to offset any of that weakness. In your prepared remarks, you talked about China. It seems like that's factored into your guidance, but I wanted to dig in a little bit more in the U.K., obviously, there's a lot of questions on Brexit. But in Germany, we had some really strong results.So maybe a little bit more on European results relative to sort of the year and what's factored into your outlook? -- Yes. And so as I said in the -- and I'll let Maria also jump in. But as I said, again, in my script, the second half of the year -- I mean Europe had a pretty decent Q3 from a sales activity perspective, and the second half of the year in Q4, we're expecting to see -- we have some of our larger deals in the pipeline. The revenue -- when you look at it from a revenue perspective because of the volatility of 606, you'll see some variations in revenue, which may not necessarily align exactly with sales activity.But to give you some perspective, as I said, we expect the second half of the year to be stronger in Europe and with some large deal activity. As I said, the Americans have been pretty strong throughout. Asia has been pretty strong. Maria, you want to add anything? -- Yes. And I think if you just look at the U.K., it's a comparable. So it is indicative of what you're going to see relative to some of the variability that ASC 606 introduces depending on the timing of when deals hit. So I would not read into the U.K.and as Ajei said, our plan all along, as we've been communicating since we first guided on 2019 back in -- earlier in the year is that the pipeline and the deal opportunities were really back-end loaded, and a lot of those are just aligned with the year-end planning and budgeting cycle of our large customers.Our next question comes from Jackson Ader with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.The first one is a follow-up to an earlier question on LS-DYNA. And, Ajei, you mentioned, so you weren't necessarily partnering with them, or in the use cases of their traditional crash and impact solvers. So can you just help us maybe understand if you were going to an automotive or an aero customer -- potential customer and say -- and look to sell kind of a broad-based deal, what would the conversation actually look like once you came to crash and impact? What was the workaround there previously? -- So thanks for the question. To make sure that you understand the context, our focus, as I said, from a go-to-market perspective, was not really on the automotive customers or the automotive crash testing. A lot of that activity was effectively taken by DYNA through some of their other channel partners. And we had -- the LSTC through their other channel partners.It wasn't really a focus of ANSYS. So that wasn't our primary business. And so in those areas, as you could imagine because we were -- we would partner, where we would work with the customer, they would take advantage of LSTC's technology, DYNA, perhaps working with another channel partner and that's how we would kind of need the customer. That's -- the automotive crash test use case wasn't really something that we were majoring in.That wasn't our focus and that wasn't where the ANSYS LSTC business was. And that obviously is an area of tremendous strength for them. And they come with not only amazing technology, but they also come with great relationships and customer relationships in that space.Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Co. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, based on your prepared remarks, it sounds like you're continuing to see really good demand from the auto industry, but I think a couple of your design software peers have called out at least selective weakness with some of their auto customers. Can you just give us an update on your view of your auto customers and your opportunity in the auto space? And your sense of how that's going to look over the next one to two years? -- We can't -- I can address it from the perspective of what we see in the marketplace. And perhaps I can -- and accept the context as I talk about, some of the conversations that we are having -- that I personally have had and certainly our salespeople are having with our customers in the automotive space. When you consider the aggregate of what the automotive customers are dealing with, with electrification. And by the way, electrification is not uniquely something that's being driven by automotive companies in and of themselves, there is also government regulations and other activities that are driving their desire to meet certain deadlines and dates and so forth.But if you consider electrification, you consider the opportunity with autonomy as just two examples. There is a profound change taking place and there is a significant level of investment that we are seeing, and interest that we're seeing in making sure that they can address these upcoming needs or these upcoming demands for their portfolio. In many cases, an activity, a focus on electrification might -- isn't about the battery, it's about a broader outcome because building an electric car requires different points of optimization than building an internal combustion engine car. The -- everything is different, or many things are different.And so there -- and that opens up incremental opportunities for us. So from our perspective, the fact that we have identified electrification, autonomy and we have compelling solutions in those areas in addition to the rest of our multiphysics solutions, we believe positions us very well. Those are growth areas. People are spending R&D dollars in those areas to be competitive in the future and we have technologies and solutions that addresses those customers.And so when I talk to automotive customers, the conversation often starts with electrification or autonomy. We may eventually get into other conversations of traditional -- that we've traditionally had with them about structural integrity or airflow and -- combustion and other areas, but certainly, we start with those areas and those -- we see those as continued areas of interest for the automotive companies.The next question comes from Steven R. Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. I appreciate the middle initial, too. Congratulations, ANSYS. Great quarter.I'm going to focus my question here on Maria. So maybe just some housekeeping first, Maria. Any changes in Q3 duration of contract length and billings terms, and any trends that you might be seeing there? I have a few companies that are seeing more annual billings and less multiyear? And then just also can you remind me what approach you're taking to the larger deals, particularly here in Q4? Are they probability weighted? And more generally, what are the puts and takes that you factored into the Q4 guide? Thank you very much. -- Yes. So with respect to durations, Steve, what I would say is we're not seeing any extension in duration. Just to give a couple of data points. At the end of Q3 if you look at deferred revenue, the current is about 5.2 months which is about the same as it was last year at this time.The long-term deferred is about 42 months. And to some of those larger deals that Ajei spoke to in his prepared remarks, those on average are two to three-year deals. So the larger enterprise deals and the strategic accounts, we're still seeing that they are choosing multiyear as opposed to annual. Annual, we are still seeing though in the momentum and the more traditional SMB space.And when we think about what are we bringing to Q4, obviously, we've got our pipeline. Rick and his team are very seasoned. And so some of them, they balance some of the risks around holidays and around how many people need to be involved in the approval process. And so we try our best given that the larger these deals get, if one slips to Q1 for whatever reason, it can have a significant impact under 606.So we try our best to factor in everything that we know about macro as well as individual deals that really could have an impact on the quarter and try to use the best judgment where we can when we're formulating our guidance. -- Thanks, Maria. Congrats again.Our next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Appreciate it.My question is for Ajei. Ajei, just around Discovery Live, I appreciated your comments relative to the PTC partnership, and I know Discovery Live is an important part of your goal to be more pervasive within large accounts. I just wanted to get a sense for the progress on Discovery Live and any early signs on penetration within some of the larger deals? Thanks. -- Thanks for the question, Rob. So again, I hate to go back to the investor day, but we had a pretty robust discussion about Discovery Live at investor day. That was about a month ago -- 1.5 months ago. So the dynamic remains the same.We are tremendously excited about the technology. Our customer is excited by the technology. We've got initial penetration into the enterprise accounts, and something like, I think, 20% of our enterprise accounts in terms of that initial penetration. And we continue to develop against an extremely aggressive road map.And we're -- the technology is moving in the right direction. We're excited about adoption. It's just very early in the cycle of the product. It's a brand-new product.It's creating category in a marketplace that's historically relatively conservative in terms of adoption of new technology. So as we've said repeatedly, it will take time for this product to develop. But all indications so far are positive, and we are excited about where we are in the marketplace with this essentially breakthrough technology.The next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi with Berenberg. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to switch gears into HPC. I think at the investor day, you mentioned you had 100 customers on Azure. And I was just wondering if you're thinking about opening that up to other hyperscalers? -- Thanks again for the question. Yes. So we have -- our technology is able to work across different cloud providers and we're not tied to any individual cloud provider. That being said, the ANSYS Cloud itself is running on Azure.But we have the capability to run on any cloud provider. -- Got it. And then maybe just a quick comment on PTC acquisition of Onshape. Does that mean anything in terms of your relationship with them on Creo? -- Well, I mean I think that -- firstly, I think it's -- Onshape is tremendous technology and capabilities from what we understand. Obviously, we're not in that space and we're not in that market, so I can't really -- I don't really have -- we don't have a formative opinion per se on technology. But from everything that we've seen, it's amazing technology. It's a great product and certainly as PTC absorbs this, I think they just closed the acquisition a few days ago.As they absorb this, we'll continue to have discussions and conversations with PTC about our relationship and how our relationship broadens to take into account whatever changes they may have made to the portfolio. But that being said, PTC has an aggressive road map with reoperate to Creo Simulation Live. They continue to see traction in the marketplace that we've talked about -- that I talked about that Jim Heppelmann has talked about in his calls. And they have a robust road map that includes the next generation of CSL.So, for example, I think in next year or March of 2020, they're going to expand to include CFD use cases from where they currently are and that obviously expands the applicability of Creo Simulation Live. So we're very excited about the relationship with PTC. We think that they're executing as they need to. And obviously, we'll continue to discuss with them as they start to absorb the terrific Onshape acquisition.The next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. I was hoping that you could just expand a little bit upon your commentary on seeing -- expecting strength here in Q4 in Europe? I think a lot of companies have called out kind of the opposite with some of the macro challenges, but is there a specific end market or vertical you're seeing the strength? I know you had a pretty large deal with a large automotive company over there last quarter. Are you kind of expecting the strength to continue from that market? Or is it more across the board? -- So we obviously -- my comments are based upon our understanding of our pipeline. So it's not a general comment about macro conditions. It's very specifically about our pipeline. So perhaps our pipelines are different from other vendors' pipelines, and that might account for the differences that you're pointing out.That's point number one. With respect to your second question about, is there any particular area? Again, my expectation is that we will see next quarter along the lines of where we've seen the past in terms of the split across industry verticals. So we're not seeing a particular vertical change dramatically. And it's highly unlikely that these changes are going to happen month-over-month as we look at the end of Q3 to the early part of Q4.As you can imagine, many of these customers who are in our pipeline for Q4 have been in our pipeline for some period of time. These are not new deals that come into the pipeline in Q4 and close in Q4, especially these larger deals. And so we have pretty good visibility and a finger on the pulse of some of those deals. We're not expecting any profound change in the industry verticals as we look forward to Q4.Our next question comes from Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Good morning. Congratulations on the nice job in the quarter. Ajei, question on Dynardo.I was wondering if you could just provide a couple of real-world examples of how you expect customers to use this solution? -- Mark, thanks so much for the question. So as I said, Dynardo is a process integration and an optimization tool. And their flagship product is something called optiSLang, which is essentially a design optimization solution. And so the idea is, as a designer, you can provide -- you can try to solve for a multi-objective optimization problem.So you can establish a set of boundary conditions and use cases, and you can use Dynardo to drive simulation to get to an optimal point where you're trying to get to with sensitivity, reliability, design capabilities and so forth. So you can drive that optimization. And you can use optiSLang to be able to change these simulation flows so you can automate the design space exploration. So effectively, what it's allowing you to do is very rapidly chain together different elements -- different simulation elements, solve for a point of optimization that you're trying to get to in an automotive way.And that allows you to reduce development time and, of course, it can accelerate product design. So that's the nature of the technology and engineers will use it to try to rapidly get to a conclusion that they are trying to drive, but it drives an enormous amount of simulation and it triggers off an enormous amount of simulation in order to get to that design point.Our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead. -- Great. And thanks for taking the questions. I just had two quick ones. First, it's great to see continued momentum with -- you called out three eight-figure deals.Any way to quantify the type of uplift you're seeing in total contract value of these deals versus these deals previously? And secondly, just on the Motor-CAD OEM relationship. Really interesting. What led you to look to OEM CAD software around electric motor design? And are there other areas to OEM, other types of CAD software as well? Thanks so much. -- Yes. So with respect to your first question -- yes, relative to the largest accounts, I would say double-digit growth, absolutely, especially as we expand our footprint across more users and more applications. And with respect to the OEMs, we've been OEM-ing and partnering not just with CAD players but with many other technology companies throughout our history. As you heard, LSTC, as an example, has been a partner for ours for 25 years, and we've got others.And the Motor-CAD design opportunity was just one that -- where we've got a use case scenario with common customers, and it made sense for them to be able to leverage their technology and our global go-to-market -- Yes. And just to amplify what Maria said, I mean -- with Motor-CAD, that technology helps us in the electrification space. And we talked about electrification as being one of the important growth drivers. And they've developed upfront design capabilities that are in the area of electric machines.And that integrated with our technology will really allow these electric machine designers to rapidly -- to be able to build -- to build electric motors and machines quickly. So to give you an example, they can do things like fast thermal analysis from their front end. So it's a more -- it's a pretty sophisticated technology. It couples electromagnetic thermal mechanical modeling capabilities.It's really designed for the rapid design and deployment of electric machines across these different operating conditions. And what we can do is dovetail our technology really nicely in with what they have, so our customers can benefit from a more streamlined electric machine workflow.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. -- Thank you, operator. So our strategy, which is to make simulation pervasive, is working as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit revenue and ACV growth, combined with best-in-class margins and continued strength across the business. That, coupled with the exciting opportunity to unite the incredible technology, talent and customer relationships of LSTC and Dynardo with our global description platform and resilient business model, gives us confidence for the future. Our continued focus on execution, our investment in the business, and a healthy sales pipeline, provide a solid foundation for us to deliver another year of record financial performance.And they set the stage for us to execute against our recently announced 2022 financial targets. I want to thank my ANSYS colleagues from around the world for, once again, delivering these outstanding results. And with that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and please enjoy the rest of your day.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

With the increasing penetration of  in manufacturing and the explosion of the  (IIoT), the already well-established robotics sector is entering a new round of long-term growth that should propel many of the companies involved even higher.Let's take a look at how an investor might go about getting some exposure to robotics and automation stocks and what these companies -- some of which you might be surprised to see mentioned -- actually do.Image source: Getty Images.The robotics and automation industries have some peculiarities about them that we should note right from the start.First, spending in the industry tends to be driven by what the business community calls expansionary or growth , which is distinct from maintenance capital spending. In other words, when the economy is doing well and manufacturing companies are growing sales strongly, they tend to think about expanding their plants or adopting new technologies in them -- this is expansionary or growth capital spending. Maintenance capital spending is simply what companies must spend in order to continue existing levels of production. So even if the long-term trend toward spending on robotics automation is upward, investors are going to have to tolerate some ups and downs, because economies tend to have ups and downs too.Second, robotics is really a subset of industrial automation, and in most cases, it's almost impossible to separate robotics from industrial automation in terms of investment. This means that it's highly unlikely that a company with broad-based exposure to industrial automation will be able to avoid a slowdown in the economy -- even if its robotics sales are growing.To bring these points together, let's look at leading U.S. industrial automation company 's  sales pattern in the 2014-2019 period. As you can see in the chart below, sales growth turned sharply negative in the 2015-2016 period due to the slump in commodity prices caused by a collapse in oil and gas, mining, and heavy industries spending. It recovered in the following years but then fell back most recently due to a combination of a slowing overall economy, specific cyclical weakness among automotive and semiconductor companies, and fears over the U.S.-China trade conflict.Data source: Rockwell Automation presentations.Long-term investors in the industry will simply accept that there will be ups and downs along the way, but the underlying  will remain strong.The third point is that Asia (and China in particular) is the driving force behind the demand for robotics and automation. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) sees the supply of robots quadrupling over the 10 years that followed the last yearly drop in worldwide supply back in 2012.Data source: International Federation of Robotics.Chinese companies purchase roughly 37% of the units sold around the world, and the rest of Asia (including Japan) buys about 33%. Europe's share of automation units purchased comes in at around 18%, and the Americas (mostly the U.S.) roughly make up the remaining 12% share. And the demand for units is only expected to grow in China, as the IFR says the country's robot density -- defined as the number of robots installed per employee -- is still low compared to that in other major industrialized countries. In other words, look to China to drive growth for robotics and industrial automation in the future.Data source: IFR World Robotics 2018.On a related note, the traditional early adopters of automation/robotics, such as the automotive and electrical and electronics manufacturing industries, are set to lead volume growth in the near future. This is important to consider, because if these two industries turn down aggressively -- as they did in 2019 -- then robotics automation companies can suffer falling sales.All told, if you are investing in the robotics industry, you must be aware of the cyclicality of the industry, its outsized connection to China, and the fact that buying into the robotics sector will almost certainly involve exposure to industrial automation at large.When researching robotics stocks, it will help to understand that there are four distinct groups to consider. They are:Let's take a more detailed look at each of the four groups and include some specific stocks as part of that discussion.So what is the difference between a robot and a piece of factory automation equipment? The IFR uses the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) definition to explain that a robot is \"an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which can be fixed in place or mobile in industrial automation applications.\"The robot definition makes it pretty clear that robotics is actually a subset of factory automation. For reference, automation is usually prominent in two main markets. One is factory or discrete automation (think\u00a0of a bottling plant or of an assembly line of robots putting together a car), and the other is process automation, which is the automated control of raw materials (think of oil and gas refining or chemicals processing).So companies like , , , and  that say they are robotics companies are also factory automation companies. As you can see below, ABB is the only company to be a major player in all three markets, but Germany's  is also a major player in factory and process automation. Japan's Fanuc and Kuka (a German company now majority owned by China's Midea) are also active in robotics and factory automation.Data source: . *Major means controls at least 10% of the market. Minor means the company controls 2% or less of the market. Yes indicates the market share is 2% to 10%.As noted earlier, the U.S. is a smaller market for robotics than Asia and even Europe. So it makes sense that more leading robotics and factory automation companies traded on U.S. markets are European (Kuka, ABB, Siemens, and Schneider) and Japanese (Yaskawa, Fanuc, and Mitsubishi). The only significant U.S.-based factory automation companies are Rockwell and Emerson Electric. Emerson tried to create a U.S. automation champion in 2018 by launching a  of Rockwell that ultimately failed.Look out for cyclicality in all these businesses. It's reasonable to expect faster growth from the robotics sector, but factory automation, in general, will oscillate in line with the economy. And capital spending in process automation is somewhat guided by trends in commodity prices., but it has a significant amount of restructuring ahead of it.  that tends to pay a , but its industrial automation operations only make up a portion of a much larger and diversified organization. Rockwell is probably the best way for U.S. investors to get long-term direct exposure to industrial automation. As the Emerson Electric takeover bid demonstrates, Rockwell is a strategically attractive company for others looking to get exposure to the U.S. industrial automation market.Until now, we've been discussing very large companies working to develop wholesale solutions for the robotics and automation markets. But what about some of the smaller companies that specialize in just a segment? These companies focus on improving certain aspects of robotics and industrial automation by developing and marketing things like vision systems, digital sensors, motion-control sensors, and video compression. If robots are going to take the place of human activity in the manufacturing process, the machines will have to behave more like humans. Part of that is being able to see and define images better in order to monitor and control automated processes.Data source: Author research.Cognex's machine vision systems are a good example for this sector. The company's largest customer is , and its biggest end markets are automotive and consumer electronics. For example, its solutions help to guide and monitor robots on a car production line and also help smartphone manufacturers to precisely align the manufacturing of display panels. Cognex's management believes it can grow its factory automation-based revenue by 20% a year over the long term. But it's not going to be 20% a year every year, because its end markets can have ups and downs from year to year.In addition to its factory automation end markets,  with its machine vision systems for e-fulfillment warehousing. E-commerce sales continue to grow at a mid-teens rate in the U.S., and there's a need to expand warehouse space in order to meet the demand for e-commerce deliveries. It's an exciting end market, and Cognex believes it can grow its logistics sales by 50% a year in the near term.The need for better robotic vision and detection is a byproduct of the growth in automation. Likewise, the growing adoption of smart sensors and actuators to improve manufacturing processes means more data will have to be captured and analyzed. This virtuous cycle of productivity requirements and subsequent advancements will help the companies in this sector continue to benefit.Before we go any further, it would help to provide a bit more explanation of what the Industrial Internet of Things is and how it relates to this sector. The IIoT is simply the process whereby web-enabled sensors are used to create data and information that will help companies better manage physical assets. An example could be the use of sensors on a gas turbine in order to predict when it will need servicing.Arguably the most exciting growth area among the four sectors, the growing penetration of IIoT software tools and digitization is changing how manufacturing companies manage their devices. Naturally, this is highly relevant to robotics, because as processes become automated, more and more data can be captured and utilized.Image source: Getty Images.As such, manufacturers are even more eager to robotize production, because IIoT and industrial software applications are enhancing the value of an investment in robots and automation. In a nutshell, . Indeed, all leading automation companies have their own industrial software solutions or partnerships with other leading companies. For example, Siemens and Rockwell Automation dominate the market for programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and Siemens has its own product lifecycle management (PLM) software, while ABB partners with   and Rockwell with  . (PLM is software used to design products and physical assets and then manage them as they are used.)Meanwhile, software companies, such as PTC, Dassault, and  , offer solutions that help manage automation assets better, including the exciting world of . In digital twinning, a physical asset is replicated digitally and then different simulations are run in order generate comparative information that is analyzed and used to run the physical asset better.In a sense, all these software companies have a symbiotic relationship with robotics, and the two often end up being mutually beneficial. Increases in software applications and IIoT adoption will make automation and robotics investments more cost effective, and companies buying more robots will encourage more software development.Alongside PLM, other software solution providers such as   help companies optimize asset performance. An example is the need to reduce downtime on machinery in a heavy-duty industry like pulp and paper. Aspen's software helps pulp and paper companies monitor the performance of motors and drives in the manufacturing process. As investment in smart automation increases, companies like Aspen are going to see more growth opportunity ahead.There is a growing subset of companies using smart automation and robotics in order to enhance or develop new solutions for customers. Investors will probably know about companies like   or even   and its groundbreaking da Vinci robotic surgical system. In fact,  has been so impressive that medical device company   is muscling in on the market and .Image source: Getty Images.Also, so-called old-economy stocks like agricultural equipment manufacturer   are benefiting from the strong . Using Deere's onboard telematics, computers, and hardware solutions, farmers can better manage their operations by getting digital assistance to guide and steer equipment. In fact, Deere even sells robotic lawnmowers.Meanwhile,   makes automated guiding vehicles used in industries as diverse as materials handling, subsea engineering technologies used in offshore energy (wind power and oil and gas), and vehicles used in space.   makes unmanned aircraft systems and drones for the defense and satellite industries.   makes robotics and handling solutions for the life sciences and semiconductor industries.Another area in which robots are adding significant value is in warehouse automation -- a high-growth area given the huge expansion of e-commerce and .   purchase of material handling company Intelligrated has been a huge success, and as noted previously, Cognex believes it can grow its logistics-based revenue at a 50% rate in the near future.Honeywell's Intelligrated is a solution provider (materials handling, sorters, and conveyors) to   and its . In fact, Amazon's investment in robotics extends to buying a robotic technology company -- Kiva Systems (now called Amazon Robotics) -- for $775 million in 2012 in order to use its technology in house. Moreover, in 2019, Amazon bought Canvas Technology, a robotics start-up building autonomous carts for warehouses.Two other stocks that benefit from automation in the warehouse are Germany's  , a manufacturer of forklifts and warehouse equipment and owner of Intelligrated's rival warehouse robotics company Dematic.  Another interesting company in the sector is  . The company makes mobile computers, scanners, and barcode printers, which will be needed to support companies investing in robotic automation in logistics. While robots will perform repetitive tasks, there will still be a need for humans to work alongside robots in smart automation centers.Another way to invest in the sector is via a , or , such as the  . The robotics ETF will tend to own most, if not all, of the robotic automation stocks discussed here, and it's a good way to gain exposure to the sector for investors looking to avoid the process of picking out the best stocks individually.Putting all of this together, it's clear that the structural drivers behind robotics companies are very strong. A combination of rising labor costs in emerging markets, the growing adoption of IIoT in manufacturing, and relatively low levels of robots used in China all point to a significant runway of growth for companies working in emerging markets.Meanwhile, in developed markets, the need to improve productivity, particularly in light of slowing GDP growth, will drive investment in robotics and automation. Moreover, the opportunity to fully benefit from the IIoT revolution will also make automation investment a compelling proposition.That said, investors in the industry will have to be able to ride out the ups and downs of the business cycle, particularly as capital spending reflects efforts to expand rather than just maintain the respective businesses. And investors should remember that two industries -- automotive and electronics/electrical -- still dominate the immediate prospects for the industry.The underlying secular growth driving the industry makes it a good place for the long-term investor.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks.Ajei?  -- Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another record something quarter for ANSYS. We surpassed the high end of our guidance in revenue as well as earnings per share, setting new Q2 records in each category. Our ACV growth was excellent, coming in at mid-teens for the quarter in constant currency.Based on our outstanding financial performance and the strength of our pipeline, I'm excited to announce that we're raising our 2019 revenue, EPS and ACV guidance for the second time this year. Maria will provide the details shortly. Our success over the past several quarters is due to a number of factors including our strategy of making simulations pervasive across the product life cycle. That strategy is driving more simulation, and therefore, larger deals.We're operating across two vectors to increase the size of our deals: First, by enabling deeper penetration of a single physics through new use cases and users; and second, cross-selling our broad multiphysics portfolio to help customers address modern product challenges. Let me give you an example of the first vector. In Q2, we closed a $49 million deal, the third largest in our history, with a South Korean high-tech leader. This, the largest single-physics deal in our history, demonstrates that we can significantly increase the size of our transactions with the power of our gold standard solutions.Moving to the second vector. As products become more complex, companies are increasingly addressing product challenges that involve multiple physics. That creates significant opportunities across our market-leading multiphysics portfolio. In Q2, we closed a large multiphysics deal with a U.S.Department of Defense prime contractor. In addition to our flagship physics solutions, our materials intelligence solutions from this year's Granta Design acquisition, coupled with the additive manufacturing applications built on the foundation from the 3DSIM acquisition, were key considerations in the deal to help them modernize their workforce and accelerate the development of complex systems. This is just one of many examples that demonstrates our technology leadership and the broad moat that separates us from our competitors. On the partnership side, I was excited to discuss our alliance with SAP and the value that we are jointly bringing to customers during a presentation at SAP's Sapphire Now conference.During the conference, we heard how SAP's Predictive Engineering Insights Enabled by ANSYS has helped a customer to streamline its order time line from months to days. SAP representatives also joined me during June's Paris Air Show where we showcased the benefits of digital twin technology with leaders from the aerospace and defense industry. Our partnership with PTC where ANSYS Discovery Live has been embedded into PTC's new Creo Simulation Live is also gaining momentum. During its most recent , PTC reported that it has closed 76 transactions with an average deal size above the previous quarter's level.Our two companies collaborated at the defense contractor I mentioned earlier resulting in PTC landing the largest ever Creo Simulation Live deal and the ANSYS team closing a substantial Discovery Live order. That contractor is noteworthy because it intends to deploy both Creo Simulation Live and ANSYS Discovery Live to potentially thousands of users across multiple business units. That demonstrates the opportunity for Discovery Live at some of the largest enterprises where it complements traditional simulation and CAD offerings and drives even more value for users. Staying with Discovery Live for a moment, I'm excited that this new product continues to garner accolades from the market as well as the media.The most recent recognition was from Fast Company which in its September issued name ANSYS as one of the 50 best workplaces for innovators for our development of this groundbreaking product. In past earnings calls, I've highlighted specific products or solution areas in the ANSYS portfolio. For example, during our Q1 call, I spoke about how our gold standard solutions like ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RedHawk are driving success in their respective markets. In Q2, I'd like to highlight the ANSYS solutions that are making autonomous vehicles a reality.With an estimated $7 trillion impact on the global economy by 2050, the financial implications of autonomous vehicles are considerable and will dramatically impact OEMs and the entire supply chain. Given the sophistication, complexity and safety critical nature of these products, it is clear that they cannot be developed without the extensive use of simulation. As a result, we are seeing increased interest from automotive OEMs, A&D companies and their entire supply chains to make these next-generation vehicles a reality. And while there may be speculation around the timing of when truly autonomous vehicles will take to our roads and airways, the simulation work around autonomy is paying dividends in the form of ongoing improvements in vehicle safety, features and efficiency.ANSYS' best-in-class multiphysics products, coupled with leading technologies that we've obtained through our recent acquisitions including medini and OPTIS are enabling automakers and aircraft manufacturers to virtually test their products to ensure safety and reliability for these future transportation systems. In Q2, we announced a landmark deal with automotive leader, BMW, to create what we believe to be the industry's first holistic simulation toolchain for developing autonomous vehicle technologies. The toolchain will optimize valuable test data by providing a development framework around rigorous safety planning, efficient test-based exploration and data analytics in a virtual driving environment. Using this solution, the company expects to launch its highly automated BMW iNEXT in 2021.As part of this agreement, ANSYS will also assume exclusive rights to the BMW-developed portion of this toolchain for commercialization to the wider market. Autonomy will affect multiple industries including automotive and aerospace and defense. In Q2, we also announced an agreement with Airbus Defence and Space which will use ANSYS SCADE solutions to enable safety critical controls with sophisticated artificial intelligence with the goal of fully autonomous flight by 2030. Airbus plans to use our solutions to link traditional model-based software development with new AI-based workflows.Their goal is to drive the development and certification of drone flight control software to accelerate time-to-market and cut associated expenses. We further expanded our product leadership in the simulation of anonymous systems with the Q2 release of ANSYS 2019 R2. In R2, we've expanded the capabilities of our VRXPERIENCE driving simulator to prepare advanced scenarios and run simulations with complete and accurate multibody vehicle dynamics. This innovation is already being used by automotive leader, Renault, to reduce physical testing, shorten time to market and ensure safety for its autonomous vehicle initiatives.R2 also dramatically enhances capabilities crucial to the design and analysis of radar use in autonomous vehicles. Our new innovation around accelerated Doppler processing provides more than 100x speed-up for the time it takes to simulate radar systems. This new breakthrough capability delivers gold standard accuracy and enhances collaboration between radar sensor designers and the OEMs that incorporate the sensors on vehicles. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to fundamentally reshape the way we think about safety, mobility, land use and our environment.With our powerful multiphysics solutions and partnerships, I am excited that ANSYS is well positioned strategically and can play a role in making the dream of autonomous vehicles a reality. This represents a significant long-term market opportunity for ANSYS. Switching gears, I'd like to welcome Lynn Ledwith as our vice president of marketing. Lynn has more than 30 years of experience and brings an outstanding track record across digital and field marketing as well as corporate branding.She has held marketing leadership positions at Worldwide Clinical Trials, Qlik Technologies, Sungard, Siemens and HP, among others. Lynn brings a fresh approach to how we market that will open new avenues to build demand and to branding. In summary, I'm proud of what we've accomplished in Q2. Our excellent financial performance, coupled with the increased functionality of our gold standard solutions and our ability to help customers take advantage of megatrends like autonomy, electrification, 5G, IoT and others, give us confidence in our ability to achieve our goals for the remainder of 2019 and beyond.And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria? -- Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Ajei shared a few highlights from our Q2 results and now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our very strong second-quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 and the remainder of 2019. Consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.Our record Q2 results reflect continued strong customer and business momentum combined with solid execution across the business. We finished the quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 23% and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. The revenue performance in Q2 was driven by strong sales execution including a larger dollar value of multi-year lease transactions and the closing of a few deals that were originally forecasted to close in the second half of the year. The combination of our strong second quarter and first half results, which have been driven by success, most notably in high tech, automotive and A&D and the strength of our pipeline, gives us confidence that we are on a path to continue to make progress against our strategic priorities and to deliver another year of record financial performance in 2019.Key financial metrics for the quarter begin with Q2 ACV of $326 million or constant currency growth of 14% and total revenue of $370.5 million. Key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our Q2 guidance. The increase in software lease license sales, combined with strong maintenance renewals, contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q2 total of $717 million, a 22% increase over last year's comparable balance and a new record Q2 high. The exceptionally strong top-line results helped to drive a second-quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 46%.We also experienced a slightly slower pace of hiring than we had planned for the quarter. That being said, we did increase our employee base by approximately 100 employees in Q2. It's our intention to continue to execute on our hiring plans throughout the second half of the year. We reported record second-quarter EPS of $1.61 benefiting from the revenue overperformance and representing growth of 19% over Q2 of 2018.With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19%, which was slightly below the range that we had guided coming into the quarter. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% for Q3 and 20% to 20 and a half percent for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $89 million for the quarter and $240 million for the first half, and we closed Q2 with a total of $632 million in cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 80,000 shares during the quarter, which leaves us with 3.5 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program.Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Coming off our exceptionally strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for the third quarter and increasing our revenue, earnings and ACV outlook for 2019. Before I get into specific numbers, let me just provide a few comments with respect to the impact of the ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China.I'd like to remind everyone that in 2018, our China business accounted for less than 5% of our total annual revenue and point out that our increased outlook for 2019 does take into consideration our reduced expectations from China. Now let me move to the details of our outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $320 million to $340 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.15 to $1.28. For the full year, we're increasing our outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.46 billion to $1.5 billion or constant currency growth in the range of 14% to 17% or 15% at the midpoint and EPS in the range of $5.98 to $6.28.We are also increasing our ACV outlook for 2019 to a range of $1.44 billion to $1.475 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 10% to 13%. Our outlook for the remainder of 2019 factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions, political situations and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry-diverse customer base. It also reflects additional spending in the second half related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation projects, increased sales commissions and hiring costs that were delayed from the first half hiring shortfall.With respect to annual operating cash flow, currently, we are maintaining our outlook for 2019 in the range of $470 million to $510 million. I would like to remind everyone that our outlook for operating cash flow in 2019 includes higher tax payments that relate to the acceleration of lease license revenue and the related profitability under ASC 606 including additional tax payments relating to the strong Q4 finish in 2018 and the first-year impact of the acquisitions that we closed earlier this year. Looking ahead to Q3, we're expecting operating margins of 39% to 40%, and for the full year, we're expecting a slight uptick in operating margins in the range of 43 and a half to 44 and a half percent. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2019 are contained in the prepared remarks document.The key takeaway from our Q2 and first half results is that our strategy to make simulation pervasive is working as evidenced by double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines and strength across the business. Part of our confidence behind raising our guidance for the remainder of the year is based upon the continued momentum that we see from our diverse customer base. We believe that the megatrends that Ajei mentioned, along with industrywide recognition that simulation can drive a competitive advantage for our customers, are bolstering demand for our products and services. We remain confident that our continued focus on execution and investing in the business, combined with the ongoing growth in our recurring business, our strong customer relationships and healthy sales pipeline, provide a solid foundation to continue to deliver on our 2019 goals as well as our longer-term 2020 financial targets.Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.[Operator instructions] And our first question today comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks all for taking my question guys and another great quater. On the topic of China, could you tell us whether or not you guys saw any immediate impact in Q2? And then as we look ahead, you mentioned it was in guide -- you guys have factored in some conservatism in guide. Any chance you guys can help quantify what that headwind is? And as far as kind of recent headlines, obviously the currency headlines right now, was that also already considered in the outlook? -- Yeah. So Ken, I'll take that. Yes, we did see a little bit of positive impact from the China situation in Q2, which helped to drive some of the overperformance in revenue. That being said, it wasn't material to the quarter.We have factored in a reduction in our expectations from the China business in the second half, I would say somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range. And yes, the -- what transpired relative to currency is all factored into the outlook that we gave last evening in our earnings announcement. -- Got it. And then maybe a follow-up for Ajei. You mentioned the large single-physics deal, the $49 million multi-year deal. When you think about kind of similar type transactions in the past, is there an opportunity to turn this into a multiphysics type of a transaction? And typically, what kind of uplift could something like that deliver in terms of future results? -- Yeah. There's always an opportunity for us to convert single-physics deals into multiphysics deals. Obviously, some of it depends on the use cases, so I'm speaking in generalities, but it depends on the use cases the customers are -- have for their specific application. But I said, in general, as I said on the call, we're trying to expand deal sizes not only by focusing on single physics, as is the case with this one, but we're also trying to drive the multiphysics cross-sell across the organization.And those two work together. So even as we deepen single physics, we're continuing to look at broadening the multiphysics. And even in an organization which has a multiphysics sale, there's opportunities to deepen individual physics. So they're both working kind of work in parallel with each other.But absolutely, it's the basis of our ability to drive larger deals.And our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, two questions for you. You noted the strength in high tech, which is quite evident, and you've also seen momentum in aero and auto, but you do seem to be -- see not quite the same growth in industrial equipment for the last couple of quarters or more.Perhaps you can talk about that end market and what your thinking is for the intermediate term in terms of the industrial market showing some improved momentum, that's the shorter-term question. Long-term question, at the design automation conference two months ago in Las Vegas, the ANSYS management including your new CTO gave a very interesting presentation on ANSYS long-term technology vision and there were references, for example, to things like new computational methods in new business areas, collaboration in cloud, services-based architecture including interestingly, at least for me, SPDM services. So the question is with regard to that technology vision, how is that today informing your internal investments in R&D and perhaps even in sales and marketing to effectuate that longer-term vision? -- So let me start with the second question first. As you know, we at ANSYS pride ourselves on the nature of our technology, the accuracy of our solutions and the effectiveness that we have in bringing new ideas and new technologies and new techniques to market, and we continue to make investments. And obviously, Jay, what you're referring to and what you saw is a glimpse into some of the work that we're doing within our organization to continue to drive innovation. You mentioned the cloud.Obviously, we're continuing to make investments in the cloud. We continue to drive product -- product capabilities in the cloud. We have most recently an announcement, I think, a couple of quarters ago for ANSYS Cloud, which is obviously driving -- which is driving cloud usage as well as, of course, HPC usage within the traditional data center. We've talked about investments that we're making in computational techniques that result in faster speed-up of our algorithms.We continue to make investments. In fact, I referred to one of those investments where we were able to get 100x speed-up in some of our capabilities in my script. So I think that there is a significant amount of investments that we're making in a different set of vectors. You mentioned, component type architectures, and that obviously reflects the next generation as we invest in our platform activity.We have an industry-leading platform in the form of ANSYS Workbench and we continue to make investments in that technology as well. So there's a number of different investments we're making in machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, all of which we think support our business and make us most successful. So that's obviously the case and you're seeing some of that and I'm glad you were able to see that presentation. As far as the industry verticals are concerned, what I'm excited about, of course, is the growth that we're seeing in the high-tech markets, aerospace and defense and automotive.And all of these areas are driving business. There's a significant level of industry focus on those areas, and frankly, those constitute tailwinds that are driving the growth of our business, and we're excited about the activity that's taking place and the activity that's taking place really permeates the entire supply chain. And in many cases, as you know, when we think about the end markets, we refer to customers where they belong even though from -- an electronics company might be supplying other companies elsewhere in the supply chain as well. So I hope that answers your question.And our next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get some additional detail on how you're driving deeper penetration with single-physics products within your customer base. And I guess I'm trying to understand, are you gaining additional business units? Are you getting new types of engineers to use ANSYS? Or are there competitive displacements? Some additional detail there would be helpful.Thanks. -- So usually, what happens is, firstly, there are obviously two vectors. One is there are more users using the technology and there's more usage of that technology, and that might be in more use cases. That may be in more complex products that require greater amounts of simulation. Our sales teams engage with the customers.We try to understand the nature of the technologies -- of the nature of the problems that they're trying to solve and we are obviously effective in positioning simulation as a way of being able to address some of the challenges. And so as they take on more and more different products, in some cases across different departments, across different parts of their organization, the success that we're enjoying in one part of the organization starts to become infectious across that organization. And so I think that that's one important dimension. The other thing to realize is as products become more complex, the amount of simulation required to validate or to effectively launch those products increases and that requires more simulation to be run.So that's greater use of HPC, high-performance computing, and that translates obviously into ultimately more business for ANSYS. And so it's more users, it's more use cases, it's more HPC, all of which drive the use within a single physics. And then, of course, as I've said before, problems tend to be multiphysics in nature especially for larger companies that are looking at systems and broader products, and in that case, we're able to then leverage a single-physics into a multiphysics sale. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question.And our next question comes from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling this morning. If we could just touch -- maybe going back to the streets, if we take autonomous driving out of the automotive sector, how does the maybe traditional simulation in the automotive space, particularly in the U.S., look in the first half of '19 and then for the second half? -- So if -- when we think about the automotive industry, the two broad trends I would say, that are perhaps addressing and changing the way that the automotive industry thinks, the first is electrification and the use of electric power to drive these cars. And the second is autonomy and the use of -- and the creation of safer and smarter cars leading ultimately to autonomous cars. And both of those are massive -- there's massive levels of investments in both of those areas. And if you have a conversation with an automotive company, those two areas tend to be huge areas where they're spending money, they're retooling, they are trying to make sure that they can stay ahead as the industry goes through this transition.So those remain big. But at the same time, car companies are building cars. So they're still worried about the fundamentals that they've worried about for many years, which include how do you deal with structural analysis and integrity. But to give you one example, the problems of structures and vibration analysis and noise is an area that we've been in for a number of years.We've helped customers solve that problem. Well, when you move to an electric car, that problem becomes even more pronounced. And so what might have been OK with an internal combustion engine, which was drowning out the noise in a car, is no longer OK when you're dealing with an electric car which might be much quieter. So the problems that they're dealing with and they're trying to solve in some cases are even more complex because of this new technology.And so absolutely, we see an ongoing demand for simulation to be used not only where it's historically been used, but also for these incremental new use cases like electrification and autonomy. The other thing that I would draw attention to is materials. I mean companies are starting to look at the use of different materials, and understanding the role of materials and the nature of the interaction between the material they use and the outcome that they get, that's also important. And of course, that's why some of the acquisitions and technology that we got through Granta come in to play a role.So when I think about the automotive industry, every single one of our technologies and techniques, whether it was original ANSYS Mechanical, which was the heritage and the foundation of the company to the most recent acquired technologies that we have, are all relevant for the automotive industry and are solving problems that are absolutely pertinent and center to them being successful as they go forward in the industry. -- OK. Great. Thank you for the thorough answer. One quick follow-up for you, Maria, just on the cash flow.I think we want to make sure we're clear. So are these large lease deals that you signed in the first half or particularly in the second half, are they leading to larger tax payments than you previously contemplated and that's why the operating cash flow guidance has remained unchanged? -- No. So just to be clear, that deal was actually in our forecast. It wasn't an outlier. But that being said, as we begin to articulate in Q1, that under 606, no doubt, the tax payments have increased.So as a result, the combination of the increase in tax payments under 606 as well as about a 2% headwind for the full year and the dilutive impact on cash flows from the acquisitions that we did earlier in the year all lead to us deciding that it's probably prudent not to take up the cash flow guidance until we get a sense of the timing around closing of those larger deals in the second half to see whether or not they will impact 2019 cash flows or move into Q1 of 2020.And our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how you're thinking about organic ACV growth for the remainder of the year? -- Yeah. I would say the impact -- the inorganic impact of the acquisitions that we did this year are about 3%. So the remainder is all organic. -- OK. Great. And then, Ajei, it sounds like R2 offers a more integrated workflow than available before. Could you discuss where you are more broadly in terms of technical integration for both your existing products and recent acquisitions? -- Well, as you know, we have had a strategy for a number of years that we've been executing against to integrate our products together through the ANSYS Workbench, and that continues to be the strategy. It was a very innovative solution that make -- that made simulation dramatically easier and it gave us a framework and a mechanism, which new technologies could be integrated together. And frankly, our strategy continues to be to drive that level of platform integration both through Workbench. And as I said earlier, we continue to invest in our ongoing platform work to component size the platform, to make it easier for people to drive that level of integration because we believe an open strategy here is in the best interests of ANSYS and our customers.So we define APIs. We allow third parties to integrate in. We certainly integrate our technologies together when we define workflows, and we continue to do that. And that's part of the strategy that we have had for a number of years.Of course, we continue to increase our level of investment in that. When you think about some of these next-generation challenges that we're addressing with our customers, I mentioned electrification, I mentioned autonomy, 5G, etc. These are also intrinsically multiphysics solutions, which require an integrated workflow and we're able to position and provide those to our customers as well based on the integration work we've done across our products.And our next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. -- Perfect. Thank you very much. Hi ANSYS, congratulations on a great quarter. -- Thank you. -- I got one for Maria and a follow-up for Ajei, if you don't mind as well. So for Maria, we've been hearing from some other companies about maybe selected weakness in certain countries maybe toward the end of the quarter and some sort of kind of nonlinearity from some people in certain countries. Did you see any pockets of weakness or was everything pretty much good across most every country? And what does your linearity look like? -- Yeah. So I would say the linearity was about the same as we've experienced throughout 2018 and Q1 of 2019. I can't speak to any specific country that we saw weakness at the end. Obviously, the tariff situation in China, but we've got enough resiliency in the model from our geographic and our vertical distribution that we were able to execute against our forecast and closed successfully.And as you saw, each of the major geographies delivered double-digit constant currency revenue growth. So we feel good about our execution in Q2. And obviously, as we've taken up our guide on all of our key metrics for earnings, ACV and revenues for the full year, we still see a lot of momentum and we've got a healthy pipeline. So now we just need to focus on execution for the remainder of the year. -- Got it. Got it. Great. Thank you.And for you, Ajei, could you give us some color on the Discovery Live activity that you're seeing and like what's the value proposition for Discovery Live? And maybe distinguish that from the value prop or the situations in which you're selling as part of the PTC CAD workflow. -- I mean the value proposition for Discovery Live is really unchanged from what it's been and what I've described in the past, namely, Discovery Live offers an individual a very quick way, a real-time way, of getting a directionally accurate solution in -- or an analysis of a particular problem. The real-time nature of Discovery Live is what makes it so valuable. And the fact that it's so intuitive to use and so easy to use is what makes Discovery Live accurate. Now we found that there are use cases certainly where customers or users are completely new to simulation will see the benefit of the use of Discovery Live, and there are -- we have cases where that's the case.And we also have other cases where Discovery Live is being used by much -- by people who are much more adept -- who have used simulation in the past, in fact are able to use that ANSYS flagship tools as part of their day-to-day work, but are using Discovery Live to give them a directional idea of where they need to apply deeper levels of simulation. And obviously, as I said, the value proposition for Discovery Live is it gives them that immediate feedback without having to do the deeper analysis. And then they can use that immediate feedback to figure out where they should start looking to do deeper analysis. So we see both of those kinds of use cases.Certainly, when you think about enterprise customers, you see exactly that because there are people within larger enterprise organizations who are users of ANSYS and you see people in there who are taking advantage of Discovery Live who are not currently users of the ANSYS suite, but take advantage of Discovery Live to give them insight -- simulation-based insight. Now as far as the coexistence with PTC is concerned, as an example in CAD or in general with CAD, there are some -- there's a cadre of users who are using CAD from their vendor. And what we are in a position to do in that model with PTC, of course, is to make Discovery Live capabilities visible to the CAD user natively. So some of those laying out a CAD design will be able to use the PTC Creo Simulate Live solutions to be able to quickly iterate and that gives them, obviously, an integrated workflow within the PTC solution, and so that's an advantage.But there are also users, as I pointed out in the case of the defense -- DoD contractor that I referred to in my script, there are also users who are not currently CAD users. And we have a situation where in that case where the customer made a decision to purchase both Discovery Live as well as PTC Creo Simulate Live, they are trying to strategically drive upfront simulation across the supply chain both internally and externally and what they want to try to do is to get every single engineer to be able to run their own simulation, whether they're a simulation expert or not so that they can get into more rapid and informed decisions early. And as I said, in that situation, we expect to see potentially hundreds or thousands of engineers across multiple business units taking advantage of simulation. In some cases they'll be CAD users using the PTC solution, in some cases, there won't be CAD users who will be taking advantage of the Discovery Live solution.And of course, if a customer is using another CAD solution, we have natural interconnections between Discovery Live and the other CAD solutions where you have the ability to take advantage of both technologies in parallel.Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks very much for -- last question here. You touched on China and obviously it sounds like you didn't see much macro weakness broadly in Q2. I guess my question is have you seen any changes here in the first month or five weeks since you've closed Q2? And how are you just thinking about the ability to close large deals in the second half of the year relative to the first half just given a potentially weaker macro backdrop. Thank you. -- I mean, I think the -- Maria's comments actually said it very clearly. We have looked closely at a pipeline, and given where we are, the guidance that we're giving takes into account everything that we understand about our pipeline and what we understand about the macro and the situation in the trade discussions between the U.S. and China as well as the broader macro. So we're in a position -- our guidance is based on what we know now and what our analysis is based upon the circumstances that we see in the market today. -- Great. And then you talked a lot about kind of some of the autonomous and electrification trends in the autos and high-tech end market. In addition, you talked about 5G. I guess just how far do you think we are through that opportunity? Is this a multi-year opportunity to come? Or how are you thinking about just where we are through the various stages of that? Thank you. -- All the ones that I mentioned, autonomy, electrification, 5G, IoT, all of these, I think, are very early in their development. We think we're broadly very early in their development. We certainly see customers who will make significant levels of investments in this over multiple years as products get better and better and as technology starts to improve. Certainly, in the case of autonomous, as I mentioned and I alluded to I think in my script, I don't think you would -- you can get experts to agree on when the Level 5 full autonomy is going to be ready in the marketplace.Some people will say sooner, some people will say later. But the fact remains that on the path toward Level 5, full autonomy, there are all kinds of innovations, which are being created that will make vehicles better and safer, and even partial autonomy starts to significantly improve the safety capabilities on the road. And simulation plays a significant role. So this is a multi-year journey that the industry is on where simulation is going to play a huge role in autonomy.And I would make the observation, of course, that it's not just in automotive. It's aerospace, it's other industrial equipment. I think I talked in an earlier conference call about undersea equipment as well, so an autonomous submersible. So there are all kinds of areas where autonomy is applicable and there continues to be enormous amounts of work ahead of us as an industry.Similarly for electrification, I could go through it in similar detail, and equally for 5G, equally for IoT. All of these are major, major megatrends that we believe to be multi-year trends that are, frankly, driving the growth of our core business. And so I think we're in a very enviable position as a company to have a core business that's in a very strong and actively growing part of the market and with products that are leading-edge products to be able to address customers' problems in these multi-year mega challenges that they're facing.And our next question comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one is just for you guys in terms of the ability to forecast those large deals that are coming in. Now you've had the fourth deal above $30 million coming in, in less than a year and a half.What have you learned from those deals? And what is -- when you look at your pipeline and the potential for those deals to close kind of toward the end of the year or even going forward, are you able to say you're more confident in kind of having the ability to predict when those deals might close considering the fact that we only really started a year and a bit ago? -- I think that anytime you're looking at pipeline and trying to predict exactly what happens in the pipeline, especially for some of these larger deals, it varies on an individual customer-by-customer basis. We're not assuming -- we obviously -- the ANSYS business, as you think about the overall volume, we do have a certain number of large deals and larger customers, but of course, we have a large amount of the business that's much more -- that's much smaller, more transactional in nature. And obviously, that's easier to predict because we know we have a law of large numbers of volumes working as -- when we're dealing with the more transactional piece of the business. For the larger deals, of course, we understand exactly what the customer problem is.We know what the value proposition is. In many cases, we have been working with the customer for a while. We understand the challenges that they're dealing with. And we understand the compelling event that's driving them to spend the money with us.They're trying to make a particular product launch. They're trying to get some particular technology out to market. They're trying to compete in a different way in the market. All of these are major drivers, and they're spending money with us to help achieve these business objectives.And so when we link these business objectives with our understanding of the value that we can provide and we put it together, given the nature of the relationships we have with some of these customers, we can predict and we factored that in into our prediction of the pipeline. So it's a more -- it's a thoughtful analysis of where we are and that results in the guidance, obviously, that we give to you guys. -- And that's helpful, thank you so much. And then just as a follow-up, I've got a question on Discovery Live. It seems like from both commentary around you and what PTC has said recently, it's getting more traction definitely. We understand that there's nothing material in the numbers especially for this year.But could it become a more material driver of growth in, let's say, a year or so? Do you have expectations for that? Did you think that Discovery Live will take another few years in order to really ramp up in terms of the volume to move the needle? -- Yeah. We will, obviously, be able to give you a longer discussion during investor day when we'll talk a little bit more about Discovery Live and the technology. But I think a quick way to think about it, Gal, is that in our industry, our customers tend to be quite conservative. And even for a breakthrough product like Discovery Live, our internal expectations are that it will take time for customers to take advantage of these technologies.And so as you rightly pointed out, it's not really a material part of our business as we think about it this year or in the short term. So we'll give you more insights and perhaps be able to address these questions and others during the investor day presentation in a couple of months -- next month.And our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks for taking the question. Regarding services, so it's great to see the continued strong services momentum as you sell a broader platform to customers. And I was just curious about your plans to continue getting partners involved with services and how sustainable the recent trends in the 30% to 40% growth is? -- So one of the areas -- one of the reasons why customers are looking to ANSYS for more services is that they have thoughts to solve some of these more complex problems and we're able to help them understand using services capabilities -- using our services capabilities how to solve some of these next generation problems. So they're looking to solve some of these complex problems. They're reaching out to us to help them do that and that's why we provide services. But as you know, our business model is not to be a services company.We're a software business. And services is not a big portion of our business and it's not going to be a big portion of our business going forward. Our plan is to work -- continue to work with third parties and partners as appropriate and we're continuing to evaluate third parties to take on responsibility for some of these newer solution areas that customers are looking to. And we'll continue to drive our investments in our business where services drive license revenue.So that's the way you should think about the services business, and obviously, we don't see that services ratio really changing as a percentage of our overall revenue in the term. -- That's really helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Maria. Could you just remind us for what the percentage of lease deals are that are one year versus multi-year? And what's the average duration for the multi-year deals? Thanks. -- Yeah, we don't bifurcate between one year and multi-year. Today, the one year tend to be at the transactional level and the multi-year, obviously, tend to be at the enterprise and strategic level. And the second part of your question? -- Duration. -- Duration hasn't really changed. I'd say those multi-year deals still tend to be between two and three years.Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. This is Nate Hitchcock on for Rich. Thanks for taking my quesiton. Thinking about the simulation toolchain tech with BMW.The release now that ANSYS will assume exclusive rights for commercialization, we were wondering if you've begun marketing this product or marketing this tech to other auto OEMs? Or if you can share anything up regarding vision or plans in this space? And then I do have one follow-up. -- We will talk more about autonomy in general perhaps at our investor day and you'll have a chance to understand a little bit more about perhaps, at a technical detail, about what we're doing in autonomy in general. But no, in essence, the direct answer to your question, that we're not marketing that externally at this point of time. We're working with BMW as they lead up to their launch of the BMW iNEXT, which is expected to launch within the next couple of years. -- OK. All right. Thank you. And then also in 2Q, we saw very strong revenue, year-over-year growth in other, Asia Pacific up 74% constant currency.And considering the point in the prepared remarks regarding some of the second half deals closing earlier ahead of schedule, we're wondering if some of the strengths in the other Asia Pacific geography is as a result of companies buying ahead due to trade relations? Or if you can provide really any additional detail here? -- Yeah. I would say it was driven by two things. Yes, some companies buying ahead, but that was a smaller portion. The other was the large transaction that Ajei referred to in his prepared remarks.So the impact of both are what drove the performance in those numbers that you referred to.And our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. When I look at Q3 guidance for operating margins, it kind of suggests 400, 500 basis points of operating margin compression. Can you just talk about some of the investments you plan making or at least the increase in spend, just a little more color? -- Yes. So I would say, first of all, it's lower revenue is really the primary driver. But no doubt, if you heard my commentary in my remarks, we are in the second half contemplating continuing to hire and making up for some of the slower pace in the first half. We've got a number of digital transformation projects under way that we will continue to invest in heavily across the business, and of course, the impact of the acquisitions that we closed earlier.So a combination of all of those are what's driving the operating margin outlook for Q3 and the remainder of the year. -- Great. Thank you.And our next question comes from Robert Simmons with RBC. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thank you. So if I can just mention, you've been behind on your hiring both Q1 and Q2, so a few questions on that. Are there particular areas that you're behind on or is it kind of across-the-board? And then kind of what's the bottleneck? -- Yeah. It's across-the-board. As I spoke on the last earnings call, Q1 was a combination of not only, I'll call it, a challenging hiring environment. And that's not just a domestic issue, that's really globally.But that was also impacted by, as you can imagine, when you do two acquisitions in a quarter, before we just keep the hiring pipeline open, we take a look at the new talent that has joined ANSYS to see if there's opportunities to fill open positions and to broaden some of our new teammates' responsibilities. So that slowed down some of the activity in Q1. As I said, we did hire 100 people in Q2 and the reality is we're going to continue to aggressively pursue our hiring plans throughout the remainder of the year. And we're recruiting for positions across the business, so there's no single function or part of the business that's disproportionately impacted.It's really across the business. And it is a more challenging hiring environment than we've seen, at least I've seen, in at least a decade. -- OK. Great. Thanks. And then are you seeing turnover, people quitting, rising or has that been pretty steady? And are you seeing wage demand is going up or it's just harder to find people? -- Yeah -- no. We still got single-digit turnover. So we're able to retain, but it is the recruiting efforts that just take longer. And as you can imagine, sometimes when you have very highly talented employees who go to their existing employer and announce they're going to be leaving, their existing employers are getting more aggressive relative to what do they have to do to retain those people.So it's tricky. We're continuing to find people. As you also know, we're looking for highly selective candidates in what we're hiring for. So it's not always easy to find them.But we're confident that we can continue to attract and retain our talent as we've done for almost 50 years now.And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks. -- Thank you all for your questions. Before I sign off, I'd like to once again thank my colleagues at ANSYS as well as our channel partners around the world for all of their hard work and their efforts that are leading to our success. Thank you all so much, and for the rest of you, thank you for joining the call and please enjoy the rest of your day.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ansys is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Ansys, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power o  estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see  .This maker of engineering-simulation software is expected to earn $5.77 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2019, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.5%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ansys. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.2%.Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn The upgrade of Ansys to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: ANSS) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $186.34/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.  One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $165 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.80.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.9% return against the $165 commitment, or a 4.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to ANSS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $165 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Ansys Inc. sees its shares decline 12.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $160.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.80 from $165), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.6% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Ansys Inc., and highlighting in green where the $165 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $165 strike for the 4.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Ansys Inc. (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $186.34) to be 27%.

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ansys currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of In order to see if ANSS is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of engineering-simulation software holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For ANSS, shares are up 3.85% over the past week while the Zacks Computer - Software industry is up 0.08% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.65% compares favorably with the industry's 2.27% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Ansys have risen 14.72%, and are up 5.61% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.78% and 2.15%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to ANSS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ANSS is currently averaging 417,860 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note tha  estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with ANSS.Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ANSS's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.46 to $5.74 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that ANSS is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Ansys on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

They contain all the key financial information and supporting data relative to our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results and business update, as well as our initial Q1 and fiscal year 2019 outlook and the key underlying assumptions. I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website.Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum. During this call, and in the prepared remarks, we'll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated.

Ajei? -- Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Our ACV growth of 28% in constant currency was particularly notable because of the challenging comparisons with Q4 of 2017.For the year, revenue grew by 11% and ACV grew 17%, both in constant currency, and we ended the year with a record $957 million in 605 deferred revenue and backlog, which is a 24% increase over Q4 in 2017. To summarize, our financial results in Q4 were outstanding and provided a great ending to a stellar 2018. At investor day in 2017, we announced that our objective was sustained double-digit growth by 2020 while maintaining industry-leading margins. We introduced several strategic pillars to guide our journey to that objective.I'm pleased that we have made important advances across all these priorities over the course of the past year. And with double-digit revenue growth in both 2017 and 2018, I'm confident we are tracking to our 2020 objective. The central pillar of our growth strategy was the need to extend our leadership in the core business by introducing new innovations and by transforming our go to market. Let me start with products.Building on the momentum from last year's 19.x series of releases. We launched ANSYS 2019 R1 earlier this month. R1 features innovation after innovation, including a new Multibody Dynamics product line, an intuitive user experience in Fluent, our flagship CFD solution; an electromagnetic interference scanner that delivers results in seconds as part of our industry-leading electronic solutions; a new heads-up display capability in SPEOS, our flagship's optic solution; and multi-core platform support in SCADE, our embedded software solution. Each of these individual innovations is important in helping customers solve some of their most challenging problems.Taken together, however, these show that ANSYS is leading the industry with advanced multiphysics simulation capabilities. We also recently launched a new ANSYS cloud native solution, enabled by Microsoft Azure that offers customers seamless access to on-demand high-performance computing in the public cloud. The offering is optimized for ANSYS solutions, initially ANSYS Mechanical and Fluent, and dovetails nicely with offerings by ANSYS' cloud hosting partners, which include both ANSYS' and third-parties' products. Based on the advances in our core products and the integration across our portfolio, we're continuing to help customers address some of their most challenging problems where they're aggressively investing in R&D.Today, let me highlight some of our successes with autonomous systems. 3M has developed advanced materials that enable sensors to deliver additional information from enhanced infrastructure to advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS. ANSYS' tools and services are opening the doors to new opportunities in the fast-changing automotive market by providing 3M credibility in demonstrating their sensor material performance under adverse weather and lighting conditions. This is another example of how ANSYS is helping a customer chase a multibillion-dollar market opportunity.Another great example of our integrated solutions is with Oceaneering, which is developing autonomous submersible vehicles for use with offshore oil rigs. They're using a multiphysics ANSYS solutions to digitally test optical avoidance algorithms, a technique that could reduce costs by 90% and that's critical when in-water tests can run up to $150,000 each day. Moving to sales. You may recall that two years ago, we had embarked on the transformation of our go-to-market strategy to allow us to maximize our market opportunity and to correct underperformance in key geographies, notably Europe.Our new go-to-market approach enables us to effectively grow and close large enterprise deals through the ANSYS direct sales team while simultaneously efficiently addressing the large volume of our transactional or momentum business through a combination of territory sales, channel partners and inside sales. That strategy has unlocked new opportunities, as you can see from our revenue and ACV growth numbers. We saw strength at all of our geographies. While North America led the way with 19% constant currency growth, I'm delighted that Europe grew 10% in constant currency, both in Q4 and in 2018, continuing the growth recovery we had expected.On the large enterprise front, we began 2018 with a $50 million customer contract, at the time the largest in the history of ANSYS. And I'm thrilled to announce that we capped off the year with a Q4 $59 million contract across multiple product lines with a long-standing customer. The second pillar of our growth strategy was selectively investing in high potential adjacencies to expand our addressable market. You may remember that simulation has traditionally been used primarily as a validation tool.As part of our vision of pervasive simulation, we're expanding the use of simulation up front in the design process with the Discovery Live during manufacturing with our additive manufacturing solutions, and in operations with Twin Builder. 2019 will be a validation and building year for these offerings, setting the stage for additional growth in 2020 and beyond. With its real-time simulation capabilities, Discovery Live has captured the attention of design engineers across the globe. One of the new users of Discovery Live, longtime ANSYS customer, Endress+Hauser, is seeing the benefits of simulation and product ideation.This global leader in measurement instrumentation, services and solutions for industrial process engineering is cutting costs and reducing time to market by bringing simulation earlier in the product development process with Discovery Live. To quote one of the company's engineers, \"With Discovery Live, we are agile. We are fast and we are efficient\". Discovery has picked up more best new product awards than any other ANSYS solution in the last decade.And at the end of Q4, we signed our first seven-figure discovery deal. Another new solution, Twin Builder, enables our customers to build, validate and deploy simulation-based digital twins. The market of Twin Builder is enormous, with a half of the large industrial companies expected to deploy digital twins in the next three years, and we are seeing early traction in the market. The home appliance and air solution division of the global giant, LG, is using Twin Builder to create virtual prototypes at the component level and share IoT information among products, supporting research to boost product reliability, reduce the time to market, decrease the need for physical testing and improve product development.The next pillar of our growth strategy was pursuing strategic partnerships and acquisitions. On the partnership side, last week, PTC released Creo Simulation Live, which embeds ANSYS Discovery technology into Creo. With PTC's market leadership, this partnership grows the ANSYS reach to a new and broader base of design engineers around the world. While it is too soon to evaluate market success, early indications are positive.During its most recent  , PTC reported that it already had orders from 20 customers following its December preview release as well as more than 160 customers in its short-term pipeline. M&A continues to be a highlight for us. As you know, ANSYS has a long history of successful M&A, where we acquire companies with leading technologies, invest in both innovation and integration with the broader ANSYS portfolio and take advantage of the vast ANSYS customer footprint to increase customer adoption in sales and drive growth for ANSYS. We're following that same playbook with our two most recent acquisitions, both of which closed earlier this month.The first is Granta Design, the pioneer of material intelligence and information technology. With the variety of materials available to product developers today, having accurate, traceable and reliable materials information is increasingly critical to simulation accuracy. Granta has proven world-class technology that has enjoyed success in some of the largest and most sophisticated companies. Rolls Royce, for example, used Granta to save $10 million to reduce setting, legacy data capture and other cost avoidance.And although we share a few customers with Granta, including Lockheed Martin, Saudi Aramco and Airbus, their distribution was limited because of their size. Now as part of ANSYS, with our ability to reach customers in all geographies, there are many new opportunities to drive growth by introducing the Granta material solution to a much larger customer base. We also closed a smaller acquisition, Helic, which builds great technology to analyze and mitigate the risk of electromagnetic crosstalk for semiconductor designs. This is particularly relevant because megatrends like 5G and artificial intelligence are driving the need for extensive -- electromagnetic analysis to combat electromagnetic noise.Helic's solutions, when combined with ANSYS' PowerArtist, our power integrity and noise analysis technology, as well as our market-leading electromagnetic solvers, will help engineers deliver on the promise of next-generation solutions. Our 2019 strategy for growth remains the same as last year. We'll continue to grow our core, expanding to the adjacencies we've selected, drive partnerships and pursue appropriate M&A. With the strategy in place, I'm excited that our guidance for 2019 is 12% constant currency 606 revenue growth at the midpoint for the full year.This is an ambitious growth objective, especially in the light of our stellar performance in 2018, and it is a testament to the strength of the ANSYS franchise. I want to take a minute to talk about corporate commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives. Last month, we were named the global 100 most sustainable corporations by Corporate Knights, a firm slowly focused on tracking and ranking customers that's committed to sustainability. This is a powerful recognition of our company and our employees.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. -- Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ajei, by any financial measure, we delivered another quarter and year of exceptional results. This is quite an accomplishment when you consider the strong comparable of both Q4 and 2017.I'll take a few minutes to add some additional commentary around our fourth quarter and annual financial performance, and we'll close with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q1 and 2019. Throughout 2018, we have been providing financial results and outlook under both ASC 605 and 606. Consistent with our messaging throughout the past year, beginning in 2019, we will transition to only reporting our financial results under ASC 606. For purposes of today's commentary, any comparisons that I make relative to growth rates will be comparing 2018 to 2017 results under ASC 605 and in constant currency.And for the last time, I'll provide key financial metrics under both 605 and 606, and consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. We would also like to announce that we will be removing the statistics on cumulative orders above $1 million in our future communications. While this metric was relevant when we first introduced it over a decade ago, the $1 million threshold is arbitrary and has become less meaningful over the past two years as the company has begun to experience higher deal values with transactions increasingly incorporating multiphysics. It gives equal weight to both the $59 million transaction that Ajei previously mentioned and to a transaction that may be less than 2% of that value, which we believe is not useful in evaluating our performance.As we move forward, we believe the best indicator of our go to market and large deal progress is the overall ACV growth across the full calendar year. I do want to mention that we closed the fourth quarter with 68 customers that have orders over $1 million, a 39% year-over-year increase and four customers that had orders of over $10 million. Our Q4 results reflect a great finish to our strongest year ever, one in which we experienced continued accelerated business momentum and execution across the company. We reported constant currency revenue growth of 14% for the quarter and 11% for the year and EPS results that were above the high end of our guidance under both ASC 606 and 605.Our ongoing record of execution throughout every quarter of 2018 gives us confidence that we are on a path to continue to make progress against our strategic priorities and to deliver another record year of financial results in 2019. Other key financial metrics that I would like to highlight begin with Q4 and fiscal year 2018 constant currency ACV growth of 28% and 17%, respectively. For the year, we reported total revenue of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion under 605 and 606, respectively. Fourth-quarter revenue under ASC 605 and 606 totaled $340 million and $418 million, with the large disparity between the two coming primarily from the upfront recognition of the license component of leases under ASC 606.As mentioned earlier, the strong fourth-quarter results included a $59 million four-year deal, the largest in our history. This deal, which was not included in our guidance, was a principal driver of the overachievement in our Q4 606 results on both the top and bottom line. It also illustrates the increased volatility that results from the upfront recognition of the entire license component of multiyear lease transactions. And further, the earnings volatility is even more pronounced because the additional upfront revenue comes with minimal variable costs.The inclusion of this deal in our 2018 results also adversely impacts our fiscal year 2019 growth rates by approximately 1% for ACV, 2% for revenue and 5% for diluted EPS. The increase in software license sales, combined with strong maintenance renewals, contributed to our deferred revenue on backlog under 605 of $957 million, representing a new record Q4 high and a 24% increase over last year's very strong comparables. Deferred revenue on backlog under ASC 606 totaled $659 million. Total recurring revenue for the quarter and the year under 605 were 16% and 12% in constant currency to totals of $245 million and $933 million or 72% and 76% of total revenue, respectively.Lease and maintenance revenue each grew double digits for the quarter and the year, indicative of strong renewals and expansions within our global customer base as well as the value that our customers place on the ongoing investment in innovation and the high quality of our support services. This increase in our recurring revenue streams in Q4 and 2018 was relatively balanced across each of our three major geographies, each of which delivered double-digit constant currency growth in recurring revenue. Under ASC 606, recurring revenue totaled $305 million for Q4 and $962 million for the year or 73% and 74% of total revenue, respectively. Our strong and growing base of recurring revenue improves the predictability around our future performance.The operating margins under 605 were 40.5% for the quarter and 44.4% for the full year. The lower fourth-quarter margin is consistent with our recent financial guidance and reflects the significant incremental sales commissions that typically occur in the fourth quarter, as high achieving sales personnel hit their commission accelerators. The full-year margin is also consistent with the expectations that we set at the beginning of 2018 and maintained throughout the year. The operating margins under 606 were 51.6% for the quarter and 47.4% for the year.Those results exceeded our expectations and were driven primarily by the revenue overperformance under ASC 606. Both sets of results are evidence that we are committed to managing our business with discipline and to ensuring that the incremental investments are driving the annual ACV and top-line growth that we have planned. We reported fourth-quarter EPS of $1.39 under 605, up 30% growth over the last Q4 and $2.13 under 606. And for the year, we also finished with record EPS of $5.30 under 605, a 32% growth over fiscal year 2017; and $5.98 under 606.The overperformance on EPS in the quarter was driven by the very strong top-line finish. With respect to taxes, under both standards, our effective tax rate was approximately 18% for the year and 17% to 18% for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead into 2019, we currently expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% for Q1 and the full year. And for 2019, we have assumed a slightly higher mix of income in foreign jurisdictions, which have a higher tax rate as compared to the U.S.Our cash flow from operations totaled $133 million for the fourth quarter and $486 million for the year. We closed the year with a total of $777 million in cash and short-term investments, of which 79% was held domestically. And while we are discussing our cash balance, I wanted to also note that we just closed a 5-year $500 million revolving line of credit. While the line of credit is new for ANSYS and is not for any imminent need, it's simply intended to give us additional capital flexibility as we continue to grow the business.Also, in line with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 500,000 shares during the quarter and 1.7 million shares during 2018 at a total cost of $77 million and $270 million, respectively. Currently, we have 3.8 million shares available for repurchase. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We are initiating our guidance for Q1 and expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $290 million to $310 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.98 to $1.11.And for fiscal year 2019, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1,410,000,000 to $1,470,000,000 or constant currency growth of 10% to 14% and EPS in the range of $5.55 to $6. Our 2019 outlook includes the contributions from the recently acquired Granta Design and Helic businesses. We are currently forecasting a range of $20 million to $25 million of revenue and ACV for 2019. The combined impact of the capital utilized in the acquisitions and the incremental integration investments that will be necessary throughout the remainder of the year will result in the near-term impact of approximately $0.05 to $0.07 of dilution for 2019 as we integrate these acquisitions into our core business.Our ACV outlook for 2019 is a range of $1,410,000,000 to $1,465,000,000. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 8% to 12%. Our initial outlook for annual operating cash flows is a range of $470 million to $510 million for 2019. I would like to highlight that our outlook for 2019 includes higher tax payments that relate to the accelerated lease license revenue and related profitability that incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 under ASC 606 as well as the expected adverse first-year impacts of the acquisitions.For modeling purposes, we're expecting first quarter operating margins in the range of 36.5% to 38.5%; and for fiscal year 2019 in the range of 43% to 44%. The recently announced acquisitions of Granta Design and Helic are expected to adversely impact our operating margin by approximately 1% in 2019. As we head into 2019, I would like to again remind everyone that our focus will be on progress against annual targets as opposed to quarterly results simply due to the volatility in quarterly revenue, operating margin and EPS that result from the timing of large lease transactions under 606. As we saw in our 2018 results, our Q4 business volume, with 28% constant currency ACV growth, continues to grow seasonally stronger.It is by far our largest quarter for new business, particularly for large multiyear deals. As we look ahead to 2019, we see a very similar seasonal pattern, with a disproportionately large Q4 dynamic. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for both Q1 and 2019 are contained in the prepared remarks document. In summary, we are very pleased to have delivered another excellent quarter and year, with strength across all of our key financial metrics.We also continue to deploy capital to drive long-term stockholder value through investing in our core business, pursuing important M&A targets and additional share repurchases. Our strong close to another year gives us confidence that our continued focus on execution and investing in the business, both organically and through M&A, supplemented by our growing base of recurring business, strong customer relationships and a healthy sales pipeline, provide a solid foundation to deliver on another strong year in 2019 as well as our 2020 financial targets. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.[Operator instructions] The first question comes from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Congratulations on the strong results. Just wanted to hone in on Discovery Live here, Ajei, and get your sense on the potential impact both in '19 and beyond. It sounds like some promising initial returns from the PTC agreement as well as some sort of organically.So if you can just frame that out for us in terms of maybe what you've baked in for '19 and how you think about that longer term? Thank you. -- Thanks, Rich. Thanks for the question. So as far as Discovery is concerned, as I said in my comments, we are very excited about what we have in terms of the technology, and obviously we're taking it to market both directly through our sales force as well as in conjunction with the OEM that we have with PTC. PTC recently announced its new product.It was announced last week. There was a webcast webinar yesterday. I think that 2,000 customers or 2,000 individuals have signed up for that webinar as well. So there's obviously a lot of excitement in the PTC customer base as well for that.So we're very excited about it. We see 2019 as essentially a validation year. We don't really see this as being a big revenue year yet. This is not -- this is still early stages for a product which I think is transformative, but the fact is in our market, it takes a while probably to gain momentum.So we feel this is a building year and we will continue to come up with a new version for the technology. PTC will continue to improve that product with the integration of our technology into it. We learned this year, and I' looking forward to -- I'm really looking forward really next year to seeing some more tangible results from a revenue perspective.The next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. This question may be geared toward Maria. When looking at your margin outlook of 43%, 44%, obviously, that's consistent with how you guys have been framing kind of where the margins could go with your investments and double-digit growth, but obviously it's a step-down from what we saw in fiscal year '18.Can you maybe just talk about kind of where some of those investments are coming and maybe some of the headwinds on the margins for '19? -- Yes. Ken, I'd say the biggest headwinds on the margins are for the dilutive impact from the two acquisitions that Ajei spoke to in his remarks. As you can imagine, most of the acquisitions that we're looking at, particularly the smaller tuck-ins, have no margin structure that's near ours. So -- but there are important technologies that advance our road map and extend our multiphysics capabilities.So we will be making some investments relative to integrating those two acquisitions, and as a result of the capital deployed as well as those integration investments, we'll have dilution in 2019, and we'll see them becoming more accretive to profitability as we head into 2020. Additionally, from the core business, we are continuing to invest in the business, in talent, R&D, AEs, field engineers and infrastructure to continue to be able to scale the business over the long term.The next question comes from Gal Munda of Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question. I would just like to focus a bit on the very, very large deals. I don't know if we can call them mega deals. In terms of the fact that 2018 was kind of a breakthrough year for you, maybe after the number of those have come through now, can you talk a bit about the predictability and the nature of those deals that you see in terms of maybe of the sales cycle compared to what the usual deal, kind of large deal, previously would take and how much effort it takes? I hope that makes sense. -- Sure. Hey, Gal. Thanks for the question again. So a couple of quick comments about large deals.Firstly, large deals don't just happen by themselves. They happen as a result of a long-term relationship between our -- us as a company and the customer. And that's a relationship that takes years to develop, and it's a relationship that we pride ourselves on and we maintain because of the level of investments we're making both in our product as well as in our technical capabilities with customers. And so that's one important aspect of those relationships.And as the $59 million deal that we talked about is from a long-standing customer of ours, as an example. And the second thing is what we're seeing is many of these large deals are obviously not just single product deals. These are -- these pull together multiple products from multiple product lines and so they're essentially multiphysics deals. And that's really important for us because when we think about the direction where some of these large companies are going, they're looking at more challenging problems.They're looking at more -- they're looking at solutions which require necessarily this multiphysics analysis that they bring to the table. And so that's another element as well of some of these large deals. And so when you think about the pipeline that we're seeing for this year for some of the larger deals, we're kind of back-end focused -- we're back-end loaded this year. So a lot of activity is happening in the latter part of the year.Q4 is obviously going to be a heavier quarter, much like Q4 in 2018 was a heavier quarter, and that's also part of the way that we're thinking about the year. So we have visibility into the pipeline. We have been developing these deals and these relationships with customers, and as I said, the relationships take years to develop. And this is part of the cadence that we're building into our business as we go forward, understanding how to manage these large deals to understand what they look like in the pipeline, make sure that we can bring the relevance of the solutions to bear with both our sales organization as well as our technical organization and then slot them in from an execution perspective.The next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Hi, guys. In your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the crosstalk in semiconductor design. I'm kind of curious as you look into 2019, how much of the growth dynamics are you expecting to come from more of your EDA portfolio versus the rest of the portfolio? And then Maria, just to sneak in, can you give us a sense, what did 2018 acquisitions actually contribute to the 2018 full-year ACV? -- Again, thanks for the question. So let me address very quickly the opportunity for '19. Obviously, electronics, in general, is very strong for us. We have solutions that help us both in the traditional EDA market as well as in the broader high-tech market.And frankly, we see tremendous opportunity in 2019 and beyond, and it's obviously being fueled by the complexity of semiconductors that are rolling into solutions for autonomous and for 5G, for AI, cloud computing. One of the things that are demanding more and more complexity for semiconductors. Obviously, that's driving process nodes -- customers toward advanced process nodes. But from our perspective, that also pulls in a need to be able to do multiphysics analysis, and it's not uniquely about looking at one individual physics.It's understanding the implications at the chip level, at the board level, at the system level, and that requires fairly an understanding of all the different physics as we've discussed in the past. And so I think that's going to be very important, certainly as we see the use of semiconductors in these next-generation applications. Maria? -- Yes. Sterling, relative to the contribution to ACV in 2018 from the acquisition, it was $25 million.The next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for taking my question here. Maybe for you, Maria. On the large $59 million lease deal in the quarter, can you remind us how the cash collections on that multiyear deal will work? -- Yes. So Saket, as you saw in the materials, it's a four-year deal with annual payments, and that first payment will come into 2019.The next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to maybe dig into your -- what you're doing in cloud here. And so Ajei, you mentioned you've got a new cloud data solutions on Azure. Maybe just can you back up a little bit and remind us, what -- how are you currently going to market through hosting partners? And then what's different about the new Azure solution that you're offering relative to either product or pricing model? And just remind us are the hosting partners -- is that a BYOL model for them and then customers rent? So just kind of refresh me on how you're going to market in cloud and how this new offering might be different here? -- Right. Great question. So we currently go to market, as you rightly pointed out, with a network of cloud hosting partners, so we're essentially around the globe. And they provide turnkey access to the ANSYS portfolio.So our cloud hosting partners take advantage of whatever public cloud infrastructure they choose to use. The customer works with them and they're able to work with both ANSYS technology as well as third-party technology and offer that as essentially as a cloud solution. So they service the cloud partner, if you will, for the customer and the customer directly works with them. And that's a great partnership with us and the cloud hosting partners that's been working very well.What we've done with the ANSYS cloud is we've taken a slightly different approach. And here now, within -- directly within our flagship products initially with FLUENT and Mechanical, you can directly access the HPC capabilities in the cloud, in this case, the Azure public cloud. And so it's completely seamless. It's completely built into the UI.And you have an option when you're using the products to then choose to use the public cloud, which essentially provides seamless HPC for our customers. And obviously, that provides -- that makes the cloud a little bit more accessible. It provides convenience because the customers or engineers can -- without having to leave the environment that they're working in every day, they can enlist this additional compute power without even being an expert on HPC. And obviously, this makes HPC easy to use, and we're excited about that.And in the coming months, we'll be adding more services and capabilities to the ANSYS cloud. It dovetails nicely with what our public -- with our cloud hosting partners, what they provide, and we're excited about providing our customers a choice of how they want to take advantage of the public cloud.The next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Good morning, Ajei. I wanted to ask about the dynamic of your top 100 customers, where ANSYS has dedicated more technical resources to those customers. They've actually thrived with higher sales.How do you think about how kind of strategy at your largest customers? And as part of that, any metrics you can share on multiphysics penetration or adoption would be helpful. Thank you. -- Sure. So as you well know that these larger deals, as I mentioned already, these larger deals do include multiphysics deployments or multiphysics -- I mean, they're multiphysics in nature. I would say that, for our largest 100 customers, most of them probably have three or more products from -- three or more physics, if you will, installed and are taking advantage of them. So I would say that it's a pretty broad penetration of multiphysics into the largest 100 customers.That being said, I think that the market for simulation is still early stages because when you think about where the use of simulation is even at the very large customers, there's plenty of opportunity to continue to increase the use of simulation. Our strategy for simulation and the use of simulation is to make it more pervasive. Historically, it's obviously been used in the validation phase, and even there, I think we're underpenetrated. But if you start to think about the opportunity going upstream to the designers and then downstream into manufacturing and operations, I think we have a significant opportunity.And we're seeing that because with some of these larger deals, yes, there is improved sales execution. Obviously, there's improved sales execution. But it's also the case of the customers need the technology. No one would be buying things if they didn't need it.The customers need the technology because we're able to demonstrate the value of the technology in different use cases and to addressing different customer needs, and that's translating into greater demand for our offering. And so you see with these large deals, these are customers we've had for numbers of years and then we continue to expand the footprint and the penetration into those organizations, and I don't believe that we're reaching an asymptote or anything of that nature. So we're excited about our future. We're excited about the opportunity in front of us.The next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a recap of the changes you made to both the sales force and the channel this year and your plans for 2019. -- Sure. I think the further -- the importance -- and I couldn't tell you exactly what happened in 2017 versus 2018, but essentially what we did is there's a pretty deep segmentation of our customers and separated them into different categories, if you will. There's a segment of our customer base where we directly address the customer through the ANSYS direct sales force, and these tend to be the largest of customers. And typically, you'll have an account manager looking after a small number or one customer with technical support.And this is where a lot of the larger deals come from. We also have what we call -- we also have territory sales individuals who are not focused on the largest accounts. And we have what we call a momentum sales motion, which is more transactional in nature. And these are the next generation or the next level, if you will, of customers, where the coverage is less, it's not so much one-to-one, it's less -- it's single sales individual may cover several different accounts or we will have channel partners who are then working with us to also cover accounts.And so through the combination of channel partners and territory sales, we're able to cover some of these accounts. We also have invested in inside sales and our inside sales activity is doing well. And we're able to then not just create inside demand. It's not just an organization to set up meeting, but we have an organization that can actually close business telephonically through our inside sales organization.Obviously, that is -- that does tend to be smaller deals, but some of them are very nice deals as well. And so that combination of being able to go direct to large organizations with more focus, being able to manage the territory effectively and leveraging the channel partners and leveraging inside sales to be able to scale the transactional aspects of the business is really what's been contributing to our success on both fronts on the large enterprise side as well as on the small enterprise side. As we look at -- as we go forward into 2019, the challenges for the sales organization, obviously, are -- we have two new acquisitions in the form of Granta and Helic. We're integrating them into the sales organization and to our go-to-market motion.That technology will be available to, obviously, our direct sales people as well as to our channel partners to be in a position to stay to market. So we're excited about -- and we're excited about that work, and that means integrating the technical sales organization, as well as teaching our sales organization. Outside of that, the same structure that I described, maybe going after large enterprise customers being able to manage the momentum accounts, that remains in place as we think about our business in 2019.The next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on Discovery Live. Maybe you can talk about the initial traction you're seeing.Is it different users than you would typically see using ANSYS? And then the funding for these deals, is it coming from different budgets that would typically be used to purchase ANSYS? Thanks. -- So we -- our approach for Discovery has been twofold. One is that we think that it could be customers -- we've historically had larger customer who are taking advantage of Discovery, although it may be -- excuse me, it may be a different user base within that large customer. So maybe a different caliber of users who have not historically used the ANSYS flagship solutions but who do -- who could benefit from the use of simulation. So even though it will be the same large customer, it will be a different user within that.And we're seeing that certainly within our own go to market with Discovery, but we're also seeing that, as you think about some of the conversations we've been having with our colleagues at PTC in terms of how they're thinking about our positioning Creo Live as well. And then the other area that we think that we will be able to bring in customers is customers have historically not necessarily been ANSYS users, who tend to -- who are smaller haven't found -- haven't felt that they could manage the use of simulation even though they would benefit from that, and we believe that there's an opportunity there as well. And that's -- I would say that that's harder for us to quantify right now but that's also an opportunity that we are excited about.The next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Thank you very much, and congratulations from me as well. So when I look at '18, I think your organic constant currency ACV growth was about 14%. And even if we take out the large deal in Q4, I think it would be 12%. And then when I look at '19, it's on a constant currency organic basis in the kind of 7%, 8% range, so a big sort of stepdown.And I just wanted to know if that's just elements of prudence. Or are there any other things that you're thinking about that would create that deceleration? And maybe related to all of this is just, can we just touch on the philosophy on these large multiyear transactions? You said the one in Q4 was not in the guidance. Does that imply that you are excluding deals like this from your future guidance? Thanks so much. -- So Ross, relative to our outlook for 2019, I would say we have forecasted based on our visibility in the pipeline as it exists. And no doubt we are going to be a little bit prudent as it's just the beginning of the year. And similar to what we experienced in 2018, given that the majority of those large transactions are currently forecasted for Q4, we want to build in a little bit of conservatism, if you will. That being said, relative to that $59 million deal in particular, we did not include it in our guidance because at the time that we gave our outlook back in November, there were still a number of moving parts relative to that deal including some competitive dynamics that, quite frankly, could have easily made that a Q1 deal.And given the size of it, particularly the impact under 606 with $30 million of revenue and $0.28 o  , to the extent that it had closed in Q1, it would have just left too big a gap. So the downside risk was not worth trying to be aggressive on forecasting that deal. The reality is, we're still in the learning stages relative to the predictability of these. And as it becomes more of an ongoing part of our business and we learn more about exactly different personalities that have different perspectives on closing, we'll get better at it.But for now, we are going to build a little bit of caution into our outlook so that we don't have any downside surprises.The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. -- Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment, Maria, on your expectation for expense growth in 2019? You grew your headcount by about 500 for the year versus a prior many-year average, just about 100 or so increase in headcount per year, so pretty considerable difference there. And relatedly for Ajei, having spent the last six to eight quarters on your go to market and AE investments, could you talk about the relative investments or initiatives on those two things for the next year or more as compared to the past year or two? And the preparations you need to make or investing in, vis-\u00e0-vis infrastructure, acquisitions integration, data centers and the like to prepare for the future growth.Thank you. -- Yes. So Jay, let me take your first question relative to our plans relative to investing. Our 2019 plans currently anticipate adding about 300 new employees to the organization throughout 2019. As of the end of January, we've got about 176 positions open for hire across the globe.Other things that I spoke to earlier, we will be absorbing the two recent acquisitions which will require some additional integration costs in 2019. And then as you just mentioned, we do have a number of infrastructure investments, not necessarily data centers, certainly some of our own HPC capacity internally. But most of our investments around talent and additional costs that come with talent relative to licensing around digital technology that they're leveraging, and we're also investing in our own digital technology to really be able to automate and scale our processes consistently across the globe. -- And I think Jay, the other part of your question was around our investments in our technical capability -- customer-facing capability, our ACE organization. And yes, that continues to be an area that we are making investments. And you'll see that if you look at our -- go online and look at the kinds of people that we're looking to hire. And we're making investments in our organization essentially across the product portfolio across the world.Obviously, we've got some new talent coming in through the acquisitions of Granta and Helic. And those individuals will obviously join the company and will be essential, of course, as we start to expand in those areas as well. So there will be expansion in our ACE capabilities in 2019.The next question comes from Monika Garg of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. -- The question for you, Maria, the question is like you are guiding cash flow flattish year over year. Can we add some color around that? I mean, you did talk about slightly higher taxes. Could you -- buyback number, how much increase you are baking in for year over year? -- Yes. Monika. So I'd say, as you think about cash flow for 2019, there's a few headwinds that we're facing in addition to the additional taxes from the 606 overperformance. We've also got a headwind of about 1% to 2% from currency, and the two acquisitions that we did are expected to be dilutive to cash flow in 2019.If you think about relative to the quantification of the tax impact, our tax rate in 2018 was about 18% for the full year, and we're guiding to 21% to 22% for 2019. So that's really kind of the differential in tax payments relative to 606 as we head into 2019.The next question comes from Matt Lemenager of Robert W. Baird and Company. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks. It's Matt on for Rob. I have a question around North America.It's now grown 13% or faster, I think, six of the past eight quarters. Ajei, is there anything in particular driving that, simply sharper execution or anything standing out direct versus indirect? Anything to -- that's kind of driving that? -- So I think there's obviously great execution in North America and there's been a lot of large deals activity as well to be able to direct in North America. And I think to a certain extent, just given the nature of some of these large deals, these tend to be long-term customers that historically have been with us for a long time. That's been -- we've been able to build on that given the way the North America team has been laid out. But no, I think from a market demand perspective and what customers are looking for, it's kind of -- you would expect the same sort of thing from customers, whether they're based -- headquartered in North America, whether they're headquartered in Europe or whether they're headquartered in Asia.And I think that the execution aspects of the North America business has also been very strong.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks. -- Thank you, Andrew. So 2018 was another outstanding year for ANSYS, with strength across all of our key financial metrics. We improved our go-to-market execution and we broadened our product capabilities. These important accomplishments continue to move the business in the right direction and give us confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets.We look forward to another exciting year in 2019. In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners for their support. And a shout-out to my ANSYS colleagues, thank you all for your efforts and thank you for another exceptional quarter and an exceptional year. Thank you all for joining the call today, and I look forward to our next call.Enjoy the rest of your day.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n recent trading, shares of Ansys Inc. (Symbol: ANSS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $176.89, changing hands for $177.26/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Ansys Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $145.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $197.00. The standard deviation is $17.481.But the whole reason to look at the  ANSS price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ANSS crossing above that average target price of $176.89/share, investors in ANSS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $176.89 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Here's what they are, why they matter, and how you can buy stocks to play the theme.In a nutshell, a digital twin is a digital replica of a physical asset. Using IoT sensors and technology, companies can effectively create a twin of an asset -- say, a multimillion-dollar piece of industrial equipment -- and model it. The benefit is that asset managers can better monitor and analyze asset performance, while running simulations on the digital twin in order to improve the physical asset's performance.The Internet of Things is spurring interest in digital twins. Image source: Getty Images.With the jargon out of the way, let's get to a real-life illustration. Within the industrial space, the major leader in digital-twin technology is  (NYSE: GE) : Its wind turbines, aircraft engines, and gas turbines are a perfect example of physical assets at the  .Not only can GE offer IoT solutions to its customers, but it can also use digital-twin technology to cut the unit cost of production on its high-ticket equipment, such as the HA turbine and the LEAP aircraft engine -- a key way to improve its margin.Keeping aircraft engines and gas turbines working is of huge benefit to operators, because just a few days' downtime can cost millions of dollars in revenue.GE's IoT businesses will now be run out of an independent company, though it will be wholly owned by GE. But GE Digital is unlikely to move the needle much on GE's near-term profitability.The best way to play the theme is probably to buy the software companies that facilitate the creation of digital twins. Three names that spring to mind are engineering simulation company  (NASDAQ: ANSS) , IoT platform provider  (NASDAQ: PTC) and engineering software company  (NASDAQOTH: DASTY) .Each of these stocks has strong long-term growth prospects, though as you can see below, valuations aren't cheap: data by  .ANSYS engineering simulation software has traditionally been used in high-end and highly specialized applications, but the emergence of digital twins opens up a wider range of markets for the company. With companies increasingly able to use internet-enabled devices to monitor the performance of assets, it becomes increasingly important to be able to simulate behavior accurately. That's where ANSYS comes in.Interestingly, ANSYS has a partnership with PTC that allows ANSYS engineering simulation solutions to be added to PTC's ThingWorx IoT platform. ThingWorx connects an operator's physical assets with the digital world -- the very essence of the digital-twin concept.Asset operators can feed information from web-enabled devices into the ThingWorx platform, allowing them to use simulation models such as ANSYS solutions to analyze and predict asset performance. For example, a manufacturing plant involved in a repetitive process could iteratively change and improve performance.The France-based company's 3DEXPERIENCE solution builds on its expertise in computer-aided design (CAD) software by offering a platform on which companies can create a digital twin, then allow multiple functions to interact with it.For example, customers can use Dassault's design software on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to collaborate across company functions as diverse as design, quality control, research, and sales and marketing. The company's strong relationship with the aerospace industry is indicative of its approach to the problem --  . You can think of Dassault's solution as being more focused on design and development of products, while PTC's solution is more about continuous improvement within a manufacturing or asset-utilization environment.GE could benefit immensely from growth in digital twins, but it's still a relatively small part of its overall operations. But ANSYS, PTC, and Dassault Systemes are all worth a close look.As you can see above, they all trade at nosebleed valuations, but growth companies usually don't come cheap. All it will take is a few years of double-digit revenue growth -- which analysts have penciled in for all three -- and valuations will catch up with their stock prices soon enough.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In closing, I would like to announce that our 2019 Investor Day will be held on Thursday, September 12 in Pittsburgh, with a reception and technology showcase event the evening before. Further details around the location, logistics and the agenda can be found on our IR website.I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remark. Ajei?  -- Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q1 has given ANSYS an excellent start to the year, with strong results across our key performance metrics. We exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by delivering constant-currency revenue growth of 16%. Our operating cash flow was robust, increasing 14% year over year, and we reported record first-quarter EPS of $1.29.To reflect the momentum across our business, I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our full-year guidance, Maria will provide further details. Our financial success is propelled by a unique multiphysics portfolio and a drive to make simulations pervasive throughout the product life cycle. A distinct combination that helps our customers solve their most complex product problems. In Q1, we enjoyed success across most of our industry verticals, with particular strength in the high-tech sector.Given the unique challenges that high-tech companies face and with our growing momentum in that sector, I would like to highlight ANSYS' value proposition to those companies and some of our successes in the vertical. The high-tech industry stands at crossroads, thanks to megatrends like 5G, AI, autonomy, electrification and data centers. Those trends, coupled with intense competition across the vertical, are spurring customer innovation, thus driving even higher demand for multiphysics simulation. And that's why hundreds of high-tech leaders, including the vast majority of the top companies in semiconductor, smart devices, telecommunications and data centers are using ANSYS to address many of their product challenges.For example, customers are increasingly relying on ANSYS' unique solution set to make 5G a reality. 5G networks require an unprecedented number of base stations, creating more complex connectivity, energy efficiency and thermal management challenges. Our solutions help users examining the performance of a base station in large-scale environments to ensure connectivity is maintained while base station placement is optimized. Combined with our chip-package-system workflow, we can help customers tackle the critical power and thermal management issues on a single platform.In Q1, we closed the deal with an Asian telecommunications company to design and analyze the 5G networks they're building. The company is using ANSYS solutions to increase the performance of antennas in their base stations to accommodate the higher frequencies inherent in 5G communication. After a head-to-head comparison, this telecom customer chose ANSYS because of our complete multiphysics simulations platform. Solutions that help our customers grapple with the complexities of megatrends like 5G, are based on our market-leading portfolio, including gold standards, such as ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RedHawk-SC.ANSYS HFSS enabled users to design and simulate high-frequency electronic products such as antennas, microwave components, high-speed interconnects, IC packages and PCBs. With its unmatched accuracy, the modern architecture of HFSS empowers users to solve complex electromagnetic and electromechanical problems across hundreds of cores, and enables customers like Samsung, NVIDIA and Ericsson to develop amazing products. We continue to extend our leadership with HFSS through our recent releases, as well as through strategic acquisitions. In Q1, we released our EMI Scanner, which is new functionality in HFSS to quickly identify areas of potential electromagnetic interference on PCB designs prior to simulation.This helps customers to eliminate errors while speeding time to market. And as we discussed on our last call, we further expanded our leadership in the electronics industry in Q1 with the acquisition of Helic, the industry-leading provider of electromagnetic crosstalk solutions for systems on a chip. The acquisition of Helic, combined with ANSYS' flagship electromagnetic and semiconductor solver, provides a comprehensive solution for on-chip 3D integrated circuit and chip-package-system electromagnetics and noise analysis. Reaction has been overwhelmingly positive with industry leaders praising us for combining the best technology for off-chip electromagnetics in HFSS with the most innovative on-chip electromagnetics technology in Helic.DfR Solutions, our latest acquisition which closed this week is helping customers address their product challenges by ensuring the reliability of their electronics. DfR Solutions is the leading provider of automated design analysis software and comprehensive services for electronic component and material supply chains. DfR bolsters our electronics reliability capabilities with an automated designer level solution to quickly and easily analyze the potential for electronics failures. And I'm excited to welcome the DfR team into the ANSYS family.Moving to our semiconductor solutions, ANSYS RedHawk-SC is the world's first purpose-built big data system for the semiconductor industry. And I'm proud to say that 100% of our seven-nanometer base is using RedHawk-SC, which is undefeated in all head-to-head technical benchmarks. Our customers and foundry partners recognize that ANSYS is accelerating its leadership in chip-package-system multiphysics with innovative new product like RedHawk-SC, with integrated workflows using our flagship solver such as HFSS and with our targeted technology acquisitions. TSMC, the world's largest semiconductor foundry, has recognized ANSYS with Partner of the Year awards in each of the last three years, and in Q1, they certified our semiconductor solutions for SoIC advanced 3D chip stacking technology.Our work on developing solutions for the high-tech industry is paying off. In Q1, Seagate Technology, a world leader in precision engineered data storage and management solutions entered into a multiyear enterprise agreement expanding the use of ANSYS simulation software worldwide. Demands on Seagate's development teams are increasing. Reaching capacity, performance and environmental goals on schedule increasingly requires more simulation across all engineering disciplines.ANSYS' solutions deliver technical and business value helping Seagate maximize datas potential. Similarly, LG Electronics also inked a new enterprise agreement with ANSYS to help support the company's continued commitment to delivering highly innovative mobile devices, home entertainment and appliance applications to customers worldwide. LG expects this expanded access to our multiphysics suite to drive innovation, shortened product development cycles and accelerated product design. Moving away from high technology, we have seen considerable traction with another recent acquisition, Granta Design, the premier provider of materials information technology.In early Q2, ANSYS closed the largest deal in Granta's history at a leading aerospace company to enable materials intelligence and materials data management across their organization. This deal was made possible by the combination of Granta's mission-critical technology, the long-standing relationship the customer has had with ANSYS and their confidence in ANSYS' ability to successfully integrate Granta. We're also enjoying success with our key partnerships. For example, our award-winning Discovery Live solution, which brings real-time simulation capabilities to design engineers is reaching new audiences, thanks to our partnership with the PTC.During Q1, PTC released Creo Simulation Live, embedded with ANSYS Discovery Live technology. During its  last week, PTC reported that it had already booked deals with 70 customers. As previously discussed, we expect the near-term financial impact to be immaterial but we see upside in the longer term. Similarly, SAP showcased its Predictive Engineering Insights, enabled by ANSYS, solution at the Hannover Messe industrial fair in Germany.Their designed-to-operate demo featured an automated fluid handling system designed by packaging and bottling machine manufacturer, Krones, which showcased digital twin capabilities enabled by ANSYS. And just recently, SAP and ANSYS highlighted joint success with a leading air compressor company. Using the SAP ANSYS solution, the company was able to streamline its customer delivery time from months to hours by eliminating the need for engineering teams to perform detailed technical customization and analysis work. Predictive Engineering Insights empowers field-based sales teams to save critical time and engineering resources.With our strong Q1 financial results, our continued momentum in high-growth industry verticals such as high tech, our investment in leading technology and our focus on expanding the value from our partnerships and our acquisitions, we remain confident that we'll achieve our goals and objectives. Like our customers, we're focused on innovation, on solving the toughest problem and on delivering results. We believe this is a winning combination and our performance speaks for itself. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria.Maria? -- Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first-quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2019. Consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.The strong Q1 results reflect solid execution across our business, combined with a steady customer demanded environment, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all well above the high end of our Q1 guidance. Our excellent start to the year is quite encouraging when considering the Q1 2018 comparable, in which we reported double-digit ACV growth and strong earnings. Key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $303.5 million and total revenue of $319.9 million, or constant-currency revenue growth of 16%. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first-quarter guidance.The increase in software lease license sales combined with strong maintenance renewals contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q1 total of $673 million, representing a 13% increase over last year's first-quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline, which yielded a very strong first-quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 43%. Margins were positively impacted by revenue results finishing well above the high end of our revenue guidance, as well as a slower case of hiring then we had planned coming into the quarter. The pace of hiring was most notably impacted by the integration activities of both the Granta design and Helic acquisitions during the quarter, as we added approximately 200 talented employees to our team.We also saw the continuation of a tighter labor market, particularly for highly skilled positions. We reported record first-quarter EPS of $1.29. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 21%, in line with the range that we had guided coming into the quarter. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% for Q2 and the full year.Our cash flow from operations totaled $152 million, a 14% increase over last year's Q1, and we ended the quarter with a total of $608 million in cash and short-term investments. The operating cash flows in the first quarter positively benefited from the very strong Q4 ACV finish in 2018. In line with our capital-allocation priorities, we repurchased 250,000 shares during the quarter at a total cost of $45 million. We have 3.6 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program.Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Coming off our strong finish in Q1, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and increasing both our revenue and EPS outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the solid financial performance in the first quarter combined with our confidence and continued positive business momentum for the remainder of the year. Our updated outlook reflects the minor contribution of the DfR acquisition that we closed yesterday.Let me also add, that currency exchange rate changes did not contribute to our increased guidance. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $325 million to $345 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.18 to $1.30. For the full year, we are increasing both the revenue and the EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.430 billion to $1.480 billion, or constant-currency growth of 11% to 15% and EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.10. We are also increasing our full-year ACV outlook to $1.425 billion to $1.470 billion.This represents constant-currency ACV growth of 9% to 12%. With respect to annual operating cash flows we are maintaining our outlook for 2019 in the range of $470 million to $510 million. I would like to remind everyone that our outlook for operating cash flow in 2019 includes higher tax payments that relate to the acceleration of lease license revenue and the related profitability under ASC 606, including additional tax payments in 2019 relating to our strong 2018 finish, as well as the first-year impact of the acquisitions. For modeling purposes, we're expecting second-quarter operating margins of 39% to 41%.And for the full year, we continue to expect operating margins of 43% to 44%. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2019 are contained in the prepared remarks document. In closing, we are very pleased to start the year with excellent first-quarter financial and operational results. Another quarter of delivering on our financial commitments, combined with the exciting opportunities to continue to leverage our incredible technology, talent and customer relationships gives us confidence that our focus on execution and investing in the business combined with the strength of our recurring business and growing sales pipeline provide a strong foundation to deliver on our 2019 goals, as well as our longer-term 2020 financial targets.Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.[Operator instructions] Our first question is from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks a lot. Maybe the first question on my end. Last quarter you guys touched on heavier seasonality in the back half of the year, specifically Q4. Just wondering, based on what you've seen in Q1 and the expected pipeline, how is that looking? Is the magnitude even greater? And then perhaps -- and then a follow-up on Discovery Live, just wanted to understand how the PTC partnership differs from what you guys are seeing in terms of customer engagements? -- So Ken, I'll take the first part of the question. Relative to seasonality for 2019, as I had said on the last call, we see 2019 very similar to 2018, back-end loaded and a lot of the large multiyear transactions are in the Q -- 4Q right now. So everything is going as we had mapped it out. And it's just, a lot of those larger deals align with customer, year end, budgeting and spend, and so they're just aligned with a larger second half. -- And then with respect to the PTC partnership, we're very excited about the PTC partnership, I think it's going well. We announced the partnership, as you know, in June of '18. And they released Creo Simulate Live, which is Creo embedded with ANSYS technology in Q1. And they've created essentially a solution that adds simulations into the CAD environment.And so engineers can see the real-time results of simulation at -- in the CAD environment that allows them to make the kind of trade-off and design changes they need to early in the design process. Based on what they said, during their investor call, they closed 70 CSL deals in Q1, essentially across all geographies, industry verticals, both direct and indirect. And they've built a promising pipeline for future quarters, and we're excited about the auction pattern that's consistent with what we've seen which is, customers will use the technology and then start to broaden. They've also announced that they're going to be back porting CSL to Creo 4, which is essentially where a larger portion of their install base, primarily their enterprise customers are.And that will allow them to benefit from upfront simulation. So this -- I think it's going well. We're excited about that and the relationship is strong.The next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good morning. Maria, let me start with you. On the call, a quarter ago, you anticipated that you would add about 300 employees for the year, and I think that did not include Helic and Granta.You've grown 300 thus far for the year, 200 of which was from the acquisition. So you're about a third of the way it seems toward your hiring goal for the year. Does your guidance anticipate that you will hit your hiring objective? And you -- instead of a record number which seems of technical consulting and support openings right now. Could that be some factor as well because you've been able to sustain the numbers for 2019? Then a technology question for Ajei.Maybe to prognosticate a little bit about the evolution of the industry. There's considerable attention as you know being paid to generative design, which is neither CAD nor simulation, it's sum of each, and it's more than just a tool for the process. As that becomes more and more adopted, as I expect it will, how do you think that affects your business but all of simulation or multiphysics simulation, and maybe tie that also into your larger SPDM strategy, if you could? Sorry, for the long question. -- OK. So Jay, I'll start on the hiring. Yeah, as you heard in the prepared remarks, we had planned and we are still planning for roughly 300 net new, not including the impact of Granta and Helic. That being said, as you heard in my earlier comments, the two acquisitions in the first quarter, as you can imagine, slowed some of the original plan down.But we did add net about 130 additional employees on to the ANSYS roster in addition to the 200 plus from Granta and Helic. And it is our anticipation that over the remainder of the year that we will see organic hiring increase over the pace of the year. And that's what's built into our guidance for the remaining quarters. -- And Jay, just briefly touch on generative design. We're excited about the direction that the industry is taking with generative design. We think that's an opportunity for us to increase the penetration of simulation into the marketplace. Because as you think about generative design, the improvement of a design continues to require rapid iterations and simulation.And so where historically, simulation might have been someone, an individual, creating a design and then subsequently validating it in the world of generative design. And frankly, in the world that we're talking about, where more people are creating technology and creating products, the opportunity for simulations provide that rapid feedback and -- to both human beings, as well as provides guidance as you start to think about a generative kind of solution. It makes sense, it drives the use of simulation. So we're very excited about our position in the marketplace.We think that generative will be another driver of the use of simulation. And we think that's completely consistent with the product strategy that we're driving. What we're doing in things like SPDM, allow us to continue and manage the huge amounts of simulations data that's being generated. Obviously, with generative design there will be more simulation data.So this is completely consistent with the direction that we're going. And frankly, we're very excited about it.The next question is from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the question. It's for Maria. What was your constant-currency organic ACV growth in the quarter? And then, could you give us a sense for how you're think about the inorganic contribution to revenue for the remainder of both '19 and as you think about hitting your 10% plus target in 2020? -- So Ken, relative to ACV, basically it is organic. There is only about $3 million to $4 million from the acquisition to ACV. So the majority of the ACV growth is from the organic business. And with respect to 2020, we have not changed our outlook on 2020 from what we said at Investor Day relative to, we are still targeting double-digit growth and industry-leading margins in the 43% to 45% range.The next question is from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow-up on the PTC partnership. And I realize it's still pretty early there.But if you can just talk about with -- what you've seen so far? Do you think similar partnerships like the PTC one would make sense to pursue? And are there other ones out there that you could pursue? Thanks. -- So we certainly are excited about the PTC partnership. They've been good partners and we continue to support them. The opportunity that we see obviously is for designers to be able to take advantage of simulation, not just experienced analyst, the designers should be able to take advantages of simulation. And frankly, we believe in an open ecosystem, so no matter which CAD solution someone's using with perfectly content.And delighted for those customers to take advantage of the CAD capability from any vendor and to take advantage of ANSYS simulation. But obviously with PTC we have a tighter relationship, where PTC is OEM-ing our technology and integrated -- integrating it directly into Creo.The next question is from Rob Oliver of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Ajei this is one for you, just as a follow-up to the last question.So when you got here you embarked upon a pretty bold strategy on the partnership side. You mentioned 5G comps. Obviously, you guys have always been strong in semiconductors. Maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the potential other areas within partnership potential? And then I had a quick follow-up on Discovery Live unrelated to PTC. -- Just on the partnerships question. Just to clarify, what specifically you're asking me to comment on, please? -- Yeah. Just getting a sense for, you guys have expanded your go-to-market your partnerships pretty markedly. And wanted to get a sense if there were other specific areas where you saw opportunity. I realize it's a bit of a follow-up to the last question, please. -- Sure. So the strategy that we've articulated is one where simulation becomes pervasive throughout the product life cycle. And what we mean by that is that any place where product is being touched, whether it's in the inception phase where the people are thinking about a product, in the ideation phase, whether it's deep design, whether it's manufacturing and things like additive manufacturing, whether it's operations, whether it's in the product itself. We believe that simulations can play a role because frankly, and understanding of the physics of the product, and understanding of how the product is -- could operate or will operate or is operating is very important in -- for customer value and customer benefit.So we see simulation is playing this much deeper role across the product life cycle. Now historically, we've been in a particular part of that product life cycle, which has been in the tail end of the design process for validation or for sign-off. And increasingly, as you see from the strategy that we've been pursuing, it's to make simulation available in multiple places. Now in -- the way we're doing that is obviously we have our own go-to-market, but we're also looking at those areas where others have a very strong presence and we're integrating our technology into others who have a strong presence or own a particular workflow.And that's one of the reasons why when you think about the EDA space, for example, we're partnering with Synopsis, where Synopsis is taking our technology and integrating it into their products as part of the workflow. We're partnering with PTC because they have a presence in the CAD space. We're partnering with SAP, as you start to think about operations. And so the way you should think about our partnering strategy, it's driven by the ability to work with industry leaders who are in their space, who are key providers of workflow, or have capability at some point in the product life cycle.And since we have an open strategy, our intention is to be able to integrate with their workflows and let our simulation capabilities be present in their product offering, in their solution offering. And obviously, they're taking it to market through their channels, through their resellers and so forth. So we see this as a win for ANSYS. And that's a strategy that we've been pursuing and that's a strategy we'll continue to pursue.The next question is from Steve Koenig of Wedbush. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about large deals in the quarter, and the context here being the year-ago quarter. May be remind us that the $50 million deal a year ago, how much of that was impactful to ACV? And what did you have this quarter in terms of very large deals that might have moved the needle? If you can provide any qualitative color there.And if I may, I do have one housekeeping-type question for Maria. And that is, if we were to calculate bookings under 606, is that comparable to the 605 calculation we performed a year ago? I know you don't know my CAD. But I'm just talking about the change in the total backlog plus revenue. Are those things comparable? -- Yeah. So let's start with respect to the year-ago quarter, if you recall that was a quarter in which we did announce, at that point in time, the largest deal in the company's history. And ACV would've been a third last year, a third in Q1 this year and then a third next year at the three-year anniversary of that deal. So a third of the deal went into this quarter's ACV results.As you know, we moved away, Steve, from bookings, just because it's a much more volatile metrics than ACV. But there should be no difference between bookings under 606 or 605.The next question is from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Question for you, Ajei, sales force. When yourself and Rick Mahoney took over, about the same time. Since then you've made a lot of structural and capacity additions to the sales force.So just wondering if you can give kind of an update on where you are in that sales force or transformation. And what's on the to-do list for 2019 as far as continuing to add capacity and make any, perhaps, structural changes there? Thanks. -- Yeah. So when I came on board and certainly, Rich, Rick came on board shortly after I did. Our focus was on looking at the go-to-market, try to figure out how we could optimize the go-to-market. And the model that we were dealing with earlier was, I would say a more -- it was a model that was relevant for an earlier time in the ANSYS life cycle.And it was more of a one-size-fits-all in terms of how we address the market opportunity. Today what we have is a more differentiated go-to-market where we take advantage of a direct sales force to go after the large deals and the larger territory deals. And we've done some channel to be able to have a channel focus on the more of the volume business. And then of course, we also have some inside sales activities.And so there's been a pretty significant, as you point out, change in our go-to-market, which has allowed us to continue to grow our business across a number of different dimensions. We've also continued to make investments in our ACE organization or our technical organizational, technical sales organization. And that's, of course, helped overall. And our channel partners have also continued to blossom.We've brought more channel partners on board, and they've continued to bring on more ACE capacity or technical capacity as well to be able to support customers. So that's the journey that we've been on, that's the journey that obviously is an ongoing journey. We continue to make refinements to that model. And you -- and we will continue to do that this year, through next year and beyond.But the basic bones that we've talked about have been put in place. And now we're starting to think about how we would optimize within that structure. In some cases it doesn't make sense to have more some -- a particular vertical focus in certain areas. And those are the kinds of questions that we're exploring.But again, we have a very enviable business model within ANSYS. And that's in the backs of the kinds of products and capabilities that we have in the customer relationships that we've been able to maintain. And that's something that we hold very dear to us. And so our go-to-market model and the changes that we make will support that.And we're not planning on doing anything to disrupt our go-to-markets capabilities.The next question is from Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question this morning. One question back on the ACV guidance. You are raising your current constant-currency outlook by 1 percentage point.Can you maybe go into more details, and the -- what gives you confidence to increase modestly here? -- Yeah. I would say, as I said, in earlier commentary, Jason, one, the performance in Q1 and the strength of the pipeline, and the deals that we're seeing that the teams are working on. So we see a lot of interest from our customers, particularly in some of the key areas that Ajei mentioned in his commentary. And we don't see that slowing down.So we're excited about the opportunity we see ahead for 2019. And we're going to spend all of our time focusing on executing and delivering. -- And if I can just add to what Maria said, she's absolutely correct. I mean if you start to spend time with our field organization. I spent a fair amount of time out in the field with customers as well and with the organization, you get a sense of the strength of the pipeline. And obviously, we're very excited about the capabilities that we can provide.We -- I've talked about some of them in my script. I mean we have conversation with companies where we talk about things like autonomy, electrification, for example, in the auto industry. Those are conversation with are much deeper and broader than conversations that we may have had with similar companies in the past. Similarly, in the electronic space, that I talked about in my remarks earlier and other industries.And that's because of the capabilities that we're able to provide. It's because where the industries are right now, and because of the nature of solutions that we can point to. So the pipeline is looking strong, we're excited about where we are. This was always a back-end loaded year, as we had indicated earlier.There's a lot of activity in Q3 and Q4. But we're confident that we have visibility into that and we understand how to land our business. So we're excited about the year.The next question is from Ross MacMillan of RBC. Please go ahead. -- Thanks so much. Ajei, just on the large deals, you mentioned Seagate and in the release you talked about LG, were they both in the quarter and were they both multiyear. And I'm just curious, your indirect revenue spike, so was there some impact from a partner on one of those deals? That'd be great. Thanks. -- I think the answer was -- I think the answer to all -- I think it was a yes to -- I will answer all of your questions. So yes, it was. Those were -- in the quarter, those were multiyear deals. And yes, there was some impact of partner activity in the indirect number.The next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe first for you, Maria. Just picking up on the last topic a little bit more broadly.Can you talk about the mix of long-term deals in the quarter? And I guess, the reason why I ask is, of course, in 606 we're going to see some differences in sort of revenue versus the arguably cleaner metric for ACV. Can you just talk about that delta and growth between revenue growth and ACV growth this quarter? -- Yeah. So Saket, I think in your comments you've picked up the unique disparity that comes from 606. And the reality is under 606 our results are going to be very impacted by the size, the duration, the timing of those multiyear lease deals. This is the first quarter where you can actually see a comp under ASC 606 for both Q1 of '18 and '19.And going forward, depending on where those deals land, you'll see some disparity between the growth rate in revenue and the growth rate in ACV. They won't always be going -- moving in the same direction. There will be periods where ACV will outpace revenue growth. So I wish I could explain with certainty how it's all going to rollout.But I think the most important thing that we've been communicating is the focus on annual results will be much more meaningful than the volatility that you'll see in the quarters, Q1 being a perfect example.The next question is from Adam Borg of Stifel. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe, Ajei, just talking big picture on ANSYS cloud. Obviously, still early.And as you think about bifurcating both the downmarket and upmarket. Are you expecting more percentages of use case as that come at the lower end of the market or bursting at the upper end and potentially, even a replacement over time as on-prem hardware gets depreciated. -- It's a hard question to answer in terms of exact predictions of what's going to happen. There clearly is value proposition for smaller customers who don't have an investment in the data center to take advantage of the sort of the native HPC capability that we're making available through ANSYS cloud -- native through to the cloud. So with the ANSYS cloud solution that we've just released most recently in Q1, we have an offering that essentially is -- has the following capabilities that I think are important to your question. The first is that it's -- it allows the performance, high performance.It's essentially building on the investments that we've made in HPC. And we're providing a compute optimized clouds infrastructure that's configured and optimized for ANSYS solvers. And so essentially, any customer can take advantage of ANSYS Solutions as scaled than in the public cloud because of the work that we've done. And then the second piece that makes it important is that the accessible from within ANSYS products, and so, someone can be sitting there at a screen working with an ANSYS product and then immediately take advantage of the cloud so it's completely seamless.And of course, since we're running on the back end on the Microsoft Azure in this case, it gives global access and best-in-class security. So we've made essentially, the experience of using cloud drop dead simple and it's as easy as it needs to be. And of course, with the on-demand licensing that we can provide, the paper use licensing that gives them -- that's a third way to complement traditional leases and paid up, and that gives them flexibility of usage. So given that -- given the performance, given the access, given the flexibility that we have with our ANSYS cloud offerings, we would expect the opportunity for customers to cease the opportunity both large, as well as small.Small customers who don't necessarily have any infrastructure obviously they'll be excited and interested in that. But equally, large customers who're project oriented, who are -- went back at HPC, resources aren't available. We've seen interest from large customers as well. So we expect both of those to continue.I couldn't tell you where demand is going to be higher or lower, but we certainly see demand across both of those segments for the reasons that I've mentioned.The next question is from Sterling Auty of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Thanks, guys. You mentioned the strength in multiyear leases. I wasn't clear, I didn't hear.Is there have been any change or noticeable change in duration? And maybe just a reminder, what are you seeing as the average length of these multiyear deals? -- Sterling, there's been no change in duration, and typically two to three years. Some of the larger deals tend to be three years and some of the strategic tend to be two years. But there's been no significant change in the go-to-market or duration. -- OK. And then one follow-on question, Ajei. Cadence announced an electromagnetic solver, what appears to be coming into one of your core pillars of strength. What are you seeing in terms of the competitive landscape? And do you think this is going to be the beginning of others that tried to go after those or adjacent marketplaces? -- So thanks, Sterling. I mentioned -- I talked a little bit about HFSS in my script. But perhaps it's worth -- since you asked the question, it's worth emphasizing a couple of points. The first thing to understand is ANSYS HFSS serves an important and growing market and is the gold standard, it is the industry-leading product.It's solves -- HFSS solves some of the most complex electromagnetic problems, spans a vast number of industries and it covers both the RF in the SI space. So this includes problems in high-growth areas that range from radar in autonomous vehicles to phase their antenna for 5G telecom to IC circuits, frankly, that are in all manner of electronic products. So it's no surprise to us and it's no wonder that other vendors want to compete in this growing space. But the point is, competing isn't that easy.We are today the leader in this space and we've been for -- we've been the leader for almost three decades. And customers have trusted HFSS for decades to solve their most complex problems and they continue to place their confidence in us. We are technology with references in tens of thousands of peer-published IEEE publications. We are absolutely justified in saying that we're the industry's gold standard.And we've been able to maintain our leadership because we've continue to make significant investments in HFSS over the years. And the product today incorporates breakthroughs in both methods, which is starting the physics, as well as in processing sort of the computer science. So to give you some details, customers trust the accuracy of HFSS because of our technology and leadership, and one example is in the area of automatic adaptive mesh refinement, which provides accurate, consistent and repeatable answers within an air tolerance specified by users. And this is the cornerstone required for predicting accurate answers and frankly, why so many global customers trust HFSS to solve their electromagnetic challenges.HFSS today is available, of course, on-prem for customers to use within their own data centers, but it's also available in the public cloud and this month, natively on Azure with the ANSYS cloud offering that I just talked about. To give you some perspective of performance, in a recent benchmark, HFSS solved an IoT PCB using 128 cores, which is a pretty typical customer configuration. 128 cores resulting in a 40x speed up versus one core. And so to put that in perspective, that's approximately an hour versus approximately 40 hours.And that's impressive. And it's also important to note that as per the previous comment I made about cloud that the cloud will democratize that scalability and it'll make it available for every single customer. And then we've introduced some technology that reduces RAM consumption by a factor of three. So in the customer benchmark that I just mentioned, RAM usage went down from 176 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes, again, significantly improving solid efficiency.HFSS is a great product that serves customers around the world in an attractive market. The competitive mode around the product, the competitive mode around HFSS it's brought, it's deep and it's filled with hungry alligators. PowerPoint presentations are easy, products are hard.The next question comes from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. So I wonder if you could talk about the decline in EMEA for the quarter? Was it due strictly to tough comps or are there any other factors involved? And if you are satisfied with the performance there? -- Yeah. Jason, it is exactly what you mentioned. It was -- if you recall last year EMEA grew in double-digits, it's just the timing of some large deals that were in Q1 of last year that did not repeat this year. So we are very excited about our EMEA business and our EMEA team.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for closing remarks. -- Thank you, operator. Given the strength of our Q1, our robust pipeline of direction channel and partner-driven deals and our partner leadership across physics, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our goals and objective. ANSYS is well-positioned to broaden our market opportunity and to extend our leadership in both the near term, as well as in the long term. That conference is made possible due to the tireless work of customers, partners and of course, my ANSYS colleagues.Thank you, all, for your efforts, and thank you for another exceptional quarter. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I look forward to the next call. Enjoy the rest of your day.[Operator signoff]\u00a0 --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of engineering-simulation software is expected to pos  of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +39.3%.Revenues are expected to be $362.06 million, up 19.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Ansys, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ansys will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ansys would pos  of $1.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.31, delivering a surprise of +25.96%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ansys doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ansys is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Ansys imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power o  estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see  .This maker of engineering-simulation software is expected to earn $5.33 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2018, which represents a year-over-year change of 32.9%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ansys. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.5%.Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn The upgrade of Ansys to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Earnings surged 39% on a year-over-year basis to $1.46 per share, according to ASC 605 standard.Non-GAAP revenues of almost $293 million (per ASC 606) comfortably surpassed the higher end of the guided range of $265-$285 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $284 million.Non-GAAP revenues increased 11.3% (11.9% in constant currency) from the year-ago quarter to $307.9 million, according to ASC 605 standard. Year-over-year revenue growth was driven by double-digit growth across lease, maintenance and service revenues.Per ASC 606, ANSYS expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.39 to $1.55 per share for fourth-quarter 2018. Non-GAAP revenues are anticipated in the range of $352 million to $372 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share, reflecting year-over-year increase of 39.3%. Further, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $362.1 million, up 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Robust investments in autonomous vehicles, electrification, smart, connected solutions and 5G were a tailwind. Customers' focus on utilizing simulation across repair, maintenance and other overhaul projects was a positive. Budgetary increase in allocation for defense spending across Europe and the United States favored growth in aerospace and defense domains.In the last reported quarter, ANSYS unveiled the latest Pervasive Engineering Simulation offerings, named ANSYS 19.2 to accelerate problem-solving capabilities across its comprehensive portfolio. It is anticipated to enhance the company's go-to-market strategy.The company's Startup Program is benefiting more than 500 young companies globally by providing them with ANSYS solutions to build next generation product and services, which is a positive.ANSYS' success with RedHawk-SC is evident from its robust adoption by hardware startups. Notably, the company is focused on chip development for artificial intelligence. Further, its RedHawk customers have started deploying the same in their complex products and design. This is expected to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, ANSYS acquired France-based OPTIS. In fact, OPTIS' feature-rich virtual reality (VR) platform is expected to complement ANSYS' offerings to help automotive manufacturers supply safer driverless vehicles. Safer navigation is ensured by development of futuristic camera, lidar and radar.With this buyout, ANSYS is set to introduce ANSYS VRXPERIENCE, which will simulate the vehicle's reaction to critical situation. This is anticipated to bolster customer experience.The buyout of 3DSIM, a leading additive manufacturing simulation technology provider, will help ANSYS to foray into 3D metal printing and access the industry's only complete additive manufacturing simulation workflow. This will enhance ANSYS's presence in the competitive simulations market.Notably, the backlog for the company in the last reported quarter increased 13.8% year over year to $761.6 million, which is a positive.However, margin is anticipated to remain under pressure as ANSYS continues to invest in product development.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $145.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $142.35 (before broker commissions).

(NASDAQ: ANSS)Q3 2018 Nov. 08, 2018 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to ANSYS' Third Quarter 2018 .With us today are Ajei Gopal, Chief Executive Officer; Maria Shields, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations. Please note the event is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks. -- Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks document have been posted on the homepage of our new and improved Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and business update, as well as our updated Q4 and fiscal year 2018 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and certainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the Company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business, as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum.During this call and in the prepared remarks, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, unless otherwise stated. Please take any reference to revenue to mean revenue under ASC 606 unless we explicitly note that we are referring to ASC 605 results. Note that all references to growth will be in terms of ASC 605 results, since we have no baseline for last year under 606. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures under both ASC 605 and 606 are included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal for his opening remarks. Ajei? -- Thank you, Annette, and good morning everyone. Q3 was yet another exceptional quarter. We exceeded the high end of our Q3 revenue and our earnings per share guidance by $8 million and $0.24 respectively. Our revenue growth, as measured under ASC 605 was 12% leading to record third quarter 605 revenue and earnings per share. We recorded $762 million of deferred revenue and backlog, as measured in the ASC 605, which represents a 14% year-over-year increase.Our ACV growth in constant currency was outstanding at over 13% for the quarter and at 11% year-to-date. This reflects strong customer demand for ANSYS solutions and our ongoing success in the market. Given our robust performance to-date in 2018 and the strength of our pipeline going into the last quarter of the year, we are increasing our revenue, our EPS and our operating cash flow guidance for the full year. We're also raising ACV guidance at the midpoint. Maria will provide more details in a few minutes.In Q3, we recorded numerous six figure deals across several major verticals. With the race to 5G and High Gear, the high-tech vertical performed well with leading communications companies choosing ANSYS' in part because of the multi-physic design capabilities enabled by a chip package system workflow. Our market-leading capabilities in enabling electrification and autonomy drove customer investments across the automotive sector. The aerospace and defense sector performed well, as investment is increasing in the US and Europe. The industrial equipment vertical, particularly the rotating machinery market is also benefiting from the recovery in oil and gas.In Q3, we also saw an increase in investment from the healthcare industry. We work with healthcare leaders such as Medtronic for many years on the use of in silico medicine to advance medical device design. At the September meeting, our Avicenna Alliance, a global alliance of healthcare industries and researchers that was set up at the request of the European Commission, Medtronic reported that modeling and simulation helped them release a product to market two years earlier, treating 10,000 patients during this period and saving an estimated $10 million.From a geographic perspective, ASC 605 revenues grew double-digits in the Americas and Europe, while Asia-Pacific grew 9% all in constant currency. Our three largest markets, the US, Japan and Germany led our performance in the quarter each with double-digit revenue growth. Our new go-to-market strategy, which we described at Investor Day last year is seeing success. Our approach enables us to effectively grow and close large enterprise deals, while efficiently addressing the large volume of our transactional business. We are intelligently matching a customer size, location and level of simulation sophistication with our routes to market, which include the use of strategic sales team, territory sales, indirect channel partners and inside sales reps.For our largest global customers, we are employing a higher touch direct sales model. In Q3, we had 30 customers with orders of over $1 million, which is a 20% increase compared to last year's Q3. About 80% of these customers license solutions from at least three of our product lines. Our top 100 customers year-to-date represent over 40% of our total sales illustrating our success and more deeply penetrating our largest accounts.One such account is Airbus Defense and Space, a global leader in its industry extended the use of ANSYS' core solutions to reduce their time-to-market from 15 years to 7 years, while accelerating their development cycle. Leveraging our solutions for autonomy and digital twins, Airbus Defense and Space is relying on ANSYS solutions to enable the future development of their autonomous innovation.Our investments in incremental field engineering resources have also been instrumental in helping to expand our relationships at the enterprise and at strategic account level. This is reflected not only in the overall growth in our software and maintenance revenue, but also in the -- over 30% growth of our services revenue for both the quarter and the first nine months of 2018. Services can help with enterprise adoption and more challenging customer solutions and will be an ongoing area of incremental investment. However, we expect services revenue to remain a relatively small portion of our overall revenue even into the future.While large deals are important to us remember that close to 60% of our total sales comes from customers not in the top 100. So an equally important aspect of our go-to-market is the use of direct territory sales, inside sales and channel partners to efficiently reach a large number of smaller customers. (technical difficulty) success in that effort by bringing in numerous new commercial logos in Q3 with particular strength in the electronics, industrial equipment, automotive industries. In addition, our start-up program, which provides qualifying businesses with our solutions at a discount has enrolled over 550 companies. Working with these exciting young companies ensures that ANSYS will play a key role in their product development processes, as they grow and require additional simulation solutions.Our indirect channel, which currently represents 24% of our total revenue continues to perform well and saw an increased volume of smaller deals. We're continuing to execute on our channel expansion plans, adding eight new channel partners in Q3, including Kreative Technologies (ph) and runSimulation (ph), two of the largest autodesk resellers in North America. Globally, we are seeing great collaborating between our inside sales and territory account reps, as well as increased investment by our channel partners, which enables us to rapidly expand our reach.One of our long-standing channel partners ESSS in Brazil recently closed a large deal that strengthens our relationship with global energy leader, Petrobras. The agreement with ANSYS allows Petrobras to leverage the latest enhancements to the ANSYS simulation platform and gives Petrobras access to leading-edge products for engineering simulation, as well as local support from ESSS. Engineering simulation tools and HPC capabilities are essential to Petrobras' oil and gas exploration and production R&D activities.Let me now shift to partnerships, which are a key component of our growth strategy. Through deep collaboration with our partners, we are able to provide customers a greater value in solving new classes of problems. Furthermore, we can expand our addressable opportunity by reaching new customers and potentially new markets through our partners' channels.In March, this year Synopsys released their ICC2 with integrated ANSYS' RedHawk power integrity and reliability sign-off technology. This will enable robust design optimization for next generation, high performance computing, mobile and automotive products. While it is still early days, we are pleased by the response from their customers.Our partnership with SAP is based on a new offering on SAP's cloud platform called SAP Predictive Engineering Insights enabled by ANSYS, which incorporates the ANSYS' digital twin technology. The long-term opportunity here is very exciting, although we expect customer adoption to be deliberate, as they go from an initial pilot to deployment at scale. Our partnership with PTC is based on a new offering from them called Creo Simulation Live that embeds the breakthrough simulation capabilities of ANSYS Discovery Live into PTC's Creo CAD solution. The development is on track and PTC will soon be starting early trials of the new offering. Finally, also during Q3, semiconductor giant, TSMC honored us with three partner of the year awards for our work with them on 3-D ICs and 7-nanometer process nodes.Switching gears, I would now like to talk about how we are continuing to drive innovation across our business. In Q3, we released ANSYS 19.2, which includes numerous advancements across our product portfolio. We improved speed, reliability and usability, and we introduced a new patent-pending mosaic meshing capabilities for fluids that delivers higher quality results that faster than before. In one use case, our mosaic mesh requires 34% less memory and delivered a solution 47% faster than previous solutions.In addition, we announced a new fluid task-based workflow, which guides the engineer through the simulation process providing best practices, as defaults. The first release allows users to prep and mesh watertight geometries using 70% fewer clicks and 50% less hands-on time than before.In ANSYS 19.2, we added several important capabilities to our electronic solutions. We enhanced our Icepak electronics cooling solution to include faster modeling of IC packages and support for connecting heat sources from multiple analysis. Our HFSS 3D component library was expanded again to help collaboration, save time and improve accuracy. We added the TDK RF chip antenna library, and we just signed an agreement with Modelithics, a third-party model vendor to create a library of 3D encrypted components targeting 5G design.ANSYS 19.2 furthers our vision of making simulation pervasive across the product life cycle. As we move from product design to manufacturing with 19.2, we have fully integrated the technology form our 3DSIM acquisition, giving ANSYS the only complete design, to analysis, to print additive manufacturing simulation workflow. Additionally, our additive solutions now include physics-driven lattice optimization and we're seeing customer success. A leading aerospace contractor invested in ANSYS' Additive Print to help optimize their additive manufacturing processes and a major medical device manufacturer chose ANSYS' Additive Suite to reduce failed build.As we have highlighted since its release in Q1, our Discovery family of products is also helping us make simulation pervasive by extending our reach to the early part of the product design phase. Our newest discovery release features the first near real-time 3D parameter studies enabling designers to analyze hundreds of designs points in minutes. We're seeing strong interest with the number of initial purchases by major and strategic customers significantly increased in Q3 over Q2.Discovery is being used by customers in ways that we did not expect. A large automotive supplier was struggling to improve its bidding process for customer RFQs. The problem was that bid submission was bottlenecked waiting for skilled analysts to validate the bid through simulation. The company purchased Discovery for its design engineers, so that the required simulation could be performed by the designers without having to wait for an analyst. Based on a pilot with Discovery, the customer estimates that it can reduce RFQ response times by up to 75% allowing them to bid on more business leading to increased revenue.Finally, I would like to introduce the newest member of the ANSYS' executive team, Dr. Prith Benerjee, who recently joined us as our Chief Technology Officer. A brilliant technologist, Prith brings an exceptional blend of experiences to ANSYS. He has had very successful careers both in academia and in industry and has earned multiple honors. Prith was a Chaired Professor and a Dean of Engineering. He led one of the most iconic industry research labs, and he served as CTO at two of the top global industrial companies. He also founded two start-ups in the electronic space. This unique mix of experiences makes him the perfect person to help guide our technology innovation and long-term product strategy.Before I turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financial results, I would like to acknowledge the most recent milestone in her stellar career at ANSYS. This is Maria's 20th year as CFO of ANSYS and today is her 80th . Congratulations, Maria and over to you. -- Thank you so much, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ajei, we delivered another quarter of outstanding result. This is quite an accomplishment for our team, when you consider the comparable of Q3, 2017 in which we reported both double-digit top line and EPS growth. I will take a few minutes to add some additional commentary around our third quarter financial performance and we'll close with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q4 and 2018.Just as a reminder, during this first year of adoption of revenue recognition under ASC 606, we have been and will continue to provide financial results and outlook under both ASC 605 and 606 through the end of this year. Beginning in 2019, we will transition to only reporting our financial results under ASC 606. In addition, any comments that I make relative to growth rates will be comparing 2018 to 2017 results under ASC 605 and in constant currency. I'll provide key financial metrics under both 605 and 606 and consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.Our Q3 results reflect continued strong momentum and execution across the business. We reported total revenue under ASC 605 of $308 million or constant currency revenue growth of 12%. Operating margins and EPS were above the high end of our guidance under both ASC 605 and 606. Our ongoing record of execution in the quarter and the first nine months gives us confidence that we are on a path to continue to make progress against our strategic priorities and to deliver another record year of financial results in 2018.Key financial metrics for the quarter begin with constant currency ACV growth, up over 13%. Third quarter revenue under ASC 605 and 606 totaled $308 million and $293 million respectively. Both results included negative currency impact of approximately $2 million, as compared to the prior year quarter.The increase in software license sales combined with strong maintenance renewals contributed to our deferred revenue and backlog under 605 of $762 million, representing a record Q3 high and a 14% increase over last year's comparable balance. Deferred revenue and backlog under ASC 606, totaled $545 million. Total recurring revenue for the quarter under 605 grew 15% in constant currency to a total of $238 million or 77% of total revenue.Lease and maintenance revenue each grew 15% indicative of strong renewals and expansions within our global customer base, as well as the value that our customers place on the ongoing investment in innovation and the high quality of our support services. This increase in our recurring revenue stream was fairly balanced across each of the three major geographies, each of which delivered double-digit constant currency growth in both lease and maintenance. Under 606, recurring revenue totaled $218 million or 74% of total revenue. Under either accounting method, our large base of recurring revenue gives us good predictability around our future performance.The strong top line helped to drive a third quarter gross margin of 90% under both 605 and 606 and an operating margin of 46.7% under 605 and 44% under 606. The Q3 operating margins were above the high end of the guidance ranges that we previously provided and were positively impacted by a combination of strong revenue result and a slower pace of hiring than we had planned for the quarter. These hiring delays were attributable to the summer season and a relatively more challenging hiring environment for certain positions and geographies. It is our intention to continue to aggressively recruit and hire according to our plans, to ensure that we have a solid foundation for continued success, as we enter 2019.We reported record third quarter EPS of $1.46 under 605 and $1.31 under 606. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q3 was 14%, which was below the lower end of the range that we had guided coming into the quarter. As we had previously communicated, the Q3 rate was positively impacted by a non-recurring net tax benefit related to certain subsidiary activities, including entity structuring that were finalized in the third quarter.The total net benefit recorded in Q3 was $7 million or $0.08. The Q3 tax rate also benefited from an income mix in the quarter, which was much more domestically weighted and additional R&E credit that were above what we had forecasted. Looking ahead, we have updated our estimate and expect our effective tax rate to be in range of 21.5% to 22.5% for Q4, which would translate to a range of 19% to 20% for the full year.Our cash flow from operations totaled $110 million for the third quarter and $354 million for the first nine months. We closed the quarter with a total of $729 million in cash and short-term investments, of which 77% is held domestically. In line with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares during the quarter and 1.2 million during the first nine months at a total cost of $75 million and $193 million, respectively. Currently, we have 4.3 million shares available for repurchase.Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. We are updating guidance for the fourth quarter and expect non-GAAP revenue under ASC 605 in the range of $337 million to $347 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.26 to $1.32. Non-GAAP revenue under ASC 606 is in the range of $352 million to $372 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range $1.39 to $1.55. For the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS outlook for ASC 606.Under 605, we are also increasing our EPS and maintaining our revenue outlook, while absorbing some slight currency headwind. These increases in our outlook reflect the strong performance in the third quarter combined with our confidence in continued positive business momentum for the remainder of the year. This translates into our updated guidance for 2018 of non-GAAP revenue under ASC 605 in the range of $1,229,000,000 to $1,239,000,000 (ph) or constant currency growth of 10% to 11% and EPS in the range of $5.18 to $5.24. Non-GAAP revenue under ASC 606 is in the range of $1,237,000,000 to $1,257,000,000 (ph) and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.41.With respect to the contribution from the OPTIS business, our outlook remains largely in line with what we had communicated since we closed the acquisition in early May or a range of $25 million to $26 million of revenue for 2018. We are also updating the midpoint of our ACV outlook for 2018 to factor in both the strong Q3 result, as well as our increased confidence, since we last provided guidance. Our increased outlook for ACV is a range of $1,262,000,000 to $1,282,000,000 (ph). This represents constant currency ACV growth of 11% to 13% over the 2017 baseline.And we are also increasing our outlook for annual operating cash flows to a range of $455 million to $480 million. For modeling purposes, we are expecting fourth quarter operating margins of 40% to 41% under ASC 605 and 43% to 45% under ASC 606. Fourth quarter, operating expenses reflect disproportionately higher sales commissions and increased personnel and department structuring expenses, including an expectation for an accelerated pace of hiring, as compared to Q3. For the full year, we expect operating margins of 44% to 45% under 605 and 44.5% to 45.5% under 606. I would like to highlight the fact that on an annual basis, we plan to finish largely in line with or slightly ahead of the operating margin target that we had committed to coming into the year.The importance of annual as supposed (ph) to quarterly margins will become a more important consideration, as we transition to solely reporting under 606 in 2019. Further details around specific currency rate and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q4 and 2018 are contained in the prepared remarks document. I'd like to remind everyone that we will be providing our initial outlook for 2019 in February, when we announce our final Q4 and 2018 result, and after we have finalized our annual planning process, which is currently under way.In summary, we are pleased to have delivered another excellent quarter with strength across all of our key financial metrics, ACV top line growth, operating margins, EPS, operating cash flows and deferred revenue and backlog. Our strong third quarter performance combined with the business result from the first nine months, give us confidence that our continued focus on execution and investing in the business supplemented by the large base of recurring business, strong customer relationships and a healthy sales pipeline provide a solid foundation to deliver on our 2018 goals, as well as our longer-term 2020 financial target.Operator, we will now open the phone lines to start the Q&A.We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) In the interest of time, please only ask one question, so we can get to as many possible through the queue. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim. Please go ahead. -- Hey, Ajei. So you guys saw a nice uptick in ACV growth. Can you maybe dive in a little deeper on kind of what the key drivers are, was it attached pricing, better utilization. And then on the flip side, maybe help us reconcile the solid ACV growth with -- with the -- with the decline, the 13% decline in bookings for -- for the quarter? -- So let me address -- maybe ask Maria to address the second part of the question, first and then I'll come back to the first part. -- Yeah. So Ken, I think can if you take a look we've gotten away from disclosing bookings because of the volatility that 606 introduces. But and the short answer is, if you take a look at last year's Q3, when we announced at that time, the largest deal in the company's history that drove bookings to a 38% growth, which it could -- should come as no surprise that because those multiyear deals are going to have a tendency to fall in different quarters that can drive the volatility in the bookings number. And that's why we've been communicating that we think it's better for people to focus on ACV, as a leading indicator of the health of the business and how we're doing against our sales performance. -- And as far as the drivers for the ACV growth were concerned, I think I addressed some of them in my -- in my comments in the script. Essentially, we saw -- we saw strong performance across all of the geographies, and we saw really good performance in -- in the verticals, in the industries, pretty much across all of them and I called out a few of them. And I think that's reflective of two things, one is, there is tremendous market demand for the kinds of solutions and products that we offer our customers, and obviously, our customers think that we have a terrific capabilities to bring to market as well. So I think you put it all together, great demand for our offerings, great technology, great capabilities, we were able to execute that. And then as I've finally said in my comments, we -- the go-to-market that we introduced about a year ago is successful, it's being -- it's, we're seeing results and -- and that's also attributed to our success this quarter.The next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Either for Ajei or Maria, question on the macro. The results from the commentary suggest that the environment out there is pretty stable. So I'll ask the forward-looking question, which is what are some of the leading indicators in your business that may or may not indicate any type of slowing. And how do you think about the sensitivity of the business, if some of your customers still come under pressure -- come under pressure into next year? Thank you. -- Well, obviously, we can look at the overall pipeline that we've in our business and we've a -- we've a pretty deep level of conversation with some of our customers. As I -- as I explained in the call, we've some of our revenue that comes from large customers and we're deeply engaged with them. And we have a certain amount of the businesses just drive through the more transactional channels that we -- that we have in the market.We are currently seeing a very strong pipeline. As you know over three quarters of our business, take 77% of our business come through recurring revenue, so that's very stable. And we continue to see good demand for -- for what we're doing. So with that high recurring revenue, the strong diversity across the geographies that I mentioned, the diversity across industries, the good technology, the multiple routes to market, we're not -- we feel very confident in our business. We're not seeing any slowdown in the pace of customer interest.We're not seeing any slowdown in the sense of customer urgency. And in fact, it's quite the contrary, if you start to look at some of these broader conversations that we're having with customers it's about how their business is going to get transformed. We are having conversations with automotive companies about helping them with ADAS and self-driving vehicles, and the market demand for those are so high, customers are investing in those areas. We're having conversations with customers about electrification and we're having success in that space. 5G all of these are areas, where customers continue to make investments. And with the breadth and the depth of our technology, we are addressing some of the most pressing problems and product design today, and so, we are very excited about our future.The next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow-up on -- on the margin commentary and so you expect operating margins to come at the high end or perhaps better than what you originally expected coming into the year? So just perhaps some commentary on what's driving that? Is it -- is it just a factor of delayed hiring? Or are there other factors involved in -- in margins coming in better than expected? Thanks. -- Yeah. So I would say for the quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, it was really two things, one the reality is the summer season and a third of our business is -- comes out of EMEA, which tends to have a -- a even extended time-off period, which -- which caused delays in primarily hiring, which is about 70% of our spend today. So -- so the combination of the summer season, as well as the unique talent that we are looking for whether it's in R&D or field engineering, in particular, which are two areas that we are disproportionately targeting to hire into, it is -- it is a bit more challenging than say three years or four years ago. So we'll continue to aggressively hire, so that we can position ourselves well, as we head into 2019 given all the opportunities that we see ahead of us.The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, when you look into Q4 and perhaps into 2019, could you comment on how you're thinking about growth by end market in the most recent trailing 12-month period, you certainly had quite good bookings growth for aero and A&D, but the comps for auto are going to get increasingly difficult for the next few quarters anyway. So when you look at your other verticals, could you comment perhaps on how you think industrial, materials, electronics and so forth might perform in terms of your assumptions for the next period?Also on the hiring front, you're not alone in looking, particularly for AEs, all of your engineering peers' Cadence, Synopsis, PTC and others are looking to do the same thing. So there is clearly a race on that -- that kind of personnel (ph) capacity measuring now across the industry at least in the 100. So could you comment on -- on the availability and perhaps, how you are targeting your AE hiring by BU? -- So to the second questions about -- about recruiting, obviously we are looking for highly skilled individuals across a number of specifics -- number of our areas of physics, and we are investing across the -- across the board. And so, yes it is competitive. And obviously, we -- we feel like, we have a great value proposition for our -- for our employees and is driven by a number of things one is we think we have really exciting products, and we serve really exciting customers, and I think that that's a factor that causes people to want to come here.We also continue to build out academic dealerships from a purposes of recruiting. We're a quality place to work. We are building the right -- right levels of relationships that we need. So while we -- while we are continuing to be as Maria said a little bit behind the curve, in terms of recruiting, we have been recruiting and we are excited about our opportunities to continue to be able to recruit in the future. And -- and we are cranking up the engine, as we -- as we go into next year. So that's the first -- that's the first piece of the question, the first part of the -- the second part of the question.The first part of your question was around the verticals. And I think as I said in the -- in the comments, we see activity across all of the different verticals. I mentioned high-tech, you mentioned automotive in your question, we also mentioned -- I mentioned high-tech in the -- in the comments. We've also had our aerospace and defense some fair amount of activity this quarter and we see that in our pipeline as well. So I'm -- I'm actually seeing a relatively broad industry split, and I'm -- I don't see any particular area that we would look at and say, hey this is an area of concern.The next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. To follow-up on some of the -- the subject matter earlier, I realize it's early, but I was wondering if you could rank some of the factors that might positively impact ACV growth in 2019. I mean, contrast that with some factors that might represent a headwind? -- So I would say the same factors that are impacting ACV growth this year, we expect to continue into next year. So at the top of the funnel, we'll continue to see progress relative to our enterprise and strategic accounts, as they continue to expand usage, adopt new users. We think Discovery Live, as we continue to see broader adoption of that product in our enterprise accounts will drive ACV growth.And at -- at the -- in the momentum and -- and territory accounts, we are seeing good progress as well, and our channel is -- is very strong and delivering good new business growth. So I would -- I would say the same factors that we're seeing driving double-digit ACV growth this year, we'll expect as -- as we enter into 2019 and we'll talk about more of that in February, when we get deeper into our guidance and outlook around 2019. -- And just to amplify the comments that Maria just made and I talked a little bit about this in my comments as well, we've taken a -- we've taken a thoughtful approach to go-to-market. And for the larger accounts, where we see more opportunity, we're investing more with those customers, and that includes with certain -- with certain customers doing a little bit of an incremental services. And what that's translating to is, our opportunity to deliver broad-based solutions to these customers, which mean -- which means larger deals. It means multi-physics deals and it means multiyear deeper levels of engagement. So all of that drives customer activity. It drives the size of the -- it drives the size of the opportunities and obviously, it drives the annualized view of what our -- what the numbers look like and that's reflected in the ACV. So that's -- that's one piece of it.We've also made investments in our ACE organization this year and we're continuing to make investments in the ACE organization. And -- and even though it is -- there is a war for talent, we have been successful in recruiting people. I think in the last quarter, we had an -- we grew our business by net of (technical difficulty), which is quite considerable given -- given that we're a relatively small company, in terms of headcount.So we -- the engine is moving. We're able to bring people on board. And our field engineering organization is able to engage -- our ACE organization is able to engage with customers at the right level and of course, that helps our customers be successful, but it also drives more business for us. And so, there is -- there is a -- there is a number of different dimensions that we've been driving and setting ourselves up for in the last year, essentially along the lines that we talked about in the go-to-market transformation messaging that we gave you guys a year ago at Investor Day. And -- and what you're seeing right now in the results, is the success of what we said we would do and obviously, we see the momentum of this continuing, as we move forward.The next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Want to follow-on in terms of the higher end piece, but want to ask from -- from this standpoint, as you embarked on the effort to improve the overall growth of the company, you mentioned the need for the incremental hires AEs, as Ajei was mentoring et cetera, I just wonder where you feel, we are in the progress of where you think you need to get to in terms of headcount staffing to be able to drive the kind of growth that you want? -- I think we'll talk about our plans for next year in -- and we'll go through our -- our headcount plans for next year, when we -- when we talk about next year's guidance in our -- when we announce Q4 and so that will be in February, I believe. So I think we'll go through more details on that. What I can say is that we made -- we made -- we made a conscious decision this year to bring on board incremental ACE resources significantly more than we had in previous years and we've made good progress toward doing that.The next question comes from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. A couple of regional questions. Understanding you guys just put up a strong quarter in Germany, there has been fairly cautionary comments coming out of the German auto OEMs and likewise the Chinese auto OEMs. So just wondering if you're seeing any hesitation from -- from that kind of perhaps end market weakness they are seeing. And then on South Korea last quarter, you had mentioned you thought that would pick up in the second half and wanted to know, if you thought that would pick up in 4Q since it looks like it didn't pick up in Q3? Thank you. -- So -- so let me -- let me address the -- the question about automotive. As we said, I think pretty consistently over the last few quarters, maybe a year, some of the areas of investment in automotive have to do with -- with ADAS autonomous vehicles, electrification, those were all the big areas, where -- where the OEMs are making, I would say significant levels of investments, and it's not just the OEMs, it's the entire supply chain.If you think about -- if you think about the transformation this represents, it's people retooling to take advantage of different technologies, moving from an internal combustion engine to an electric solution, requires a significant change starting to think about automotive, the testing that's been involved, how you validate autonomous vehicles, all of those are significant changes from business as usual and that's where the investment is taking place in the automotive industry. And frankly, all of that plays directly to our capabilities and our sweet spot. So we feel very confident that the -- that the technologies and the solutions that we provide are in demand, not only by the OEMs, but the entire automotive supply chain. -- Yeah. And -- and on the South Korea question, as -- as we mentioned on the last call, we've been working relative to changes in the go-to-market and working through account assignment because we do have a hybrid model in South Korea. And so as -- as you can imagine working for go-to-market changes don't happen in one quarter. But we're confident based on what we're saying relative to the pipeline and the progress around those, that transformation that we'll continue to see positive results in Q4, and as we enter 2019, as that -- those go-to-market and account assignments are completed.The next question comes from Rob Oliver of Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Good morning. It's Matt Lemenager on behalf of Rob this morning. I had a question on the partnerships. So there is a slew of them now and the number then has kind of ramped over the past 12 months, 24 months. Which are the partnerships, whether it's PTC, SAP maybe Synopsys are expected to have the earliest impact on the P&L? And does late 2019 feel like the right time frame to think about that for -- for that kicking in and having an impact? Thank you. -- Well, I think -- I think the -- the way you should think about these -- these partnerships is that in each one of these -- each one of them is different. And the -- in the first year of the partnerships, they are really building out the product. So you should really expect relatively modest contribution, as the partnership starts to get into -- into high gear. As you well know, these kinds of relationships are multiyear relationships, and these are not quick wins that result in incremental revenue overnight because you're talking about new products being brought to market, you're talking about training additional sales resources and so on and so forth. So I would just urge you to be to -- well, the way we think about these partnerships is that these are strategically important, but these are long-term -- these are long-term activities. And as we think about our business, they represent -- they represent an adjacent avenue for growth for us in the long-term.The next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush. Please go ahead. -- Hi and sort of thanks for taking my question. Congrats to Maria here on your 80th earnings anniversary, I got ways (ph) to catch up with you Maria. -- Thank you. -- I'm -- oh, yeah. So Rob kind of got at some of it. I was going to ask about kind of the sequencing of the adjacencies in terms of what -- what most significant, currently I imagine, I don't know is fairly significant the -- the autonomous was contributing somewhat. And then what -- what's the longer -- how -- how do they sequence longer-term, in terms of what -- what looks potentially the largest down the road? But if I could just maybe add to that as well, I am wondering what -- what if anything is the opportunity to apply more IP in the area of machine learning and AI to any of these adjacencies? And -- and also more broadly, in the domain of comp size, type IP? What -- what sorts of things would you like to see to accelerate your road map? -- So couple of quick questions about -- about -- so that the -- the ordering of some of these adjacencies. Obviously, we've products in the market with respect to the -- to the Discovery family of products today. Again, that's early, but -- but I gave a couple of examples, of our customers and obviously our relationship with PTC, as I described is based upon them bringing a product to market -- bringing a product to market actually relatively soon. Jim Heppelmann, who is the CEO of PTC has described the Discovery Live technology as being jaw-dropping and -- and I think that they're very excited about that as they bring -- as they bring the technology to market. So I think that that's a -- that's obviously something that we see happening in the shorter term.We -- we did an acquisition of OPTIS earlier this year and OPTIS gave us some really important technology with respect t -- with respect to OPTIS lidar, radar. And -- and we also have now, as a result of the OPTIS solution, we have a closed-loop -- a closed-loop simulation environment that allows us to be successful. We believe in the ADAS testing space, so that -- to allow our customers to validate miles without having to physically drive miles, but use -- use testing and use simulation, as a way of being able to validate -- validate the functions of an autonomous vehicle. So that's another area, where we've made investments. We talked about it last year. We have made investments and we are delivering product in the market place today.So I think those are -- those are some areas. In the -- as you think about digital twin, those represent a little bit further out, I would say than -- than some of these other areas because digital twin is a -- is still -- is still I would say, a number of customers are very excited about the technology, but it represents a longer-term roll out because it requires the change in the way people think about how they are maintaining their equipment, the way they are managing their businesses. And so, there is a -- I would say that that's a little bit longer term, as we think about some of these adjacencies. And so -- so that perhaps give you some context.To your second -- to your second point about machine learning, look we believe that physics-based simulation and machine learning AI are very complementary, and we believe that our hybrid approach is quite viable and could be very valuable. And we've embraced and we've used machine learning methods and tools for quite some time actually well before the current buzz around this area. And as with everything that we do, our objective is to make sure that we can advance the capabilities of the physics-based simulation that we bring to market.And so -- I'll give you a couple of example. So our RedHawk-SC product, it's based on big data and machine learning techniques to enable rapid design exploration (ph). And the whole idea is that using this technology,, where it -- which combines machine learning and physics-based simulation and engineers can now make better design decisions than they could before. We're also making use of machine learning techniques for example, in specific use cases, for example, we're looking -- we're figuring out and inferring the optical properties of materials, where we're using machine learning in -- in some of the ADAS scenario generation, so to be able to do automated testing for ADAS, you want to automatically generate road scenarios, we're using machine learning to help do that.We're -- we're using machine learning to help design smart assistance to gauge HPC resource usage and so on. So we're very confident about where we're going. We think that AI and machine learning techniques will complement what we are doing. And our traditional simulation technology, physics-based simulation and for our customers, we think that means that they can just be more efficient and effective when designing their products.The next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Thanks so much. Maria, I just wanted to ask if we look at 606 and 605, obviously 605 revenues are tightened, but maintained for the year, 606 are going up. And I think I understand the implications of a shift to lease versus perpetual and how that impacts 606. But is there anything else happening on lease that is having an influence rather than just that mix shift? And I guess specifically, anything happening on average duration of these deals that would also be impacting the amount of revenue, if they gets (ph) booked to perpetual with that shift? -- Relative to duration Ross, no. There has been no change in duration. What I'd say is on the 606 front, as we've been saying all year, the -- the multiyear lease deals particular in the larger accounts are heavily skewed to Q4 mostly around customers' year end spending and budgeting and planning activities. So -- so the disparity between 605 and 606 is largely driven by the difference in revenue recognition, as well as the timing of larger deals that drive some of the volatility depending on the timing of when they close under 606.The next question comes from Alex Frankiewicz of Berenberg. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just had a question on Discovery Live, in terms of general adoption. How is that going versus the plan so far? And do you see any potential competition arising from Altair's recent acquisition of SIMSOLID? -- So we're actually very pleased with the -- the adoption of Discovery Live. We continue to see good customer traction, I -- I gave you an example. And -- and there are a couple of kinds of customers, who are looking at Discovery Live are one -- one, is of course, the larger customers, where we historically had some technology and they are looking at the use of Discovery by their design teams and -- and that leads to a subsequent purchase and then -- then larger purchases down the road.And then the second area is, we are seeing customers, who have previously never used simulation before, being able to use Discovery because it's just so easy for them to use. So I'm actually -- I think we're pretty much on where we expected to be with respect to our internal milestones both from a customer adoption perspective, as well as from a product or lease perspective. And since the launch in February, we've had two major product releases and we continue to add technology and capabilities to our product. So I'm very excited about that.You asked -- you asked a comment about competition, is perhaps helpful to -- to sort of just reflect on exactly what Discovery Live is. Discovery Live is fundamentally trailblazing technology and it sets the bar for transformative user experience for design engineers. Now, we know that others see the -- they recognize the same opportunity that we see, and this is an opportunity, where ANSYS can fundamentally change product design by democratizing (ph) simulation. And well, we see competitors incrementally improving existing tools and technologies either by organic activities or through acquisitions, we've yet to see frankly anything as transformative as Discovery Live. We believe Discovery Live is in a class of its own, and I -- and I referenced some of the comments from PTC, for example earlier on this.You got to realize that Discovery Live builds on a whole new solver architecture and that -- that's based on GPU. It's essentially orders of magnitude faster than traditional 3D method and it supports multiple physics and multi-physics simulation, and that gives design engineers, the -- the intuitive insight that they're expecting. I mean it essentially makes simulation, as easy as a video game for a designer. So -- so we -- we don't -- we are excited about the technology. We don't see -- we think the bar is very high and we're not -- we're not -- we're not seeing anything else in the marketplace that's like it right now.Now, I'm really excited about the portfolio that we have. With Discovery Live, we've got speed, we've got interactivity. With our flagships solvers, there is an enormous breadth and depth in accuracy, taken together our portfolio frankly, it's simply unrivaled in the industry today.The next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe just one because most of my questions have been answered. Ajei may be for you, you talked about adding on other resellers, notably, a couple of that were some large autodesk resellers. Can you just maybe give us some broad brushes on the strategy there? And perhaps, how Discovery Live could maybe work with other CAD tools in addition to PTC? -- I think -- I think the -- the comment that you made about working with resellers, we've a pretty broad strategy for our reseller community around the world. And we're essentially looking to -- in key areas and for key coverage areas, we are looking to bring resellers on board, who are familiar with simulation, who understands what we do and are in a position to broaden our go-to-market. And the -- the two, and the examples that I gave in the -- my prepared remarks were for example, the companies that has been able to satisfy those metrics and are able to -- to help us and of course, we can help them with -- with great product and great capabilities.As far as -- as far as Discovery Live is concerned, we believe that it's a -- it's a simulation, it's a simulation (ph) solution. Discovery Live is not a CAD offering. It's a -- it's CAD agnostic. We're not a CAD offering. The guys that do CAD do a number of number things that Discovery Live has no intention whatsoever of doing. Discovery Live is a simulation solution and it works with -- it works with CAD. it adds to CAD, a completely different dimension and -- and that's why customers are excited about it.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal, Chief Executive Officer for any closing remarks. -- Thanks so much, Andrew. So I continue to be extremely pleased with our performance, our outstanding performance through the year and the progress that we're making toward our strategic initiative. Our pervasive simulation strategy is resonating with customers and our broad go-to-market changes are yielding results. We continue to strengthen our core products and we are making the right investments in next generation offerings.And in conclusion, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners. And as always a shout-out to my ANSYS colleagues, thank you all so much for your efforts and thank you for another exceptional quarter. Thank you all for joining the call today.

However, some hardware of the chip was disabled back then.The \"T-Rex,\" as nicknamed by the company, has been designed specifically for artificial intelligence researchers, data science specialists and content creators.A glimpse into the core of the graphics card shows the powerful 24GB high-speed GDDR6 RAM, with ray tracing performance upto 11 Gigarays per second compared with 10 Gigarays per second in the GeForce RTX.The strong lineup of advanced graphics cards has made NVIDIA a favorite graphics card provider among PC makers. The company has always generated substantial revenues from its cards because of the significantly higher functionality.In its last reported quarter, revenues at the GPU business grew 25% year over year to $2.77 billion on the back of strong Datacenter, Professional Visualization and Automotive segments. | Moreover, growth in the company's AI business, backed by the Turing T4 Cloud GPU launch during the last reported quarter, was a feather in the cap.Notably, NVIDIA's other Turing-architecture based GPUs - the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 - have received a positive response from a wide range of customers, including the major movie studios and game developers.Furthermore, the NVIDIA RTX Server, an integral part of the architecture of the Titan RTX GPU, designed for photo-real rendering in the datacenter opens a new market for GPUs. Notably, it has been adopted by key developers like Adobe  , ANSYS  , Autodesk  and Dassault, among others.Management is optimistic about expanding its addressable market with Turing and the recently unveiled software offerings. Growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars are expected to be the company's consistent tailwinds.We note that weakness in the Gaming segment, due to an excess inventory of midrange Pascal products, is an overhang on the company.

(Symbol: ANSS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the December 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ANSS options chain for the new December 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $140.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $136.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ANSS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $149.88/share today.Because the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors considering a purchase of Ansys Inc. (Symbol: ANSS) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $185.58/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the April 2019 put at the $160 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.1% return against the $160 commitment, or a 3.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ANSS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $160 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Ansys Inc. sees its shares fall 13.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $156.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.30 from $160), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Ansys Inc., and highlighting in green where the $160 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the April 2019 put at the $160 strike for the 3.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Ansys Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $185.58) to be 21%.

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and ANSYS wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!Thank you, Annette. And good morning, everyone. Q2 was an excellent quarter across all key metrics which has led to an outstanding first half of 2018. In Q2, we delivered constant currency revenue growth of 105, and our operating margins and EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance under both ASC 605 and 606. Our Q2 605 revenue and EPS are both second-quarter revenue for ANSYS. Our deferred revenue and backlog increased 24% year-over-year to $816 million. Annualized contract value, or ACV, grew 10% in constant currency for the first half of the year. Both of these metrics are leading indicators of the robust health of our business. Given our strong performance to date in 2018 and the strength of our pipeline going into the second half of the year, we're increasing our EPS guidance for the full year.We're also adjusting our revenue guidance to reflect an increase in our constant currency revenue outlook but in the context of an adverse currency impact of about $15 million since we last provided guidance. Maria will provide more details in a few minutes. Large deals helped to drive our success in the quarter with 35 customers recording orders of over a million dollars, an increase of 25% over the second quarter of 2017. These customers tend to buy multiple products from the ANSYS portfolio. And consistent with last quarter, over 75% of these customers purchased products from at least three of our product lines. Our largest customer this quarter had combined orders of over $30 million across four product lines. Our success in engineering services in the context of our momentum with enterprise and strategic accounts is another highlight of this quarter. We reported Q2 and first half constant currency services revenue growth of 40% and 30%, respectively, albeit of a smaller denominator.This is evidence that we are succeeding in leveraging our world-class engineering services talents to drive customer adoption of our portfolio. This is a direct result of the focus and incremental investments we have made in our field engineering team and in our go-to-market strategy around this important class of customers. I'm delighted with the performance of our North American business and with the ongoing recovery of our European business. Europe grew 11% and 10% in constant currency in Q2 and the first half, respectively, continuing the significant turnaround for that region. As we had planned, sales in Asia Pacific are backend loaded this year. And hence, APJ had a relatively slower growth to the quarter and the first half. I'm excited that our key regions of China and Japan delivered solid revenue growth for the quarter. However, the slower pace of implementation of go-to-market changes in South Korea impacted performance in that country.And some centralized purchasing of enterprise deals muted results in India. With an expanded pipeline of larger deals, the ongoing addition of incremental enterprise sales resources in the region, and the completion of our go-to-market changes, we are optimistic about our Asia Pacific performance in the second half of the year. Representing about 24% of total revenue, our indirect channel is a key area of focus. During the first half of 2018, we added 11 new channel partners, including eight in Europe. We also increased our elite channel partners to 20 from an initial group of five. Our channel partners' certification levels across our product portfolio has also increased. And they continue to add sales capacity and technical resources and enhance their capabilities. From an industry perspective, automotive and high tech continue to perform strongly with notable wins driven by the rise in electronics and the push to autonomy and electrification.We saw a wonderful example of the power of our electrification solution recently when our partner, Volkswagen Motorsport shattered the time record at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb by nearly 16 seconds using an all-electric race car. ANSYS was very proud to be selected as Volkswagen Motorsport's strategic technology partner of choice for simulating the mission-critical aspects of the electric propulsion system and the overall car design. I'm also excited that we continue to make advances in our start-up program. Today, we have over 500 innovative, young companies from around the world using the power of ANSYS solutions to build their next-generation products and services. Now, last year, we described our vision of pervasive simulation where simulation becomes critical across the entire product lifecycle. Our core business relies on driving innovation into our flagship solutions with mechanical, fluids, electromagnetics, semiconductors, and systems.ANSYS 19.1, released during Q2, bolsters our leadership across all of our key physics. This comprehensive release features advances across our portfolio to improve reliability, performance, speed, and overall user experience. These dramatic improvements are driving high-value multiphysics sales across the regions and the industries we serve. For example, Eldor Corporation, a global manufacturing leader for automotive systems expanded their adoption of ANSYS electronics and HPC solutions to support next-generation electric powertrain development. Extending their adoption of a multiphysics platform based on ANSYS structural CFD and electromagnetic products enabled Eldor to further ensure the reliability of their designs while increasing simulation efficiency. All critical to responding to this rapidly evolving market. Multiphysics was a critical topic at June's DAC, the major semiconductor industry conference.We were excited to have dozens of customers share their best practices on how they use ANSYS solutions beyond the traditional signoff area, leveraging the power of multiphysics simulations, big data analytics, and chip packet system co-analyses to tackle the challenges of seven nanometers and 3D IC design, just to name a few. This new functionality will help them to innovate by exceeding their power of performance and area goals. A great example of our customers' success was outlined in a press release yesterday with HiSilicon Technologies, a subsidiary of Huawei. They're relying on ANSYS's suite of semiconductor and electronic simulation solutions for power integrity and reliability signoff to address complex multiphysics challenges. These include on-chip thermal effects, aging, thermal-aware statistical electromigration budgeting, and electrostatic discharge, as well as the creation of Chip Power Models for simulating the entire packaging system.HiSilicone is using ANSYS RedHawk-SC, our next generation system one chip, power noise, and reliability signoff solution to enable design-successful, all-advanced process nodes, including seven nanometer and five nanometer. Our successes with RedHawk-SC was also showcased at DAC. I'm excited that all of our seven-nanometer RedHawk customers are using or deploying RedHawk-SC for signoff of their most complex products and design. These designs are at the heart of innovations and artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, 5G, mobile devices, and so on. Our successes with RedHawk-SC go beyond the tier-one chip makers. We're seeing rapid adoption by a number of Harvard start-ups focused on chip development for artificial intelligence. But to become truly pervasive, simulation must move beyond the product design phase and move upstream into ideation and downstream into operations.ANSYS Discovery Live, which we introduced in Q1, provides instantaneous 3D simulation and direct geometry modeling to enable interactive design exploration and rapid product innovation. We saw early success with ANSYS Discovery Live with China Southern Power Grid which provides electricity to over 250 million people. This Fortune Global 100 company is using Discovery Live for digital exploration, resulting in a 3x improvement in tower design time. The company also signed a contract in Q2 to expand its ANSYS usage across physics, including structures, fluids, electromagnetics, as well as high-performance computing. This expansion also enables the design teams to collaborate across engineering disciplines using an integrated workflow based on the ANSYS Workbench platform. Also in Q2, we announced an exciting new partnership with PTC. They're developing a differentiated solution for their customers that embeds Discovery Live's simulation engine into their Creo 3D CAD offering.With the combined solution which removes the boundaries between CAD and simulation, engineers will be able to see the real-time results of simulation during the modeling process. This will enable them to rapidly make trade-offs and design changes in their models. With PTC's significant presence in the designer's space, our partnership broadens our reach to design engineers around the world. Although there's no impact on our 2018 revenue while the solution is in development, early customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Simulation can also play a critical role downstream in product operations through the use of digital twins. While digital twins adoption is still in its early stages, we're seeing significant interest from customers. Many companies have challenges in maintaining assets that are in remote or hostile locations.And so, it's no surprise that companies in mining, energy, as well as construction sites with heavy machinery are early adopters of the Internet of Things and digital twin technology. In Q2, we released ANSYS Twin Builder, the only solution that offers a packaged approach for digital twins, enabling engineers to quickly build, validate, and deploy these digital representations of physical products. The open solution integrates with any industrial IOP platform and contains runtime deployment capabilities for constant monitoring of every individual asset used during operation. The solution empowers customers to perform diagnostics and troubleshooting, determine the ideal maintenance programs, optimize the performance of each asset, and generate insightful data to improve the next generation of products. Our longtime customer, Regal, is a great digital twin success story. Regal is a leading manufacturer of electric motors, power generation, and power transmission products serving markets worldwide.Regal leveraged ANSYS simulation to build a digital twin, enabling them to iterate on the design, optimizing both software and hardware. Their digital twin helped them understand the performance impact of design changes within minutes and validate that the new design met market requirements. Likewise, Regal leveraged ANSYS's mechanical fluids, embedded software, and systems tools to reduce the design time from six weeks down to a few days. I'm also delighted that in Q2, we announced an innovative partnership with software giant SAP. They're embedding ANSYS's technology for digital twins into their extensive digital supply chain, manufacturing an asset management portfolio, introducing a new product called SAP Predictive Engineering Insights Enabled by ANSYS. This new solution which introduces ANSYS simulation to operations and asset managers ties together engineering models, manufacturing details, and operational insights including financial information.Connecting these diverse datasets enables businesses to evaluate the real-time working conditions of physical objects and remotely monitor products and assets, empowering them to quickly detect and fix issues if something goes wrong as well as to make design improvements to future releases. This relationship is particularly exciting for ANSYS because of SAP's enterprise product portfolio and extensive customer reach. And while we're not expecting any revenue for ANSYS in 2018, while our engineering teams are working on the new product, initial customer feedback from customers has been very positive. And finally, on the products side, we're seeing strong interest and increased opportunities from our recent acquisition of OPTIS. As you may remember, OPTIS is the leading provider of physics-based simulation software for light, human vision, and visualization. This best in class technology helps to extend our industry leadership and drives full portfolio sales, particularly in the automotive vertical.The $30 million Q2 deal I mentioned earlier was with one of the world's leading automotive companies. And like many of our automotive customers, this company is facing mounting pressures to bring new autonomous and electric vehicle technology to market as quickly as possible. This industry leader, who is also a customer of OPTIS, realized that further investment in ANSYS's flagship solutions, including electromagnetics and functional safety, would increase their simulation efficiency which is crucial to rapid innovation. Now, before I close, I wanna give you an update on our board of directors. First, I would like to thank two of our long-standing board members, Brad Morley and Patrick Zilvitis who retired earlier this year for their many years of dedicated service. And I'd like to welcome to our board two accomplished executives with extensive experience at leading technology companies: Nicole Anasenes and Glenda Dorchak.Along with Dr. Alec Gallimore, who joined the board in December, they bring a wealth of thought leadership and experience to a outstanding board of directors. And we are very much looking forward to the value they will bring to our growing enterprise. I will now turn the call over to Maria to discuss the financial results in more detail. Maria?Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Ajei shared a few key highlights from our results. And now, let me take a few minutes to add some additional commentary around our second quarter and first half financial performance. I will close my prepared remarks with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 in 2018. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the first year of adoption of revenue recognition under ASC 606, we have been and will continue to provide financial results and outlook under both ASC 605 and 606. Additionally, any comments that I make relative to growth rates will be comparing Q2 2018 to Q2 2017 results under ASC 605 and in constant currency. I will provide key financial metrics under both 605 and 606. And consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. Our record Q2 results reflect continued strong momentum and execution across the business.Despite a stronger US dollar that adversely affected our revenue by approximately $2 million, as compared to our forecasted exchange rates, we posted revenue growth of 13% or 10% in constant currency. Operating margins and EPS were above the high end of our guidance under both 605 and 606. Our strong second quarter and first half performance give us confidence that we are on a path to continue to make progress against our strategic priorities and to deliver another year of record financial results in 2018. Our key financial metrics for the quarter begin with Q2 constant currency ACV growth of 8% and 10% growth for the first half of the year. Second quarter revenue under ASC 605 and 606 totaled $299 million and $309 million respectively and include positive currency impacts of $6.8 million and $6.3 million as compared to last year.The inquiries in software license sales combined with strong maintenance renewals contributed to our deferred revenue and backlog under 605 of $816 million, representing a record Q2 high and a 24% increase over last year's comparable balance. Deferred revenue and backlog under ASC 606 totaled $587 million. Recurring revenue for the quarter under 605 grew 11% in constant currency to a total of $228 million or 76% of total revenue. Under 606, recurring revenue totaled $225 million or 73% of total revenue. Under either method, our growing base of recurring revenue gives us good insight and predictability into our future performance. The strong top-line performance helped to drive a second-quarter gross margin of 90% under both accounting methods and an operating margin of 45.5% under 605 and 47.3% under 606. The Q2 operating margin was above the high end of the guidance ranges that we had previously provided.Margins were positively impacted by revenue results finishing at the upper end of our revenue guidance when factoring in the strengthening of the US Dollar beyond the currency ranges provided with our previous guidance, particularly against the euro and the British pound. The 606 revenue and margins were favorably impacted by the timing of deliverables under a single contract that yielded $12.5 million of revenue in the second quarter. This revenue was originally anticipated to be recorded in Q3 of this year. This is a good example of contracts that can cause the increased volatility that we expect in our 606 results. We also experienced a slightly slower pace of hiring than we had planned for the quarter. These delays were partially attributable to OPTIS integration activities that have been taking place across the teams since the closing of the deal in early May. We reported second quarter EPS of $1.24 under 605 and $1.35 under 606.With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q2 was 22% which was at the lower end of the range that we had guided coming into the quarter. Going forward, we have updated our estimates and expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21% for Q3 and 21% to 22% for the full year. This includes an anticipated non-recurring net tax benefit of approximately $5 million or $0.06 that we expect to record in Q3. This net benefit relates to certain subsidiary activities, including entity structuring that are currently under way. Our cash flow from operations totaled $111 million for the quarter and $244 million for the first half. We closed the quarter with a total of $696 million in cash and short-term investments, of which, 76% is held domestically. Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. We are initiating guidance for the third quarter and expect non-GAAP revenue under ASC 605 in the range of $302 to $312 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.31.Non-GAAP revenue under ASC 606 is in the range of $265 to $285 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.93 to $1.07. For the full year, we are increasing our constant currency revenue guidance. But due to the movements in currency rates that I mentioned earlier, we are also revising our outlook to reflect the estimated negative $15 million impact on revenue due to currency in the second half of the year. We are also increasing our EPS outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the strong performance in the second quarter combined with our confidence in continued positive business momentum for the remainder of the year. This translates into our updated outlook for 2018 of non-GAAP revenue under ASC 605 in the range of $1,223,000,000 to $1,245,000,000 or constant currency growth of 10% to 11% at the midpoint and EPS in the range of $4.97 to $5.09. Non-GAAP revenue under ASC 606 is in the range of $1,210,000,000 to $1,250,000,000 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.87 to $5.14.With respect to the contribution from the OPTICS business, our outlook remains largely in line with what we had communicated last quarter or a range of $25 to $26 million in revenue for 2018. We're also updating our ACV outlook for 2018 to factor in the negative impact from changes in currency rates since we last provided guidance. Our revised outlook for ACV is a range of $1,252,000,000 to $1,282,000,000. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 9% to 12% over the 2017 baseline or approximately 10% to 11% at the midpoint. We're also maintaining our outlook for operating cash flows other than a slight currency adjustment and narrowing of the range to $435 to $470 million.I would like to remind everyone that our outlook for operating cash flow in 2018 includes our current estimated adverse impact of approximately $12 to $15 million related to the acceleration of income tax payments under ASC 606 that is associated with deferred revenue and backlog credited to retained earnings that will never be recognized as revenue in the company's financial statements. For modeling purposes, we are expecting third-quarter operating margins of 44% to 45% under 605 and 37% to 40% under 606. And for the full year, we expect operating margins of 44% to 45% under 605 and 43% to 45% under 606. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2018 are contained in the prepared remarks document. In summary, we delivered another solid quarter with strength across our key financial metrics, ACV, top-line growth, operating margins, EPS, operating cash flows, and deferred revenue and backlog.The strong second quarter and first half performance give us confidence that our continued focus on execution and investing in the business combined with the ongoing growth in our recurring business, our strong customer relationships, and healthy sales pipeline provide a solid foundation to continue to deliver on our 2018 goals as well as our longer-term 2020 financial targets. Operator, we can now open the phone lines to take questions, please.Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press * and then 1 on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the key. If at any time, your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press * and then 2. We also ask that you keep your questions to one question and a brief follow-up. Our first question is from Monika Garg of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is your total revenue yearly guidance is unchanged in spite of currency impact of $15 million. But then you are reducing ACV guidance by $15 million due to FX. I'm trying to understand if it's not impacting revenue, why it is impacting ACV.So, Monika, relative to the outlook for the full year on revenue guidance, it is slightly modified up after factoring in the currency impact of $15 million. And from an ACV perspective, the same thing. The only changes to ACV at this point are factoring in the negative impact from currency in the second half of the year because of what's transpired in rate changes since we gave guidance in May. There is no other changes to ACV other than for currency.What I'm trying to understand is the upside you are seeing in the business in the revenue side, won't you also see in the ACV?Yeah. The ACV range, Monika, we've given a wide enough range that we believe that some of the puts and takes that may happen, particularly in Q4 where some of those larger deals are heavily weighted toward -- sometimes the reality is timing may move those into another quarter. So, we're trying to balance all the variables and factor in timing around large deals and the reality that as you get to the end of the year, sometimes with holidays and things, you just run out of runway.Thank you very much. The next question is from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go.Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to follow up on two of the go-to-market initiatives mentioned in the prepared remarks, specifically the buildout of the channel partners and the hiring of technical salespeople. Maybe for Ajei, at a higher level, where are you in the cadence of these investments? And how long is it typically between when you add a technical salesperson or a new channel partner and when you expect to see a contribution to the pipeline and bookings? If I could ask you also to comment on the in-progress changes in APAC that are mentioned in the prepared remarks. Thank you.Sure. So, when you think about the changes that we're making and what we announced last year, we said we were going to go through a change in our go-to-market strategy. And that would include a greater focus on channel partners. And it would also include a clear understanding and segmentation of the market with an incremental focus on enterprise accounts and then with our direct sales organization also taking strategic accounts and territory accounts and then working with the channel to make sure that we have a clear segmentation. As part of that process, we clearly recruited a number of new channel partners who've come on board. And that work is ongoing. Obviously, the rate at which channel partners come up to speed depends on their level of background and the amount of work that they've done in our space in the past. We are very diligent in how we choose channel partners.And it can take some time to screen them to come on board. And obviously, they have to come up to speed on our products and so forth. But again, the speed at which they are able to sell depends on their experience in our space. As far as the technical resources are concerned, we continue to recruit. And we've been able to add to our technical sales people or our ACE organization. The pace is not exactly what we would have wanted because obviously, we're looking for very, very high-skilled people. And so, we're a little bit behind on that. But we still continue to be able to add to our ranks. I think those were the questions. Was there anything that I missed?Just on the in-progress changes in APAC. And then I have a follow-up on Discovery Live if I may.Yes, in APAC. So, essentially, the point about APAC was, as I mentioned in the script, we have a year that's a little bit backend loaded. And the timing of deals obviously then has an overall impact on quarter performance versus year performance. That's No. 1. Point No. 2, I would say we were a little bit slower in implementing some of the go-to-market changes that I just talked about in South Korea. And that had an impact I would say on our performance in that country. And then the other point I mentioned was around the centralization of some large enterprise deals.Essentially, what happens is we serve customers obviously, who are global in nature. They have workforces around the world. And we had a few deals where even with workforces in India, the customers chose to purchase at a different country and centralize the purchasing. So, that's the situation over there. So, obviously, a multiphysics solution that maybe these customers are going after as opposed to a historical, single-physics view. So, that's really the changes I highlighted in the script.That's very helpful. Thank you. Follow-up is on Discovery Live. What can you share at this point about the economics? I think we've talked about $2,000.00, $4,000.00, $6,000.00 price point before with the PTC agreement. Any color you can tell us on the gross margin line and the contribution that could have? And one of the questions that we have is when you look at the price points of CAD solutions historically, they've also been in that same range, the $2,000.00, $4,000.00, $5,000.00 range. When you've gotten customer feedback, has there been any concerns or pushback around, \"Well, the price of adding on Discovery Live is almost equal or perhaps more than the price of the base CAD solution\"? And sometimes when you're upselling at that kind of price point, meaning double, that can be a little bit of an uphill battle. So, I would love to hear if any of the feedback from customers has touched on that at all and maybe been positive in spite of that. Thanks.So, firstly, this is our first full quarter of Discovery in the marketplace. And we've seen trials increased. We've sold Discovery Live in every single geo. We've sold Discovery through multiple channels. And the feedback has been very positive. We're seeing customer traction. I gave you an example in the script of China's Southern Power Grid. So, there's clearly market demand for the product. There's validation of the product, hits a sweet spot. And it's validation that we have it right. So, I'm excited about that. With respect to PTC, that's a loyalty arrangement with PTC. So, to your point about margins, it's a loyalty arrangement. As far as the revenue impact from the PTC relationship, at this point in time, we don't have product in market. And we don't expect to see any impact in 2018. We're expecting this to have an impact on the following year. As far as customers' interests are concerned, they don't view this as a -- this is not a small addon to a CAD solution.The simulation aspects of Discovery Live are extremely powerful. And this is brand new, industry-leading capability. So, we're seeing a lot of excitement from customers, especially in the PTC and store bases. They think about their Creo users. For them to be able to get CAD, we don't see any problem in maintaining the price point at all. So, we don't see that as a problem right now. Obviously, we'll have product in market later on. And we'll have hands-on evidence later on. But right now, we don't see the price point as a problem at all. And I think I'd --[Crosstalk]Thank you very much. Thank you. The next question is from Gal Munda of Berenberg. Please.Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to ask one in terms of the large deals. Now, you guys have done three large deals worth $30 million over the last three quarters. So, can you just give us a bit of a color about opportunity, the way you see in terms of your existing and store base? How many of those customers are starting to look at the overall portfolio and maybe consolidate some of the vendors that they're using in simulation and what that means for the opportunity in the pipeline of your large deals? Just trying to get an idea. Out of your customers, is it 20? Is it 100? Just if you can ballpark it for us. Thank you.So, one of the important metrics to consider as you think about evolution for large deals is to think about the journey that we've been on. And if you look back at the history of ANSYS, we were historically selling single-physics. And our sales motions were around being able to sell an incremental solver at a time. And we were operating very much at the lower levels of the organization. We've obviously moved up over the years. And suddenly, with the changes that Rick -- and with go-to-market that I spoke about earlier -- the changes that Rick has made, we have a very clear and thoughtful approach to being able to address the needs of our customers.We use channel partners were appropriate. We use inside sales where appropriate. And certainly, we have also strategic accounts and enterprise accounts. These are accounts that we believe will be driving significant multi-portfolio sales. And as I mentioned in my script, we have something like 75% of these large, million dollar deals include three or more physics. And so, what you're seeing in the evolution is customers who were previously single-physics customers are now expanding their footprint and moving to multi-physics customers. No one shows up on day one as a non-customer of ANSYS and then buys multiple millions of dollars of software across multiple physics. Usually, what happens, they'll come in and they'll grow. And so, many of our existing customers and many of these large deals come from customers who've had years of success with ANSYS who are now expanding their use of simulation.The reason they're expanding their use of simulation is not just because we're reaching them in the best possible way. We are. We're trying to meet the customers where they are. We're trying to adjust our go-to-market to address the needs of the customers. So, that's one. But it's also the case that the products that they're dealing with are becoming significantly more complicated. So, if you take, for example, automotive -- and I mentioned an automotive sale -- whereas years ago, we may have had a conversation with customers about structures or fluids or airflow, today the conversation is about electrification. I mentioned the example of Volkswagen Motorsport. It's about electrification. It's about electric drivetrains. The conversation is about autonomous. And these are all intrinsically multiphysics solutions that include our electronics solutions, our embedded software, our optical solutions with OPTICS in the case of autonomous and so forth.And so, the nature of the customer problems have changed. We're in the right place at the right time with the right portfolio. We have the right go-to-market. And we're in a position to get to the customers as they need to which is essentially driving the growth of our portfolio. The other point I made in the script is we've made investments in our engineering services organization, and we're able to monetize that investment. And that also drives adoption, and it drives customer success. So, we're very excited about this movement toward larger deals, toward satisfying customer needs at a higher level. And we're very optimistic.Thank you. And just as a follow-up, when I look at your ACV growth around 8% constant currency, deferred revenue and backlog still, even in constant currency must be growing about 20%. Can you just talk a bit about that mix shift that's going on still between the perpetual licenses and leases? How does that compare year-on-year, Maria, if you can comment on that? And how does it compare with your expectations that you had? Do you still see more and more leases coming in? And are those large contracts mostly likely to be leases in the future as well? Thank you.Yeah. So, Gal, what I'd say is I commented in the script -- I called out the fact that the recurring revenue streams are growing double-digits in constant currency. And no doubt, perpetual licenses are single-digit growth this year. That being said, certain geographies, particularly in Asia, as Ajei had alluded to that are slated for second half tend to be paid up in nature. But no doubt, as the enterprise and strategic accounts become a larger part of the quarterly business flows, they are choosing leases as opposed to traditional -- when they were more single-physics customers, they tended to be paid up. And now they are migrating. We will continue to have a flexible business model that enables customers to choose because that's the most important element, we believe.As customers migrate to truly broadening the use of multiphysics across the enterprise and adding new products to their portfolio of usage, we need to allow them to license the software under whatever model makes sense for them. And currently, a number of those are choosing multiyear leases. And we're OK with that.Thank you very much. The next question is from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Thank you. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, first, for a bit of housekeeping, could you tell us the inorganic contribution to ACV in the quarter and a rough estimate of what you now expect for the year?Yeah. It's about four to five for the quarter and 25 to 30 for the year.Okay. Great. And I guess for Ajei -- and it's bigger picture question, but given the big deal activity, I was wondering if you could help us understand what level of upsell you're starting to see on some of these deals as you expand the physics.What do you mean what level up upsell? Are you talking about expansion across physics or use cases?Well, simply, if you were revisiting a renewal with a customer -- and say they were paying $1 million, on average, how much upsell are you getting above the prior run rate?It's very hard to give you a formulaic response because the fact remains that each of these deals, it depends on the industry that the customer happens to be in. It depends on the geos. And it depends on the specific initiatives that they have under way. So, there's no standardized answer. The broad trends though that I've mentioned several times, the broad trends that we're seeing of smarter products, that's driving a lot of this conversation. And so, you'd get -- and I gave you the example of how we're having these broader conversations with a number of customers in the automotive space. If I think about telecommunications, we're having conversations about 5G.And those happen to be strategic initiatives, and so on. I can pick the industry, and whatever the strategic area is, that's the area that we're focused on to try to help them be successful using our technology. And that's what drives the incremental use of technology. And oftentimes, you'll find customers starting to take a step away from some of their core areas of competence as they start to move into some of these new physics. And in particular, you have customers who have historically not used electronics heavily in the building of their products. When they recognize that you now need to build smarter products, they need more support for electronics. That depends on the level of staffing they can get. And that depends a little bit on the broader support they're able to get together for themselves. And of course, we're in a position to help there too So, a lot of it really depends on where the customer is, industry, geo, and so on.Thank you very much. Next question is from Rob Oliver of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And apologize for the bad connection here if I have one. Just given the push into indirect channels and partnerships and the success you guys are having there, how should we think about the longer-term mix of direct versus indirect business? I think traditionally, it's been about three-quarters direct. And do you guys see that changing at all? And then I'll put my follow-up in now in case I get cut off again. This is the second quarter in a row where you guys mentioned it's been challenging to hire and that hiring would be backend loaded. I was just wondering is that a field technical sales issue? And what gives you guys the confidence that you'll be able to hire in the second half of the year? Thanks a lot.So, first, as far as your question about the volume of business through the channel partners, we don't fundamentally expect the numbers to change dramatically in the short-term. And it's been, as you rightly said, about three-quarters. And that's what we certainly see in the short-term going forward. About your question about hiring people, this year, as you know, we increased our hiring aperture. And we were looking for significantly more people than historically we've been in a position to hire. And it takes a certain amount of time to rev up the recruiting engine. And that obviously adds latency to the process. And it's also the case that we're looking for very skilled individuals. And some of these individuals are a little bit harder to find. So, we're building our recruiting pipeline which is, of course, both our internal pipeline as well as some recruiting partners. And we have a key focus on making sure we can address and bring more people on board. Maria, anything to add?Yeah. Rob, I just wanted to add one thing. As with any time that we acquire businesses, it just has a natural slowdown as we think through the integration, as we think through what talent do they bring to the table that may be able to fulfill roles that we had originally thought in the plan that we were gonna go to market to fill. So, that combined with, no doubt, a more challenging hiring environment has slowed things down. But that being said, we continue to have an aggressive recruiting engine. In fact, we just recently hired a couple more additional people on that team to help us as we head into the second half so that we are well-prepared as we head into 2019.Thank you very much. The next question is from Rich Valera of Needham & Co. Please go ahead. you. Ajei, auto featured very prominently in your prepared remarks. And I know that's historically been large customers of your products. And just wondering is there something going on specifically in the auto industry that's leading to more activity, bigger deals that's somewhat unique to auto? Or is that something you expect to see pervasively among your other verticals that you [audio cuts out]Well, one of the reasons I've mentioned auto is really the epitomizes change that's taking place toward smart, connected products. The big trends in automotive which are autonomous vehicles, electrification, and connected, if you will, all of those trends, we have great technologies that support our customers through that transition. For example, with the OPTIS acquisition that we just recently concluded, we have now an end to end simulation that allows our customers to be able to simulate driven miles. And so, one of the big challenges with the autonomous is it's very difficult to test autonomous vehicles. And we can now -- with this integration across the OPTICS portfolio and the traditional ANSYS portfolio, we now have an integrated view of virtual miles driven as well as an integrated view of all of the sensors, including camera, LADAR, and radar, as well as, of course, ultrasound for short distance. And we can close the loop on the simulation process.So, that's a very exciting solution. It's completely relevant to what the car companies are dealing with right now and not just on-road but also off-road. Similarly for electrification. And I gave a couple of examples. And similarly for connected. And we were talking about 5G and antenna design and so forth. So, that's clearly making a difference for the end customer. And then, of course, those changes reverberate through the supply chain. And so, we're having conversations, and we're working with customers, for example, around the integration of our safety technology into semiconductors. And so, in fact, in Q2, a major automotive chip provider, they expanded their use of simulation. And this is a chip provider. They expanded their use of simulation to include ANSYS Medini which is our safety solution, to get ISO 26262 functional safety analysis which is appropriate for the auto industry. So, there's an enormous amount of reverberation through the supply chain from the automotive sector that you're seeing.So, I think that's one area, but these broad trends I think are applicable across industries. As I said, industries are at different levels of maturity. And we expect to see these trends repeating themselves across other industries as well.Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up for Maria. Can you reiterate what you said on taxes for 2018, what it was and what it went to? Thanks.Yeah. So, what I said was for Q3, we're looking at a range of 19% to 21% because we will have a non-recurring benefit of about $5 million or $0.06. And then for the full year, we're looking at a rate of 21% to 22%.Thank you very much. The next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.Thank you. Good morning. For Ajei first, with respect to making simulation more pervasive via partnerships in particular, if, in the case of the PTC relationship, you penetrate, let's say, the majority of the active Creo base, that would add about 100,000 licenses to the answer space, perhaps more. When you consider your other partner opportunities, particularly in operations such as with SAP or Arris, are you thinking in terms of potentially tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of additional licenses added to your base, albeit at a possibly substantially lower than usual [inaudible] with solvers?And then relatedly, I'll ask you a question I asked PTC which is how are you implementing the partnerships more deeply into the ANSYS organization not just at the highest levels of the company? And then just to throw my follow-up in for Maria, your 605 non-GAAP operating margin guidance suggests about a 200 basis point decline at the midpoint from 2017. Is the margin antimatter for the year mostly due to higher R&D, including the OPTIS acquisition? Or is it mostly SG&A, as you add sales in AEs plus variable comp on the bookings growth? Thanks.So, Jay, let me try to address that multipart question. I'm not sure I have all of the -- let me look at Maria's note here. So, the first was around the number of users. So, look, it's much too soon for us to give you a revenue projection of where we will be with some of those partnerships. It's obviously the case that we will be expanding the number of users to others which has traditionally not been using ANSYS solutions. That's certainly the case as you start to think about going downstream into operations and, of course, as you start to think about the designer community. And we believe that there's an opportunity to monetize that relationship going forward. Obviously, it'll depend on the kind of user and the industry they're in. You're also absolutely right to suggest that the cost that we would charge, our pricing for runtime licenses for digital twins will be different from our pricing for our traditional solvers. And that's obviously going to be the case because the use cases are different.And the nature of usage across those two cases will drive a different level of complexity and solver need. As far as investing in the relationship is concerned, I think that the relationship has multiple touchpoints. We have project management in place. We have multiple touchpoints up and down, both from an R&D perspective as well as from a go-to-market perspective. From an R&D perspective, obviously, the teams are working together to make sure that we can synch up on deliverables and we get everything in place for product release by PTC. But our teams are working closely together. And from a go-to-market perspective, obviously, there's some planning involved to make sure that we understand what we're doing together. So, I think that that's well under way.And obviously, this is a working partnership with people rolling up the sleeves and getting the job done. So, I'm excited about that relationship. And I'm excited about frankly, the mobilization on both companies, both PTC and us to move things forward. Maria, there was another question, right?Yeah, around margins. I'll take that one. Jay, if you look at our guidance for full-year, under 605, we're saying 44% to 45% which was pretty much in line with what we had communicated as we came into the year, relative to our perspective for the full year. We are building in the impact of OPTIS which is slightly negative as we had communicated last quarter. And no doubt, we are continuing to add investments across the business, particularly on the people front, R&D, field engineering. As Ajei mentioned, on the partnerships, we have added incremental people whose fulltime job now is to focus on the success of those partnerships. So, we're investing across all the functions of business to prepare ourselves to be able to continue to take advantage of the tremendous market opportunity that we see ahead....Chris, do we have another question? Operator?My apologies, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question is from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Thanks so much. Ajei, I know it's early on Discovery Live, but the example of China Southern Power Grid suggests that it may be a way to engage with customers and then actually drive adoption of the broader portfolio into those accounts. I'm just curious. Is that a secondary effect, a trend that you think is gonna be more pervasive? And then my follow-up for Maria, on the ACV growth that you've given us for both Q2 and first half in constant currency, I wondered if you had the comparable growth rates for ACV in Q2 '17 and 1H '17. Thanks.To answer your question, there are actually, I would say, a couple of important use cases for Discovery Live. And one, as we've discussed, is the use of Discovery Live by individuals who have not necessarily been using simulation. And those individuals could be at companies who historically have not bought ANSYS solutions. And so, that's clearly a use case. But there's a really exciting use case which the Discovery Live Southern China experience does bring to focus. And that is that many of our customers who are historical users of ANSYS recognize the opportunity to be able to broaden the deployment of simulation through their engineering base by making Discovery Live available to their designers. And so, we'll go from the flagship into the designers.But equally, we can go in from the designers into the flagships because we have now the ability to provide this end to end coverage across the organization for people of different levels of skills and capabilities and understanding of simulation with the ability to be able to move and migrate work across the different product lines. And so, that's a dynamic that we're very excited about. And we see this pattern continuing with customers. And that's something that we're encouraging. And certainly, our enterprise sales force is excited about that because that gives them an opportunity to engage with some of these large customers. And they're seeing large opportunities for discovery live. But then they're seeing that driving further flagship sales. So, that's the symbiotic effect that we're very excited about.And Ross, to your question on ACV growth, ACV is a new metric that we just started reporting in 2017. So, we have not gone back to recreate ACV under historical data. So, I don't have the comparisons for last year to the same periods.Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session. And I would like to turn the conference back to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.Thanks, Chris. I'm delighted by the excellent quarter and the progress that we've made. Our pervasive simulation strategy is clearly resonating with customers. And as I think about the rest of the year, our focus remains on execution. We will continue to strengthen our flagship products with ANSYS 19.2 that's coming out soon, and we will continue to expand our ecosystem through additional partnerships. And of course, we will continue to support and grow our customer base. In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners. And a shout out to my ANSYS colleagues. Thank you for all your efforts. And thank you for another great quarter. Thank you, all for joining me on the call today. I look forward to our next discussion. Enjoy the rest of your day.Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this conference call. And you may now disconnect your lines.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT), consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry.Moreover, continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) presents significant growth opportunity for industry players.Notably, the cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems.Additionally, the increasing need to secure cloud platforms, amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking, continues to drive demand for cyber security software.Further, as enterprises continue to move their on-premise workload to cloud environments (emergence of hybrid cloud), application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance. This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud-based environments.Robust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth. These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry's growth prospects.The  , within the broader  , has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13.7% and 19.2%, respectively.We believe the near-term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement.However, the Computer Software industry's valuation looks stretched at the moment. One might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.65, which is close to the highest level over the past year.The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.14 and the median level is 18.28.Moreover, a comparison of the group's P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector's forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.71 and the median level of 20.50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry's respective ratios.Nevertheless, strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top-line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company's earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company's earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year's reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of $3.13 per share reflects solid year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2.6% upward since Mar 31, 2018.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it at the top 25% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising. The group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11.89%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Computer Software's long-term growth prospects are alluring. Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models, rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools, the proliferation of wearables & self-driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry.Moreover, the growing usage of Internet of Things (IoT) at home, in office, for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver. These factors are expected to drive top-line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016.Another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group's gross margin.The role of software is evolving. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage is expanding in managing infrastructure. Moreover, the industry is significantly benefiting from the ongoing cloud transition.SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth due to a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate. Moreover, strong spending by enterprises is a positive.Moreover, software companies are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. This enhanced liquidity is expected to boost their appetite for strategic acquisitions.Despite stretched valuations, investors can build positions in the Computer Software industry based on the above-mentioned factors as well as strong earnings outlook.Here, we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see  .) ,  .: The stock of this Pittsburgh, PA-based engineering simulation software and services provider has jumped 45.1% over the past year.

The Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based engineering simulation software company was upgraded on improving productivity and profits. However, after massive amounts of growth over the last 18 months, this upgrade is too late to benefit new Ansys stock investors.To be sure, the company may finally be coming into its own 48 years after its founding. Ansys specializes in finite element analysis software. This software simulates several engineering-related factors related to product development. This helps to determine how products will function under varied conditions. It also allows firms to test products before incurring higher expenses.Through this technology, it has developed a moat that allows it to compete with the likes of  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ).Goldman analyst Gabriela Borges cited this fact in defense of her upgrade. She also mentioned improved product positioning, the potential for higher margins, and a positive outlook based on a critical partnership and improving opportunities.One move that has improved this outlook is its partnership with  (NASDAQ:  ). The two firms partnered to develop PTC's Creo 3D CAD software. This utilizes PTC's CAD technology with Ansys Discovery Live real-time simulation. It also allows design engineers to improve the quality of their products while reducing development costs.This partnership should improve the bottom line. Still, the profit picture has already begun to show improvement. After years of stagnant revenue and profit levels, Ansys stock appears poised to grow both revenues and profits. The company saw earnings of $4.01 per share in 2017. Analysts forecast profits of $4.92 per share in 2018 and $5.42 per share the year after.Unfortunately for new investors, the market has likely priced these factors into the stock. Goldman mentioned the high valuation in its report, and they upgraded the stock despite a higher price-to-earnings () ratio.No doubt Ansys enjoys a clear vision and presents a competitive threat to Autodesk and other peers. However, as I mentioned in a  about Autodesk, its quarterly losses did not create a buying opportunity in the stock.Ansys finds itself in a similar situation. Despite low levels of profit growth in recent years, Ansys stock moved steadily higher. It has almost doubled in value since the beginning of 2017.As a result, the current PE for ANSS stock stands above 50, and it trades around 37.5 times earnings on a forward basis. Wall Street expects profit growth of about 22.5% this year and just over 10% next year. At current prices, the price-to-earnings-to-growth () ratio comes in at 1.66 on a forward basis, and over two when measured against current metrics.Judging by both a PE and a PEG basis, Ansys stock appears expensive. Ansys has become a costly stock precisely because of its value proposition and product lines. This will serve both its customers and ultimately their customer's customers well. However, it leaves little room for new investors to profit.Although Ansys appears poised to resume profit growth, valuations have likely moved ahead of its profits. The stock has risen recently on an upgrade from Goldman Sachs.Goldman cited an improving moat as well as increased profits and productivity in its upgrade. While I agree with the factors that led to the upgrade, I find the valuation expensive at these levels. I believe Ansys could profit new investors if it falls to a lower price. Still, at its current PE ratio, investors will likely find higher returns in other equities.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he Computer Software industry is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation demand environment.Software has become the focal point of technological innovation.

(Symbol: ANSS) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $177.79/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $150 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.80. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.9% return against the $150 commitment, or a 3.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ANSS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $150 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Ansys Inc. sees its shares fall 15.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $147.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.80 from $150), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.2% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Ansys Inc., and highlighting in green where the $150 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put at the $150 strike for the 3.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

Below is a chart showing ANSS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

(Symbol: ANSS) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $145.57/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the July 2018 put at the $135 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.20. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.9% return against the $135 commitment, or a 6.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ANSS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $135 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Ansys Inc. sees its shares decline 7.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $129.80 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $5.20 from $135), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.7% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Ansys Inc., and highlighting in green where the $135 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the July 2018 put at the $135 strike for the 6.7% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Coty, Inc. (Symbol: COTY), the market cap is now $12.89 billion, versus Ansys Inc. (Symbol: ANSS) at $12.75 billion.Below is a chart of Coty, Inc. versus Ansys Inc. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (COTY plotted in blue; ANSS plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of COTY vs. ANSS:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.At the closing bell, COTY is up about 1.2%, while ANSS is off about 0.4% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photo (  ) saw an improvement in its  Friday, from 94 to 96.[ibd-display-video id=2368044 width=50 float=left autostart=true] The new rating shows the stock is outpacing 96% of all stocks when it comes to the most important stock-picking criteria.

(Symbol: ANSS) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $127.71/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the April 2018 put at the $115 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.70. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.4% return against the $115 commitment, or a 3.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ANSS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $115 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Ansys Inc. sees its shares fall 10% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $112.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.70 from $115), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Ansys Inc., and highlighting in green where the $115 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the April 2018 put at the $115 strike for the 3.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Ansys Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $127.71) to be 18%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the PowerShares DWA Momentum Portfolio (Symbol: PDP) where we have detected an approximate $48.0 million dollar outflow -- that's a 3.3% decrease week over week (from 30,150,000 to 29,150,000).

Tuck-in acquisitions have not only expanded product offerings but also its capabilities in providing high-end design simulation software.ANSYS is now focused on improving capability to process and analyze simulation data. Toward this purpose, the company recently acquired Apex, NC-based Computational Engineering International (CEI) for an undisclosed amount.CEI's flagship product - EnSight - is well known for its superior capability in analyzing, visualizing and communicating simulation data. Currently, the company has more than 750 customers.We believe that the integration of EnSight with ANSYS's Workbench will help the company win new contracts from Internet of Things (IoT) based original equipment designers. Per engineering.com, the visualization capabilities of EnSight will also enable ANSYS to address the simulation data needs of Augmented Reality/ Virtual Reality device providers. | ANSYS shares increased 1.41% to close at $124.59 on Jul 12. Notably, the company has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the stock returned 34.7%, the Index gained 8.4%.We note that ANSYS's timely acquisitions have significantly expanded product portfolio. Acquisitions like SpaceClaim, Reaction Design and Evolutionary Engineering have expanded the company's expertise in 3D modelling, chemistry simulation and cloud-based composite analysis and optimization technology.These have eventually expanded ANSYS's total addressable market (TAM). The company can now address the needs of diverse industries like IoT, next-gen 5G product designs, autonomous vehicle, mobile products as well as high-performance chips for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).We believe that ANSYS has significant growth opportunity from the rising complexity in product design owing to rapid adoption of IoT in the manufacturing industry. Moreover, growing demand for energy efficient products is also a key catalyst.ANSYS expects the transition from perpetual license contracts to longer-term, time-based licenses at some of the company's largest customers (in mature markets like the U.S. and Japan) to impact software license and maintenance revenue growth at least in the near term.For second-quarter fiscal 2017, net revenue is anticipated in the range of $254-$263 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $259.87 million.For 2017, ANSYS anticipates revenues of $1.030-$1.058 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.05 billion.Moreover, weakness in Europe and adverse foreign currency exchange rates are other major concerns.ANSYS carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ANSS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $116.63/share today.Because the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.

If an investor was to purchase shares of ANSS stock at the current price level of $116.63/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.10% if the stock gets called away at the May 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ANSS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Ansys Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ANSS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

(Symbol: LECO). Although CASY has traded at a recent price of $105.57/share, the average analyst target is 15.56% higher at $122.00/share. Similarly, ANSS has 15.33% upside from the recent share price of $83.02 if the average analyst target price of $95.75/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LECO to reach a target price of $62.57/share, which is 14.66% above the recent price of $54.57. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CASY, ANSS, and LECO:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n  \nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Ansys Inc. (Symbol: ANSS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the May 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ANSS options chain for the new May 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $83.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ANSS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $88.81/share today.Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 71%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.29% return on the cash commitment, or 13.12% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Ansys Inc., and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.90. If an investor was to purchase shares of ANSS stock at the current price level of $88.81/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.48% if the stock gets called away at the May 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ANSS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Ansys Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ANSS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.14% boost of extra return to the investor, or 21.69% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 27%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 25%.

(Symbol: ANSS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 2016 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 226 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ANSS options chain for the new April 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $80.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ANSS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $87.04/share today.Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ANSS stock at the current price level of $87.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Ansys Inc.

That is because ANSS is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 71.1.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet ANSS's high RSI value isn't the only reason for investors to be concerned, as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in ANSYS's stock as of late. This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of ANSS's prospects for the near term.Over the past two months, investors have witnessed 2 earnings estimate revisions lower compared to none higher for the current year. The consensus estimate for ANSS has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too, as the estimate has fallen from $3.08/share two months ago to just $3.05/share today.If this wasn't enough, ANSYS also has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers.

And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at ANSS given that, according to its RSI reading of 27.84, it is now in oversold territory.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet, ANSS' low RSI value isn't the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Ansys' earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 3 earnings estimate revisions move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for ANSS has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $3.07/share two months ago to just $3.08/share right now.If this wasn't enough, Ansys also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ANSS options chain for the new May 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of 65 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $69.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ANSS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $76.02/share today.Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

That topped 78% of its large-cap growth peers, which averaged 29.96%. The S&P 500 was up 29.12%.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 18.14% vs. 15.70% for its peer group and 17.73% for the big-cap bogey.Caruso, age 57, discussed his investment process with IBD from his office in Manhattan. How does your search for leading stocks differ from other growth investors'? We think of equities generally (in terms of) a combination of growth and capital returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which support the valuations of equities over a long period.And we take a long-duration approach to investment opportunities. But most growth investors are dangerously focused on the moment, growth in the short term. We try to exploit this phenomenon where not a lot of analytical work is being done four to five years out. Give me some examples that show how your tack works, please. In the spring of 2012,Chipotle Mexican Grill (  ) missed a couple of months of sales estimates and the stock was crushed. It went from about 440 to 230 a share. But our research let us be marginal buyers in that lurch. We were confident in the caliber of management. We bought a distressed stock in a great long-term franchise (between May and July 2012 between 380 and 400). Later, they began to execute and sales improved. (We added to our position) through the beginning of October 2012 at prices between 284 and 330. IsCognizant Technology Solutions (  ) another example? You added a big chunk to your stake a few quarters ago. They have a great core competency in technologies that are increasingly desired by clients: in the cloud and in mobility. It's been growing in the high teens and low 20s for years. It has no debt, and it has excess cash.After putting up a strong quarter, they got caught up in the immigration debate. They rely on a lot of foreign visas to conduct their business. The stock went down about 25% in a heartbeat.That was an opportunity for us to reload. In the spring of 2012 we started initiating. The stock broke down into the high 50s (from 78). We met with Cognizant managers for three or four hours, and we left convinced they still had a great business and plan. The stock moved higher. The immigration debate percolated, and we bought in the 60s. Now it's in the 90s. Are you looking for investment opportunities created by the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its bond buys? We don't try to overthink the macro environment. So our marching orders to our analysts are to focus on company fundamentals.But when (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke started the tapering discussion, after having underperformed the broad market and value in particular the prior 12 to 15 months, growth securities started to do well. So the market response to tapering seems to have catalyzed a shift on the margin to growth stocks. Is that because growth stocks tend to have more foreign exposure? Yes, growth stocks generally have a little more exposure to foreign earnings growth. And U.S. value stocks have more exposure to, let's say, earnings that are fueled by Federal Reserve stimulus steps. This is speculation on my part, but the discussion regarding tapering might auger well for future growth stock performance. Computer services, software and systems are your largest category of holdings at 12.36% of assets. Why do you expect good things from them? Cognizant is one, with close to a 4% weighting. The portfolio is built around companies like that andGoogle (  ). We think ofPriceline (  ) as a service company. Some people think of it as a technology company.Ansys (  ) is an engineering simulation software company. People think of this as a company that benefits from innovation.In the old days, you had a team of engineers design a new product, build mockups, then software would run calculations that tested stress characteristics. It was on the tail end of the innovation. And it might take weeks to run those simulations.Today you can run millions of simulations before you even get to the real engineering side of things. Biotech is your second-largest industry group, with 5.45% of assets. Why are you focused there? Biotech came out of a very long, severe stock price underperformance. Now we're seeing far greater pipeline productivity emerging from a couple of leaders. We've centered our investments onCelgene (CELG),Biogen (BIIB) andGilead (GILD). Each is in a different area of disease management.Biogen has been mostly a multiple sclerosis story. They've come to market with a new oral medicine called Tecfidera, which has experienced one of the most unbelievably successful product launches in pharmacology history. But (investors) have been so focused on MS that they haven't paid attention to some of the products that are in development.There is a hemophilia product (Eloctate) that we expect to launch in mid-next year. It has the opportunity to take share fromBaxter (BAX) and drive growth. And there's upside left for Tecfidera for a long time to come.Gilead is basically an HIV and hepatitis C story. It has new product launches on the horizon. We expect Gilead to remain dominant in HIV in the near- to midterm. Their hepatitis C portfolio is starting to contribute meaningfully to corporate growth.Celgene is a multiple myeloma story, a cancer story. We see expanding use of the marketplace.All of these companies were coming off of pretty conservative valuations for the kind of growth we envision them experiencing for the next couple of years. Why did you trim yourFacebook (FB) stake recently? You could not have foreseen the pullback that began in mid-October. The stock had an amazing run after reporting Q2 earnings. They demonstrated great acceleration in their mobility business, which people got excited about. The stock doubled in a short time.We made a meaningful reduction in exposure in that euphoria. It had become close to 3% of the portfolio. So we cut our position roughly in half. It is roughly 1.5% today.Their 20% fall? The stock had gone up the day they reported earnings. Then management talked about the need to spend more on investing in people and their product. A lot of highly valued, high-growth companies have seen similar price corrections.I'm comfortable owning the stock. At the right price, we're getting back in. Michael Kors (KORS) is relatively new for you. Are you concerned that earnings-per-share growth has sharply decelerated in recent quarters? We're always concerned about decelerating growth rates. But Kors' decline is to a less-than-extraordinary level. That's still better than a lot of companies. The stock is reasonably valued for the kind of growth we envision. They have opportunities in Europe and elsewhere overseas. Kors is seen as differentiated here and overseas. Any surprise toStarbucks' (SBUX) accelerating EPS growth?Caruso: No. They're just an unbelievable company. They're one of the few that has been able to consistently reinvent themselves. They've done a brilliant job of expanding their product offerings in small footprint stores, in being first to market in using new technologies to connect to their customers and their rewards programs are best in their class. Precision Castparts (PCP) is up this year, but you've done some trimming. What are your concerns? They are persistent in acquiring businesses that let them leverage their own infrastructure. And they're an important supplier toBoeing (BA) on the 787. They generate about $10 million of content on every 787 that Boeing ships. Part of our reduction is that we own both companies. If we sell, it probably will be out of Boeing. Precision has lagged Boeing, so Precision has more upside. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is way down this year. Yet you've added to your position in some recent quarters. Are you still optimistic?Caruso: This has been the most disappointing stock in the portfolio in 2013. The interest we had was centered on the uniqueness of their business. There are no competitors at their scale. Robotic surgery is here to stay and will continue to grow.Procedure growth continues to expand at a midteen clip year over year. The issue with execution relates to installation sales, which has slowed, especially in the U.S.We expect a couple more tough quarters. Procedure growth will continue in the 16% area. There's no competition. Unbelievably high margins, big share buyback, no debt. Hopefully, it will be a contrary growth stock that recovers. Are you concerned thatLinkedIn's (LNKD) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters? They've brought a new (advertising product for mobile devices) to market. It will help their growth rate re-accelerate into next year. Like we did with Facebook, we made decent sales in the summer on the market euphoria around this stock. We're more interested in finding a price to re-engage LinkedIn than Facebook.We think of it as a core holding, a business that's tough to replicate due to their network effect and LinkedIn managers who think of this as a business and want it to be profitable. It's a good business that is richly valued. It will grow into that. So getting the entry and trim points right is important. Noble Energy's (NBL) EPS growth has soared the past two quarters. But tumbling crude oil prices have doused energy producer stocks' spark lately. This stock has pulled back about 10% since Oct. 30. Why stick with it? Noble is one of the best-positioned energy companies by way of its fracking inventory. Overseas -- in Israel and Africa -- they have unbelievable reserves. And they are really good operators, really focused on creating value.Energy firms are more volatile than what we typically engage, but this company's assets are special.We've seen a reduction in underlying commodity prices, so we would welcome an opportunity to buy some of this back, make it larger in the portfolio. It's not quite at a point where we would start buying it back. What's the biggest change you've made since taking this fund's helm in February 2012? Basically, our perception of growth is linked to a company's ability to create long-term value. So our focus is further forward than many other investors' focus is. It's more on the economics of business and profitability than on the hunt for earnings growth, which is sometimes very episodic. We're still looking for opportunities in large-cap growth. But we're focused on the longer term. What was the fund's prior time horizon?Caruso: I can't say, but it was probably more consistent with most growth managers'. Annual turnover in growth portfolios is often 100% to 150%. We're trying to do closer to 50%. We want great franchises that have the ability to win over a very long time. I tell my analysts I want them to understand how companies are competitively differentiated. I don't want them spending their time trying to anticipate when a bad business is a good stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) helped its client Incepture Print Solutions to create White Paper Factory environment, which has generated more than $1 million in savings for the latter. The White Paper Factory saves production time and reduces costly storage and obsolescence of pre-printed paper, envelopes and promotional inserts.Jacksonville, FL-based Incepture Print Solutions is one of the largest commercial print-to-mail operations in North Florida. By adopting the White Paper Factory model, Incepture Print Solutions is capitalizing on its return-on-investment on its printing and mailing operations in order to drive better results and revenues.White Paper Factory provides flexibility and speed in transforming black-and-white Explanation of Benefits Statements for healthcare clients into full-color Member Health Statements with personalized messaging.Secondly, the White Paper Factory enables printing and manufacturing 100% variable data print envelopes with personalized logos, addresses and messages in real-time during the wrapping process and facilitates regulatory changes or marketing messages to incorporated with ease. The solution permits Incepture to produce 20,000 completely assembled envelopes on hourly basis, which is four times faster than before, that too using only a single operator.Thirdly, the White Paper Factory helps generate $300,000 in savings through paper reduction, shipping and storage space. Further, inventory storage for paper is also reduced by 75%. Lastly, the solution allows Incepture Print Solutions derive $800,000 in savings every year on postage costs by merging multiple jobs into a single, larger print run printed in Zip Code order.The decision to shift to the White Paper Factory model comes after Incepture Print Solutions faced an uphill task of processing millions of transactional documents each month last year. It required multiple types of pre-printed forms, outer envelopes and business reply envelopes. Each job was individually printed and assembled, hence the job set-up and change-over production were labor-intensive and inefficient.The decision is also in line with the long term strategy of Incepture, which is to streamline its workflow, reduce reliance on pre-print, and increase its ability to provide high-value client communications.Incepture Print Solutions has now converted itself into a complete White Paper Factory. It has standardized processes for about 450 jobs on a daily basis. The company no longer uses pre-printed forms and envelopes, it has replaced this system by linking its print and mail operations to a single workflow to produce more engaging, colorful statements and other client correspondence.Incepture Print Solutions has replaced six separate print engines with two IntelliJet Printing Systems and combined eight inserters to two Mailstream Wrapper Productivity Series mail finishing systems. The company presently manufactures 100% variable data statements and envelope wrap material on a single printing platform in black, full color or MICR, that have less maintenance and fewer operators.Further, Incepture Print Solutions is the first company to purchase and install the Print+ Response Inkjet Module that prints monochrome, 100% variable data messaging and graphics on business reply envelopes, correspondence return envelopes or inserts in-line during high-speed inserting and wrapping.PBI currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

We appreciate the company's better-than-expected earnings performance in the second quarter of 2013. However, the continued weakness in Production Mail and Management Services segments and decline in the Small and Medium Business Solutions (SMB) revenue streams have been a drag on the company's revenues.On Jul 30, Pitney Bowes reported second-quarter 2013 pro forma earnings per share of 52 cents, which was 15.6% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents. Quarterly earnings were up 1.9% year over year from 51 cents per share. Earnings for the second quarter 2012 exclude goodwill impairment charge of 40 cents, restructuring charges of 7 cents and loss of 10 cents due to discontinued operations.Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.16 billion, down 0.7% from $1.17 billion in the prior-year quarter. The top line benefited from double-digit growth in the Production Mail and Mail Services segments. International Mailing revenues were flat year over year. This was offset by lower recurring revenues from the SMB group, lower licensing revenues in the Software segment and lower revenues due to continued pricing pressure on some contract renewals in the Management Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 million.Following the release of the second-quarter results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2013 declined 5.4% to $1.76 per share. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2014 also contracted 7.7% to $1.69 per share.The demand for postal services is experiencing a continuing decline. Digital and electronic forms of mailing have substituted for the postal services, which is a threat to Pitney Bowes' revenues and profitability. Although Pitney has ventured into new products as an alternative to postal services, we remain skeptical about the success of these low-margin products.In addition, the company's free cash flow is being impacted by higher working capital requirements. Significant amount of cash ($86 million) was used for investing activities during the latest reported quarter (2Q13) compared with just $14 million in the second quarter of 2012. Cash and cash equivalents also dropped to $608.6 million during the quarter from $913.2 million in the prior-year quarter.Further, Pitney lowered its guidance for 2013. For 2013, the company expects revenues, excluding the impact of currency, to range from a decline of 1% to a 2% increase. Revenue guidance was lowered from the previous guidance of flat to up 3%. The company expects earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.77 a share, as against the $1.85 to $2.00 range mentioned previously. Free cash flow for 2013 is expected to be in the range of $575 million to $675 million compared to the previous guidance range of $600 million to $700 million.However, Pitney Bowes has been divesting its non-profitable businesses in order to become a more focused company. Following the earnings release, Pitney Bowes announced its plan to divest its North American management services unit to Apollo Global Management for $400 million. In May, the company announced its plan to sell the management services business wing in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to Swiss Post Solutions. The financial terms were not disclosed.Pitney Bowes carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which further justifies our recommendation.Some other stocks that are performing well in the industry and worth considering at the moment are  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

Because options pay off at a future date from the time of purchase, stock option trends can indicate where investors expect stocks to move.The two major stock options are call options and put options, and they represent optimism and pessimism respectively. Call options are the option to buy a stock at a future date and at a price set today \u2013 calls become profitable when the stock rises, so buying a call indicates the investor expects the stock to rise.Put options are the exact opposite. Whereas calls are the option to buy the stock, puts are the option to sell a stock in the future at a price fixed today. This becomes profitable if the stock falls over that time period, so investors buy puts when they become pessimistic on the stock\u2019s outlook.The Put/Call ratio is the number of put options relative to the number of call options for a given stock. If there are more put options (a put/call ratio greater than 1), then there are more investors who think that the share price will decrease than there are investors who think that the share price will increase.Simply put, a high put/call ratio reflects a bearish sentiment about a given stock while a low ratio reflects a bullish sentiment. For this article we focus on stocks with low put call options.To demonstrate this idea, we screened for stocks for that are seeing significant decreases in their put/call ratios over the last ten trading days, indicating bullish changes in sentiment from the options market.To further refine the list, we screened for companies that have significant cash holdings relative to average quarterly operating expenses \u2013 a sign of strong liquidity.

For this article, we define an inflection point as the convergence between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.When these two moving averages cross, it often represents a shift in investor sentiment. If the 50-day SMA moves above the 200-day SMA (bullish), it's called a \"Golden Cross\" signal. If, on the other hand, the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA (bearish), it's called the \"Death Cross\".To compile this list, we started with a universe of stocks that have seen the 50-day SMA cross above the 200-day moving average (bullish signal).

However, Autodesk did not disclose the terms of the transaction.Pittsburgh, PA based Allpoint develops software that collects and processes 3D LIDAR point cloud data for the roadway and building markets. LIDAR is an optical remote-sensing technique, which is emerging as a cost-effective alternative to traditional survey technologies. LIDar produces mass point cloud datasets that can be managed and analyzed using Allpoint software.Autodesk will integrate the Allpoint technology into its Reality Capture Group, which will further expand its capability in creating digital models of physical objects and spaces. Allpoint technology adds to Autodesk's earlier acquisition of Alice labs and RealViz.Autodesk expects the acquisition to have no impact on the guidance issued on Nov 15, 2012. Currently, Autodesk expects revenues to be in the range of $570 to $600 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of 43 cents to 51 cents for the fourth quarter of 2013. For 2013, Autodesk expects revenues to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.31 billion and EPS on a non-GAAP basis in the range of $1.84 to $1.92.Acquisitions have played a pivotal part in developing Autodesk's business over the last couple of years. Autodesk acquired 23 companies during fiscal 2012 for a total of $221.7 million, significantly higher than $13.5 million in fiscal 2011.Autodesk continues to expand its product portfolio through the acquisition of small start-ups that are easy to integrate within its own business line. Acquisitions have also helped it to expand its cloud-based product offerings in the recent times. In the first nine months of fiscal 2013, Autodesk acquired 8 companies that include a number of software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers for approximately $204.2 million.We believe that Autodesk will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions in order to expand its digital prototyping solutions. These solutions are expected to cater to manufacturers of all sizes, enhancing their ability to design, visualize and simulate their products before they are built.Moreover, the new cloud-based products will boost Autodesk's subscriber base in the near term. The company is also increasing its penetration in the mobile market by developing software for smartphones and  iPad. We believe that these initiatives will boost Autodesk's top-line growth going forward.However, foreign exchange fluctuations and sluggish macroeconomic environment remain the primary headwinds.

Changes in a stock\u2019s put/call over time can indicate whether options traders (which are generally considered to be sophisticated investors) are becoming more bullish or bearish on the company\u2019s outlook. This is helpful information to prospective investors that want to get in at a good time.To illustrate this idea, we ran a screen on the tech sector for the top 10 stocks seeing the most bullish changes in sentiment from options traders, with the largest decreases in put/call over the last ten trading days.Do you think these stocks will outperform like options traders predict?

We all know that oil is a limited resource. But we also know that if we don't find alternative sources of energy, the world as we know it today will no longer exist.That's why alternative energy ETFs are so tantalizing to think about. There is so much discussion about the older energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas that have been moving our economy for decades. Climate change discussions as well as rising commodity prices have helped bring alternative or renewable energy discussions to the front table.The problem of course is that these new energy sources are often much more expensive and while that may change in the future, it is not clear how much time it will take. Another important factor when it comes to energy is government regulation. Other sectors are relatively free of government interference as long as they obey the basic laws. Governments have put their money where their policy is by granting huge financial incentives to alternative energy companies but with financial support comes regulations. Energy, including alternative energy, is seen as something with national security implications and is keenly under the radar of most governments. Since there's no way to know how the governments would react in the future, it adds a good deal of risk to any alternative energy investment.As an investment perspective, recently, with the drastic drop in oil prices, alternative energy funds have suffered. It should not come as a surprise that coal related stocks and ETFs have continued to be one of the best performing sectors this year. Considering that alternative energy is yet to produce sensible economics, oil and coal continue to be cheaper to use than alternative energy. Another basic disadvantage that holds true for most of the alternative energies is that their supplies are mostly dependent on nature and thus are not constant.However there is no denying the fact that eventually there will be some big winners in the alternative energy field but as of now there is a deep uncertainty as to how much time it will take to get alternative energy in the driver's seat. The advantages of using alternative energy will be only be realized when people are forced to make the changes to their lifestyles and businesses.Alternative energy ETFs come in two basic forms: those that invest in a wide swathe and those that invest in a concentrated area of the alternative energy market. PBW tracks the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, a benchmark that tracks companies that focus on greener and generally renewable sources of energy and technologies that facilitate cleaner energy. It holds 53 securities and is heavily exposed to companies in the electrical equipment sector. : PBD consists of 88 securities and has nearly one-third of its exposure to U.S. firms, the largest single country allocation. Additionally, the fund is heavy on mid and small cap securities; just 14% of the assets are classified as large cap firms. The WilderHill  Index (ECO) is an index that defines and tracks the Clean Energy sector: specifically, businesses that stand to benefit substantially from a societal transition toward use of cleaner energy and conservation. Stocks and sector weightings within the ECO Index are based on their significance for clean energy, technological influence and relevance to preventing pollution in the first place. The WilderHill Clean Energy Index (ECO) is a index that tracks the clean energy sector and the PowerShares Clean Energy Portfolio (  ) is the investment vehicle that replicates it.: PZD consists of 78 firms which focus on knowledge-based products\nor services that improve operation, performance, productivity, or\nefficiency, while reducing costs, inputs, energy consumption,\nwaste, or pollution. : PZD consists of 78 firms which focus on knowledge-based products or services that improve operation, performance, productivity, or efficiency, while reducing costs, inputs, energy consumption, waste, or pollution. : This iShares fund allocates its holdings to a wide variety of alternative energy sources. Besides solar and wind, the fund also invests in firms that produce biomass and ethanol and geothermal producers. The top sector is electrical equipment, which makes up about 53% of assets. : The index is a modified market capitalization weighted index designed to track the performance of clean energy companies that are publicly traded in the United States and includes companies engaged in manufacturing, development, distribution and installation of emerging clean-energy technologies including, but not limited to, solar photovoltaics, biofuels and advanced batteries. : This ETF focuses on mid cap securities, which make up more than half of the fund's total assets. KWT's top holdings are Renewable Energy Corp. and MEMC Electronic Materials, which combine to make up 22.6% of the fund's total assets. : TAN offers investors a greater level of exposure to small cap securities by investing slightly more than two-thirds of its total assets in small cap firms. Its largest holding is First Solar, which makes up 10% of the fund's total assets. FAN offers investors global exposure to the wind industry, allocating 26.2% of its assets to Spanish equities, 16.3% to the U.S. and 14.9% to Germany. This ETF also offers investors global exposure, and is diversified across market capitalization levels with nearly equal allocations to large, mid, and small cap securities.The alternative energy sector is undergoing a recovery after having absorbed the global recession and falling waterfall in the world price of crude. Earlier this year, very few alternative energy companies have been in the trough. Although these alternative energy companies have recovered from their low, their valuations are still well below the 52-week high. The growth of alternative energy companies is closely tied to the fortunes of the economy.A World Bank report has suggested that six major East Asian economies will together need roughly $80 billion in investment in alternative energy sources per year in order to stabilize their greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. Since 2005, investment in clean energy increased by 230% to $162 billion in 2009.Under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act ((ARRA)) passed in February 2009, the U.S. Treasury Department has implemented a program to issue cash grants in lieu of investment tax credit for renewable energy projects. Asian governments, most notably China, have increased their financial support for solar projects. China is aiming at increasing its installed solar power capacity to 2GW by 2011 from 140MW capacity at the end of fiscal 2008.
