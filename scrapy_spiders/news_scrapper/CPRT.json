{"Content": ["Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. \tFor the ProShares ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF (Symbol: QLD), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $110.40 per unit.\n\n\nWith QLD trading at a recent price near $94.85 per unit, that means that analysts see 16.39% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of QLD's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Copart Inc (Symbol: CPRT), MercadoLibre Inc (Symbol: MELI), and Cisco Systems Inc (Symbol: CSCO). Although CPRT has traded at a recent price of $65.39/share, the average analyst target is 38.51% higher at $90.57/share. Similarly, MELI has 33.80% upside from the recent share price of $506.16 if the average analyst target price of $677.22/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CSCO to reach a target price of $50.00/share, which is 20.69% above the recent price of $41.43. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CPRT, MELI, and CSCO:  \n\n   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n\nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.  \n\n\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", ["\nThere are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Copart Inc, but the average is just that \u2014 a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $65.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $110.00.  The standard deviation is $14.787.\n\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average CPRT price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with CPRT crossing above that average target price of $83.00/share, investors in CPRT have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $83.00 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Copart Inc:\n\n\n\nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

(CPRT) are climbing more than 7% Tuesday morning at $70.22. There are no company-specific news to drive the stock up.Before the coronavirus pandemic hitting the market, Copart shares had touched an all time high of $104.88 in February. It has recorded a 52-week low of $55.69 in March.U.S. stocks are rising on Tuesday following news the spread of the coronavirus is slowing in hot spots like New York.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new July 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.40.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $75.60 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $82.02/share today.\n\nBecause the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.50% return on the cash commitment, or 33.46% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, and highlighting in green where the $80.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.10.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CPRT stock at the current price level of $82.02/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.63% if the stock gets called away at the July 17th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CPRT shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CPRT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.00% boost of extra return to the investor, or 30.41% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 46%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 44%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $82.02) to be 43%.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Liaw, President of Copart. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, Dan. I'll start today's call with the Safe Harbor, before turning it over to Jay for opening remarks.During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, disposal of non-operating assets, foreign currency-related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09.We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in assessing our business trends and performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis.In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including forward-looking statements concerning management's current views with respect to trends and uncertainties, including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.The current worldwide pandemic could adversely affect our financial results in future periods based on declines in accident volume and other pandemic-related factors. And our business and operating results are generally subject to additional uncertainties such as dependence on our major vehicles, sellers, business [Technical Issues] relating to our international expansion strategies, factors affecting average selling prices for auction vehicles, any additional risks identified under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended July 31, 2019 and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on our Form 10-Q.Any forward-looking statements [Technical Issues] as of today and Copart [Technical Issues] obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.With that, CEO, Jay Adair. -- Thanks, Jeff. You're breaking up just a little bit on that. So, maybe we should dial in. -- Yeah [Speech Overlap]. -- I'll go ahead and kick off. Yeah. Perfect. Again, welcome everyone. Thanks for coming to the third quarter call. If I were to describe Copart at the beginning of the quarter, I would say full speed ahead. We were acquiring land, developing that property, winning business, selling record units, record number of units Companywide. And if I were to fast forward a month later to the beginning of March, the best way I could describe us would be unpredicted, but prepared.Clearly, looking at COVID and it was all day, every day, COVID in the first week of March. By the time we got to the second week of March, I had reached out to some friends of mine that are in the service industry, people that own hair salons, people that own restaurants, and the government has not yet told anyone to, specifically, not go to work or to specifically not open up their business, but just the rhetoric that was coming out of the news and out of Washington was enough to keep people from going out to dinner, to keep people from traveling. And so we saw that Companywide.We saw overnight our customers couldn't travel, overnight we had to cancel conferences and cancel events that we had planned. And this was -- we had, at this point, gone from what I would say unpredictable to a position where who could anticipate that the government would actually be thinking of shutting down business. And my concern was really about the behavior of people and so I reached out to some political contacts that I've got, and I quickly came away from those meetings thinking they're going to actually shut business down.And obviously, the country has been through a number of experiences over the years, whether it'd be polio, whether it'd be Spanish flu, and we haven't been in that situation where we think business is going to be shut down. We saw that not just in the U.S., but coming out of Italy, the U.K. I think the U.S. was probably a little earlier on than the U.K. from the results I've seen. But in the end, the U.K. definitely shut down much harder than the U.S. did. But regardless, this was really, really unpredictable at that point.But as I said, very prepared. So first thing we did, this felt a little bit like the '08 financial crisis. We weren't sure if there was going to be liquidity at banks. So the first thing Copart did, not knowing the future, not knowing exactly how we were going to have to position ourselves, we pulled down in excess of $800 million on our line. And at that point, we had over $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet.We, subsequent to that, reached out to all of our employees. We put together the first of what would be a number of phone calls, that were Companywide phone calls, with all of our management and all of the fields. We recorded the calls so we could play them back. And this is really about setting people's fears aside. I mean the fear of COVID is something we can't control, but your financial security is something we could control. And these are precarious times. So, we reached out and let everyone know that we had a lot of cash. Can you hear me, OK? Okay. We reached out and let everyone know that we have a lot of cash and that -- one second here. Can you hear me on the call, all right?Yes, sir. Please proceed. -- You've got issues there, then Jeff will come in here. Okay. All right, folks, I'll continue. We've just -- we've got some -- Jeff and I are in two different locations, obviously because of COVID. They can hear me fine, you can all hear me, but apparently Jeff is having trouble. So he's going to get on and he'll continue. But just to continue on that note, we made it very clear that Copart had a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet, we can operate for months or we could survive for months without operating, without being able to pickup cars, without being able to sell cars.Now, clearly, that's going to be a problem for the nation, that's going to be a problem for the U.S., the U.K. and other markets we work in. I'll get into that. But the initial messaging to our Company was that we are strong, that there will be no furloughs for 90 days, that there will be no reduction of hours, and that this is about continuity. This is about Copart making sure that we can provide the services for our customers. And the way to do that is to give the people at Copart confidence so that they can deliver on that promise, and that's exactly what we did.As I said, we started off the quarter full speed ahead, and we didn't want to change from that position. So, we've continued throughout the quarter to acquire land, we've continued throughout the quarter to develop that land. We think this is necessary to the long-term success of Copart. We believe that this is a temporary reduction of volume, we're already seeing that, Jeff will talk about that a little more, but we're already seeing that volume coming back. But that was really message one.Message two was this new concept of essential business. And this is not -- clearly, this is something none of us have thought about before. And if you were to speak to some of my friends that run businesses, if you were to speak some of my friends that work at businesses, they all feel their businesses are essential, essential to their family, they're essential to their success. And so conceptually, it was hard to understand that the government would be, at the state level, at the federal level, at the city level, telling businesses not to operate. And I actually made an argument at that point with some of the politicians that I'm connected with or friends with. Let's look at quarantining high risk and let's look at if they got pre-existing conditions. And then let's look at trying to parse the population so that a quarter of us are at work or a third of us are at work or half of us are it work so we can maintain social distancing, similar to what I would say we're doing now as a company.So, throughout this experience, we had multiple times where law enforcement tried to shut down Copart locations, both in the U.S. and internationally in the U.K. And throughout all those experiences, our team rallied, and we made the arguments that are very clear. If Copart doesn't pick up cars from tow companies, they're going to get full and the streets are going to have cars left on them. If Copart doesn't sell vehicles, you're not going to have parts available for repair. If we don't pickup cars from body shops, you're not going to have body shops able to fix cars, you're not going to have insurance companies able to pay off insureds and it's going to stop the insurance process.So, we made very strong arguments in multiple states. And there was a couple of scenarios where we shut down for a day or two, and we were able to reverse that by working with Chiefs of Police and other folks in the law enforcement. We were able to reverse that and get back open. I'm happy to say all of Copart's locations, for the most part, have been open. For the most part, meaning we were down for a day and then back up, maybe down for a day or two and then back up.So, we have essentially been running through this whole quarter picking up vehicles, although less, and Jeff will talk about that, and we've been selling off a lot of inventory throughout this process. So, as I said, very unpredictable, but very prepared. This was something that -- internally, we have reflected on this and dealing with DMVs that have shut down and trying to work with those DMVs, so that they continue. While they're shut down to the general public and on the retail front, we've tried to work with them to continue to process titles in the back so that we can get these vehicles sold.Fortunately for us, we've had a large capacity as we've been adding land over the years, we've developed a lot of land, developed a lot of capacity, so we've got room at our facilities. We did things, there are some increased costs in the quarter because we did things, like move vehicles from one yard to another yard in anticipation of DMVs being shut down to ensure that we have enough room at that facility if we had to keep picking cars up and not be able to sell those vehicles.And then finally, I'd make the argument that we continue to express that we are a company that has for the last 17 years sold everything online. And so a lot of the states made the argument that if you're completely online, you can stay open. That was another one of our arguments that we utilized. And we've had the benefit of buyers being able to look online and bid online and then send trucks in to pick up the vehicle. So it's -- overall, it's been a very unpredictable experience.I, really, second week of March, didn't think I'd be eight weeks later seeing jobless claims at $36.5 million[Phonetic]. I just didn't -- I wasn't convinced that the government was going to actually be as aggressive as shutting business down across the country. We all know that that's been the case and we all know what's happened over that period of time. Our team has really, really rallied. The IT folks, though, not all at the office, because social distancing have continued to deliver technology.We've adjusted, we've course corrected on the fly, and changed the services, how we offer those services, the technology we use to offer those services. And our folks in the field have done a phenomenal job every single day, coming to work, making sure we unload trucks, put cars away, set sales, sell cars, load customers out etc. And so, one of the things we've said internally is while we didn't anticipate this pandemic, the folks at Copart were built for this.We have really done a great job as a company. And for those Copart folks out there that are listening to this call, as your CEO, you guys have done a phenomenal job, and actually you guys have kicked ass and I'm proud of everything you've done. And this is one of those experiences that will go down in the history books for me, and I couldn't be more prouder of the success and the way we've handled this pandemic.On that note, I'll turn it over to our President, Jeff Liaw, to give you an update on the quarter. -- Thank you, Jay. We'll start of the remarks with a deviation from our usual script and offer some comments on the COVID-19 crisis following Jay's narrative and its effect on our business, specifically how the coronavirus has affected our operations, our priorities and our financial results.On operations, as Jay noted, beginning in March 2020, our business and operations began to experience the interruption worldwide, first within our European operations and as the month progressed and the quarter progressed throughout the balance of our global operations. As Jay noted, materially, in all of our jurisdictions, we've been deemed by local authorities an essential business because we helped to ensure the removal of vehicles from repair shops, impound yards, streets and highways, enabling the critical function of our world's road infrastructure.We're proud of the role our people play in, serving the communities in which we do business, and the work we do will enable the smooth functioning of our societies during the crisis and certainly support our eventual recovery from it as well. We've taken great care to follow appropriate health and safety protocols in all of our facilities to ensure safe working conditions for our employees, as well as for our sellers, buyers and other business partners with whom we come into contact.We've also adapted in many cases to remote work arrangements and have experienced no material disruptions to our business. We frequently and proactively communicate with our customers as well. And in many respects, we're simply continuing business as usual. For example, our facilities remain fully operational as well as the online-only auctions Jay noted a moment ago. Because we've operated exclusively online auctions now for 17 years and have made iterative refinements and more transformative overhauls over the years, we've not experienced any disruptions in any way in terms of how we sell cars. And we continue to believe that our auction technology drives the best-in-class experience for our members and best-in-class returns for our sellers as well.Turning to our priorities. It won't surprise you that our near-term priorities are on our customers, in many cases adapting real time to their own workflow modifications and accommodating their remote work arrangements. We deployed new technologies in support of those accommodations as well. Our long-term focus is again on investing in international member recruitment and retention. Our auction liquidity is sacrosanct and enables our business to grow.We are focused keenly on extending our technology advantage in every respect, both in terms of our auctions as well as in many ways we interact with our sellers, our members, and the various aspects of our ecosystem. We are investing aggressively in our future also in terms of capital expenditures and support of capacity. We believe there isn't any such thing as non-critical capital expenditures. If they were non-critical, we never would have made them in the first place. We note we spent more on capital expenditures this past quarter than we did in all of fiscal 2015 in support of ours and our customer's future growth. We'll be opportunistic as we look forward in acquiring still more capacity to serve our customers.We are investing in our people as well. We continue to recruit, train and promote our team members. We have not furloughed employees or suspended 401(k) contributions. We have said before and fundamentally believe that our people are one of our most critical assets. And while we will always be prudent stewards of our business, we won't make short-sighted decisions that affect our ability to serve our customers well. We want to be prepared to serve them and their growth and our growth as well, and of course to be prepared for potentially active tropical storm season ahead.Turning to the coronavirus effect on our financial results. It won't surprise you that our operating results for the quarter were affected by lower processed vehicle volume. We received and sold fewer vehicles in the quarter than we had anticipated due of course to the pandemic. The volume declines, in turn, were due to fewer accidents occurring as a result of fewer miles being driven in response to state and national shelter-in-place orders. We track a range of industry sources, including Apple Mobility, Google, the University of Washington's metrics among many others.And we would note that, from the baseline it appears that driving activity dropped at down 55% to 65% relative to the pre-coronavirus levels during certain periods in the quarter, though we also note that activity has increased substantially from that trough level. And then compared to apparent reductions in driving activity, our assignment volume has not been affected as severely, not nearly so, a function of driving behavior and total loss frequency. On driving behavior, because the roads are less congested, it appears that drivers are often driving faster and perhaps with more distractions still.Total loss frequency has increased according to most industry sources. That's been caused by a mix of repair shop disruptions, which have affected their ability to service automobiles, and also insurance carrier decisions on remote work and wanting to simplify the loss claims process as opposed to having adjusters with the vehicles, policyholders, recover vehicles after repairs.We've also noted some volatility in selling prices for vehicles at our auctions, though we would note also that liquidity and auction participation has remained high throughout the crisis. Selling prices in more recent days, after the end of the quarter, have actually reached levels higher than pre-crisis levels. The price volatility during the quarter, we would attribute in parts to substantial -- substantially strengthened U.S. dollar, and therefore the currencies that often purchase or the countries that often purchase cars at our auctions have seen their purchasing power somewhat impaired as a result.There, of course, has also been global economic uncertainty, which has affected demand for vehicles as well, and finally, some potential logistics challenges or uncertainties regarding the exported vehicles. But by and large, the auctions have -- auction liquidity has remained quite strong.On our own financial liquidity, as we noted in our 8-K issued in March, we drew down $825 million in funds under our available revolving credit facility, in part in response to what we perceived as systemic uncertainty. We've subsequently repaid all of those outstanding borrowings under our facilities. And as of April 30, 2020, we had approximately $1.1 billion of available liquidity, including $300 million of cash and the undrawn facility I just described.Our conservative capitalization, we think, enables us to continue to make decisions for the long-term benefit and interest of our customers and our shareholders. Looking forward then, on the coronavirus, we expect the pandemic to have, of course, an adverse effect on our quarterly revenues in future quarters with magnitude and timing of those effects dependent on the extent in duration of suspended economic activity across our markets, as well as the potential resumption of shelter-in-place orders.The longer-term impact on our business will depend on the development of the pandemic, society's responses to those developments and the potential availability of vaccines and treatments, of course, none of which we can predict.In short, our approach to the pandemic is that it's a massive disruption to the global economy and the markets we serve, but not a permanent structural shift. If and when the facts indicate otherwise, and that we are facing such a structural shift, In either way, the reduced demand for our services, for example, permanent remote work arrangements that reduce daily commuting, or in ways that increase demand for our services, for example, the substitution of automotive transport for public transits and air travel, will adjust accordingly.As we discuss our financial results, we'll share the customary metrics that we provide every quarter. Before the crisis, the themes we've discussed in the past have largely continued, as Jay noted in his opening remarks. Meaningful increases in unit sales, in insurance, in non-insurance, in assignments, average selling prices, bidding activity, international bidding activity and so forth. So the metrics we'll share of course include a blend of pre and -- pre-crisis and crisis input.Turning to the third quarter. We experienced global revenue decline of 0.5% or $2.8 million year-over-year. That includes an unfavorable currency effect of $3.6 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollars -- of the U.S. dollar, pardon me, as well as the shift of a particular customer from a purchase arrangement to a consignment engagement, you've heard us describe before.Global service revenue grew $17.9 million or 3.8% year-over-year, which, as we've noted before, is a more accurate reflection of the underlying economic activity in our business that in turn reflects growth in the U.S. of 3.6% in service revenues and international service revenue growth of 5.1%. We did experience a purchased vehicle decline of $20.7 million or 26% as growth in the U.S. was more than offset by the international decline we noted a moment ago, primarily driven again by the shift of a U.K. customer to a fee-based sales contract.On unit growth, we experienced global unit sales decrease of just under 1%, we'll provide more color momentarily, with the U.S. increase -- U.S. unit increase of 1.4% and international unit decline of 12.6%. The U.S. unit growth has been driven by organic growth from our existing insurance customers and market share gains. Insurance grew 5.6% in units sold for the quarter. Non-insurance declined 13.4%. Though, if you exclude the charities and wholesale business, our non-insurance business actually grew year-over-year for the quarter.Prior to the crisis, as one important group that we track, our dealer consignment volumes actually had continued their double-digit growth rates year-over-year. Our non-insurance business, of course, has been meaningfully affected by COVID-19. We believe we have outperformed other auto auction businesses during the crisis, in part because we have been a natively digital business for almost 20 years and because of our auction liquidity.Turning to global inventory. Worldwide, our inventory declined 9.6% with U.S. inventory declining 11.3% and international inventory growth of positive 1.2%. Our inventory declined as auctions consumed inventory, which was then replenished at reduced rates.Our gross profit declined from $251.6 million to $242.6 million or a 3.6% decline year-over-year. Our gross margin rate declined slightly from 45.5% to 44.1%. In the U.S., we experienced a gross margin contraction of 50.2% to 46.3% as our yards remained open throughout the pandemic with lower-than-expected unit sales and assignment volumes. Our international gross margins increased from 25.4% to 31.7%, due in part to operating efficiencies and also in part to the shift of that customer from a principal arrangement to a consignment.In the U.S. and globally, we do note rising for unit processing cost a reflection of negative operating leverage from fewer units sold and fewer units received than we had previously anticipated.Turning to selling prices for the quarter. Within the U.S., we experienced a decline in average selling prices year-over-year for the full quarter of 4.8%. Prior to the crisis, we had observed increases in selling prices within the quarter. And since the end of the quarter, we have seen prices rise to above pre-crisis levels. As I noted a moment ago, the volatility in the quarter has been due in part to currency effects as well as logistics and demand uncertainty.Even with this unprecedented global dislocation, our international member base remains critical to our auction liquidity and outcomes. We actually increased unique and international bidders in the quarter by almost 20% year-over-year and observed increases in bids by international members and increases in bids per unit sold. The outcome, of course, is higher bids per unit, and therefore better selling prices for our customers as we drive enhanced auction liquidity.I'll turn now to general and administrative expenditures. In general, as we've noted before, G&A expenditures will fluctuate and grow over time. We continue to believe that we can achieve operating leverage over time. As with all trended data in our business, gross margins, G&A unit sales and so forth, we'd encourage you to review longer-dated trend lines rather than the single quarter metrics for a more accurate view of the business.Our GAAP operating income declined from $207.5 million to $195.1 million for the quarter. Our net interest expense increased 9.7% year-over-year, due largely to the drawn revolver for a portion of the quarter, partially offset by lower interest rates as well. Other income of positive $2.3 million was attributable to earnings from a non-consolidated equity-method investment, currency gains and asset disposal gains.In the third quarter, we -- our provision for taxes was $44.3 million, which includes the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options, which has been reflected as such in the non-GAAP earnings reconciliation.Our GAAP net income decreased from $192.7 million a year ago to $147.5 million this year, and our non-GAAP net income declined from $154.9 million to a $138.3 million for the quarter.Turning then to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with just north of $300 million in cash on the balance sheet and just north of $100 million in net debt, leaving us essentially unlevered. We adopted a new lease standard this year in the first quarter, which shows a $106.6 million operating lease right-of-use asset and $109.1 million of operating lease liabilities on our balance sheet.On cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was robust at $294 million, an increase versus the third quarter of '19 and a substantial increase versus the second quarter as well. This is driven in part by the cash flow generated from the business as well as the working capital reductions that come with the decline in inventory.Our capital expenditures for the quarter of $90.6 million. Again, more than 80% of our capex was attributable to investing in capacity expansion. We have a number of new yards and expansion projects in the queue as well. We continue our efforts to purchase and develop land to meet current and prospective demand.With that I'll turn the mic back to the operator, who can begin taking questions.Thank you, sir. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question queue. This one comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hey, Bob. -- Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off were you kind of finished the prepared remarks as it relates to the land. You talked about, earlier in the remarks, the two potential impacts on longer term on miles driven, it could be more work from home could reduce miles driven, or a fewer people are taking mass transit or flying, there could be an increase. So, how do you -- obviously, I don't expect you to know the answer to that, what the outcome will be in that regard. So, how does that impact your land strategy right now? And then just as it relates to that too, is there enough activity going on that you can find more land? Is that -- is it easier or harder now as a result of the economy to purchase land, if you wanted? -- Very good question, Bob, and good to hear from you. In short, I think you're right that those big societal questions, I think, will remain to be resolved over the months, quarters and the years ahead. On land invest investments, the lead times for acquiring and developing land are quite long. Our expectation is that we will use that land to accommodate our customers' growth in our own for a multiple year horizon. So, it's not a one-month, 18-month, even a three-year decision. We acquire land because it makes sense over a five- to 20-year horizon.We continue our activity. I think your intuition is fair. And that, in some respects, our ability to do so has been, perhaps, limited in some cases, where economic activity or regulatory approvals have stalled because of the virus impact. In other cases, though the crisis may unlock opportunities for us to move forward because of land is now available at more reasonable values or local jurisdictions are still more excited about having the jobs that a new Copart facility brings with it.So, I think, in short, we have not meaningfully disrupted or changed our strategic approach to land acquisitions and we wouldn't do so based on anything that happens over a six- to 10-week horizon. As we noted in the opening remarks, if the facts unfold differently going forward, we'll of course revisit, but for now, no change in our course. -- Got it. Great. And then -- and we've talked a little bit on previous calls about your work with carriers on optimizing the total loss process. And you noted total loss frequency seems to have ticked up recently as well, and we've seen that in some publications as well. Can you just expand on what value you can add to the carriers now in the total loss process, given your increased data that you've been collecting for so many years? -- Yeah. And good question, Bob. And I think we talked about that a couple of quarters ago, and I misunderstood your question last quarter. But in short, we believe that providing more data to our insurance carrier partners and earlier in their own loss claims process will help them make more informed decisions and in many cases, will empower them to total cars more quickly, which saves them processing burden, storage costs in repair shops, uncertainty regarding the loss claims resolution [Phonetic] with our own policyholders.So for us, it is masking the data that comes from having sold tens of millions of vehicles over the years, being able to value them efficiently and quickly based on limited data sets available to us at that moment in time and sharing that data in ways that empower those carriers to make the decisions more quickly. That's what we met a couple of quarters ago, and that work certainly continues apace. -- Okay, super. And then last one from me, I'll jump back in queue. And just shifting gears a little bit, can you give us an update on Germany? Has the economic impact over there or anything else impacted insurance carriers' decisions to convert to the U.S. style auction? How are things going and just a general update? -- I think in broad strokes, we continue to move forward there as well. So, we've invested and continue to invest in land and in people and technologies. Our dialogues with insurance carriers continue to be very productive. I think we noted on the last call that we had begun selling consignment vehicles on behalf of insurance carriers there.This kind of disruption, I think, cuts -- the coronavirus cuts both ways. On the one hand, it's difficult nowadays to meet face to face, either among ourselves or with our customers or prospective customers. On the other hand, radical shifts like this also tend to open the mind to considering alternatives where the status quo is no longer the glide path that it once was. So, I think it hasn't changed in either way. I think our conviction that our long-term prosperity in Germany is there for us to pursue. -- Super. Thanks very much. -- Thanks, Bob.And we'll take our next question in queue, comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thank you for taking my questions as well. Wanted to ask, to what extent did the pandemic reduced revenue in the quarter knowing that revenue recognition can be something like 50 days after the loss event, so we would expect, I guess, the pandemic impact to be much more severe in the current quarter? -- Yeah. I think that observation is there. And your question is difficult to answer. Your directional observation is fair. And the reason the question is difficult to answer is, you start to cut the data very, very finely, right, where -- when do you consider the coronavirus start date to have happened in Oklahoma versus Louisiana versus Sao Paulo versus Toronto, right? So, I think the directional attack is very hard to assess and that's why we didn't get into very elaborate pre and post metrics. It didn't -- it just wasn't worthwhile or clean enough to do so pre and post. But, yes, you're correct that given the leads and lags in our business, several weeks from when the accident happens to when the car is assigned to us, and then a number of weeks again before we have the title process and the car available for auction, but there is a lagging effect on our volume, yes. -- Thanks. And then, maybe I know you don't like to comment on the current quarter so much, but maybe just give a sense for what the last couple of weeks have looked like in terms of assignments versus last year. Are we meaningfully better as driving activity normalizes or still far below last year? -- I think, Craig, we tend not to comment, as you know, on the current quarter. As I noted a few moments ago, we have seen assignment volumes, ASPs and so forth have certainly rebounded very meaningfully from the troughs. The year-over-year comparison will be for when we talk about the quarter. -- Okay. Thanks. And then just on inventory, that was a helpful metric that you always share. Maybe not down as much as I had feared and actually up internationally. What's driving the international increase? Is that purely just internal secular trends that you created through your growth initiatives or is that market kind of coming back sooner than maybe I had feared? -- It's a fair question. I think there are, yes, our secular forces that we've talked about every quarter. In some cases, also there have been interruptions outside the U.S. in DMV processing of title. So, you noted that the international unit sales were also down more than they were in the U.S. In some cases, that's because of inventory that's been home outside the U.S. as well. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thanks, Craig.We'll take our next question in queue comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good morning guys. -- Good morning, Bret. -- On the inventory question, and we think about the trough in driving being the beginning of April and your month-end inventory being down around 11% [Phonetic]. Would that in theory be maybe trough inventory in the sense that may be an assignment takes a couple of weeks post crash? And if driving has picked up, would it be seeing inventory sequentially higher do you think? -- No, not inventory, Bret, trough assignments maybe, right? We are several weeks out from trough driving activity, but inventory itself is in the accumulation of many weeks, months and in some cases, years old stuff. So that's a bigger layer cake so to speak that includes driving activity, accident volume, total loss frequency from a much longer period of time. -- Okay. And then on recent selling prices rebounding, is that on the back of domestic bids or is the foreign buyer back in the market pretty aggressively? -- Both. There's meaningfully increased unique bidders and bids, both domestically and internationally. -- Okay. And then a housekeeping question. I think Jay had mentioned that some of the costs are associated with moving vehicles around logistically due to DMV activity. Could you give us an idea how much expense was in the quarter around that? -- Don't have a precise number to provide, Bret. I think it's -- I think, in short, the moving of vehicles on logistics, in part it was in fear frankly of us having vehicles stranded. So, we wanted to make sure that our most congested yards would be able to continue to serve our customers. And so we moved some cars at our expense within our own network. So, I think that's what Jay was alluding to. But, no, don't have a precise number to provide. -- Okay. Great. Thanks.We'll take our next question queue comes from Stephanie Benjamin, Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good afternoon. -- Hi. -- Hey, Stephanie. -- I wanted to comment on some of the land acquisitions and the continued aggressive capex plans. So, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the geographic location or if you're targeting specific areas, is this more domestic focused, international focused, what's the kind of general theme or geographies that you're looking at in terms of some of these expansions would be helpful. Thank you. -- Thanks, Stephanie. A healthy mix of both is the answer. So a fair bit within, perhaps, our long-standing traditional markets in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., but also investments in Brazil, in Germany and elsewhere. So all of the above. And it's in pursuit of in support of our long-term growth, right. We can't stop the ship to wait for crystal clear certainty on what happens with driving activity and so forth. We fundamentally believe that we'll continue to drive auction liquidity, but the 50-year trends on total loss frequency will not abate on society's demand for mobility.In general, mobility isn't just commuting to work, it's also necessary for leisure, for healthcare, for education, and that those 100-year trends really will continue perhaps with a meaningful interruption as it stands today. So, believing those underlying principles, I think we just want to invest to support our own growth and that of our customers. So, I think it would be irresponsible for us to arrest that process mid-course. -- Absolutely. And then in terms of some of the comments you've made about certainly seeing some improvement across metrics from trough levels. Is that true in terms both the -- obviously, the U.S., but internationally are you seeing some of the same levels of trends? -- In short, yes, with a fair bit of variability and a fair bit of uncertainty, right. So we track those metrics very carefully, but we also -- we'd be at risk of pretty meaningfully oversteering the business that we responded to. Daily traffic reports in the U.K. from Friday, right, that's not a good way to to operate a business or make strategic decisions either. So, we track those metrics. We have seen recovery in some cases. Certainly, some countries were later to shut down, and therefore it will be later to reopen, somewhere earlier and therefore earlier. So, we've seen the full gamut of activity. As you described, some folks recovering more quickly and others more slowly. -- Understood. Thank you. -- Thank you, Stephanie.We'll take our next question in queue, comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. -- Morning. -- Hey, Jeff, wanted to start on something you talked about on the dealer consignment side. You said it was stronger pre-crisis, obviously, probably slowed meaningfully, given what we've heard from the channel during the crisis. How do you think that channel progresses and the health of that channel progresses from here, just given the declines in reduction we've seen in used vehicle sales, both in the U.S. and globally? -- A fair question. I think if the question is over the next two quarters to three quarters, harder for me to answer. I think over the long haul, I think we remain quite bullish about our ability to serve that market. The volumes in the near term, of course, impaired by reduced activity period. Folks are taking fewer trade-ins, they're trafficking less than vehicles period. So there are fewer that makes sense to routes to consign with Copart. Over the long haul though, our auction liquidity, our international buyer base, the buying and selling of new and used cars, I think will continue to capture the growing portion of that ecosystem.So, our outlook long term, certainly has not changed. As I noted a moment ago, I do think we have somewhat meaningfully outperformed other such auto auction platforms during the period, in part because we were never dependent on folks coming and having lunch at the auction facility and bidding live on cars. We have been made it digital for a long time, and I think it showed in the quarter. -- Helpful. And then maybe a related question. Just on the impact of used-vehicle pricing, there is a positive dynamic as that falls to units. The total loss rate going higher. There is a negative to that on revenue per unit. Can you help us just think through the puts and takes and kind of -- is it a net positive or net negative, as we think about the changes in used-vehicle prices? And then how that impacts maybe the next 12 months to 24 months? -- That's a fair and difficult question, and one that I've wrestled with now for five years. You're correct. Directionally speaking that with softer used car prices, cars will total more easily and we would see a unit volume improvement. With lower used car prices, however, all else equal, the selling prices for our cars would be reduced as well, and we would therefore, all else equal, make less per car than we otherwise would. How those net? I think we struggled over the years to know what we quote route for.I think as a CFO and as a financially oriented person, I know that we have hundreds of thousands of cars in inventory already, and I want to achieve the best possible selling prices for those cars. So, it's probably intuitively hard to route for declining asset values when you already have many of them. But that said, the unit volume effect would be real. If you saw a substantial decline in used car prices, our unit volumes would increase very meaningfully. And even over the past say four years or five years down, our used car prices have remained robust and very robust relative to where industry analysts had forecasted if they would be five years ago.That has no doubt suppressed unit volume that otherwise would have come to Copart, which has been masked by other forces, total loss frequency, market share gains, let in by other forces that have made that somewhat invisible. But there's no doubt that robust prices have suppressed unit demand for our services. -- Got it. Really helpful. And then if I could squeeze a last one in. Jeff, over the last 12 months, we've heard a lot more talk around the industry, just about ancillary services providing more for the insurance companies. Are there any services today that your customers are requesting that you don't provide? Or do you guys have a robust suite today that you think covers most of your insurance companies' needs? -- I think, it's tough to talk about customers with monolithic entity, some of them certainly have an appetite for us to do more and to vertically integrate still more into what they do day-to-day. And we certainly have expanded our service offerings over the past year, five years, 10 years, 20 years, and we do more and more for our insurance carrier partners. So, yes, there are additional services that we offer and more services that we will offer over time as well. -- Thanks for all the color. Good luck, guys. -- Thank you.We'll take our next question in queue, comes from Derek Glynn with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. -- Yes, thank you for taking the questions. In this call and in the past, you've discussed some positive tailwinds driving higher total loss frequency. At the same time, we're seeing higher ADAS attach rates on vehicles, which may reduce frequency at some point. And you've also increased exposure to non-insurance segments. I'm wondering if growing volumes in those non-insurance channels is a conscious effort perhaps to hedge yourself from an eventual decline in accident frequency. Is there any urgency to diversify the business? -- A lot of different embedded questions in what you just posed, so I'll try to dissect them one by one. First, in terms of ADAS effect on frequency, I would note a couple of things. One is that I think the working hypothesis is that it will eventually reduce accident frequency. And I think that's a reasonable hypothesis because safety technologies for the past 50 years have generally reduced accident frequency. That's been true for as long as Copart's been around, with one short-term blip, I would say, between 2011 and 2016, when accident frequency actually went up year-over-year. That was a function of the iPhone proliferating across Saudi.So, generally speaking, accident frequency does decline. ADAS, on the other hand, we think, will drive increases in total loss frequency and those forces will offset one another. Over the course of history, total loss frequency has generally increased much more than accident frequency has decreased. ADAS, I think, there is a very logical thread to walk from ADAS proliferation to total loss frequency, because what makes cars safer tend to be the sensors on the perimeter of cars that are easily damaged, difficult and expensive to calibrate, and will drive still more cars to be totaled.Specifically, on your question of our diversification into other segments, I wouldn't characterize it that way. It's not a risk mitigation measure so much as it is the byproduct of auction liquidity as we have cultivated an international and domestic member base that increasingly is purchasing vehicles that have lighter and lighter damage. It begins to more heavily overlap the whole car universe as well, and therefore the cars that dealer receive on trade-ins become more and more attractive at Copart. We immediately expose that car to buyers in Nigeria, in Honduras, in Poland, Lithuania, in Oklahoma, in Maine, and it is that liquidity which has enabled us to grow within the dealer segment. So it's not per se a desire to mitigate risk, it's a desire to grow the business. And ultimately that incremental dealer car also then helps our insurance companies as well. Auction liquidity begets some more liquidity and begets better auction returns. -- Okay, great. Appreciate that. And then can you elaborate on what was your original intent in drawing down that amount of capital on the credit line? Was that solely a precautionary measure, given the uncertain economic climate? Or was there anything perhaps more opportunistic you were thinking about doing in terms of other capital allocation priorities? Would appreciate some clarity there. -- Fair question. That was more just a risk mitigation measure we took at a moment when the global economy and the financial system. There was enough uncertainty and a low enough cost that have made sense for us to draw the revolver. We know that we have the cash available to us should we have needed it. We still do of course. Our revolving credit facility remains quite intact with first-tier banks behind it. So we have conviction now that it is there when we need it. And that was all there was to it[Phonetic]. -- Understood. Thank you very much. -- Thank you.We'll take our next question in queue, this comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good morning, Jeff and Jay. How are you? -- Morning. -- Good Gary. -- How are you? -- Good, good. Couple of questions here. I was writing real fast. I'm trying to keep up. You said your non-insurance were down, vehicles were down 13.4%, is that correct? -- Let me give you the precise decimal, but keep going. -- Well, what I was trying to get at is, if you back out the charity cars, what -- were they down or up? You have that? -- If you back out, I said the charities and wholesalers would have been positive -- slightly positive, just north of 1% for the quarter. -- Okay. That's fine. And then just kind of a hypothetical question here. Given how long it takes for the whole cycle of -- from accidents to assignments, etc., if hypothetically, the country opens up by say the middle of June, all right, obviously Q4 is going to be challenged, and no fault of yours, it's just that's the way it is. But when do you think -- if the country were open up by the end of June, when do you think things start to normalize? Is there -- does it take a quarter, two quarters, three quarters to get you back to where the growth level you were at before? -- And you mean, Gary, in terms of our unit sales or revenue, what... -- Yeah. Just in general. Yes, exactly. And what I'm trying to get at is, from the time the country starts opening up and you assume that every people are going to be driving, you're going to have the same level of accident, same level of total losses, how long does that take to flush through to your system where you start there is no real impact from the COVID situation in any given quarter? -- The reason I paused Gary, any given quarter, we sell cars that we were assigned that same quarter. So in the third quarter of 2020, we sold cars that we picked up in February, March and April. We also sell cars from the last -- a quarter before and the quarter before and the quarter before and five years before, literally, that layer cake that I described a few moments ago. So in terms, no quarter -- every quarter has some memory going forward. But I think it's several quarters really before you got the meaningful burden because it takes on average several months for us to sell a car. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thanks, Gary.Our next question in queue comes from Ali Faghri with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple here. I guess, first, can you remind us about your cost structure fixed versus variable and how we should think about detrimental margins in a backdrop like the near term where volumes are declining meaningfully? It sounds like you aren't proactively taking cost out of the business, specifically in response to COVID, but I may be wrong. -- Yeah. A handful of questions what you described there to. In terms of the fixed and variable mix, that question always boils down to what you're time horizon is, and over the long haul all costs are variable. In the near term, the majority of cost are semi-fixed with the exception, for example, of towing costs. Towing costs tend to -- we incur them when we tow a vehicle and when we don't, when we don't. So, I think in the near term, and as you heard us describe a few minutes ago, if we conclude that this is a structural shift, then we would consider meaningful changes, but otherwise we will operate the business as it is with the intent to serve our customers well through storm season and for the next three, five, 10 years as well. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then as a quick follow up here. You mentioned ASPs are above pre-COVID levels. Is that due to a supply/demand mismatch currently as buyers are returning to the market, but the supply of vehicles is still relatively limited, so perhaps it's more of a temporary trend? -- It could be. I think if that remains to be seen, I think there is -- that's what forces you just described a moment ago. Also if the economies recover, if folks had themselves chosen to sit it out a week or two, they certainly find themselves short inventory or parts or cars rebuild or what have you, right? So there may be something of a catch-up effect so to speak. But I think the long, long-term trends before this quarter, our ASPs had been up 13 consecutive quarters, and they won't go up every quarter for the rest of our lives, of course, with that general tailwind of auction liquidity, higher total loss frequency, better younger cars, less damaged cars, those forces aren't going away anytime soon. Now, what that means over a two-week, four-week, even a three-quarter horizon, we don't concern ourselves with too much. What we focus on, of course, is how to drive those returns up on a multi-year basis. -- Great, thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our next question in queue comes from Stephanie Benjamin, Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. -- Hi. I just had one quick follow-up. I was hoping maybe you could speak to if you felt really broadly speaking, if your insurance customers have look to diversify their auction providers or restructuring some of their relationships or how they interact with their auction providers. Just any high-level comments would be helpful just looking back the last year or several years? Thank you. -- No, I appreciate the question, Stephanie. And, again, tough to generalize about our customers who are -- had many different ways of approaching the business. But in general, we focus all of our efforts on serving them well and generating the best possible auction returns and providing the best possible service in ordinary times and in crazy times like the ones we're in today. So over time, I think we have generally continued to earn and win the trust of our customers, and have gained market share as a result. So, I wouldn't say that I've heard that theme in general.I think the question is, can we serve our customers well and can we persuade our prospective customers that we can serve them well, how the chess match works between sole sourcing multiple providers and so forth. I haven't heard any particular trends in one direction or the other. So long as we deliver Copart-level service and Copart-level auction returns to our customers, we'll let the chips fall where they may, and I think history has proven that, that has been a productive approach. -- Thanks. I appreciate it. -- Thanks, Stephanie.Our next question in queue comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. I know you have historically provided investors with the split of insurance versus non-insurance cars. Are you also able to break out the percentage of salvage versus non-salvage or haul cars? I think the haul car split is materially lower than the non-insurance split, but I'm just wondering if given the decline in miles driven in accidents, if there is any ability to absorb yard capacity by taking on more haul cars whether sold by dealers or other sources? -- I think the second question is probably easier than the first. To your -- the second question, in part because we have invested so aggressively in capacity, we by and large can serve customers and can serve our dealer customers and our insurance customers wherever they want to do business with us. I think Jay talked about that at some length on our last earnings call as well. We have invested and we continue to invest so that we can always say yes when those opportunities present themselves.So, no, it's not that -- it's not the reduced driving activity and declines in insurance assignments would per se enable us to win more dealer business, it is that we drive excellent returns and service to them that allow us to do so in the land. The land is our problem. We'll figure that out in the background, so that we can serve them flawlessly.Speakers, there are no more questions in queue at this time. -- All right. Appreciate everyone coming on the call and we look forward to reporting on Q4 in the fiscal year 2020. And wish everybody stay safe, and we'll talk to you then. Thank you.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

So far, the worst of the outbreak is in China, but large-scale viral cases are on the rise in Italy, Iran, and South Korea. Medical restrictions and quarantines are disrupting global trade and travel patterns, with shutdowns in Chinese factories impacting global supply chains in everything from electronics to the containerized shipping industry. The S&P 500 is down 12.8% from its peak on February 19, completely erasing earlier gains and putting the index at an 8.6% loss for the year to date.But as per usual in the stock markets, risky times also present opportunity for daring investors \u2013 and while the market as an aggregate is falling, any one stock\u2019s individual performance may be very different. In short, a savvy investor can find stocks with serious growth potential, even in today\u2019s market conditions.We\u2019ve used TipRanks\u2019  tool to pull up some stocks with serious growth prospects. Setting the filters to show us only mid- to large-cap stocks, with upwards of 20% upside potential, 6,100 stocks were reduced to a far more manageable 293. Let\u2019s dive in and examine three of them in detail. We\u2019ll start with Copart, the online automotive auction site. The Texas-based company boasts a global reach, with services in the US and Canada, UK and Ireland, Germany, Spain, and the UAE. The company offers services to sellers looking to unload used and salvaged vehicles, primarily in the dismantling, parts, and export markets. A limited number of vehicles are sold as used cars for the general public, but most of Copart\u2019s customers are insurance companies.No matter what the stock market does, there will always be a market for used auto parts. That basic fact is reflected in Copart\u2019s success. In the company\u2019s most recent fiscal quarter, Q2 2020, reported last month, CPRT beat the forecasts and the year-over-year numbers, but the margins were narrow. Revenues came in at $575.1 million, up 18.6% year-over-year but only half a percent over estimates. EPS landed at 65 cents, right on the forecast.The earnings result for Q2 was the sixth in a row that the company met or surpassed the expectation, but shares slipped on an ominous sign: EPS growth was flat from Q1 to Q2. CPRT is down 19% since the quarterly report. It\u2019s important to note here, however, that the quarterly earnings came out on February 19, the same day that markets started sliding on coronavirus fears.The combination of a general market slump and apparently slowing sales put a damper on the stock\u2019s recent gains, but an important \u2013 and overlooked \u2013 point in today\u2019s automotive market bodes well for CPRT. In the past 40 years, the rate at which cars are declared a \u2018total loss\u2019 after an accident has increased from 4% to 20%. At the same time, the number of cars on the road has increased dramatically. This puts a much larger population of sellable vehicles in Copart\u2019s universe.At least one analyst sees CPRT\u2019s current state as a good point of entry to the stock for investors. , of Baird, writes, \u201cCopart's earnings and revenues fell short of expectations and the modest slowdown was sufficient to break the momentum in the shares. We remain bullish on the shares as the fundamentals remain.\u201dAlong with his Buy rating, Kennison increased his price target on the stock by 4%, to $100. His new target suggests an upside potential of 18%. (To watch Kennison\u2019s track record, )Overall, CPRT\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold, all set in the last two weeks. Shares are selling for $84.47, and the $106.33 average target price implies an upside growth potential of 26%. ()  Next on our list is Alnylam, a biotech research company focused on RNAi commercialization for the treatment of genetic diseases. Biotechs are famously volatile, and companies are notorious for running steep losses until striking gold with a new drug approval. Alnylam falls squarely into that pattern, with the EPS loss at $2.47 in Q4 2019.Revenues, however, were up, coming in at $71.7 million. This beat the forecast by just under 1%. ALNY shares are up 46% in the past six months. The company has two drugs on the market, Onpattro and Givlaari, approved in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and reports growing sales revenues on both. Alnylam reported $55.8 million in Onpattro revenue for Q4 (up 21% from Q3), along with solid initial interest in Gilvaari. With another eight drugs in various stages of pipeline development, Alnylam has a firm foundation for future prospects.Chardan Capital analyst  is impressed by the growth potential here. He writes, \u201cWe believe that Alnylam is the clear leader in the RNAi space, as its scale, experience, patents, breadth of pipeline, and access to capital place it in an advantageous position relative to its competitors developing small RNA therapeutics. The Company's RNAi platform has been validated by the approval of two products (Onpattro and Givlarri), multiple positive phase III study results, including six last year\u2026\u201dNakae puts a $190 price target behind his Buy rating, indicating confidence in a robust growth potential of 61% for the coming year. (To watch Nakae\u2019s track record, )Alnylam has no fewer than 10 Buy ratings, outweighing the 1 Hold and 1 Sell as well as giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $143.08 suggests a premium of 22% from the current share price of $117.55. ()  Anaplan is another company that had the bad fortune of reporting solid Q4 numbers just as the market hit a correction. The San Francisco-based company inhabits the cloud software ecosystem, offering customers event planning applications for business use. With the company\u2019s platform, users can build and maintain strategic and operational business performance management systems.Like many high-tech companies, PLAN has been operating at a net loss, but the Q4 numbers showed the loss is narrowing. In non-GAAP reporting, PLAN posted a loss of 7 cents per share, comparing favorably to the 13-cent loss one year earlier. At the same time, total revenue rose by 42% to reach $98.2 million \u2013 that number included a 50% year-over-year increase in subscription revenue to $89.5 million.Writing from RBC Capital, 5-star analyst  says of this company, \u201cWe believe Anaplan is at the tip of the spear for digital transformation of financial and operational planning systems, a $21 billion-plus market with high barriers to entry and no pure-play competitors... With the company steadily building a broader strategic value proposition as a \u2018System of Insights\u2019 that can pull operational data from various systems of record we see the opportunity for the company to successfully scale to billions in revenue\u2026\u201dZukin backs his Buy rating on the stock with a $75 price target, implying room for an impressive 67% upside growth this year. (To watch Zukin\u2019s track record, )Zukin\u2019s optimism is slightly higher than the consensus view of this stock. PLAN shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 4 Buys and 1 Hold set in recent weeks. The stock is selling for $44.88, and the average price target, $66.20, suggests a robust 48% upside potential.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new November 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $52.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $70.86/share today.\n\nBecause the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 15% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 76%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 12.00% return on the cash commitment, or 18.40% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.20.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CPRT stock at the current price level of $70.86/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $75.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 20.24% if the stock gets called away at the November 20th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CPRT shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CPRT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $75.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.39% boost of extra return to the investor, or 22.07% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 72%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 60%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $70.86) to be 38%.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 . Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and it's a pleasure to welcome you all to the second quarter call. I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Liaw, our President, for safe Harbor, and then we'll give you I'll give you a quick update on the company, and he will give you an update on financial performance.So with that, Jeff? -- Thanks, Jay. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, disposal of nonoperating assets, foreign currency-related gains, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in assessing our business trends and performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC.Jay? -- Thank you, Jeff. For starters, I'd like to state that we have never been better prepared for the future. When we think about capacity, we think about it globally. And whether it's in Europe or the U.S., we have more capacity today than we have ever had. This is an effort that has been ongoing for the last five years to build out a network of locations that are closer to the car and then have more room, so that we can continue to handle vehicles that come in due to continued total loss rates, again, due to technology in cars and due to market share gains that we have seen over the last five years. We expect that both those trends will continue and I'm happy to say we have the capacity to handle that. When it comes to catastrophes, whether they be small catastrophes or super storm events, there is no match for the way that Copart handles a CAT. Our preparedness has never been better through equipment that we utilize in the field, through locations where we have large facilities that can store 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 vehicles in a super storm event, through the process we've developed over the last five years and through the technology that we deploy, it is not an understatement to say that our position in the industry is unmatched when it comes to those events. Our people are also the best in the industry.Whether it be through our tenure as the company has achieved so many years of success now, whether it be the training or the talent, their ability is unmatched, and I put a huge, huge amount of credit on our success over the last five years in wins due to the people that run this company. Our technology continues to lead the industry. We've been a leader in the technology space now for 20 years, moving completely online back in 2003, 17 years ago. And I would put our technology teams up against any of the tech titans in Silicon Valley. What we have developed over the years and what we are developing currently and that will be rolling out in the years to come, we'll continue to keep the gap between us and our competitors and offer a service offering to our customers that is unmatched. Copart is a technology company, but we're also a land-holding company with over 10,000 acres, over 200 facilities, and we're also a logistics company. We're picking up over 250,000 vehicles a month, and we do that from assignment to pick up in less than a day. Through our people, our process and our technology, we'll continue to win. With that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to our President, Jeff Liaw for an update on the financials and the performance of the company.Jeff? -- Thank you, Jay. As Jay noted, we are pleased with our results for the second quarter. It's a record second quarter for Copart in revenue, gross profit and operating income. We experienced global revenue growth of 18.6% or $90 million change over last year. Our U.S. revenue grew at 23.8%. The international revenue nominally declines 2.6% year-over-year, but that's primarily due to converting a substantial U.K. customer from a purchase-based sales contract to a fee-based arrangement instead. Our global service revenue grew $93.2 million or 22.4% year-over-year, which along with units sold is a more accurate measure of the underlying activity in our business. As we've noted on our prior calls, vehicle sales and costs are disproportionately visible in comparison to their economic relevance to our business. Our purchased vehicles declined $3 million year-over-year for the second quarter or 4.4%, due primarily again to the shift of the U.K. customer from a purchase arrangement to a fee-based consignment engagement. Our global unit sales grew by 13.7% year-over-year with U.S. units growing 15.3% and international units growing 5.7%. Our U.S. unit growth was driven by organic growth from our existing insurance customers and non-insurance customers as well as market share gains. The long-term trends, we've noted in prior discussions, in favor of rising total loss frequency are continuing, driving organic growth from insurance customers as these strong salvage returns we generate at auctions continue to become more and more economically attractive compared to rising repair costs.We continue to grow our non-insurance business as well, nominally on a unit basis 5.8% year-over-year, which reflects growth in certain seller groups such as automotive dealers offset by proactive capacity management efforts on our part with charities and wholesalers. Excluding those charities and wholesalers, our noninsurance business grew on a unit basis 20.6% year-over-year. We attribute this growth to our increased marketing and sales efforts, but perhaps most notably to the auction liquidity we achieved at Copart. We have brought a large pool of buyers and sellers together. And the auction liquidity we deliver to our sellers, we would argue is the very best in the industry. Our global inventory increased 7.5% year-over-year, U.S. inventory grew at that same 7.5%, international inventory growth just north of that at 7.8%. This inventory growth is again driven by the same unit growth trends noted above both industry growth as well as customer wins. Our gross profit grew from $208 million $208.2 million to $259.9 million or 24.8% increase year-over-year. We experienced a gross margin rate change from $42.9 million to $45.2 million with gross margins expanding by 230 basis points. A portion of this is attributable, of course, to that same shift of the customer from a principle-based arrangement to a fee-based arrangement. In addition to that, we achieved efficiencies across the globe in the form of operational leverage, which helped to further expand gross margins.In the U.S., and globally, we would again, as always, note rising labor, health insurance, fuel costs, selling costs, etc.; offset also by generally benign trends in ASPs as well as operating leverage. On those average selling prices, in particular, in the U.S., our ASPs grew at 0.7% year-over-year. Our ASPs continue their growth that reflects, I believe, now 13 consecutive quarters of ASP growth in the U.S. That ASP lift is a product of more bidders, more international bidders and, therefore, more auction liquidity. This is a year-over-year comparison as well as an increasing mix of newer, less damaged cars. That trend we talk about on our call now for years, and it continues to prove true. International bidding and buying activity, again, a reflection of our proactive marketing efforts as well as the effectiveness of our all-digital auction platform PV3. The outcome is that we generate more auction activity, more bids per unit and, therefore, better selling prices for our customers. Just shy of 50% of the value of our U.S. auctions are attributed or won by international buyers and the vast majority of our units have their prices affected and lifted by the participation of those same international buyers. Turning to general and administrative expenditures. I'll speak about them, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation.They are up from $33.2 million a year ago to $39.2 million this quarter. It's also up slightly sequentially by about $400,000 relative to the first quarter. In general, G&A expenditures will fluctuate and grow over time as with other numbers on our P&L and our cash flow statement. We generally encourage folks to take a multiple quarter view in projecting the business. We continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage given the top line growth rates we have experienced in recent years. We do believe they're like as with yard costs, there are certain inflationary pressures here regarding labor rates, healthcare costs and the like, but we believe we can achieve operating leverage, nonetheless. Our GAAP operating income grew from $164.7 million to $209.9 million, or an increase of 27.4%, reflecting 250 basis points of operating margin expansion. Our net interest expense was roughly flat year-over-year at approximately $4.5 million. Other expense/income of $400,000, in this case, largely attributable to currency gains offset by losses from certain nonconsolidated equity positions of ours. Our second quarter income tax of $36.4 million reflects a $14.8 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options, which has been reflected as such in the non-GAAP earnings included in our release from yesterday. GAAP net income increased from $131.4 million to $168.7 million for the second quarter this year, or an increase of 28.4%, year-over-year. And finally, on the P&L, our non-GAAP net income increased from $124.9 million to $153.5 million, a growth of 22.9% year-over-year.Turning then to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We finished the quarter with $93.5 million of cash on the balance sheet and $320 million and change of net debt. We adopted a new lease standard, as you likely know already this year, last quarter and the first quarter of 2020. And we now show $104 million as an operating lease right-of-use assets with a corresponding $105 million liability on the balance sheet as well. On the cash flow statement, we generated operating cash flow of $144.5 million for the quarter, an increase of $37 million, driven principally by higher earnings year-over-year. Our capital expenditures of $269 million in the quarter, the strong majority of these capital expenditures were for capacity expansion per our practices in the per our practice in recent years. I'll note here that we continue to invest aggressively in capacity expansion to serve both industry growth as well as our market share wins, as we've discussed at great length in the past. Permitting is a complex and collaborative dialogue with communities in which we do business, so the timing of the completion of certain purchases is always subject to lumpiness in our cash flow statement. We will invest millions; and in some cases, tens of millions of dollars at a time for single asset single site completions. We're delighted for ourselves and our customers that we're able to achieve and to execute this past quarter's worth of capital projects. That said, even in this capacity growth period of Copart's history, the quarter obviously is an outsized capex quarter for us.We would look at the last few years as more indicative of our general run rate in a growth period. With that, I'll make a few final comments on our efforts in Germany, and then we can open it up for Q&A. Regarding our efforts in Germany, our strategy and approach continue unabated. We are investing very substantially in people and technology and in land. We continue to source cars as a principle to build liquidity and we're getting progressively better at it. However, the real long-term objective remains unchanged as well, which is to earn consignment volumes, to serve the insurance industry there, both for the carrier's direct economic benefits and lower claims costs as well as their benefits in improved policyholder experiences in the cases of total loss. We have active dialogues with decision-makers at major carriers and have sold cars on a consignment basis for the insurance industry in Germany. We look forward to discussing that further with you on future calls as well.With that, Samantha, I'll ask you to open it up for Q&A.[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. -- Morning. I just wanted to start, on the last call, you alluded to helping some carriers optimize their claims process. Can you talk more about that, how it's going? Have there been any initial results or is that a long-term game plan? Is that a 2020, 2021? How should we think about that? -- Bob, I'd characterize that as a 40-year journey. That's something we do literally every day. We may have spoken about it in somewhat greater detail on the last earnings calls, but we view it as our principal job is to improve the claims process and economic outcomes for our insurance customers and their returns. So there are certainly individual products that we have in the queue, products we have released, products we are already selling, but I wouldn't view that as a discrete change per se in what we do, Bob. Just an ongoing purposeful commitment to that very outcome. -- Got it. Okay. And then you just spoke about, obviously, the highest, I guess, capex quarter you've had? And is this was all the land in the U.S.? Is this international as well? Are you still looking to keep a similar pace for the last two years going forward? Can you just give us a little more color on that. -- Yes, the vast majority of the capital expenditures would be in the U.S. with some internationally, but the vast majority in the U.S. So I called it out because it is, obviously, a much higher rate that we have incurred in recent years. We have announced our 20/20/20 initiative in April of 2016, if memory serves, so approximately four years ago, we began this aggressive capacity expansion phase in our history. I would look to the past few years as more indicative of the run rate of our expenditures in this capacity growth phase more so than this past quarter. It is the nature of the beast, Bob, as you know, you have involved with the industry for a long time, that capex by its nature is lumpy. Because you close on a property that could have been literally tens of millions of dollars and then or it is delayed by six months, and so the tens of millions of dollars of expenditures await you in a few quarters' time. So we don't endeavor to smooth it. We are we simply want to acquire and develop the land, so we have it available for our customers and ourselves as soon as we can. And sometimes, it happens all at once. -- Got it. Okay, great. And it sounds, I guess, it's crazy to ask this given the, I think, 14% volume growth in the quarter and this and for several years, the double-digit volume growth, but are you currently constrained on growing faster based on your capacity? Have you reached a kind of equilibrium now that you're just acquiring new capacity for future growth? How can you talk about where you stand, if there have been constraints before? If you've reached what you need to get for current levels? -- Yes, it's a fair question. I think we as Jay noted at the top, we've invested in the land, so that we could serve our customers exceptionally well across all markets, if and when they're ready to do business with us. So that's our commitment to them, which is also, as you may have heard during the discussion there, within certain noninsurance sellers of ours, we've made proactive decisions to free capacity in that respect for these critical insurance customers in particular. So we I wouldn't say it's been a gating factor, Bob, but it has required us to make an all hands on deck efforts to acquire and develop that land. -- Okay, super, thank you so much.Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Kennison with Baird. -- Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about industry trends. What you're seeing in terms of claims activity and the total loss rate and how you see that unfolding in 2020? -- Yes. I'll take a bigger step back, Craig, and make a broader observation. I think we are seeing claims activity that's relatively flat year-over-year in terms of the nominal claim. So these are the same data points, I'm sure, that you track already regarding certain carriers who disclose publicly their claims results as well as certain industry aggregators who do the same. Over most of our 40-year history, I think we've seen claims frequency generally decline very modestly over time as cars get safer and perhaps drivers get better. Though one anomalous period for that trend, of course, was 2011 to 2016 when smartphone penetration, smartphone distraction was perhaps at its peak. But otherwise, for most of our 40-year history, accident frequency has generally declined over time. However, the one-way tailwind in our business, as you know, has been total loss frequency, which has increased very steadily over time. I think individual months and quarters are tough to measure. I think there's always going to be a lot of noise in that number. But I think if you take any kind of step back at all, you would see that trends continues to move up.And for reasons I think that become reasonably clear once you dig the half step below the surface, which is that the cars are becoming our cars are becoming more sophisticated over time, more technologically involved and, therefore, all of the sensors and cameras that are fitted in the car are making it more difficult to repair. So repair costs are rising, which makes repairs less compelling. While at the same time, our auction liquidity is improving. Our international buyer base is expanding. So quite literally, at the same time, repairs are worse, salvage is literally better, which is what has driven the total loss frequency increase to sixfold fivefold to sixfold over the past 40 years and why we think it will continue to rise over the years to come. I expect that in 2020. I know that's a bit of a long-winded answer, but I expect that this year and but frankly, for years and decades to come. -- And then looking at your European business and the European car park, are there substantial differences in the constitution of that car park, such that we'd see a different trend in total loss rate or claims frequency? -- In broader strokes, no. There certainly are local and country-specific idiosyncrasies that can affect exactly how we enter, how we participate. But in broad strokes, no. The cars are similar. The underlying drivers that make the total loss such a compelling economic proposition here in the U.S. and in the U.K. are by and large true there too, which is to say, high labor repair high labor cost, repair costs, vehicle complexity. And frankly, again, emerging and growing international demand for those same wrecked cars. -- And lastly, how would you frame the conversations you're having today with European insurance carriers versus those conversations maybe a year or two ago, now that you've got sort of assets on the ground and an active platform working in Europe? -- Fair question, Craig. I'd characterize this much more productive. It's one thing to discuss analogues to the U.K. and the U.S. in why the economic proposition can or should be compelling, it's another matter to have yards open, people engage, trucks towing cars as well as, by the way, actual sales results at auction, which demonstrate the superior economic outcome. So literally buying cars on the platform they're using and trading them at a profit on the ground in Germany to buyers outside Germany, in many cases, is the most compelling argument of all. Like, which is not, \"Hey, Germany can be like the U.S.\" It's that Germany on February 19, 2020, February 20, is delivering auction results of XYZ. So the conversations have advanced in part for that reason. -- Great, thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from John Healy with North Coast Research. -- Thank you. I wanted to ask you guys about the comments you made about technology. Clearly, you guys have led the industry for a long time on that front. And when I think about kind of the last few years, I feel like you guys have made some nice upgrades to the buying and selling applications. So I was hoping to understand from a technology standpoint, where you guys are pushing the envelope? And one area that kind of I've always thought about and we talked about that potentially could create service benefits would be if titling with the states could become a little bit more seamless and maybe you guys could develop applications there. So just trying to understand on the back-end side of things. If what technology can bring to the industry. And that said, if you bring technology into the industry, potentially cars move quicker, does that erode some of the economics that you guys have been able to benefit from associated with the storage and the cradling of the vehicle for the extended period of time? -- Thanks, John. My answer to you probably will be similar to what I said to Bob, which is that, that is a nonstop investment for us when it comes to technology to improve outcomes, in particular, for our sellers. And for them, outcomes means in the ordinary course, shortening cycle times, allowing them to close claims more quickly, selling the cars, we're titling them we're treating original titles and processing the salvage titles to the states more quickly and, therefore, auctioning them more quickly to a global liquid platform. That there are literally dozens of steps in that process, each of which has its own process and technology to-do list for us internally. So the answer to your question broadly is yes. The technology is by far, our single biggest corporate investment here, besides our land. If you were literally to walk through Copart headquarters and meet with group by group, you'll find the technology group is overwhelmingly the largest in numbers and resource expenditures. So it's it has been a huge part of what we do. We talk about it, frankly, more with our sellers than we do on calls like this, but it is our single biggest corporate investment. -- Got you. And I would have missed it. I probably did. Did you guys mention what inventories were at the end of the quarter in the U.S.? -- Inventory is up 7.5% year-over-year. -- Great, thank you so much. -- Thanks, john.Thank you. Our next question will come from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. -- Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks.for taking our questions. Jay, a quick clarifier on your opening comments. Talking about capacity growth and incremental market share, are you seeing incremental market share out there today? Are there any large contracts coming up for RFP in the next year? Or was that just a comment on kind of overall strategy and recent trends? -- Well, we never get into specific clients or talking about whether they're up for tender or up for RFP. But we have succeeded, historically, at having market share wins, and the point I was making was twofold: one, that we have the capacity to do that going forward; and the second was that I anticipate that trend will continue. I think the other thing I was going to add on the previous question, there was a comment about whether or not, if we sell vehicles quicker, if that would be detrimental from a storage standpoint? And for the most part, we benefit when vehicles are sold quicker. Our goal just so that all the investors understand, our goal is to move those vehicles as quickly as possible for the customer so that the vehicle generates a higher return. And storage or storing of the vehicle is an insignificant part of the business, so I wanted to just add some clarity on that. -- That's helpful. And then, Jeff, maybe a follow-up. You continue to call out a benefit from this mix shift within noninsurance toward dealer and all fleets away from municipality and charity, how far along in that mix shift are we? Should that continue or have we largely phased out a lot of the legacy municipality charity to where that should be more steady state, kind of going forward? What's the right mix longer-term strategically? -- Complicated question. We, of course, value our customers across all of these categories. We just also do face somewhat some resource constraints from time to time and had to make decisions accordingly. I would think of that shift as largely complete. We don't that's the level of detail we wouldn't get into what happened in which quarter and what how deep into the quarter to perfectly model a year-over-year. But I would think that I think of that as largely complete. -- That's helpful. And then just one last one for me. Historically, if we look at warm winters, 2012, 2017, there does tend to be some negative impact on volume growth in the coming quarters just due to less accident frequency. Are you guys thinking that this winter should have any kind of impact on your results today in the back half of the year? Or industry dynamic is strong enough to where we shouldn't really see that show up in the business? -- Yes, it's a very fair question. We tend with the exception of, of course, extreme weather events, we tend not to talk about weather because it sometimes feels like it's both difficult to quantify and becomes an explanation of that can be become an excuse for factors in the business. I do agree with you that it was, by all measures, a benign winter, higher temperatures, lower precipitation at least across the United States. And that, yes, therefore, that generally means fewer claims at the top of the funnel. Quantifying that precisely, I don't know. Our inventory was up 7.5% year-over-year, nonetheless, so whether that was depressed by temperature's precipitation is a judgment probably better left to others than to me personally. -- Thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question will come from Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. -- Hi, good afternoon. Jeff, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on the, call it, the pricing, revenue per unit side of the equation. I think you called that another quarter of ASP growth. But on a year-over-year basis, maybe it's a little bit slower from some historical trends. I think some are kind of calling for some declines in used-vehicle pricing this year? I don't know if that's going to materialize or not, but maybe if you could speak to that side of the equation on the pricing and revenue per unit side and what you're seeing in the market? -- Thanks, Stephanie. I think in that, I think you're asking really about two different economic phenomenons, one of which is the selling prices for our cars at auction. That itself is a function of both cyclical and secular forces, some of which you mentioned. The cyclical X variables that can affect the selling prices of cars at our auctions, of course, include used car prices, as you noted, currency fluctuations and the like, among other things. The secular forces, we think, are that total loss frequency rises. And at total loss frequency rises, we get more marginal totals, more drivable cars, that would drive ASPs up. So the combination of the two over the very long haul, we think, will drive ASPs up in any individual quarter or year, month, week, day, etc. The projections become perhaps too fine to parse all of those variables. But generally speaking, we believe the secular tailwinds are ultimately net driven. The second part of your question on revenue per unit. That's not something per se that we expressly disclose. We, of course, drive revenue, we drive unit volume as much as we can. Revenue grows also with the addition of services we provide to both sellers and buyers. -- Great. And then I just had a clarification. I know it was asked twice. I apologize for hearing it. But on Germany, did you say that you were testing some consignment models or testing that consignment model with some carriers in Germany? Or did I mishear that twice. So just a clarification. -- You heard correctly. We have sold cars on a consignment basis for insurance carriers in Germany. That said, we also continue to purchase cars. So our principal activity is continuing as well as we build the physical infrastructure, people base and technology and talent to serve that industry long term. -- Great, thank you so much. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. -- Good morning guys. When you think about the inventory growth in the quarter, and you had some pretty big share gains last year, is there any way to look at what was the contribution from new customers versus what was core legacy inventory growth? -- I would characterize, but I think that's a level of detail we probably wouldn't get into. But I would the way I characterize it is that there was both underlying market growth as well as market share gains in that year-over-year number. -- Okay, great. And I guess, this we don't talk about the scrap pricing anymore. But do you see any impact, I guess, from the Chinese market demand relative to what's going on with coronavirus? Is there any pending volatility on scrap price there? -- I'll answer that in two parts. Scrap price maybe effect on Copart, I would say, largely de minimis. So the Chinese buyers in part for regulatory reasons, but are a very tiny portion of our overall sales below 2% when I last checked. So they're not a significant buyer of Copart cars. And that said, Coronavirus, obviously, will not necessarily observe specific national borders. So if it spreads, there could be an effect downstream. But to date, no. -- Okay. And then just one question on Germany. What's the total acreage there? I guess, when you think about the yard size in Germany, I think of it being somewhat smaller than a U.S. Yard, so I guess, is it better to think about it in acres versus locations? -- Probably so, though not something we would discuss yet. We are investing in acreage. I think your intuition generally is correct. In that our yards would be smaller today, in part, because we needed to get going. The lead time here in the U.S. and for that matter in Germany to develop a 50-acre parcel for vehicle storage is long, and we weren't willing to wait to do that. So we have gotten achieved operations in a number of facilities there more quickly by starting with smaller facilities, and in some cases, leasing them. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. -- Good. Hey, Could you tell me, just as a percentage of the vehicles you're selling, insurance versus noninsurance, how has that mix changed? I mean, what is the current percentage now versus where it was maybe last year? -- The current percentage is approximately 21%. And I think a year ago, it was a little bit north of that. There is some seasonality to it I suppose not year-over-year, there's no seasonality. So a year ago, it was 22%, I believe, and now it's 21%, and that's partially a function of the shift within noninsurance that we just talked about a moment ago. -- Right. So and one can assume that most of the growth there is dealer cars, correct? And if there is, the growth is of dealer cars. -- That is a meaningful source of the growth in our noninsurance business. Yes. -- Do you have the capability, and I probably should know this, but I'm asking the question. With the dealer cars, do you have the capability to sell it at the lot their lot? Or do you have to take it to one of your facilities to sell it? -- So there are I'd say, probably the safest way to the best way to characterize it is that we are exploring multiple ways to service those automotive dealers, I think, clearly, from their perspective today, our principal value proposition is the buyer base that we offer in comparison to other offerings in the marketplace. For example, we have a global buyer base, we already have the folks looking from all over the world. And that is the value we offer. And how we deliver that and whether, physically, we require a facility or not? Those are all variables that are relatively simpler to manage, quite candidly, Gary. But I think the value proposition side, I think, is clear. And how we deliver it, we are experimenting with a number of different avenues. -- Okay, thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Derek Glynn with Consumer Edge Research. -- Yeah, thank you for taking the question. Actually I had a follow-up on the noninsurance business and, specifically, your relationship with the independent dealers. I'm curious how the vehicles sourced from them or that are purchased by them at your auctions differ from their own core inventory offering at retail? Are there any key differences in terms of age or quality? I'm just trying to get a better sense for how they're leveraging your platform? -- I think the trends would be hard to draw as they're very broad sweeping ones. But I'd say, in general, of course, if a dealer tends to specialize in brand X and receives a trade-in in brand Y that would be a natural car to process through a Copart or consign through a Copart auction. But I think the financiers are all over the map. And automotive dealers sometimes simply want to achieve near term liquidity and consign a number of cars through us, so you'll see a wide-ranging mix. Sometimes damaged cars are often intact cars that are perfectly drivable, sometimes older cars on their facilities, sometimes newer ones as well. So tough to provide rules of thumb. -- Great, thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our next question has come from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolf Research. -- Hey, guys, thanks for the question. Question for you on the European rollout. So it sounds like you've you're proving out the capabilities and the data to the insurers, right, like with actual data and actual service. So besides for like the red tape of highly regulated industry, like what are the other friction points that are preventing insurers from acting more quickly, given what's presumably compelling data? And then two, like once they've made that decision, like how long does it take for them to like change the disposition model and onboard? And like what's kind of like the timeline of conversion once they've decided this model is like a better model? -- I think the single biggest barrier, Chris, is simply inertia, which is that, it's an insurance industry that is accustomed to a set of historical practices literally for decades from their interactions with their policyholders all the way back through claims. So the practice habits are difficult to break. I do we do believe that when carriers shift meaningful volume in this direction and improve the policyholder experience, that there certainly should be some momentum that ultimately causes it to accelerate from there. But speculating as to exactly what that conversion time frame is, it's tough to do. But the barrier, I think, is more habits than anything else. -- That's helpful. And then can you help us think through kind of the capex the implications of capex on kind of yard op cost? Like, I mean, the capex has been super robust lately, but like how does that translate near term? Is there a certain tier, which used to lag? Or how do we like basically translate the capex to yard op cost in the coming quarters or years for that matter? -- Maybe if you had access to literally every data point inside our company that would be too noisy, a correlation to try to draw to capex. I'll just give you some directional indications. capex, when we open a new facility is net helpful because we certainly, the new site is closer to some of the seem to be accident or the repair shops, where the cars are being retreated from, so we would achieve immediate savings in terms of the retrieval of the vehicles. We may achieve savings because there are yards that are very congested nearby and, therefore, are incurring extra labor costs and the likes to manage the vehicles inside the facility. However, of course, opening new facilities incurs some level of \"fixed costs,\" including utilities and telecom, management, labor and the like. So there are puts and takes. I would say across the system, the capex, we are opening enough new facilities, expanding enough current facilities and have done so very steadily that the effect in any given quarter won't be that pronounced. That's one reason you don't hear us discuss. We don't explain gross margin variations or cost variations because the facilities newly opened is now a big enough set of facilities that the opening of any given set in a quarter does not affect the financials visibly anyway from where you sit. -- That's very helpful. Thank you for the time.Thank you. Our next question will come from Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. -- Thanks for taking the follow up. Jeff., a quick follow-up on the European market commentary. While the car park is similar, I believe alternative park usage is lower, particularly, in collision repair in Europe. So I guess the question is, is there an existing collision salvage marketplace in Europe to support traditional salvage volume? Or were the units you sell over in Germany or what you're selling in Germany more the run-and-drive vehicles today? -- So the your industry observation, I think, is fair, which is that alternative park utilization in Europe is considerably lower here than here in the U.S. That said, there are clearly cars that economically should not be repaired. And so even within Europe today, they will find a home, one way or the other, with their cars that are 110% damage, which you could not possibly justify the repair costs to restore it back to. The economic value proposition for the carriers is that we can help them achieve full and fair value for those salvaged vehicles. Whether it will ultimately fuel dismantling or simply be scrapped altogether or be rebuilt and redriven again somewhere else, we simply help the carriers to achieve that full fair liquid market value instantaneously as opposed to today's traditional path of disposition, which don't do best. But I think your industry observation is fair, but nonetheless, there still there still are many cars that are totaled in Europe to date. -- Make total sense. Thanks so much.At this time, I am not showing any further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to the speakers for closing remarks. -- Okay. Thank you, Samantha. Thank you, everyone, for attending the call. We look forward to reporting Q3 in the next quarter. Thanks so much.

Comps across all of its U.S. restaurants actually dipped 0.2% for the third quarter, as overall results were held back by a 2.2% decline at Bonefish Grill.\u00a0There are still a couple of reasons for optimism. For starters, Bloomin' Brands' bottom line is growing faster than its revenue gains. Adjusted earnings climbed 25%, overcoming the flattish top-line results. The restaurant operator is finally joining many of its peers in the delivery market, leaning on third-party providers. Bloomin' Brands launched on DoorDash this fall, kicking things off in late September with a novel 50,000 steak giveaway.

We now have our speakers in conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to President and CFO, Jeff Liaw. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, Dan, and welcome to Copart's Fiscal 2020 First Quarter . I'll ask Darren Hart, our VP of Finance, to start with the Safe Harbor. -- Thanks, Jeff. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted common share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, foreign currency related gains, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises, and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09.We've provided a recollection of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with the corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance.We analyze our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments.We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions of our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. -- Thanks, Darren. We are certainly pleased with our results for the quarter. Darren, in a moment, will walk through details of those results with the metrics that we traditionally disclose. Wanted to pause for a few minutes also to talk about some of the bigger themes in our business, as those themes, I think, will help explain and drive the results of the past quarter and the past year, and frankly shed light also on our strategic approach to the business.First, we want to talk about the evolution of the total loss universe. I think historically, we've been good and the industry has been good about talking about repair costs. And while rising repair costs due to vehicle complexity and age and labor rates and the like, we're driving increased total loss frequency. Needless to say those trends continue unabated and are accelerating due to rising complexity in the proliferation of accidents -- accident detection and avoidance system. It's well understood among customers, investors and other stakeholders, that repairing cars has become progressively less attractive economically for many, many years.I think where we've been less effective is in communicating the other side of salvage equation and to be precise, I mean the values that we can generate for these cars at auction. The total loss industry has changed very dramatically over Copart's 37 years, and even fairly significantly over the past five. In our early days of course, salvaged vehicles were literally worked their weights in metals. You see even vestiges of this in earnings calls as recently at a year ago when we were disclosing scrap prices and how they change year-over-year. I've been the CFO of Copart for four years. Outside of those earnings calls, we have literally never once talked about scrap prices. Why? Because the cars that we sell increasingly instead, became valuable for their parts competition. As the dismantling industry evolves and the OEMs leverage their aftermarket parts businesses for profit through higher prices, the dismantling industry helped to drive salvage values upwards.Since then, however, there has been a still more significant shift in our industry, which is that today these cars are not worth their weight in metals, not worth per se their value as parts, but instead their value as drivable, rebuildable vehicles, which has forever altered the salvage equation for ourselves and for our insurance company partners.The punch line then there is that the rising total loss frequency isn't just a function of preparing cars becoming more expensive, it's that totaling them and selling them has become more attractive over time as well. We have a number of initiatives under way with our insurance carrier partners for whom this reality is becoming more and more apparent. We intend to help them further optimize their claims processes, yielding more totals and earlier ones as well.But how? How we've been able to drive those volume increases with price increases at the same time is in part by becoming a still more global business, our physical reach, our brand reputation and, of course, the auction platform liquidity that we offer has expanded buyer universe for our cars and lifted the prices we can achieve at auction. You can see it first hand that our unit growth rate has certainly eclipsed that of the industry in general and certainly that of the dismantling industry as well, while our prices at auction had actually increased. And that's because the fastest-growing economies in the world, in Eastern Europe, in Africa and Central and South America are also the lowest automotive penetration markets in the world. So while we have grown our supply very substantially over the past few years, we've grown our demand much more still through our proactive marketing efforts.And that's the second thing I wanted to briefly tackle, and that's Copart's auction liquidity being the flywheel that generates differentiated value for ourselves and for our customers. I'm sure we'll get questions in Q&A about certain market share wins and insurance. You already know that we don't comment on specific accounts on an individual basis. But I think we emphasized that over time we have grown market share very steadily over the years, we just haven't talked about them on an individual account basis. Why? Ultimately because auction results are the most important. We generate better value at auction than the rest of the industry, and service levels as well, which we believe we deliver better than others.Our growth -- the growth for auction liquidity has further been enhanced by organic industry growth, of course, the same total loss frequency phenomena we described a moment ago. And then growth in our non-insurance business, which is fueled by, but also helps contribute to our insurance business. Every car we earn the right to sell from an automotive dealer also increases the value proposition of our auction and ultimately raises the price we can achieve in our insurance cars as well.We've made the investments in land and technology, process and people for decades that enabled us to grow this platform, making it more valuable with each passing year to our customers and to us. And so the virtuous cycle of auction liquidity continues.The last thing I wanted to tackle is our international expansion efforts, which, you already know, has been an important driver of our past, but likewise will be an important driver of our future growth as well. We described in great detail during our fourth quarter 2018  our expansion efforts in Germany. Our strategy there remains consistent. Build the physical infrastructure necessary to effectively serve a nationwide footprint, build logistics capabilities, enable rapid vehicle pickups, use purchased cars to seed our German auctions, leverage Copart buyer -- global buyer network, and bring our value proposition to overhaul the claims process for the German insurance industry.As you know already from Germany, our intentions are to expand elsewhere in Western Europe as well. Our year-over-year and sequential trends in Germany are encouraged with substantial growth in unit volumes, revenue and trading profits providing very clear indications that our consignment model will be an economically superior proposition for the insurance carriers in the German market in general.With that, why don't we dive into the specifics of the quarter, and I'll turn over -- turn it back over to our Vice President, Darren Hart. -- Thanks, Jeff. We delivered another strong quarter with record first quarter revenues, gross profits and operating profits. Global revenues grew by 20.2% or $93.1 million, despite $3.9 million in foreign currency headwinds, primarily due to the relative strength of the US dollar against the British pound.Global service revenue grew by 23.6%. Our purchased vehicle sales were flat as we converted a substantial UK customer from a purchase-based sales contract to a fee-based sales contract. First quarter global unit sales volumes increased by 12.4% and vehicle inventories grew by 14.1% versus Q1 of last year.US revenues grew by 25%, fueled by higher average selling prices and a 13.2% volume increase driven by organic growth from our existing insurance and non-insurance customers and market share gains. Our non-insurance business represents approximately 24% of total US sales volumes and includes franchises, independent dealers, finance and leasing leasing companies, fleets, charities, equipment dealers and wholesalers. Excluding charities, our non-insurance unit sales volume grew -- increased by 13%. We attribute the growth across non-insurance to our increased marketing, sales and operational focus and our auction liquidity.First quarter US average selling prices grew 4.2% year-over-year. ASPs continue improving as a result of more bidders, more international bidders, and therefore auction liquidity, as well as an increasing mix of newer less-damaged cars. International bidding and buying activity reflect our proactive marketing efforts as well as the effectiveness of our all-digital auction platform, VB3. Year-over-year, we increased unique international bidders and unique domestic bidders by over 20%. The outcome is higher bids per unit and therefore better selling prices for our customers.Our selling prices continue to significantly outpace various used car indices such as the Manheim used car price index, which was roughly flat this quarter versus last year. Increasing ASPs then cycle back to our unit growth drivers. US vehicle inventories grew by 15% due to these continued strong industry tailwinds as well as market share gains.International revenues were flat due to the aforementioned customer contract shift from purchase to fee based revenue and unfavorable foreign currencies. International service revenues grew by 11.4%, while international volumes grew 8.4% and international vehicle inventories grew 8.1%. Globally, purchased vehicle sales were flat as US and Germany purchased vehicle growth was offset by UK customer contract shift.Globally, gross profit grew from $195.9 million to $254.9 million or 30.1%, and gross margin percentage grew from 42.5% to 46%, an expansion of 350 basis points. US gross margins grew from 45.2% to 49.2%, driven by rising ASPs and operational efficiencies. International gross margins declined from 31.4% to 29.5%, in part due to the increasing mix of our German business. In the US and globally, we do note rising labor, health insurance and selling costs. However, these rising costs have been offset in part by rising ASPs and operational efficiencies.General and administrative expenses, excluding stock compensation and depreciation, increased from $34.8 million a year ago to $38.8 million, primarily driven by a $3.7 million pre-tax charge related to the employer portion of payroll taxes on certain executive stock compensations. This one-time charge has been reflected as such on an after-tax basis in the non-GAAP earnings, included in our earnings release. Beyond this item, international G&A growth, in support of the expansion of our European businesses, was offset by a lower US G&A due to decreased legal costs and higher capitalized software development. While our G&A may fluctuate modestly in any given quarter, we continue to generally expect G&A expenses will grow, but provide operating leverage over time.Operating income grew from $151.4 million to $205.4 million or 35.6%, which represents a 420 basis point operating margin expansion, inclusive of an unfavorable $800,000 year-over-year foreign currency impact. Net interest expense was up year-over-year from $3.7 million to $4 million, primarily due to reduced offsetting interest income given our lower average cash balances.The Q1 income tax benefit of $16.1 million reflects a $62.4 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options and a $3 million tax benefit from other discrete income tax items. The one-time benefit from the exercise of employee stock options as well as the discrete income tax benefits have been included and reflected as such in the non-GAAP earnings included in our earnings release.GAAP net income increased from $114.1 million to $218.2 million or 91.2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income increased 36.9% from $113.3 million to $155.4 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share grew from $0.47 to $0.91 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share grew from $0.47 to $0.65, or 38.3%.Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. We adopted a new lease standard, ASC 842, this quarter and now show a $136.4 million operating lease right-of-use asset and $140.3 million of operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with $181.1 million in cash and $219.5 million in net debt. Operating cash flows for the quarter were $212.5 million, an increase of $105 million, driven by higher earnings, due in part to the large income tax benefit.We invested $131.5 million in capex during the quarter, with over 85% attributable to capacity expansion. Given the sustained industrywide volume fueled growth by higher -- due to a higher total loss frequency, we remain focused on purchasing and developing land to meet current and prospective demand. We currently have 39 new yard and expansion projects in the engineering phase and 33 projects in the development phase. During the quarter, we also collected $12.6 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and paid $101.4 million for employee stock-based withholdings.We thank you for your continued interest in Copart. Dan, if you'd open up to -- open it up to questions, that would be appreciated.Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question in the queue comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please go ahead. -- Good morning, and congratulations on a another nice quarter. -- Thanks Bob. -- Thanks. -- I wanted to start -- you've talked a lot about your strong international buyer base, you brought it up, say, obviously, and how it benefits your insurance customers, I guess, actually all your customers that are selling. Can you give us a little more color on the types of cars the international buyers are most focused on? Is it the same as the general pattern in the US? Are they more focused on insurance or non, newer or older cars? Just a little color into what they're buying. -- Bob, thanks for the question, and a good one. I think in general, they are -- the demand is similar with the one nuance being that they will -- their interest is typically on higher value vehicles, which makes logical sense because a car which is a very old battery case, which is largely just metal value, you would never bother to ship overseas. So they tend to focus on rebuildable, drivable vehicles in particular. And those -- so they overlap very heavily. I would say that we talked about how international bidders are purchasing approximately half the value of our US options, plus or minus. They did of course on many, many more cars still than that. So the point being that it is similar in the aggregate with the nudge to higher value cars. -- Got it. Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just related to that roughly half the value of cars purchased, I know you don't target numbers like that at all, but -- so where do you think the percentage goes given the trends in the industry right now over the next three years to five years? Again, I know you're just focusing on service -- servicing your customers and things, you're not targeting any number, but where do you think it might go? -- Don't have an end state in mind, Bob. Think that it has grown steadily over time. There are a number of important secular tailwinds there that we mentioned a few moments ago about economic growth in those markets, low automotive penetration. I think, we take for granted here in the US that mobility is essential for our economic well-being for education or healthcare and the like. In those economies, likewise have demand for the same mobility. So over time, I think there will be still more demand for US vehicles, wrecked cars that could become drivable cars there, but we don't have an end state in mind per se, Bob. -- Got it. Okay. And then looking at dealer cars, there's obviously been a lot of growth from franchise and independent dealer sales on Copart over the past couple of years. Can you talk a little bit about the typical car that's consigning to you and who the buyers are? Is that international? Or is that other dealers? Or just a little more info on that dealer cars? -- Both. I think the dealer car -- dealer -- dealer source cars, I think you know, has been an area of emphasis for us for years, with meaningful growth really over a number of quarters now year-over-year. And that's because our value proposition, again, the same -- it's the same one as it is for the insurance carriers that has delivered auction values which matter the most to them. And that is a function of the phenomena we talked about a moment ago, that is liquidity, that is marketing efforts, that is international buyers and domestic alike. So it is again a fairly representative sample of buyers on the other side of the equation. -- Super. All right. Thanks so much. -- Thank Bob.Our next question in the queue comes from Caig -- excuse me, Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks for taking my questions. And Jeff, thanks for the dramatic overview. I wanted to start with the UK conversion. With that conversion to a consignment model, should we anticipate three more quarters of pressure on vehicle sales from that customer? -- The word pressure, I probably hesitate, if the math, yes, will persist for -- will persist for a few quarters if that's you mean. I think for us, it's not pressure per se, because I think you know we think about cars, our economics on a unit economics basis, per unit basis more so than we do the actual gross revenue number. So it's not that meaningful to us managerially, but in terms of the math you described, yes. -- Got it. And then I have another math question where we don't get to use numbers, but clearly you earned significant business from -- and ensure that previously committed nearly all of its volume to a competitor. First, why do you think Copart won that business? And second, this was described as a 30% volume customer that's going to happen, most of which by the end of this year, does all of that math jive with how you understand the relationship? -- Craig, you find us unsatisfying, but we've been very consistent about not commenting on individual customers. More generically, we have earned very significant market share for years and for decades, often organically. And the reasons in general, so not commenting on specific accounts, are that we deliver superior auction results, that is first and foremost, certainly depending on where we are in a historical cycle, other considerations like catastrophic events and the like can also factor the decision, but ultimately it's about the economic value we deliver to our customers, number one.Number two, related but somewhat [Indecipherable] is service levels, and that in turn is a function of our yard network, our people, our technology, our process, how well do we service and account day-to-day, week-to-week, year-to-year. And then of course, as I noted a moment, how we service them in times of crisis as well.That's how every insurance carrier considers their salvage partner decisions and depending on who the partner is and when you -- where we are in history, they'll prioritize differently, but those are the criteria that anyone would make that decision on. -- And then my last question is just around innovation and what you might be doing to innovate your services or your auction platform. There has been talk lately among your competitors about improving cycle times through a platform that would connect banks and insurers or better video and camera views such that you have a better look of the interior or exterior of the car if you're bidding from all the way across the ocean. -- Yeah. Good question. And I think, perhaps we've been remiss in not describing them robustly enough on our earnings calls. But in general, we take those services -- those types of services very seriously. So I'll comment just on one, for example, the loan payoff question I think you just raised. And for those who aren't already in the know, one complication in the resolution of a total loss claim can be that a policyholder has an outstanding loan on his or her car, so before the salvage plan can be resolved altogether, the loan payoff balance to per diem owed on that loan needs to be obtained by the carrier and the policyholder so that the lender conversely paid off.As I understand it, others in the industry are in alpha or beta testing for a product they intend to launch at some point. We launched ours in May of 2019. So whole six months ago, we had an automated loan payoff offering already delivered to our customers. We didn't talk about it on our earnings calls per se. We recognize that as an important consideration for an insurance carrier and wanting to resolve those claims. We love the claims process. We are meticulous students of it. We appreciated it for a while now that this is a second point at a bottleneck and we developed and delivered service accordingly six months ago. -- I'm sorry to follow-up, but is there any way you can describe the cycle time improvement from that loan payoff tool? -- Hard to do, Craig, because it's very hard to isolate variables. As you might imagine that is on a portion of the cars that have loans outstanding and a portion still for which those financial institutions are connected to various intermediaries that we have partnered with. So we did not always quite so black and white, but it's certainly a tangible improvement. Both we and our insurance partners appreciate it. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thanks, CraigAnd our next question in the queue comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about the market share gains, Jeff. You alluded to that the economics in the dollar returns in the business that you get the insurers that was I think that your lead off point into why the Company has been successful over the years in terms of gaining share. Is there any way you could kind of peel back the onion a little bit on that topic for us a little bit? Potentially over the last few years, how that dollar return number to the insurer maybe has changed if you think the gap is widened? And then also, what do you contribute the gap to? Is it just purely the build out of the international buyer base and just scale? Just love to know a little bit more on that topic. -- Sure. So the delivered values at auction, you've heard us describe the length on this call the international buyers and how important they are. And I think that sometimes maybe underappreciated that how relevant they are both for the units that are ultimately acquired by international buyers, but also on all of the other units they bid on, right? They just help provide value disclosure, full and fair value realization across virtually all the units that Copart offers.Beyond that, there are number of other considerations too. VB3, if you haven't already, you should quote attend an online auction to Copart and do so for others in the industry and render your own judgments. But we have what we think is the best-in-class technology for sellers and buyers alike, which yields -- which has for us anyway, yielded increasing bidders. So bidders and bids well in excess, even if our unit growth, meaning bids per unit -- domestic bids per unit, international bids per unit have very consistently increased for a long time.So it's mostly about the auction liquidity phenomena we just described, John. -- Great. And then, just wanted to ask about the land investment in the quarter. Kind of jumped up a little bit. And I was curious to know if you could help us think about what we should be thinking about in terms of normalized land spend over the next couple of years? And should we look at Q1 as kind of a anomaly or a sign of things to come here? -- I think it's capital expenditures, in particular, I think are hard to extrapolate from a given quarter, but we're talking about parcels of land and in some cases costs, multiple tens of millions of dollars. So reading into one quarter's numbers I think is bouncy. I would say that if you consider the past four years to be quote elevated capital expenditure levels for Copart, those investments will continue for years to come, both as necessary for the business that we have today as well as growth we anticipate. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thanks, John.Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good morning guys. -- Good morning. -- Hey, Jeff, if you could put it in perspective, may be give us a feeling for what the yield spread does look like versus the average competitor. Obviously, you've done a good job building out the end buyer base, and the frequency of their bidding. But could you sort of quantify how much the yield those benefit your auction? -- Tough to quantify, Bret. We know, we believe it is significant, we believe that the industry has generally voted with its feet, but literally an individual car, of course, would not be sold on both auctions, you would never have and all else equal, auction comparison like-for-like. But we believe that simply the international proposition of our bids, the increasing number of bids per unit over time, this is pretty compelling evidence. That's true. -- Do you think it's single-digit percentage points or double-digit percentage points, I mean sort of ballpark? -- Bret, I don't know. I would -- I can't. We really don't have the data to do that, but literally no cars that were sold on both -- on multiple auctions. So it's -- we can't quantify that. -- Okay. All right. And then a question, I guess, you talked about mix and maybe 50% of the volume is now being rebuilt. Could you compare that to where we were five years ago? You sound like we've got a big change recently. But what percent was scrap, what percent was dismantled, and what percent was built five years ago versus that? -- Won't be able to point-to-point comparisons in part, because we don't have perfect visibility either buyer who buys 400 units from us may have different intentions for different of those units. We can surmise that if they're based in the Ukraine, they intend to drive them again versus if it's a buyer who is six miles away, also owns a scrap yard, we can guess -- we can render a different judgment. But those would be estimates in the aggregate, I think directionally very clearly all have been -- it's been a very significant shift from scrap and dismantling in favor of rebuildable drivable cars.You can see that in part also in the -- and literally the physical appearances of the cars we've been selling, if you attended the Copart auction in the 1980s, and saw what was sort of 50% damaged car, you can see one that is obliterated that very clearly will never be returned to growth.If you look at the car today with 50% damage, it looks like a car. It probably had a technology set, if you even were willing to temporarily forgo, you could drive the car right away. So the very nature of the car has changed as well. -- Okay. And I guess, do you have any new thoughts as far as the upper boundary of total loss rates? If we're in the high teens now, what that number could go to? -- No new thoughts. And perhaps, we have old ones then. And that is to say the total loss frequency, I think, folks who see 20% or whatever today wonder, could it someday be capped at 25%. And I think if you take then the 40-year view and look back to 1980, you'll see the total loss frequency then is 4%. So if it went from 4% to 20%, I don't see the logic in believing that it will ultimately [Indecipherable] 25% instead. If we're having this conversation any point over the past 40 years, I think we would have foreseen ceilings that are quite a bit less than reality ended up being. So our view is that, so long as there is a natural outlet for these cars in the form of international buyers, in particular, in higher growth economies, who need cars that, that there is no particular -- there is no ceiling, there is no gauge on where total loss frequency can go. -- Yeah. Thank you. -- Thanks Bret.Our next question in the queue comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the -- hey, first one is on the ASP growth. I mean, pretty demonstrable growth there last year. I mean 4% still really impressive. But want to get your sense if you're lapping anything or kind of how do you think about that decelerate here on ASP growth? -- I think there is enough noise in any given quarter that I think it's all -- you hear me talk about this in -- with respect to many variables in our business, this one included. I look over a longer period of time. That said, selling price improvement is a good solid quarter for us and it's been consistent now that we've been up consecutively for 12 quarters or so. As you know there are secular and cyclical forces here.The secular ones being total loss frequency that as we total more cars, those are generally better ones. Secular drivers [Indecipherable] improved more of them, they will drive ASPs upward as well. There are cyclical forces here as well, including currency, I think of that sort that can cause fluctuations in both directions. So I think we're -- we are happy to continue delivering better values for our customers. -- Yeah. It's OK. And then I kind of reask a question different way that was asked earlier. But when I look at your capex in an LTM basis, it's about $440 million. It's roughly double what it was a few years ago, yet the yard ups and depreciation have kind of barely bunched recently. So I guess this would imply that you're -- you probably have more land at development phase right now. And I'll track the number. I can go back and see if you disclosed that.But just wanted to get a sense for what's behind the set an urgency of land expansion? If there is anyway to kind of thematically bifurcate where you're kind of added capacity or is it internationally, domestically, is it yard expansion existing yards? Are you trying to -- is the biggest of customer win? So anything you can do to provide clarity on the capacity additions there would be helpful. -- The strong majority of these expenditures are for our quote traditional markets, so ones in which we've been doing business in for a long time, and they are a reflection of demands -- demand to-date, meaning if you have perfect visibility into every Copart yard, you'd be able to see that plenty of them could use more space now. Therefore, a good portion of this capex is for expansions. Whatever we can expand into contiguous space, we of course would love to. But the operating efficiencies that affords us, and when necessary we will expand it -- we will instead build new facilities elsewhere. So you're right to guess that we have many facilities in development. What's driving that is simply demand -- demand today and demand growth in the future. -- Got you. Okay. Thank you. -- Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our last question in the queue comes from Derek Glynn with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a follow-up on yard ops. You've gained some leverage on that line item over time, probably helped in part by higher pricing. But I'm wondering if you see any areas of inefficiencies there that you guys can tackle or any initiatives for that cost item in particular to drive further margin improvement? -- It's a fair question and the answer is somehow both yes and no. So this is an area of relentless focus for us, it is how we optimize the efficiency of our yard operations. And therefore, we are -- we deploy initiatives all the time, including for example, a self-help driver app last year, which reduces weight for unnecessary trips that our drivers make to our yard. So at that times hundreds, we have a number of initiatives under way.I don't know that any of them will yield a step function change. In some cases, they help to offset natural inflation we see in our business from fuel and healthcare and other factors I'm sure you know quite well. So yes, it is an area of ongoing emphasis for us and it has been worked. -- Got it. And then just secondly, it's been a couple of years since you announced the acquisition of NPA. Just wanted to get an update there. Can you give us a sense of how the powersports business is progressing? What its contribution to growth has looked like? And broadly, if it met your expectations? -- Got it. Yeah. NPA has been a great acquisition for us. We're thrilled that they are -- they are a part of the Copart family today. I think you may remember from the time we did the deal that our logic was twofold. We needed to like the transaction on a stand-alone basis and we needed also to believe that it would add -- it would contribute strategic value to Copart and our insurance and non-insurance business as well. I think it's delivered on both fronts. The business has grown organically on its own, meaning the powersports business, the auction that we run through NPA have grown on their own. And likewise, its contributed to our expertise when it comes to the powersports space, which you may remember we noted is a nuance in different markets, in many respects as well. So now having that expertise in-house has contributed to our capabilities in our traditional business as well. So yes, on both counts. -- Great. Thanks guys.And speakers, there are no more questions in the queue. -- Great. Thank you for joining us for the call. We'll look forward to talking to you next quarter.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 226 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new May 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $70.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $78.09/share today.\n\nBecause the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.13% return on the cash commitment, or 9.91% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, and highlighting in green where the $75.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CPRT stock at the current price level of $78.09/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $80.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.00% if the stock gets called away at the May 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CPRT shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CPRT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $80.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.20% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 27%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $78.09) to be 26%.

The Insurance Council of Texas estimated at least $4.75 billion was paid out to insured owners who collectively lost more than 250,000 private passenger and commercial vehicles in the flooding. And this is just one event. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina and two other storms damaged some 571,000 vehicles along the Gulf Coast and in Florida.\u00a0Flooding is the biggest cause of vehicle damage reported to insurers after storms like these, according to Roger Morris, spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Add to this the number of wrecked and totaled vehicles that insurers declare as a total loss each year, and the numbers become overwhelming.Image source: Getty ImagesWhat to do with all of these unusable vehicles? Once the water recedes, the insurance pays out, or the wrecker tows them away, California-based   is the next link in the chain.Copart helps insurance and rental car companies, local municipalities, financial institutions, and charities sell over two million salvage vehicles over the internet through online car auctions and vehicle remarketing services. Dismantlers, body shops, salvage buyers, dealers, and individual consumers are able to buy these vehicles from Copart's 200 locations in 11 countries, including over 170 across 47 U.S. states and another eight in Canada. Copart's network enables the sale of these totaled vehicles in foreign markets where they can be repaired at lower costs due to less regulatory requirements.Because demand for this specific sort of recycling is continuous, the salvage business is not significantly impacted by economic cycles. Natural disasters will continue their random paths of destruction and auto makers continue to add costly technology-enabled features even in their baseline models. The latter fact means a higher number of cars are more likely to be totaled than repaired. And even as car manufacturers include more safety features on board, their efforts are often circumvented by distracted drivers using their smartphones, who account for 25% of all car crashes.Copart's market is both international and domestic. The company states that approximately 20% of the salvage vehicles it acquires are sold to non-US buyers who are more likely to purchase higher-priced cars \u2013 a figure it has documented over the past 12 years of growing its business internationally.\u00a0In order to meet this ever-growing demand from car buyers and sellers, Copart says it's \"doubling down\" on storage capacity expansion, and it has continued to iterate on its technology-based model since launching as a members-only website in 1996. Copart launched online bidding in the industry back in 1998, pioneered online vehicle images in 1999, and introduced real-time virtual bidding in 2001.\u00a0The company's financials demonstrate an increased demand for its vehicle remarketing services and the higher average selling prices it's been able to get from those international online bidders. Total revenue continues to climb, exceeding $2 billion in July of this year, . And Copart is keeping more of what it makes, compared to others in its industry. Copart's trailing twelve month (TTM) gross profit margin is 45.58%, which is 57.2% higher than the sector median of 29%. Its year over year revenue growth of 13.1%, healthy $646.7 million in cash from operations, and 23.23% return on total assets (all TTM figures) underscore the profitability of this solid company.Copart's stock price has increased 55.7% ($28.45) over the past 12 months and 400.7% ($63.67) over the past five years \u2013 far better returns than the S&P 500's respective 17.9% and 50.95% increases over those same periods.

The strong revenue growth in the quarter comes on top of the its increasing revenue growth in the  of this year, and set a record for the company's fourth-quarter sales.Data source: .Copart's fourth-quarter revenue gains continued its third-quarter trend of double-digit percentage sales growth, which was 15.7% in the previous quarter. Its fourth-quarter sales growth came from a 20.1% increase in global service revenue, reaching $470.4 million, and a 25.4% jump in purchased car revenue, to $72.2 million.Image source: Getty Images.Copart's global service revenue is the most important revenue segment for investors to watch because it accounts for about 87% of the company's total sales, so a 20% increase in this segment during the fourth quarter was undoubtedly good news for Copart and its investors.It wasn't just the 's sales growth that was impressive this quarter, though. Copart's operating income improved by 43% to $192.8 million, and its gross profit increased by 28.8% to $242.6 million.Copart's management mentioned on the investor call that the average selling price of vehicles sold through Copart auctions continues to rise. The average selling price rose 8.1% in the fourth quarter, which helped push up the company's purchased car revenue; management noted that \"this has been a continuation of a trend\" for the past several years.The company's management also said on the call that Copart finished the quarter with $186.3 million in cash and about $200 million in debt. Copart's operating cash flow for the quarter was $193 million, with capital expenditures totaling $114.5 million.\u00a0Copart's share price has jumped nearly 10% since it reported its fourth-quarter results, likely because investors were pleased with its impressive sales gains. Copart's share price has been on a tear this year and is up 73% year to date, compared the 's 19% gain.Copart's management doesn't issue any forward guidance, but the strong end to the company's 2019 fiscal year is a good indicator that Copart is moving in the right direction as it heads into its new fiscal year. Investors should continue to watch the company's service revenue for any changes to its current growth trajectory and also keep tabs on changes to the company's average vehicle selling price (as this would affect Copart's vehicle sales revenue).

In this midst of this success, now seems an opportune time to assess new risks that might impair the company's business model over the next several years.During Copart's  last month, an analyst asked for management's perspective on the rise of car-sharing, and the potential for a reduction in individual vehicle ownership as car fleets tied to ride-hailing businesses grow more prevalent. The question addressed the risk that declining car ownership could translate to fewer vehicles available for auction.CEO Jay Adair offered the insight that automobile ownership doesn't rest on practical considerations alone. Adair pointed out that at least in America, car owners choose vehicles for reasons extending past utility. We buy cars even where mass transportation is readily available. Many purchasers opt for new vehicles replete with the latest technology when a used, utilitarian car might do. Adair also cited brand attachment as a purchase factor: \"[T]here is nothing practical about buying a Mercedes-Benz or a  or any luxury car. It's a personal choice.\"Adair's point is that the appearance of ride-hailing services may increase, rather than decrease, the number of vehicles on the road. I find this reasoning persuasive. Classical economic theory assumes that consumers nearly always make rational choices that benefit their finances over the long term. Yet as Adair argues, consumption is often personal, and non-exclusive. You can be an avid user of Uber and still overspend on a luxury vehicle. Those who predict that we'll ditch personal car ownership once car-sharing options are ubiquitous may be overrelying on textbook interpretations of supply and demand.Image source: Getty Images.Adair also posited that the rising proportion of technology in cars will make them much more difficult to repair in roughly 10 years, increasing the likelihood that a damaged vehicle will be written off as a total loss. This should actually benefit Copart's business model, which gleans the lion's share of its revenue from the auctioning of salvage vehicles.CFO Jeff Liaw in turn provided his perspective on the potential risks of car-sharing to Copart's business. Liaw relayed that the company seeks to understand how car-sharing will affect vehicle miles traveled, the frequency of accidents, and total loss frequency in the industry.\u00a0On the first two effects, Liaw stated the following:Ride-sharing I think for miles traveled almost certainly will drive up the number of miles on the road today. I've seen consulting studies that indicate that every mile of self-driving is replaced by 2.8 miles of ride-sharing miles -- [that] may be bullish, but the point is that almost certainly we have reduced the friction for driving. It's easier now to drive after a couple of drinks, easier for younger or older people to get in the car as well. Vehicle miles will rise. Accident frequency, I think all else equal, I think it's likely neutral. I don't think that  and [] drivers are systematically superior drivers than the rest of us, you may be more bullish on that front than I am.On the third effect, Liaw believes that loss frequency, which he describes as a long-term tailwind in the auction industry, will continue to remain at roughly 5%, having increased from 4% over the last several decades. The implication is that as long as 5% of vehicles on the road suffer a total loss annually in the foreseeable future, Copart's core damaged and salvaged vehicle market will remain robust. A greater proportion of shared vehicles and even an increase in autonomous fleets may not change this percentage appreciably.Ultimately, Copart sees enormous market share that can still be captured over the next few decades, and doesn't appear threatened at this juncture by disruptive evolution in the automobile industry. Management acknowledges the coming sea change in vehicle utility, but believes Copart's basic economic model of selling trashed vehicles globally via online auction will emerge unscathed.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Through the first half of the year, the  was on track for its best year in over two decades. To be sure, gains have been muted in the third quarter despite major indices flirting with all-time highs. But with the S&P 500 up 20% year-to-date, stocks are still having one of their best years this century.One bullish sign about this rally is that the leadership in the S&P 500 in 2019 is very diverse. That is, the individual stocks which are leading the market higher are not concentrated in one industry \u2014 rather, they are a from a broad array on sectors. That\u2019s bullish because it shows that the market rally this year has breadth. You don\u2019t just have one boat or one group of boats rushing ahead of the rest. Instead, the whole sea is rising here, and when the whole sea is rising, that is often a dynamic that is tough to stop.Underneath this sea of stocks are undercurrents of megatrends making their way to the surface. Investors who get in now \u2014 before the crowd has been convinced of the potential long-term worth of these companies \u2014 will .With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the best stocks of 2019 so far, and see where these stocks could go next.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\t85%Through September, the best performing stock in the S&P 500 is  (NYSE:). Shares of the fast casual Mexican eatery have rattled off an 85% gain this year, thanks to the company\u2019s turnaround gaining impressive momentum throughout the year.Specifically, new management has doubled down on three growth initiatives \u2014 revamping the menu with exciting new options, expanding reach by building out the digital business and re-branding the chain with a new marketing campaign. Those three growth initiatives have all worked, and Chipotle has reported hugely positive comps all year long, which has fueled the huge gains in CMG stock.Going forward, this rally could persist. After all, nothing is wrong with the Chipotle growth narrative. The turnaround is powering full steam ahead, and for the foreseeable future, the company should comp positive and report big profit growth. In theory, those strong numbers should keep CMG stock on its winning trajectory. But I\u2019m concerned about valuation. At 60-times forward earnings, Chipotle stock is one of the most richly valued restaurant stocks I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 and I think upward moving fixed income yields could pressure that extended valuation in a big way.As such, while the rally in CMG stock could persist into the end of the year, I don\u2019t think it will. Instead, I think CMG stock could give back some gains over the next few months. In sharp contrast, stocks that are  can make investors money in any market.Source: Shutterstock\n\t74%Through September, the second best S&P 500 stock is  (NYSE:). The energy company focused on crude oil and natural gas exploration and production has seen its stock rise nearly 75% in 2019 for two simple reasons.First, you have surging oil prices. WTI Crude Oil prices are up more than 25% year-to-date, thanks to improving global economic conditions firming up demand and certain one-off catalysts short-circuiting supply (such as the recent attacks in Saudi Arabia). HES stock has naturally rallied with rising oil prices. Second, Hess owns a 30% stake in a huge oilfield in Guyana that projects to be one of the most lucrative oilfields in recent memory. As this oilfield has inched close towards being operable, HES stock has moved higher.Can the rally continue? I have my doubts. The trailing price-to-sales multiple on HES stock is now at a 2019 high, while the dividend yield is at a 2019 low. Thus, the stock is richly valued by historical standards, meaning investors are pricing in higher oil prices for the foreseeable future and huge upside from the Guyana project. The latter will probably materialize. I\u2019m unconvinced on the former, as it appears countries globally are ready to inject supply where needed to keep oil prices from rising too much.As such, while HES stock could continue to move higher from here, further gains will be reliant on oil prices moving higher.Source: Shutterstock\n\t73%The third best S&P 500 stock through September is  (NASDAQ:).Shares of the semiconductor equipment giant have risen by more than 70% this year as investors have realized that the semiconductor downturn everyone was expecting in 2019, isn\u2019t as bad as feared. That is, LRCX dropped big in late 2018 to multi-year lows and a dirt cheap valuation as investors anticipated that a global economic slowdown would kill semi equipment demand in 2018/19.It has. But the damage has been relatively muted and a recovery already appears to be underway. As such, LRCX has benefited from both multiple expansion and upward estimates revisions in 2019 \u2014 the sum of which is how Lam Research stock has rattled of a 73% YTD gain.LRCX should continue to move higher from here, albeit at a slower pace. That\u2019s because only one of the stock\u2019s two growth drivers will remain in play. The multiple expansion tailwind has dried up, since at 17-times forward earnings, LRCX is trading at its richest valuation in years. But the upward estimates revisions tailwind has not dried up. Global economic growth trends are improving, and as they continue to improve over the next few quarters, the semi market should continue to bounce back \u2014 which should lead to analysts upping their forward revenue and EPS estimate for LRCX.Big picture: While the best of the LRCX rally is in the rear-view mirror, this stock still has some gas left in the tank to head higher over the next few months. Source: Shutterstock\n\t72%The fourth best S&P 500 stock through September is  (NYSE:).While the U.S. auto market may be having a tough time in 2019, online car auction company Copart is not. The company has rattled off three straight strong quarters in 2019. Revenue growth has accelerated higher through each of those quarters. Margins are powering higher, too. Profit growth has been robust. In other words, Copart has been firing on all cylinders in 2019, despite a weak auto market backdrop, and that divergence has helped CPRT stock soar by more than 70% this year.This rally has more firepower left. Copart has leveraged its unique value prop in the auto industry to transform into a steady 20%-plus revenue and profit grower. For that 20%-plus revenue and profit growth, CPRT stock trades at just 30-times forward earnings. That\u2019s a fairly reasonable multiple to pay for 20% growth. So long as the U.S. economy remains healthy and continues to support 20%-plus profit growth at Copart, which it should for the foreseeable future \u2013 then CPRT stock has room to move higher.Momentum stocks, like CPRT, can be difficult to chase but the risks can be worth the rewards. And new breakthroughs are happening right under our noses \u2014 ?Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\t71%The fifth best S&P 500 stock through September is  (NASDAQ:).Owing to its broad exposure to favorable growth trends in data creation, accumulation and storage, data storage giant Western Digital has been a Wall Street favorite for a long time. In 2018, Western Digital lost Wall Street\u2019s favor as growth turned sharply negative amid a broad data storage market slowdown. WDC stock shed more than 70%. But in 2019, there have been signs of improving conditions in the flash market, and the consensus belief is that a trough is close. As Western Digital has neared this inflection point, investors have gobbled up shares in anticipation of a big recovery in 2020.Will the rally continue? It hinges entirely on whether or not that big recovery in 2020 actually materializes. If it does, WDC stock could fly much higher \u2014 the stock is still 40% off its early 2018 highs. If it doesn\u2019t, WDC stock could give back most of its 71% year-to-date gain. Fortunately for WDC bulls, I think the big recovery will materialize, given that global economic conditions are improving, trade tensions are easing, global business confidence is improving and fiscal stimulus is on its way to help juice economic activity. Meanwhile, major breakthroughs from little-known companies \u2014  \u2014 will shape the future.Consequently, while WDC stock is unequivocally a high-risk, high-reward play here, I think the reward part has more merit than the risk part at this point in time.Source: Shutterstock\n\t70%The sixth best S&P 500 stock through September is  (NASDAQ:).Much like Lam Research, KLA is a semiconductor equipment stock which has materially outperformed in 2019 because the slowdown in the semi market hasn\u2019t been as bad as feared and looks to be over pretty soon with sizable catalysts on the horizon, such as 5G. As such, the consensus belief is that KLA\u2019s growth trajectory will materially improve over the next few years, and investors are gobbling up KLAC stock ahead of that big improvement.The rally continuing here will depend on how much KLA\u2019s growth trajectory improves. At present, KLAC stock trades at 16-times forward earnings, which is a multi-year high valuation for this stock. In order to justify that above-average multiple, revenue and profit growth need to accelerate meaningfully from here. If they don\u2019t, KLAC stock could give back a bulk of its gains.Fortunately for KLAC bulls, I think revenue and profit growth will accelerate meaningfully, as 5G and IoT tailwinds converge on improving global economic conditions in 2020 to create a robust semi-equipment spending environment. If that does happen, KLAC stock should stay in rally mode for the foreseeable future.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\t68%Last on this list of best S&P 500 stocks of 2019 is  (NASDAQ:).Shares of CPU and GPU company AMD have been red hot for a while now. In 2018, this was the S&P 500\u2019s top stock. In 2019, it\u2019s the seventh best performing stock. This consistent strength comes down to one thing \u2013 market share expansion. Over the past few years, AMD \u2013 a historically small and largely irrelevant player in the CPU and GPU markets \u2013 has dramatically increased its presence in the CPU and GPU markets, and as the company has, revenues and profits have marched meaningfully higher. This big growth has powered equally big gains in AMD stock.This rally should continue into 2020. At present, AMD projects to keep winning share in the CPU and GPU markets for the next several quarters. So long as the company keeps doing this, growth rates will remain robust, and investors will salivate over the long term potential. That is a winning combination which should ultimately keep AMD stock on a winning path.Thus, when it comes to AMD stock, it\u2019s all about market share expansion. So long as this company keeps winning market share, AMD stock will stay on an uptrend.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at , one standout is the Invesco S&P 500\u2014 Equal Weight Industrials ETF (Symbol: RGI) where we have detected an approximate $43.9 million dollar outflow -- that's a 17.5% decrease week over week (from 2,000,000 to 1,650,000).

That doesn't just include the oil wells, the Longhorn cattle, and the plates of barbecue you'll find across the state. You can find Texas-sized investment opportunities, too -- and in more industries than you might expect.Stock market investors don't typically focus on where their companies are headquartered, because in most cases, top stocks do business well beyond their backyard. Yet when you start looking closely at Texas, you'll find a wealth of prosperous companies that either already are or have the potential to become the biggest players in their industry niches.Image source: Getty Images.Below, you'll find seven top stocks headquartered in the Lone Star State that could produce Texas-sized returns over the long haul.Data source: S&P  Intelligence.Let's take a closer look at all seven of these companies to see why they present interesting opportunities for investors.Texas is a great place to eat, and a lot of people visit with the idea of getting a juicy steak or mouthwatering barbecue every day on their trips. But for displaced Texans in other parts of the country, the biggest challenge is finding Mexican food that comes close to satisfying that constant hunger for home. Chuy's is working to solve that problem by taking its unique vision of Tex-Mex food and spreading it across the nation.Chuy's origins date back to 1982, with a single location in the Barton Springs area of Austin south of the Guadalupe River. As the restaurant chain describes it, founders Mike Young and John Zapp envisioned a \"fun and funky Tex-Mex restaurant that served authentic and fresh food in an atmosphere that appealed to everyone.\" It wasn't long before Chuy's was opening new restaurants across Austin and moving out to other cities within Texas. Yet despite the drive for expansion, each Chuy's location had unique charms, avoiding the trap of rote uniformity in which many big chain restaurants find themselves.Image source: Chuy's.Texas was big enough for Chuy's until 2009, when the company decided to make a big expansion push beyond the borders of the Lone Star State. The company opened a Nashville-area location, and from there, the craze began. Chuy's now sports about 100 restaurants spread across 19 states.The Chuy's experience combines quirky, colorful decor and furnishings with fresh food, including tortillas made while you watch. Prices are quite reasonable, and although there's plenty of competition in the restaurant space broadly and in the Mexican and Tex-Mex niche more specifically, Chuy's stands out due to a level of authenticity that other chains simply fail to deliver.Recently, Chuy's has seen some business challenges that have forced it to reconsider the pace of its expansion efforts. Low unemployment across the U.S. has boosted labor costs, which are a large part of the restaurant industry's typical cost structure, and higher expenses for food ingredients have . Yet company management has responded by looking for ways to boost efficiency, choosing to pull back on aggressive plans to grow its store base while still continuing to follow a more modest expansion strategy to extend the Tex-Mex chain's geographical reach further. Chuy's still has work to do to reach its full potential, but there's a lot of opportunity for investors to benefit if the Austin favorite can find the right balance between growth and efficiency and boost its sales and profit at a faster rate.When it comes to purchasing vehicles, most consumers stick with a couple of common ways to find the cars and trucks they want. Those who can afford new vehicles go to traditional dealers, comparing various makes and models with their needs. Those on a more limited budget typically can choose from a variety of different avenues for buying a used car, from looking through classified ads or going to local neighborhood used-car dealers to choosing a company with a nationwide network of locations and cars.Yet underneath the massive auto distribution and retail industry is a completely different source of vehicles with which most consumers aren't nearly as familiar. When vehicles are involved in major accidents, get too old to run, or otherwise fall out of use, they often enter the auto salvage industry. Some vehicles can get fixed up and run again, while others will end up getting used for parts or scrap. Regardless, though, the auto salvage industry is a big business -- and there's a lot of money in the cars and trucks that go through its global network.Copart has become a big player in the salvage business, and with its move to Dallas in the early 2010s, the company has become an important contributor to the Texas economy. Copart's contribution to the salvage industry has been its revolutionary software platform, on which it holds online auctions to get rid of its massive inventory of salvage vehicles. With more than 200 salvage facilities in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and eight other countries around the world, there are plenty of opportunities for buyers to find the vehicles they want at the prices they want to pay.Moreover, Copart is constantly growing. Salvage operations are often local and fragmented, but Copart has consistently bought up smaller operations in order to boost its market share. Even though the company still has plenty of competition, Copart has built itself into a leader of the industry, and it's done so while maintaining the fiscal discipline of not overpaying for the businesses it brings under its fold.Recently, , and that has investors newly excited about the company's prospects. Even though it suffered some disruptions from Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in 2017, the disaster also provided massive levels of inventory for Copart's business. Copart now enjoys a huge network effect from its reputation in the industry as the go-to provider of auctions for salvage vehicles, and that should serve as a barrier for would-be competitors for years to come.\u00a0Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a great way for investors to get both growth and income, as the rules governing their tax-favored corporate structure require REITs to distribute almost all of their net income to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Yet what many investors find surprising about REITs is that they don't all own conventional real estate. Crown Castle International is a great example of this, as it offers a way to cash in on the seemingly endless demand for wireless network infrastructure.Crown Castle is the largest provider of telecommunications infrastructure in the U.S., boasting more than 40,000 towers helping wireless carriers provide cellular coverage. At the same time, Crown Castle also has different types of telecom assets, including about 65,000 lower-powered small-cell nodes and 70,000 miles of fiber to provide data connections, cloud-computing services, and other applications requiring large amounts of bandwidth. Many of the largest national and regional wireless carriers rely on Crown Castle's assets, as do a substantial number of clients in the technology, energy, utility, and educational sectors.Image source: Getty Images.The fact that Crown Castle already has such an extensive network of telecom infrastructure assets is itself a barrier to entry against potential rivals. Local communities often oppose the construction of new cell towers, and while that imposes some limitations on the amount of growth that Crown Castle can achieve, the chilling effect it has on would-be competitors is a huge benefit. Moreover, as small-cell nodes get more popular, the company should be able to capitalize on its expertise in that arena, offering them as an alternative to help carriers implement their 5G upgrade plans.At this point,  from companies looking to bolster their 4G capacity, and that's been a big boon to the REIT's organic growth. Despite the extensive amount of depreciation and amortization that its assets produce, Crown Castle has seen solid earnings gains, and favorable performance in its preferred funds from operations metric shows just how lucrative concentrating on the U.S. telecom market has been.Crown Castle counts income investors among its fans, as its dividend yield has typically stayed in the 3% to 4% range over the long haul -- well above the average for the overall stock market. High yields can signal a lack of growth opportunities, but the coming rollout of 5G and the increasing importance of wireless communications and high-bandwidth demand should combine to provide the Dallas-headquartered REIT with plenty of expansion opportunities. All told, Crown Castle gives investors the best of both worlds, and it's in a good position to keep delivering solid returns for shareholders.Some Texans will be surprised to see only one energy company make this list of seven top stocks. That's a reasonable criticism, given the importance that oil and gas exploration and production has within the Lone Star State. Yet from an investment standpoint, the turbulent price movements that natural gas and crude oil have seen in recent years highlight the risks that come with the potential rewards in the oil patch.One thing that's certain, though, is that oil and gas production in Texas will continue, and the companies that produce it will need a way to get those products to market. That takes energy infrastructure, and midstream leader Enterprise Products Partners has a huge portfolio of assets to help its clients make the most of the oil and gas they produce.Enterprise has an impressive combination of different midstream energy assets. The company boasts more than 49,000 miles of pipeline delivering natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined products, and petrochemicals. The master limited partnership is also a leader in the energy product storage industry, with its salt dome assets giving it a capacity of 260 million barrels of natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude oil storage. Enterprise can also store as much as 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas.Some energy products require further processing, and Enterprise has the capability to do that as well. The company has 26 different natural gas processing plants, and it has 23 fractionators for natural gas liquids and propylene production.Finally, as rich finds in Texas and elsewhere have boosted production, the U.S. has become an important energy exporter, and Enterprise has several terminals to facilitate international trade. With locations in the Houston Ship Channel, as well as in Beaumont, Freeport, Morgan's Point, and Texas City, Enterprise has a dozen and a half deepwater ship docks for loading various energy products.All those assets are  in a major way. Even as energy prices have been turbulent, the MLP posted record financial results. As new pipelines have gone into service, they've provided an immediate boost to revenue and earnings. Aggressive capital spending has the company foreseeing further growth into the foreseeable future, yet Enterprise has also been able to increase its dividend distributions consistently. Even though there's already been a big upsurge in activity in key energy-producing areas like the Permian Basin, Enterprise expects that further production increases among its clients will bring additional demand for its energy infrastructure assets, justifying the investments that the pipeline giant has made and making it into an even bigger player in the Texas energy industry.Howard Hughes was a Texas native, born in the Houston suburb of Humble. After attending Rice University, Hughes became a key figure in two very different but equally glamorous industries: Hollywood and aviation. Yet along the way, Hughes also made key investments in real estate that eventually became the heart of the corporation that bears his name. In particular, his holdings in the community of Summerlin near Las Vegas helped Hughes make a name for himself in the real estate field.Yet Howard Hughes Corp. now has deep roots in Texas. The company, which was spun off from in 2010, has long held a large property interest in the area north of Houston that became The Woodlands. Now, Howard Hughes also has developments in the Houston-area city of Cypress as well as two developments in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Overall, the real estate company has 16 properties spanning from Hawaii to New York City.Image source: Howard Hughes. is different from many developers. The company focuses on large-scale planned communities that integrate commercial and residential space along with the amenities that people expect from modern developments. By building an ongoing relationship with an area, Howard Hughes becomes invested in the success of the entire community, and it works alongside residential homebuilders to ensure a good mix of different types of housing to support all of its properties.In addition, unlike many capital-poor real estate developers that work on single properties at a time, Howard Hughes has a large inventory of unimproved vacant land. That gives the company a vested interest in continuing to foster growth in those areas, and it ensures that it can continue to profit far into the future rather than having to acquire additional real estate later on when the growth prospects associated with a particular community are much more obvious.The biggest uncertainty with Howard Hughes right now is what path it will take strategically. CEO David Weinreb has been frustrated with the market's failure to recognize what he believes is the company's true value, and Howard Hughes recently announced that it would look at strategic alternatives in an effort to get investors to acknowledge the overall potential of the business. That announcement had the intended effect, making shareholders excited about the possibility that  at a price that's well above where the stock has traded historically. The quality of the real estate developer's assets makes that a definite possibility. Yet long-term investors might prefer it if Howard Hughes does something short of an outright sale, such as spinning off a portion of its assets into a separate entity. That way, investors might well get an opportunity to keep prospering from the company's successful business model.Matchmaking is big business, and the rise of the internet has had a huge impact on the way people meet. Match Group is the company behind popular dating and relationship websites and apps like Match.com, Tinder, and OkCupid, and it's become a key player in the budding industry across the globe.Match Group makes money in two primary ways. First, it sells display ads, allowing it to offer some free services to users. Match also seeks to get money through tiered subscriptions and various additional functions and features that enhance the user experience beyond what free versions offer.The network effect that Match has developed is its biggest asset. The company recently counted about 8.6 million subscribers, up by more than a million over just the past year. Yet Match recognizes that users can be fickle, and it's careful to keep giving its customers more of the features they want while not trying to push change at such a fast pace that it spooks those who use its services the most. That's prompted moves like the creation of Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold, which give Tinder users more flexibility to make more swipes to indicate interest. Promotion of one's own dating profile and the ability to undo past decisions are also part of the package that draws interest from users willing to pay up for the service.Even though Match has made a big splash in the U.S. market, there's plenty of potential for it to  elsewhere. Services like Meetic in Europe and Pairs in Japan and other parts of Asia have given Match more of an international scope, and growth rates in overseas revenue have outpaced Match's domestic gains as that part of the business starts to gain momentum. Match now enjoys about a 50-50 split between subscribers in North America and elsewhere.Some fear that the days of high growth for , especially as market penetration among interested users rises to encompass more of the potential addressable market. For now, though, Match still has a substantial amount of runway left for growth, especially when you consider the parts of the world that have yet to discover the full value of dating services. For the Dallas-based dating giant, becoming a household name across the globe could vault Match's share price still higher in the years to come.Few companies can say that they owe their existence to the size of their home state. For Southwest Airlines, though, Texas gave it the opportunity it needed to challenge and eventually surpass the huge national air carriers that dominated early air travel.Prior to the deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s, the federal government imposed extensive control over which airlines could operate in serving certain routes between cities, as well as how much they were able to charge. However, those federal guidelines only applied to airlines that served cities outside of a given state. Founder Herb Kelleher therefore set up Southwest to operate only within the borders of Texas, with a regular route structure that connected Love Field in Dallas with airports in Houston and San Antonio. Despite legal challenges, Southwest's ability to undercut national carriers subject to regulation was upheld.Image source: Southwest Airlines.Once federal regulation ended, Southwest quickly expanded its low-cost, no-frills service to neighboring states. The airline has always done things a bit differently, with features like first-come, first-serve open seating in its aircraft. Rather than a pure hub-and-spoke route map, Southwest more than most airlines has hung onto a point-to-point emphasis that sometimes includes additional stops for passengers.Southwest's attention to customer service is one of its most popular features. The airline's decision not to impose the baggage fees that nearly all of its competitors now force passengers to pay even on a single bag make it stand out from the crowd, demonstrating the value it puts on its customers. Being smart about expenses is a key way the company can afford such measures. Even the original color of Southwest's planes stemmed from which paint colors came at the lowest cost, and even now, the airline's cost-conscious business model has been an important part of what's made it so successful over time.Now, Southwest serves 100 cities across the U.S. and in close international markets, including Mexico, Central America, and several Caribbean destinations. One of its most influential moves lately has been its expansion of service to Hawaii, making a challenge on another set of popular routes., many of which are tied to its early adoption of the 737 MAX aircraft, which got grounded in early 2019 following two major crash incidents. The immediate result was reduced capacity and weaker financial performance as Southwest struggled to deal with the gaps in service that resulted from not having its 737 MAX planes available. In the long run, though, investors are confident that the airline giant will keep following the strategic flight plan that has helped it become such a huge player in the industry over the past half-century.It might seem like sticking with a particular state would leave you overexposed to the local economy, and that might be the case if the only stocks you chose to buy were associated with the Lone Star State's famous energy industry.

Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter  for Copart. Before I start, I will turn it over to Jeff Liaw for opening remarks and then I'll give you some commentary, turn it back to Jeff for an update and then we'll open it up for Q&A. With that let me turn over to Jeff. -- Perfect. Thanks, Jay. I'll start with our Safe Harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted common share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of the impact of income taxes on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, net of deferred tax charges, certain discrete income tax items, disposals of non-operating assets, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition related fees and integration charges, reserves for legacy sales tax liabilities, foreign currency related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday.We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time-to-time on our behalf. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC.Now, I'll turn our attention to the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 for Copart. We are pleased with our results in booking a record fourth quarter in revenue, gross profit and operating income. Our global worldwide revenue grew 20.8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter despite unfavorable currency effects of $3.9 million or thereabouts from foreign operations, primarily due to strength in the US dollar versus the pound. Our US revenue grew at 21%, international revenue grew at 20%. Global service revenue and purchased car revenue were similar for the quarter with global service revenue growing at 20.1% and purchased car revenue growing at 25.4%, slightly outpacing service revenue.On unit sales, we grew worldwide 7.1% year-over-year with US unit growth of 7.3% and international unit growth [Technical Issues] United States our growth is driven both by our insurance customers as well as our non-insurance customers. On the matter of organic growth within the insurance world, we believe the long-term trends in favor of rising total loss frequency continues. Repairing vehicles is becoming relatively less attractive with repair costs rising from vehicle complexity and labor inflation, while at the same time totaling vehicles is becoming relatively more attractive with more buyers for these damaged cars and rising selling prices as a result [Indecipherable] few minutes. We also continue to grow our non-insurance business as well.Non-insurance volume represents north of 24% of our total US volume sold. In that non-insurance segments, we generally include franchise and independent auto dealers, finance and leasing companies, fleets, charities, equipment dealers and wholesalers. We attribute growth in non-insurance to our increased marketing, sales and operational focus and of course our auction liquidity and returns most of all. We grew global inventory for the quarter at 18.4%, with US inventory growing 19.8% and international inventory growing 9.8%. Inventory growth was driven by factors, similar to the ones that I described a moment ago for units trends. We grew gross profit from $188.4 million to $242.6 million or approximately 29% increase year-over-year. Our gross margin rate increased from 41.9% to 44.7%, an increase of 280 basis points. This is partially attributable to lapping elevated depreciation from a year ago and also partially attributable to rising average selling prices for our vehicles. International gross margins declined slightly from 28.9% to 25.5%, largely attributable to purchased car activity in Germany.I'll turn now to average selling prices within the United States for Copart auctions, which rose 8.1% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. This has been a continuation of a trend now for years, a reflection in our business of more bidders -- more international bidders and therefore improved auction liquidity as well as increasing mix of newer less damaged cars. International bidding and buying activity are in turn the reflection of our proactive marketing efforts as well as the effectiveness of our all digital auction platform VB3. The outcome is have more bids per unit and therefore superior selling prices for our customers as well. And in fact our ASPs continue to outpace meaningfully the various used car indices, such as the Manheim Used Car Price Index. As you know, rising ASPs of course then cycles back to our unit growth drivers as well with repair cost rising, but the proceeds for total loss units increasing at the same time, the total loss path becomes relatively more compelling economically.I'll turn now to our general and administrative expenditures, ex-stock comp and depreciation, G&A is down from $42.8 million a year ago to $39.8 million for the quarter. As we say almost every quarter, our G&A expenditures will fluctuate and they will generally grow over time, but we continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage, given the top line growth we've experienced. As with all trended data in our business gross margins, G&A unit sales inventory changes etc., we encourage you to review longer-dated trend lines rather than single quarter metrics for a more accurate view of the business.Our GAAP operating income grew from $134.8 million to $192.8, or 43% year-over-year. This is despite currency effect of a negative $1.1 million in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018. Well note again that in operating income this increase reflects in part the elevated depreciation levels from a year ago. Our net interest expense was nearly flat, up from $4 million to $4.3 million, primarily due to less interest income from lower cash balances at year-end, the product in parts of our share buybacks over the course of the year. Other expense of $1.5 million was largely attributable to non-recurring losses from our share of an equity method investment.Then on taxes, our fourth quarter income tax rate of 17.9% is a reflection of a lower US federal tax rate. As we've discussed on prior calls of 21% or thereabouts, as well as onetime benefits from stock option exercises and discrete income tax items. The onetime benefit from those stock option exercises has been reflected in our non-GAAP reconciliation, which is included in our earnings release. GAAP net income then increased from $109.7 million a year ago in the fourth quarter to $153.5 million this year or an increase of approximately 40%. Our non-GAAP net income increased from [Indecipherable] or growth of 39% is again adjusted for certain excess tax deductions for stock option exercises and related payroll taxes, as well as certain legacy sales tax liability reserves. Finally, on the balance sheet and cash flow, before I turn it back to Jay. We finished the quarter with $186.3 million in cash on our books and a little north of $200 million in net debt. We generated operating cash flow for the quarter of $193 million with capex of $114.5 million, more than 90% of which was attributable to capacity expansion and lease buyouts. We continue our efforts to invest in land, to purchase and develop lands to meet both current and prospective demand for our services.With that, I'll turn it back to Jay. -- Thank you, Jeff. Good morning again. In this quarter, not only is the fourth quarter for fiscal 2019, but it is the last quarter of the decade and a quarter that is a milestone being 25 years since we went public. Copart went public on March 17, 1994 and I literally remember it like yesterday going into New York City for the first time. We criss-crossed back and forth bidding with investors, pitching Copart and two weeks later we were in the World Trade Center building, must have been up about 104. I know it was the highest I've ever been in the building, and I know it was the highest I'd ever felt in my life is a pretty incredible time. And they were yelling Copart on the floor, people were screaming the name out and screening a lot of other things that you wouldn't do today, times have changed a lot, but it was one of the most memorable and emotional experiences I ever had in my life.We were set. That's how I look at it. Copart now is public. We paid off our debt. We have currency to go buy companies and we IPO'ed that day at $0.50 a share. We closed that day up about 15% based on my memory, which was quite a pop in the stock. So it's quite a bit of demand for the Company. And we closed the year 25 years ago, yes, I had to look it up, because that's one thing I don't remember. We closed the year with revenues of $22.8 million as a Company and operating income for the year of $4.1 million. And we set off and we grew and we've bought companies and we've built a network and in 1996 we reserve this thing called copart.com and we weren't really sure what the Internet was, but we thought it was pretty cool.And we, from that point on, really focused on all the things we can do at Copart and Copart.com. In 1998, we launched Internet bidding. It was the first of its kind. Willis and I were in San Francisco at an auction called Butterfield and Butterfield, and we saw people sitting at a desk on the phone, raising their hand and bidding against the live auction there. And we had seen that in our business with contract buyers, but in this case, these people were on the phone with the actual end buyer's and that's really where the idea came from and we thought why couldn't we allow people to submit bids over the Internet and then we will wrap those bids at auction. It hadn't been done in the whole car world, it hadn't been done in the salvage world. It was a brand new concept.We rolled it out in August of 1998 and from March of 1994 to August of '98, the stock has tripled and we are pretty proud of our success in terms of what the Company has done in terms of growth and in terms of what we've seen in our stock price, but we really wanted to innovate. We wanted to change the way the cars were sold. In those days, it was 100% live auction. And so now we are introducing this Internet experience, but you really had to physically be at the auction to see the car and then submit the bid online. So in 1999, we started putting images online and that was another first for the industry and we've chose five. I'd like to tell you there was some kind of thought process behind it, but there is four corners on the car and an interior shot and that was it. So we put five images of every vehicle online and continued thinking about ways to improve the experience for our customers.By 2003 and clearly, we were ahead of our time in terms of really pushing toward a digital platform and toward an online platform. But by 2003, we rolled out and tested our virtual bidding technology and it was June 23, 2003 in Bakersfield, California. We chose Bakersfield because it was a smallest store [Phonetic] we had in the Company and we're going to test it, but test it in a small environment and see how it does or said it out, and what we saw in that sale is the strongest returns out of the whole year, it's a biweekly auction. So it's probably about 12 or 13 auctions so far that year and it was the highest return, we've ever seen as a Company in that location.So we had to roll another sight, we chose Syracuse, New York because it's on the other side of the country, because it was also small site and it was a completely different experience and we saw the exact same results. Within six months Copart would roll the whole Company to virtual bidding technology to VB2. It was our second generation of virtual bidding technology, hence the name. And from there we would see returns just continue to increase and they would increase -- and they would increase all the way to 2008. And anybody who lived through 2008 in the business world knows what happened next. And so after the financial crisis, Copart had a decision. What do we want to do and we chose to double down. We double down on our expansions going international, expanding into the UK and eventually Germany and Spain and Brazil and the Middle East, Canada and another -- a number of other locations that we went into or that we opened up internationally.And then we also doubled down on our marketing efforts and this was really the first time the Copart had taken an aggressive marketing stance. We started with NASCAR, with NHRA and with television SPEED Channel and ESPN2 and a number of other methods. That would evolve from that point on into a massive social media platform that we dominate today, whether it's Twitter, Facebook, YouTube. There are a number of channels where people have over 1 million followers and they talk about nothing, but Copart on their channel, buying cars, fixing cars and how they love to do business and to work with Copart, buying cars at Copart and bill [Phonetic] cars we sell them. While this was happening, technology started to go into cars at a rapid rate. The interesting thing about 2019 is today, you can buy Kia that has everything from lane assist, adaptive cruise, adaptive headlights, every single thing you'd expect on the Mercedes-Benz, except the interesting part is back in 2009 none of those things existed on Mercedes-Benz.So what we saw over the last 10 years is where the top car that you could buy in American had none of that technology and average car in America is standard with that type of technology. We saw that trend starting about five years ago and we kicked off a program called 2020. This allowed us to expand our network, expand our locations and start to get really prepared for the volume that we knew was going to be coming in. Many of you followed the Company for a long time know that we also doubled down by acquiring a bunch of the Company back doing stock repurchases, but to me what's more important is how we operated the business. We focused on the marketing efforts to build ultimate demand for the product we're selling, to have room for all the vehicles through our expansive network of locations.And if you combine those two, you achieve record ASPs, achieve record volumes, achieve -- you achieve record successes. So I'm very excited about what has happened in the last 25 years. How could I not be. For a kid that went to New York City for the first time and looked up, I couldn't believe it. I just could not believe -- couldn't believe what I saw, it was that incredible. I have never been emotional [Speech Overlap], but it was a really, really incredible experience and to be sitting here today and looking at the Company, this has gone from just over $20 billion a year in revenue -- $20 million a year in revenue to a Company that has broke to $2 billion revenue number, it's damn impressive.We have over 7,000 people that make up Copart. They were led by the best people in the world at what they do. The team that we have built over the last 25 years are amazing. That's why we've seen the kind of results we've seen. I've never seen Copart -- in all my years never seen Copart in a better position, in a better opportunity to seize the future. With Will Franklin at my side and Jeff Liaw, as our President and with the rest of the team in the 7,000 people that make up Copart, I'm enormously excited. I can't say that I'm enormously excited about what we're going to do in 2020, but I'm enormously excited about what we're going to do for the next 10 years. I was going to speak first, but Jeff was on a roll. So, I was going to turn it over to our new President. But now, I'll turn it over to questions.So with that Jonathan, if you'd open it up for questions that would be great.[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bob Labick of CJS Securities. -- Good morning of Bob Labick from CJS. First congratulations to Jay to you and to Copart on 25 great years and then congratulations to Jeff and to Will on their new roles as well. -- Thank you Bob. -- Thank you Bob. -- Excited for you guys. So one question I wanted to start with, you've said for several quarters and mentioned it -- I think you mentioned it today Jeff. I'm not 100% sure, what you've been saying it for several quarters that you've been winning share in the US, and I just was hoping you could discuss what's going on? What are you doing differently to gain the share? What are your key selling points with customers and how do you continue to show this strong growth in share gain? -- A good question, Bob. And I think we generally don't comment on individual accounts. But if you look at multiple quarters, multiple years really, I think it becomes self-evident that we have grown faster than the industry overall and the reasons we think are many folds. A handful that I'll describe here, but certainly auction returns, the economic proposition we offer is first and foremost, you heard us both talk about our technology platform, member recruitment equivalent marketing and so forth, which drives superlative auction results, which ultimately drives unit volumes and account wins in our favor. We, as you know from prior calls pride ourselves on security and service as well, both in the ordinary course of business. There are a number of details that I want to drag you through, but when we talk about operational performance with our customers what that means, I think is in many fold experience with Copart and then of course we also take pride in our superior service in catastrophic events as well. So depending on where you are in storm cycles, economic cycles, etc., certainly, different customers have different priorities, but we work day and night to deliver excellent results on all those dimensions. -- Got it. Great. And then on the ASP side you've had obviously terrific results. I was hoping maybe you could break it down a little bit. Is it, both in terms of the insurance ASPs and non-insurance growing, or is it just a mix toward non-insurance? And if it's both are growing within insurance is it like-for-like growth, meaning if you have like a 10-year-old car with 150,000 miles, this year, are you getting a higher ASP than you did a year ago? Just any color on the ASP growth would be great? -- To answer your question technically is difficult because there is no -- it is not like for like right, meaning a 10-year-old car today is not the same as a 10-year-old car a year ago and that's one of the drivers thought change. But, yes what we're describing is not just mix shift from insurance to non-insurance. It is also like for like increases and the selling prices of insurance vehicles. So I think the answer to your question is yes, they are both increases in the 10-year-old car as well as an increasing mix of newer cars within the insurance world as well. -- Got it. Great, thank you. And then last one quickly, I think last quarter we talked about Germany and building out the distribution kind of network within the country before flipping insurance companies. Can you talk about your latest thoughts and hurdles to getting that market to Copart style? -- Certainly, I think we have continued to invest in Germany. We've experienced strong growth in both our traditional listing service business, as well as the Copart style -- Copart model auctions that we're running in Germany. We continue to invest in land member recruitment, seller sales efforts and so forth. So the progress continues there. We continue to believe the economic proposition is compelling [Technical Issues] Bob, where we got into retail, I think the story is still very much holds from there. -- Congratulations again on all of the things we've just discussed and thank you. -- Thanks Bob. -- Thanks Bob.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Craig Kennison of Baird. -- Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And again congratulations on all those fronts. I wanted to ask about hurricane Dorian and in general, you're hurricane preparation this season. What have you done to prepare for Dorian and as that moves up the coast and maybe doesn't track toward Florida, but threatens other states? How has your response evolved? -- Thanks, Craig. Copart started on getting experience. I would say in super storms back in 2005. Sure, we dealt with storms prior to that, but 2005 is really the eye opener. Following that would be Sandy and Harvey. And today, we've got an amazing team that is just dedicated to cat. We got land dedicated to cat and we've got equipment dedicated to cat. So I can get into all the details when we just say that's we're prepared and we're ready across the Eastern seaboard. So whether the the hurricane was going to impact Miami or whether it's going to impact New York, we've got the people, the equipment and the land in place and ready to go to serve our customers. So we're good. -- Good and thank you. And I'm assuming you have no exposure to the Bahamas? -- No, none. -- Okay. And then, Jay, maybe in the spirit of long-term thinking, based on your comments, could you just talk about the sharing economy and what that means for Copart? You've got potentially a major shift in car ownership from individuals to fleets. How do you think that plays out for Copart and was that a big trend? Are you looking toward other big trends as you look at the next quarter century? -- Well, if we go back maybe five-ish years on these earnings calls. I remember, making a comment that I didn't believe autonomous driving was going to be at the level that everybody was predicting back in those days. And in fact, we actually -- as I said on the opening call, we doubled down on our belief and started acquiring quite a bit of Copart stock because, I think it was just a general belief at that time that volumes would shrink over time not increase. The -- I could get into all of the sharing economy and I could sum it up with a bunch of examples and analogies. But there is nothing practical about buying a Mercedes-Benz or a BMW or any luxury car. It's a personal choice.There's nothing practical about living in a large home and most of America today, while could live in a much smaller home, chooses a larger home because it's convenient and that's nice. Cars are the same way. I think your personal and while there will be some sharing involved, just like there is some Uber involved, I think for the most part when it's convenient, it's not always convenient in New York City to own [Phonetic] a car, but what's convenient in most of America to own a car, I think you'll see that. So I'm of the belief putting that aside, that we're going to see increased volume just as an industry regardless of market share wins, the Copart has had, you're going to see increased volume, because the market just going to continue to grow because the trend that's most important is technology, being put into cars, that's not going to stop. People love technology and they love additional technology going in the cars and that will cause cars to be tougher to repair 10 years from now and those vehicles will be more likely to be written off as a total loss and repaired. So I think the trend of volumes going to continue to increase. -- Hey, Craig, I'm just going to jump in and add a little -- a little further, and as you might imagine, we spent a lot of energy tracking technologies changes in behavior, ride sharing and the like, because we do make long-term multiple decades investments in land and technology, etc., to support our business. So we very much need to understand it. And at the risk of being pedantic, I think I'd drag this back to the basic algebra of what drives unit volume for Copart and that is vehicle miles traveled, accident frequency and then total loss frequency and then I ask myself what is ride sharing need for each of them.Ride sharing I think for miles traveled almost certainly will drive up the number of miles on the road today. I've seen consulting studies that indicate that every mile of self-driving is replaced by 2.8 miles of ride sharing miles instead that may be bullish, but the point is that almost certainly we have reduced the friction for driving. It's easier now to drive after a couple of drinks, easier for younger or older people to get in the car as well. Vehicle miles will rise. Accident frequency, I think all else equal, I think it's likely neutral. I don't think that Uber and [Indecipherable] drivers are systematically superior drivers than the rest of us, you may be more bullish on that front than I am.And then lastly, total loss frequency Ride sharing I think I've no effect here. Total loss frequency has been the one way tailwind for the past 50 years in the business. In 1980 total loss frequency was 4% or thereabouts, today it's more than 5% [Indecipherable]. So to me, that is -- those are the individual drivers, the vehicle miles traveled and loss frequency almost certainly will continue to move in our favor, accident frequency, you'll form your own point of view as to how much of the growth in the other two is offset by accident frequency. But in the aggregate, I don't think ride sharing changes the calculus for our business. -- Great well congratulations to everybody. Thank you. -- Thanks Craig.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. -- Hey, good morning guys. -- Hey Bret. -- Good morning. -- And congratulations. Jeff. The question on scrap rate, I do feel that maybe, is there an upper bound on the percentage of crash is that total -- what point the insurance companies no longer see the benefit of totaling, even if the repair cost is higher? I think we're at the high-teens now and is there a number you see that getting to in the next three to five years? -- Hey, Bret in short, no. I think you mixed a few things in there that I will try to piece apart. One, you made a comment about scrap rates, which are clearly lower and more than 20% down year-over-year. We used to have that in our script every quarter. We literally didn't even include this year. So I think it's increasingly irrelevant for our business. Our cars as you know, some are sold for parts, many are sold to be rebuilt and repaired, many go overseas for both purposes and therefore the actual metal content in the car is less and less relevant for our fundamental business. -- Yes Jeff, my second question. I should have said total rates as opposed to scrap, that option to the total car as opposed to repair? -- I think in a vacuum that question may be reasonable, which is to say, what if -- in other words, if I were to say to you hypothetically what if total crash cars -- total loss cars were to multiply by 5-fold. Will you get to the point where it doesn't make any economic sense to total anymore. All else equal, I think the answer might have been, yes. But if I told you, total loss vehicles can grow by 5-fold, while selling prices for those total cars keep rising and substantially so, then I think the problem is solved, right. If there were a finite demand, a fixed demand for that supply of vehicles I think the answer is yes. I think we have proven especially over the past three years that demand is very much not finite. With that global buyer base for rest of US and UK and Canadian cars etc., is robust and growing. -- Okay, great. And then a follow-up on the land of purchase. You commented in the prepared remarks and then you also commented in Germany. Could you talk about what your acreage add in '19 was and maybe what you see acreage expectations for '20 or maybe I'm sort of on a average go-forward basis? -- We generally don't provide that Brett and for a multitude of reasons including that the gross number of acres is actually not all that informative, but -- because the land is not fungible. So what you have in Florida is not relevant to what you have in Texas and California and so forth. So we don't provide that level of details, I think it's almost misleading in it's precision. But I think the punch line is, we invested very meaningfully in land in fiscal 2019. We don't see that trend abating anytime soon. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. -- Yeah. Hey, good morning guys. I add my congratulations to the list and thanks for taking my questions. What is there on the non-insurance business? I know you've talked about this in recent quarters, but your language seems to be getting more positive. And Jeff, I think you mentioned it was up to 24% of volume. Could you talk about or update us on your strategic approach to the business? I mean do you foresee that becoming a much larger portion of your volume going forward? And on the margin, where are you winning these units from? Where are they going today that you're taking the units? Thanks. -- Thanks for your question, Dan. In short, I think I get that question a fair bit when I'm on the road as to whether, it will grow as a mix of our overall business. And I think what I'd tell you fundamentally, that's not really how we think about running the business. We want to grow our insurance business and we want to grow our non-insurance dealer business, equipment dealers, wholesalers that the entire universe of customers we want to grow. So whether one [Technical Issues] even a given year or 5-year period is quote outgrowing the other is less relevant to us and the fact that we want to continue to pursue and grow our business there.I think you heard me briefly allude to the economic proposition and the value proposition, we offer these sellers in the non-insurance universe. I think again, first and foremost is a massive liquid digital auction platform that will yield full and fair values to them, that hard stuff is the most important thing by far. Beyond that of course is the service and the sales force and the marketing efforts that we have under way to pursue and win those customers. I think we win that business from a multitude of different places. From the dealer world, some of those folks may well floor and sell the cars directly themselves and [Technical Issues] look to the large whole care option, others look to newer, modern digital apps C2C, B2C, B2B and otherwise, to which to dispose the vehicles. So there is no doubt, it's a competitive universe. I think our growth in the past few years is a reflection of our success in our, both our marketing efforts, but ultimately the auction platform itself and the price that yield. -- That's really helpful, thanks. And then touching on the you mentioned I think during your remarks, I think the inventory was up over 18% than the quarter, that's much higher than last quarter and kind of less view. I know that it can move quarter-to-quarter due to timing, but did we see anything accelerate during the quarter that led to such a strong inventory build or was that just a timing issue or a comparison issue that led to that big number? -- I think the inventory growth, as you know from having followed us for a while is the best, but also still imperfect indicator of unit volume for the next quarter or two or three, is certainly is an indication of strong growth in the business and that's how I would interpret it. I would again reiterate that in looking at any of these measures, we look at multiple quarters at a time, not an individual data point that's literally one day July 31, 2019 versus July 31 2018. But nonetheless, that growth rate is not accidental, it is a reflection of both growing market volumes, account wins and growth in our business. -- Perfect. And then last one for me. Just touching on international growth. I think you guys mentioned it was about 6% on the unit side, again, I know it can be noisy quarter, but it is a step down from, call it four quarters in a row of double-digit growth. Is there anything that changed there? Any market there -- any -- did any specific markets weaken or soften through the quarter? Thanks. -- There is no -- no particular sustained to change that -- is reflected in that number. So I'll be internally consistent and tell you in both directions that a single quarter indicator is not the best and most reliable indicator for the business. -- Perfect. Thanks so much best of luck guys. -- Thanks Dan.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just curious if you've thought about entering the portion of the dealer-to-dealer whole car market that is not physical, but entirely software related. So for example, similar to KAR Auction Services, TradeRev business or ACV Auctions. Well, I think whole car has not been a strong focus for you. I know you're technology platform is highly regarded in the industry and just wondering if maybe there is a way to leverage that an asset light way and then perhaps more generally, following on the earlier question you know if you could elaborate on which parts of the non-insurance market do you consider to be in your addressable market? -- Got it. First on the all digital question, I think for us we're always exploring ways to better serve our sellers and buyers and that's certainly one of the paths that we consider and evaluate on an ongoing basis. I think I would note, there are folks who are investing very heavily quite literally losing money and spending cash in on those pathways. While we continue to generate very positive returns on our auction platform. So the overall value proposition for Copart against the backdrop of -- in some cases venture-backed businesses and so forth, continues to grow very well, meaningfully faster than the used car market overall.So I think it's a reflection, at least in part that the Copart auction platform is succeeding in that world as it is, to your second question about the addressable universe. I don't know that we'd exclude anyone. I think there are folks who are more target rich than others, but these are leasing companies, fleets, dealers, independent franchise. So I think anyone with the vehicle to sell, we consider fair game for Copart. -- Okay, great, that's very helpful, thanks. And then just my last question, I was curious if you thought that there might be any change to the competitive environment now that your primary competitor in the US, IAA is stand-alone business. There has been some speculation that they might wish to more closely emulate Copart strategy. I don't know with regard to investing in different areas, including internationally. Just curious if you have any thoughts on that? -- I think almost certainly a better question for them. -- Got it. Okay, thank you very much. -- Thank you. [Technical Issues]Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Jay, I don't think I've ever heard a more cash in earnings call. Is this mostly from hitting the milestones and some of the significant promotions that were up last night or is there something the business is [Indecipherable] of inflictive, but as you very impassioned is frankly looking at the fundamentals, this is the best insurance unit volume that we've seen in quite some time in exit rate, in terms of inventory growth. I was just curious like what's behind this enthusiasm? Thank you. -- We're doing very well right now. There is no question about that. But I felt I should at least tell some of the story of the last 25 years and I promise, not to -- to get the [Indecipherable] as the woman on coffee talk does. But when I look back in my head and think about going to New York for the first time, seeing the process and how you take the company public and watching Willis gives his feel to the investment community 10 times a day for two weeks and then to hear that Copart being yelled and screamed and sworn across the floor. I thought it was just a story that had to be told. It's something we talk about sometimes internally, but I think the investment community may not really appreciate the humble beginnings of this Company and what this Company has achieved and the people that make up this Company and how incredible they are.So it's just that -- yeah, we're doing well right now, but it's just that, I try not to get emotional sometimes, but it happens and in that case it happened. I guess may be reflecting back in my mind, Willis having a conversation with Willy Weinstein [Phonetic] and us getting ready to open up on the floor, the next thing you know they're screening Copart and there is a bottle of champagne and everybody's taking a sip at 10 o'clock in the morning or 9 o'clock in the morning, whenever the hell the Street opens up, but you know that just -- that was just such a great memory and so it's a once in a lifetime I think. And Copart over the years was viewed as -- Oh, Jezz, you guys have tripled the stock now. Oh, Jezz, you guys have have six times the stock now. And I don't know what the stock is trading at today, but at $0.50 a share, if it's [Indecipherable] bucks we've 160 times the stock and the future for me has never been brighter.I've never seen the market share gains that we are seeing right now and in the history of the Company, I've never seen the kind of volume that's coming in from a market share win and I've never seen the kind of organic growth because of the technology and cars and I've never seen us operate at such a high level in terms of delivering on the service. So that's it in the nutshell. -- No, that's awesome, that's really helpful. And then I wanted to ask maybe bigger picture, long-term question. Do you think like some of this accident avoidance technology fears over blown for your industry, specifically at least near term anyway. Like I wonder if -- like the accident frequency is more prone to low-speed accidents so what's actually left that is in accident is more likely to be totaled, have you looked at that at all in terms of figuring out like that impact it has had? -- Let me make this two parts. Let me turn it over to Jeff after I make this comment. This will give you a -- I think a more precise response or answer to it. Will Franklin [Phonetic] coined the term risk homeostasis. And I think it makes a lot of sense and that is that if you've got auto breaking or you've got adaptive cruise or you've got lane assist and or the car literally drives itself down the road, keeping in the lane, you just got to keep your hands on the wheel, I think those are technologies that allow you to take more risk. Hence the term risk homeostasis. I think it causes people to be distracted more and in some ways, makes the car no more safe.I would as a recipient of damaged cars, I would like to see people drive safely and that at the end of the day is most important, but when you have technology on cars that allow you to be less engaged, people don't multitask well. You're either good at driving the car on you're good at not driving the car and being a passenger. But to drive the car and not fully focus on the car in front of you, the car that's in the line next year because you've got technology to this issue. I don't think it's the best idea. For me personally, I shuttle that stuff off in my cars. I go and hit all the buttons. I don't have any of that stuff working when I drive. I don't want to trying to keep me in my lane, I don't want any of that. On the flip side, when the car does get in a wreck, all that technology has to replaced, that raise the cost of repair, increases total losses. So that's my take. I'll turn to Jeff. -- Chris, what I was going to add is that I think it can be true. I think, which you're alluding to is not simply the one metric measure of accident frequency, but also potentially reduce the severity as well. And I think the answer to that is yes. You could see less physical severity in an accident, so to speak. But I think by the way, if you went back and looked, so if you go back in 10-year increments and take a picture of a borderline salvaged car, total loss car, that car has changed a lot in the last 50 years. 50 years ago, the car with obliterated. It was hammered barely recognizable the vehicle. Today a car that is mildly hit from the rear or the front, can easily be totaled by virtue of the technology you just described. Accident detection and avoidance systems are effectively high value, no generic available sensors on the perimeter of a car. There is a lane departure sensors in the mirrors, the cameras and and [Indecipherable] in the front and rear bumpers, those are technologies that are expensive to repair, literally for the parts themselves as well as the skill required to install and calibrate them. So while the physical severity may decrease. I think the economic severity is unlikely to be. The cost of repair, we don't think it is going down anytime soon. And I think there is decades worth of evidence to suggest that's true. -- Got you. So, that's really helpful. And thanks for the type of thoughts. -- Thank you.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Derek Glynn of Consumer Edge Research. -- Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on ASPs, up 8% in the US, still a strong number, but also decelerating from prior quarters. Are there any cause or factors in particular that is causing that rate of change to be a little bit lower than prior periods? -- No, not particularly. I think that ASP number is meaningfully is still growing meaningfully more than the used car market in general, meaningfully more than the ACV, or the pre-accident value, so to speak of the cars that are being consigned through us. So I don't think it's a reflection of any particular change. -- Okay. I understood. And then, Jay, you talked a lot about the marketing efforts of the Company historically. Just curious how you see that marketing program and message unfolding or evolving in the future, particularly as you expand further into international markets? -- Well, let me start with this. For 16 years, we've had data that nobody else in the industry has because every single bid goes through the Internet. We've got every single high bid, every single second high bid, what we call a push bid, every single bid on that vehicle. So we can see that what customers are looking for, it's analogous to Amazon. If you are looking at an iPhone or iPods or something of that nature on the site and you don't buy it, they know, you were looking, they know you're interested. They know that you may actually want cords [Phonetic] some other features. So we have the same ability because they look at every single vehicle and bid online, it allows us to tailor the technology toward pushing vehicles to them. In the old days, we used to say buyer comes to the yard and looks at the car and has to find it. We put it online, buyers can go online and find it, but we've taken down the travel friction.But we haven't taken down the friction of finding and now we find it for you. So if you're online, we're going to very quickly be able to tailor the types of vehicles that you're looking for and what you want. So that's one massive component. The other component I talked about already as a social media piece, we've really been able to create a buzz around the amazing product and the technology the Copart has. And so that when you think about -- you put both of those together, it allows you to create an enormous demand for the cars like Will -- like Jeff said, we're not thinking about scrap prices today, that vehicles are much different and the demand on the vehicles is much different than it was 10 years ago. So it's really change that -- from that standpoint. Then when we think internationally, these trends are happening in Germany, in the UK and other big markets that we're active in. And so we're leveraging knowledge across multiple markets, which is a wonderful thing, and different maybe then Walmart is in the US and Walmart has ASDA in the UK.I don't know if someone who buys at ASDA in the UK is going to buy something in the US. With Copart there is a cross-pollination of buyer base, where buyers that are looking at product in the UK may go online and find that Harley, they were looking for in the US and then -- and then bid on it. So there is a fair amount of that that exists across the -- I give that example, but there's a fair amount of that it exist across Polish buyers buying in the UK, become aware of Copart, start to bid in the US that kind of thing. So it's -- that's why you see so much focus from Jeff on talking about international bidding and the rest, because it's a very different game than it was 10 years ago when scrap prices mattered. -- Got all the commentary. -- All right, thank you.Thank you. At this time there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jay Adair for closing remarks. -- Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. I appreciate everybody for coming to the call. We look forward to reporting on Q1, and we'll talk to you then. Thanks so much.

Beyond Meat has now more than quintupled for the lucky investors who got in on last month's debutante at its $25 IPO price.

The stock has gone on to roughly triple since its initial pop. The stock's thin float and the escalating number of shorts keep squeezing the shares higher.Beyond Meat does trade at a sky-high valuation. It's fetching more than 80 times trailing revenue, and it's still not profitable. The bullish counterargument is that you don't find too many food companies checking in with the kind of growth that Beyond Meat is generating as its product expands into more grocery stores and restaurants looking to add plant-based entrees to their menus.

That increase was an improvement from the 5% sales jump in the  and the 10% increase in the  of this year.The company also reported impressive net income of $553.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of 51.3% year over year.Data source: .Image source: Getty Images.Copart's strong sales growth in the third quarter is a welcome change. The company had experienced a slowdown of its revenue growth over the past several quarters, and the third-quarter jump not only reversed that trend but also helped Copart achieve its highest revenue in at least the past two years.Copart's increase in revenue is attributable to both an increase in the company's service revenue and vehicle sales in the quarter. Service sales jumped 15% year over year to $473.7 million, and vehicle sales popped 18% to $79.4 million.Copart's management considers the company's service revenue (which is sales it collects from both vehicle sellers and buyers) the most \"accurate indicator\" of its underlying business. It accounts for about 86% of total sales, so it was good to see this revenue segment increase by 15% in the quarter.Aside from increasing sales, Copart's operating income also jumped by 32% in the quarter to $207.5 million, and the company's gross profit increased by 15% to $251.6 million.Copart's management mentioned in the third-quarter press release that the company's operating results are still being adversely affected by \"abnormal costs\" related to the impact of Hurricane Harvey. The hurricane has caused increases in spending for storage facilities, equipment rentals, increased overtime labor costs, and the like for the company that totaled $7.4 million in the quarter.Copart's share price has popped about 5% following the company's third-quarter results, which isn't all that surprising considering the company's strong sales and earnings growth.The company's share price has been steadily increasing since the beginning of this year after taking a steep dive toward the end of 2018. Copart's share price climb this year has resulted in a 30% gain over the past 12 months, compared to the 's increase of just 3.5%.Copart's management doesn't issue any forward guidance, but investors should be pleased with the fact that the company's sales are moving in the right direction again. Investors should continue to keep a close eye on sales to see if the current reversal of slowing revenue growth is indicative of a new trend or if it's a momentary blip.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the October put at the $65 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.50.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.4% return against the $65 commitment, or a 11.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to CPRT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $65 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Copart Inc sees its shares fall 1.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $61.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.50 from $65), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 11.2% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, and highlighting in green where the $65 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the October put at the $65 strike for the 11.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Copart Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $66.24) to be 30%.

Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thanks so much. Good morning everyone and welcome to the third quarter conference call for Copart. In the room today is Will Franklin, Executive Vice President and Jeff Liaw, Chief Financial Officer. We are calling from a hotel, so hopefully you can hear us OK, I know it's a little echoey.We just finished a great week at our annual Advisory Board. This is a chance for us to invite our Canadian customers, our US customers and exchange ideas and information about the industry and items that Copart is working on, technology and process that we're working on. So it's been a great week, and I think we can share some of that with you this morning, some of the facts that we've got are quite fractions, we just completed the conference.So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff Liaw. -- Thanks Jay, I'll start as always with a brief Safe Harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of the impact of income taxes on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, discrete income tax items disposals of non-operating assets, foreign currency related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09.We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above.In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time-to-time on our behalf.For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. I'll provide brief remarks on our financial performance in the third quarter, before turning it over to Will Franklin for additional context.We achieved another record quarter in both in revenue, gross profit and operating income starting with the top line. We experienced global revenue growth of 15.7% despite an unfavorable year-over-year currency effect on revenue of $7.9 million primarily due to the relative strength of the dollar versus the pound and the Brazilian real.Global service revenue grew at 15.3% or $62.9 million year-over-year. Purchased cars grew at a rate of 17.8% driven principally by our increasing activity levels in Germany, but also by underlying growth in our large markets like the US and the UK.Unit sales for the Company grew at 4.5% year-over-year with US units increasing 2.8% and international units rising 13.8% versus the third quarter of 2018. Our US unit growth was driven again by both insurance and non-insurance segments. Will, will describe further the underlying drivers of growth in particular in the non-insurance space. Our global inventory grew 12.2% year-over-year in comparison to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Moving down the P&L, on gross profits, we grew 14.8% from $219 million to $251.6 million. We experienced a slight gross margin rate change from 45.8% to 45.5% or a decrease of approximately 30 basis points. This is again driven in part by a slight mix shift to purchased car volume for the reasons described a moment ago.As we talked about on prior calls as well, we also experienced lower purchased vehicle sales margins on a rate basis, because as the average purchase price in sales price for our purchase vehicles rise, we expect a contraction in percentage margin. Some of the drivers of our mix shift to purchase vehicles, Germany, in particular are higher value on average, and therefore can cause lower percentage margins.Overall, then turning to average selling prices, so this is literally what vehicles at Copart auction sell for, we experienced a year-over-year increase of 10.1%. Will, will also provide more context on the cars, the nature of the cars themselves as well as our efforts to continue to expand Copart's member base.Again, moving down the P&L, our general and administrative expenditures, ex-stock comp and depreciation was down slightly from $34.2 million a year ago to $34.1 million, and up approximately $1 million sequentially versus the second quarter. As we say, in quarters in which G&A rises or declines, generally speaking G&A expenditures will rise over time for Copart as we experienced inflation, but we continue to believe that we can achieve operating leverage, given the top line growth that we have experienced.Our GAAP operating income grew from $174.6 million to $207.5 million or a growth of 18.8% overcoming the currency effect of $1.4 million decline in and of itself year-over-year relative to the third quarter. Our net interest expense was up slightly from $4 million to $5 million given the slightly higher average net debt balance as drew on our revolver late in the second quarter in connection with our Q2 stock repurchases.We repaid the vast majority of our revolver balance during the third quarter nonetheless and ended the quarter with a $70 (ph) million drawn revolver balance.Turning to taxes momentarily, our third quarter income tax rate, GAAP income tax rate of 5.6% is in part a reflection of the lower US federal tax rate that we've discussed on prior calls of 21% for fiscal '19 and beyond. You may recall that fiscal '18 was the straddle period in which we had months that were both pre and post the tax reform -- tax reform bill implemented in -- at the end of calendar 2017.The third quarter income tax rate benefited as well from certain stock option exercises as well as discrete income tax items, related to benefits recognized as a result of amending previously filed income tax returns.The one-time benefits from those stock option exercises and discrete income tax items, you will see reflected in our non-GAAP earnings reconciliation. Our GAAP net income then increased from $127.4 million to $192.7 million or a 51% increase year-over-year.On a non-GAAP net income, we grew from $125.0 million to $154.9 million, growth of 23.9%. As I mentioned a moment ago, this -- these adjustments include excess tax deductions for stock option exercises and related payroll taxes, discrete tax items of $10.2 million that are excluded from our non-GAAP net income.These were again generated by amendments to previously filed income tax returns, we believe that excluding these benefits from our non-GAAP earnings is an appropriate reflection of the underlying performance of the business in the current period as well as our run rate tax burden.The last note, I'll mention on our international businesses, for further background in particular on Germany, we encourage you to review the transcript of our first and second quarter earnings calls, where we describe in much greater detail the nature of the market and our approach to it.We have continued our substantial progress in Germany and are investing in our future growth there as well. We've experienced more than ten-fold increase in volume in Germany year-over-year in the third quarter of '19 in comparison to the third quarter of 2018.We have continued our practice of acquiring vehicles through our listing service and selling them at our Copart Germany auctions. Our experience continues to support our thesis generally that today's listing service model is shortchanging German insurance carriers and policyholders for that matter, and that ultimately a model similar to Copart we know in other developed economies will prevail in Germany as well.We're pleased with our progress on multiple fronts, including the development of technology, our logistics processes, land and the recruitment of high quality talent to support our operations there. Leveraging the power of Copart internationally, our German auctions have seen very strong participation, particularly with buyers outside of Germany.Excluding Germany, our international or non-US businesses continue to perform well, despite currency translation headwinds. Those headwinds of course are most pronounced in our British and Brazilian businesses.Will Franklin will provide additional color on the underlying performance here. Collectively, excluding Germany, our international businesses have experienced year-over-year unit growth, revenue growth, profit growth and the like.Then to the balance sheet before I turn it to Will. Cash flow for the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $238.3 million with CapEx of $122.6 million. Well over 90% of this CapEx was attributable to capacity expansion and lease buyouts, a continuation of a theme that you've heard for several years.We also repaid $86 million of our revolving debt facility during the third quarter. We consumed $33.5 million of cash related to stock option exercises. Think of those as de facto buybacks in connection with taxes owed on the exercise of stock options.With that, I will turn it over to our EVP, Will Franklin. -- Thank you, Jeff. Let me provide in some more insights into our third quarter performance. Our worldwide sales volume grew by 4.5% and our worldwide inventory grew by 12.2%. Hurricane volume activity was immaterial for both this quarter and the same quarter last year.In the US, our sales volume grew by 2.8% and our inventory increased by 14.5%. Our volume growth continues to be driven by organic growth within the insurance market, market wins within the insurance market, and our continued expansion into the non-insurance segments.Organic growth in the salvage market is driven we believe, by an increase in total loss frequency. Published statistics suggest a total loss frequency of 19.9% for the first quarter calendar '19, an increase of 2.6% over the same quarter last year.This metric measures the percentage of estimates written that result in total losses. What is not reflected in this metric is the increase in the instances (ph) in which insurance companies salvage cars without ever riding the repair estimate.Our conversations with insurance company executives as well as the current trends and assignments lead us to believe that the growth in total loss frequency is higher than that published. Repair costs, particularly for new cars are trending now at a rate exceeding that inflation. An increase in the number and the average cost of replacement parts, the growth in pre and post repair scans and the supplemental damages they identify.The lack of trained and capitalized repair capacity and the consolidation of the repair market by the three major MSOs are all leading to a rise in repair cost.We believe the industry is simply trending, to less comparable cars. While repair costs are increasing, so too are the returns that we're generating for our sellers. The combination of our marketing (ph) efforts and the efficiency of our auction platform BB3, continues to generate returns to our sellers, far exceeding overall industry returns, as represented by the Manheim Used Car Index.Compared to the same quarter of last year, our ASPs are up over 10%, while the Manheim Used Car Index is up 3.9%, As worldwide demand for rebuild of the cars continues to outpace the available supply. Our marketing focus on internal -- or excuse me, on international buyers has led to a significant growth in bidding activity from those buyers.Our full US website is translated into seven languages with certain elements of the website translated into languages native to 135 countries. And from the US we sell into 147 countries.In terms of volume, nearly 40% of all the units sold to our US auction sellers are now international buyers, increases both year-over-year and sequentially. Because international buyers generally purchase rebuildable, and therefore, higher value vehicles, they represent a still higher share of the value of the cars sold at our US auctions.Approaching 50%, again an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Approximately, three out of four of all vehicles sold on our US website receive a bid from an international buyer.We continue to grow our buyer base, while we saw a 22% increase in unique international bidders on a year-over-year basis, we also saw a 14% increase in unique domestic bidders, which we believe is remarkable growth rate for what some might consider a large and already mature buyer base.The growth in ASPs has been primarily -- a primary driver in the increase in revenue per car in the US. In addition, we continue to provide more services to our insurance customers. There are certain tasks between the first notice of loss and auctioning of the salvage car that we can contribute to, or perform more efficiently, because of our broad industry knowledge, our scale and our technology.The non-insurance markets continue to be a focus of our growth strategy in the US. It represented 23% of our overall US volume this quarter compared to 21%, the same quarter last year and 17% same quarter two years ago. These markets include franchise and independent dealers, finance and leasing companies, fleets, charities, heavy equipment, wholesalers. Excluding the charity market in the U.S., our non-insurance volume grew by 18%, and 93% over the same quarter last year and the same quarter two years ago respectively.The growth in volume was spread broadly across multiple seller segments. Volume from dealers was up 14%, wholesalers 39%, rental car companies 79%, and fleets and industrial equipment, 7%.We attribute this growth to our increased marketing, sales and operational focus and the growth in returns generated for these segments.Turning to our international operation, the performance of the UK and Canada remained relatively consistent with the same quarter last year in terms of volume, revenue and EBIT, after adjusting for currency fluctuations.In Brazil however, we continue to see meaningful growth as the value we offer in terms of technology, process and land has allowed us to expand our market share in that country. In Brazil, our volume and local currency revenue and EBIT grew by 43%, 55% and 61% respectively. This is remarkable growth considering the declining number of auto insurance policies written due to the economic conditions in that country.Additionally, in Brazil, like in the US, we are growing our non-insurance business, which represented 9.8% of the total volumes sold compared to 3.6% in the same quarter last year. Jeff has already provided commentary on Germany. Our other operations outside of the Americas, the UK and Germany for the quarter remained immaterial in both revenue and EBIT.In the US and globally, we are seeing rising labor health insurance and cellphone costs, all of which have led to an increase in our average cost to process each car.Year-over-year, our US inventory was up 14.5%, which is significantly higher than the growth in sales volume of 2.8%. We attribute the difference to an unusually mild weather that affected assignments at the beginning of the quarter.However, assignments after the first month of the quarter have been and continue to be robust. The year-over-year growth in our US inventory over the last 16 quarters has averaged over 12%, and we expect this trend to continue. To accommodate this growth and to provide stand-alone capacity along the Gulf of Mexico and the East Coast, we continue our land expansion activities.Since the last earnings call, we have announced the opening of four new facilities, three new Copart facilities in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Rainbow, Kentucky and West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and one new NPA facility at Sacramento, California.In addition, we are expanding existing facilities in Atlanta, Chicago, Austin and Newburgh, New York. In total, these three new Copart yards and four new yard expansions, have added over 150 acres of storage capacity. So far this year, we have announced 22 new facilities, 12 in the US, one each in Brazil and Canada and eight in Germany, as well as ten yard expansions in the US.Currently, in the US and Canada, we have over 21 new yard in yard-expansion projects in the construction phase and 33 projects in the engineering phase. These projects alone represents thousands of acres of capacity and will consume hundreds of millions of dollars in capital.That concludes my comments, we'll now proceed to the Q&A session of this call. -- Thank you. -- Operator, you could open it up for questions, please.At this time, we will open the floor for questions. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. -- Good morning and congratulations on a nice quarter. -- Thanks a lot, Bob. -- Thank you. -- So thanks for some of the color. I want to follow up on Will's comments on the international buyer base first. You may or may not have this with you, but I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of where that was sort of the percentage of sales of that base three or five years ago would be one part of the question.And then the second part, which is probably more important anyway is, talk about some of the drivers that have changed in the US just in salvage, the salvage market that have led to more international buyers getting into this market. -- Got it. Much appreciate your question, Bob and this is actually a topic we addressed and discussed at some length with our customers this week. As for the underlying drivers of that shift over time, I think there are two major ones worth mentioning.The first is that, of course we are observing a higher economic growth in a lot of countries outside the huge developed economies, like the US and the UK, and therefore there is just more natural demand for vehicles including rebuildable cars that come from Copart auctions.The second is the nature of total loss frequency, I think you've been following the industry for a long time Bob, so you know that even what was a 50% damaged car 20 years ago, looks very different from one today, because the cars today are much more easily rebuilt, some of the damage maybe technological modules that could be fixed more simply in places outside the US.So that's been the 30, 40 year trend really starting with airbags, many years ago, but more recently with the arrival of newer technologies in the cars as well.So a combination of growing economic activity and therefore demand for cars in these countries with higher economic growth, but much lower vehicle penetration, number one. And number two the changing nature of the cars as well. As I told more easily, the cars have value, not just as dismantled parts, that's probably one fundamental misunderstanding of this business is to assume that the cars really go only to dismantles.Over time, they are increasingly going to rebuilders, many of them international in nature. -- Let me add one more element to that growth and that is that, the cars rebuilt in foreign markets are generally not held to the same standards as the cars that are rebuilt in domestic markets.For example, a car in the Eastern Europe may or may not have their air bags replaced at all. So that gives them an advantage in terms of lowering the cost of converting that car to a drivable vehicle. -- Okay, great, that's super color. Thank you. And then just kind of sticking with the trend of technology going into cars, you know, the centers, et cetera, and what you've talked about over several calls that younger and less damaged cars are being totaled.Just wondering, if you could give us a sense of where you believe we are in that process. And this is, are we in a early innings, middle, late where do you think the trend to more younger and less damaged cars being totaled stands? -- I think as a general matter Bob, the nature of total loss frequency is big and slow moving in the sense that it reflects the installed base of cars in the growth. Right? So, our business principally serves those cars that are literally being driven or the insurance carriers, of course to insure that.And therefore there aren't step function changes in any given month or quarter or year, we're talking about 250 million 300 million cars in the road registered vehicles in the United States, for example. So I don't think those are spiky sudden changes. I think it's a gradual change that has generally been a favorable one for decades now.As for the precise age of the fleet and the precise age of vehicles that are involved in accidents and therefore totaled, I don't think we expect dramatic changes. But collectively, the changes will ultimately be favorable to total loss frequency. -- Got it. Great. And then one last quick one, if I could on just on Germany, I know you went on about it quickly the ten fold increase in volumes is tremendous, but could you just give us a sense of the feedback you're getting from the insurers right now as to what's holding them out from switching to the Copart model, if there is any specific things that still need to be worked on or addressed?Or if they just need a year or two of data? Or what do you think is the kind of -- I guess last or hopefully near the end of impediments toward switching over to the Copart model? -- Sure. I mean, it's a great question. Right now, Bob, we're focused on -- for this fiscal year was getting the network build. So we've got the network of facilities in place. We've got the trucks now and carriers in place to tow vehicles.And I would say the best way I can explain is we're pressure testing the team now. We're achieving the results that we have in the UK, that we have in the US, that we have in Brazil, where a vehicle can be assigned and picked up in sometimes hours, but within a day or two as opposed to a longer period of time.So we're getting all of the operational performance in place and we do have a couple of accounts already, but we are not going out and hitting -- swinging big or swinging for the fences with some very large carriers until we've got everything working the way it should.So it's a process of building the team, the network, pressure testing, and then this year, we will be going out and speaking with some carriers about switching over to the model. But, you know, we want to have everything working perfectly before we do that. You get really one shot at success. -- That's great. Okay. Thanks so much. -- Thanks, Bob.Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. -- Continue to be really impressed with the on the non-insurance business that you guys are putting up. When I first started covering the Company, I used to think non-insurance business was all about charity, I mean, clearly, it's not anymore.And I was just hoping you guys could talk a little bit about what's the value proposition or what's the message that you're sending and allowing you to win that share from dealers and then even more specifically the growth that you cited in the rental car industry is really interesting. Curious to know, how you are getting that business? And kind of how you're convincing some of these fairly decent sized consignors to work with you? -- So thanks for your question, John. I think in short, it's not particularly about messages or marketing, it's just fundamentally about returns. And so we offer a buyer base, including large quantities of international, active buyers of rebuildable and driveable vehicles. And so it's really the net auction results that we can deliver to the non-insurance segment.I think you're mentioning dealers in particular that has proven persuasive. So it's not particularly any silver tongued communications on our part. It's really just that we demonstrate week after week and month after month, that we can generate better returns for them on their vehicles. And to do so quickly with new logistics and the infrastructure to deliver those outcomes. -- Well, (multiple speakers) -- Let me just add a couple of comments there. Our return is obviously a huge part of our ability to be successful in that market. I think the other thing that we don't ignore is the operational aspects and the ability to eliminate any friction to send us these cars. So everyone of these segments is significantly different, charity cars completely different than these heavy equipment, which is completely different than a car coming from a franchise or independent dealership.So to the -- and each of them have their own operating systems. So to the extent that we can integrate our operations into their systems. To the extent that we need to change our process to accommodate their specific needs, it makes it more likely that there you -- that they will be testing us on their volume and the results of the test have been such that they continue to increase the volume that they sent to us. -- Great. And then, just wanted to ask about the -- the real estate investment. I think last call you guys noted 45 or 46 projects, kind of under way. And you've got maybe 24 months to kind of tie that up. Any updated thoughts on the real estate investment, do you expect to do more than that or you're ahead of pace there? Just kind of how you're thinking about that investment? -- Yeah. There is no cars slowing down our expansion with -- we project out five years in terms of volume needs, and the reason we project out so far is because of the gestation period. Some of these new properties can be two and three years very easily, especially in these high -- these expensive markets. And so our activity I don't see decelerating at any point in next two or three years. -- Great. And I guess I'm going to hook in on that five-year forecast that you just kind of mentioned there Will. When you are kind of our building out that five-year forecast for your needs in terms of real estate, obviously it's going to correlate to the volume and the capacity.So when you look at those forecast, are the forecast meaningfully different than the volume numbers globally that you're seeing today? So and I know, you guys don't have long-term growth targets. But as you think about those needs and what you're buying forward -- does the year in, year out kind of movement look a lot like what you've put up in the last few quarters? Or do you guys think that the growth in the market accelerates or decelerates and you know, thus far in your business? -- So I'm not really motivated to share our exact projection numbers. I can tell you this, though. We have a couple of absolutes (ph) in our business. One is auctions have to run every day and our auctions do, our KTLO on our auction sites is 3 or 4, 5, times. The other absolute is land, we have to have land. So we really can't risk under projecting our land needs going forward. And so once again, we are very aggressive in our pursuit of the land capacity to accommodate the growth that we're anticipating. -- Understood. Thank you, guys, and congrats. -- Thanks, John.Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. -- Hi, good morning. My first question is just a clarification, and I apologize if I missed it, did you give the revenue per unit that you saw during the corner, I don't know both in the US or internationally or in total? -- No, we don't generally provide that metric. We did talk about a couple of the levers that are driving up that revenue per car, primarily on higher ASPs, and secondarily, the increased in services that we're providing to our sellers and our buyers. -- Great. And then you talked about this kind of in your opening remarks in terms of the comments you had in the last week and some of the -- maybe the technology investments that you're looking at -- or potential investments, but maybe you could speak a little bit more about the technology side of your business and what can be done, it's being moved forward? Thanks. -- Sure. So the selling (ph) process that the insurance companies go through sounds very simple. But in reality is is fairly complex. I mean you have a lot of constituents in that whole process. You got the insurance company, you've got the policyholder, you're going to need an appraisal and a repair estimate both which can be provided by different people. You can have a lean payoff, you're dealing with a DMV.And all these activities and transfer of information need to be coordinated and sequenced in the right order. And we work with virtually every insurance company in the United States, and so we're able to identify best practices and develop technology around those best practices and offer that technology and those best practices to all the insurance companies.But in generally smaller insurance companies will take advantage of it, the large ones will too. So we're -- so to answer your question, we generating the technology that allows us to integrate the flow of information, flow of documents, the flow of the process around that total (ph) loss process. -- Stephanie, the only -- the only thing I'd add there is when I think about technology for Copart, find a framework for it, I'd say, think of it in three pieces. The first is the importance of technology in helping our customers perform better and faster from their side, and that's the integration that we'll talk about providing data at the right time to better enable their own decision making processes.Second aspect of technology for us is to help us perform better. So we have different applications, different technologies, for example, that help us manage our towing network better to dispatch trucks more efficiently. And then thirdly, of course technology enhances our own reliable -- reliability. You heard Will talk about investing for KCLO (ph), which is in our province to keep the lights on in auction reliability and so a good part of our technology investment as well is to prepare us for the growth that we are serving to make sure that we continue to serve our customers well. -- That's really helpful. Thanks for all the color. -- Thanks Steph.Our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. -- Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start on the insurance side with RFPs, I know in the past five years or so you've landed a handful of very large national contracts with insurers, with that in mind has the trend stabilized, are there any upcoming renewals or RFPs with new prospects?And then additionally, what's the dynamic in Germany and are there any big RFPs that would be a national contract there? -- Got it, Craig thanks for the question. As to your first question, if we don't -- we're not like a subscription business that has a bunch of customers coming due or upon their contract expiration, at the same time. Our dialog with our customers is literally on a daily basis, so no, there is not a particularly lumpy either opportunity or risk for us to win or lose a big chunk of business simply by the nature of contract expiration in and of itself.That said, we think our -- all of what you've heard today about our auction platform, the returns we generate, technology, etc., generally enables us to win market share over time, which we have done now for decades, and believe we will continue into the future as well.As for Germany, the issue isn't principally RFPs, as someone posed a question earlier, it's principally about changing the way business is done altogether by the German insurance carriers. So it's a shift in a way they think (ph) not a contract expiration, per se, or an RFP that triggers the opportunity for us. Copart certainly is a well known enough and obviously very successful enterprise in salvage auctions around the world generally. So those dialogues are available to us, when we are ready, when they are ready for them, that is not per se in RFP. -- Thanks. And then, Will I had a question for you on real estate and hoping you can share some metrics to frame that spend, but maybe what are the economics of the typical real estate project due to the average cost of an acre or the range you might pay depending on the market.What kind of capacity do you get in terms of car volume on a project like that, and then what's the path to break even or to corporate average returns on that investment? Anything you can shed light on would be helpful. -- Sure, let me start by saying there is no typical transaction. So we can buy a land for $50,000 an acre in some parts of the country. We just bid our land to the equivalent over $3 million an acre and didn't get into the second round of the bidding for that plant.You can't -- so continuing on some of your questions, you can't look at the economic output from one yard, because we don't service one insurance company in one yard, we service insurance companies nationwide. So you can't really ignore these very expensive markets, because they may not be as economically profitable as the less expensive real estate markets.So that's really not even a consideration for us, we just know that we have to have the land whenever insurance companies need it. -- Craig, I -- even to put it in financial terms, I think if you took snapshots at any moment in Copart's history and said, does this next parcel of land generate an ROI in the form of its cap rate that exceeds Copart's weighted average cost of capital, the answer is almost certainly no.But, if you had the benefit of a time machine if you go back to the early 1990s and decide Copart, whether we should buy a land or not, now that we have the benefit obviously at hindsight having acquired massive parcels of real estate in the United States, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere around the globe is one of the key economic enablers of our business. It's proving to be incredibly strategically valuable.We believe that will be true going forward as well. So as Will noted, it's not about the cap rate on any given parcel of land, it's about building the network that allows you then to amass a global liquid market of buyers as well. So it's a two-sided auction and owning our land has been a critical enabler of that two-sided auction. -- That is super helpful and maybe just to follow-up, Will, with your point on the property, where you didn't make the second round, what is the consequence of that, does that mean longer towing distances or higher costs, I mean, what is your backup plan given you need to service customers in that market? -- Well, there's a number of ways to approach markets like that typically, we like to have one large yard, and certain situations will settle for a multiple smaller sites. We'll also look at trucking and we'll do that tracking in a manner that does not negatively impactful to our sellers. For example, a truck in the evening. We can operationally address some of the yard constraints by taking older inventory and moving it off site.There is ways (ph) around it, but ultimately land will continue to become more expensive and the development costs will become more expensive as well. -- And Craig, let me add to that, Will talked about a five year plan, we get bumped on land all the time. That example he gave, it is just another example of land that we've tried to buy, we couldn't buy and there will be another piece of land we can buy, but we can't get zoning, because we're working on this five years out, we're not out of capacity there. We've got room and we can service customers.And specifically in the market, he is talking about, we've got plenty of room and we can service customers. But we've eventually got to get land in that market. And if we didn't, then we would do some of the things that Will just spoke of. -- Great, thank you. -- Thanks Craig.Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Incorporated. -- Yeah, good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions. -- Good morning, Dan. -- Good morning. I want to start on a comment you made on ASP strength, and the growing number of bidders in the US despite it being a more mature market. I think in recent quarters, you've noted that you've increased your international marketing to bring more international bidders to auction, but there are -- are there any initiatives you can point to that you guys are doing to help bring domestic buyers to auction? Or what do you attribute that strength in bidders to? -- Yes, yeah, we have specific initiatives for both domestic and international buyers. We work with a buyer profiles and through our marketing efforts, whether they're social or PPC or SEO, we're targeting those buyers to make more aware of our auction, and particularly the cars are available. So when we introduce or we go on to a new segment that may not be a familiar segment to our existing buyer base, we'll spend an -- an extra amount of time and resources to identify that segment, and to those particular buyers. And Jay just handed me some of my call notes. Obviously, we've been successful. We've increased our unique bidders on the domestic side by 14% when I say, that's 14% of a very large buyer.International is more segmented, because it's country by country. So two of the countries that are drawing are Georgia and Jordan. And Georgia for whatever reason, they're buying electric cars. So Teslas and Preaus are finding their way to Georgia to a very, very high ASPs.And so we are from -- we are obviously promoting that. And in China, they're buying Harley-Davidson. In Mexico they're buying pickup trucks. In the Netherlands, they are buying sports cars. So we're getting to know the demand in these particular regions. In Nigeria, they just want affordable transportation and our marketing efforts reflect that knowledge that we are gaining. -- Got it. That's really helpful color. Jeff, switching gears a little bit, looking at the revenue growth in the quarter, kind of the implied revenue per unit remaining strong, especially considering the scrap steel headwinds, that we saw during the quarter, can you maybe just give us the reminder on how scrap steel impacts your business and your ASPs. I feel like like a few years ago, it felt like a bigger driver of ARPU, but had anything changed, can you just give us a refresh on about how that impacts your business? -- That's a great question and I think the answer is a strong yes, that the nature of scrap and its influence on our business has shrunken over time. It declined very meaningfully. And as a flip side of the coin of the issue we talked about a few moments ago, that a car -- imagine a car has a spectrum of potential value and at the very low end it is literally worth its weight in steel and its metal content.And in the other extreme end of the spectrum, it's a driveable car the next day, a perfectly intact automobile. As our -- as the nature of technology and the increasing complexity of cars has made more the totals -- more of the total cars at the end of this -- closer to the end of the spectrum of driveable cars, they're more rebuildable, they're more driveable, they're certainly worth more as parts than they are as a metal.And therefore scrap is not something by the way operationally, we particularly focus on day to day at all. It's really about finding the right buyers of the cars and the high value -- that the higher value cars for us assuredly are not being sold for scrap. The international buyers are obviously not shipping a car several thousand miles to melt it down. So the scrap matters, but increasingly less overtime. -- So yeah, we should change how we're thinking about it. That's helpful.And then maybe last one internationally. We've touched a lot on Germany, but looking -- it looks like you're growing scaling your offering in Spain, pretty nicely. Although it's still pretty small. Can you just update us on how you're thinking about that opportunity? Or any kind of feedback or learning on that market as we think about what's next beyond Germany and Europe? Thanks. -- Sure. So we implemented a new playbook, if you will in Germany to build the network out. And we're letting the teams in Europe, basically take that playbook and implement it in Spain. So they've added locations and they are in many ways mimicking what we're doing in Germany to achieve their own success.There is -- there is focus in both markets, but clearly, we're putting the vast majority of our efforts right now into Germany to get that market to see a big win in terms of volume and a switch over.And, you know, this has been a continued investment in the market in terms of people, process, technology, land etc. And once we start to see that transition over, it will be even further growth into expanding locations. Will's example of the US for land is what we're doing right now in Germany. We've got a dozen sites we're looking at, and we are trying to purchase and then beat -- and then we'll develop those sites. So that the ability to build that network and to achieve success takes time.And so Spain is doing the exact same thing, they are much smaller weighed than Germany, but nonetheless, doing the exact same thing in that market. And they are seeing success. So we're excited about that. -- Great, thanks so much guys. Best of luck. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. -- Hi, it's Chris Bottiglieri. Thanks for taking the questions. So first one was, did I hear correctly that international buyers are 40% of units, but 50% of revenue? -- 40% units is 50% of the value of everything that we auction. And that's because of buying the rebuildable cars and not the cars that are being part of that. -- Got it. That makes sense. And can I -- as a rule of thumb that would suggest that the selling price of those cars is 25% higher than the non-international bidders. So would it be fair to kind of use as a rule of thumb for the impact on ARPU growth, the 25% premium as international mix grows? -- Yes. I can't validate that precise arithmetic, but directionally yes. They are buying meaningfully higher valued cars on average. In part because of that scrap phenomenon you heard a few moments ago repeat, very low end cars of course none of them go internationally many of the high-end cars do. -- Got it. Perfect. Okay. The next question I had was, can you, I don't think you've heard talking this a lot recently, but can you talk about kind of within the US, the mix of fees, like excluding purchase vehicles, that just makes the math fuzzy, but can you give us a sense of what percentage of revenue is fee-based versus ancillary service based and kind of like to what extent that's contributed to ARPU growth in the last couple of years? -- I think Chris by now, we've -- on fee schedule we tend not to discuss them in any great substance. I think we have delivered additional services, as you heard Will talk about a few of them including our title procurement services, loan pay-off, loan payoff amounts, and so forth. But we -- our reschedules are competitive and sensitive matters for us. We delivered we believe very strong value to both our sellers and buyers. -- Got you. Then just a quick question on rent expense, that's doubled over the past years. I was wondering if this is driven entirely by international expansion or you had a change in philosophy like rent versus on own or cap rates or what not.And is there way to bifurcate the rent expense between the US international business force? Thank you. -- You were posing the question about the lease versus own decision on real estate. -- Well, yeah, like if you look at the facility's rent expense and for the Company, it's doubled over the last two years. So trying to figure out what's driving that. Is it all international? Or is it something else going on with driving that like doubling of rent expense? -- I would think of rent expense a little bit like purchased cars for Copart. They are, it's a number that you'll see, and therefore, and we reported publicly and therefore it draws attention, but in practice, we buy what we can.So we buy anything we can and we lease when it's operationally necessary. We intend to when we enter a particular market when we are adding capacity to a metro area, in our existing markets, our expectation is that we're there for decades, and so we're always better off buying.There are some circumstances in which the land that's available can't be bought and therefore has to be leased. There are some circumstances for example in Germany, as you mentioned a moment ago in which our desire to be up and running very quickly compels us to pursue actionable properties in some cases or in many cases lease properties instead of purchasing them.But our preference fundamentally in almost every case would be to buy and not to lease and any additional rental properties are by necessity, not by desire. -- Got you. Okay, thank you.Thank you, everyone. At this time, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Adair. -- Thanks so much. We appreciate you all attending the call and we look forward to reporting on the end of the year and the fourth quarter on the next call. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference.

However, the company's adjusted earnings per share of $0.52 beat the target by a penny and represented a 10.6% increase compared with the prior-year quarter.The company is seeing benefits from user gains and increases for the average selling price on its platform, but  highlights the possibility that expansion could settle into proceeding at a slower pace going forward.Based on current momentum for the automotive e-commerce market, it's reasonable to expect that there's still plenty of untapped opportunity in the space, but Copart isn't the only player. It's also reasonable to expect that the market could get more competitive -- large tech platforms have already made some early moves into the space.Copart isn't feeling too much pressure yet and still has avenues to long-term growth, with consumers gradually trending toward online retail, improving technology, and further expansion in European and South American territories.

(NASDAQ: CPRT)Q2 2019 February 21, 2019, Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 . Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter call for Copart. On the call with me today is Jeff Liaw, CFO; and Will Franklin, Executive Vice President. I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Liaw for opening comments, and then Will Franklin will give us an update on operations and then we'll be happy to answer any questions that we have at that time.All right. Thanks so much. Jeff?When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Copart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. -- Thanks, Jay. I'll start with safe harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effects of disposals of nonoperating assets, foreign-currency-related gains and losses, the impact of income taxes on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, net of deferred tax changes, and certain income tax benefits related to accounting for stock option exercises.We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday afternoon. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above.In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time-to-time on our behalf. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC.Now, I'll turn our attention to the second quarter of our Fiscal 2019. We're pleased with our operating results. Also, I'll start with a reminder that the first six months of Fiscal '18 were distorted by Hurricane Harvey. Over those first two quarters of 2018, we incurred losses of nearly $10 million on an operating basis. Q2, in isolation, would reflect a gain because the first quarter of 2018 would disproportionately capture storm related costs while the second quarter would disproportionately capture storm related revenue. We'll -- I'll make it a point over the course of his call to communicate our key metrics with and without the effects of Hurricane Harvey.We achieved a record second quarter in revenue, gross profits, and operating income, starting with our nominal global revenue growth of 5.6%, with an unfavorable year-over-year currency effect of $4.9 million from foreign operations, primarily due to the relative strength of the dollar in comparison to the pound and the Brazilian real.Excluding the effect of Hurricane Harvey, our revenue growth was 17% even. Our global service revenue growth was 3.7% year-over-year, and again, excluding Hurricane Harvey, was 13.7%. We typically suggest looking to service revenue and service revenue growth as the more accurate indicator of underlying business activity. Our purchased car growth of 19.1% year-over-year, driven largely by our international businesses, split approximately equally between the U.K. and Germany. A quick reminder that our Copart owned inventory remains relatively small at $28.3 million at quarter end, which is small in the context, of course, of the overall business.Turning to unit sales, our nominal global units declined slightly at 0.6% year-over-year, with a slight U.S. unit decline of 3.7% and international unit growth of 18.7%. Again, excluding Hurricane Harvey, our global unit sales grew at 7.7%. U.S. units grew 5.7%. And, excluding Harvey and charities volumes from that U.S. number, our volumes grew 7.5% year-over-year . Our U.S. unit growth was driven by both our insurance and noninsurance segments, which Will will describe in greater detail in a few minutes.Then, turning to inventory, our nominal global inventory grew at 6.6% year-over-year. Excluding the effect of Hurricane Harvey, our inventory grew at 7.7%. For the quarter, our gross profits grew 8.7% year-over-year, excluding Harvey. That same number would be 13.6% year-over-year growth. Our gross margin rate increased from 41.7% a year ago to 42.9% this year. So, approximately a 120-basis point lift. Excluding the effect of Harvey, our gross margin compressed slightly, approximately 1%, which can be explained almost entirely by the slight mix shift to purchase car revenue.Our average selling process for vehicles at Copart auctions in the United States, excluding Hurricane Harvey, grew 16.1% year-over-year. This -- pardon me -- 15.4% year-over-year. That compares to 16.1% growth a year ago. So, 15.4% this year and 16.1% a year ago for the same quarter. Will, again, will provide more context on this phenomenon, a reflection both of the type of cars that are consigned to Copart as well as the expansion and marketing efforts that we pursue with our Copart member base.Turning to our general and administrative expenses, excluding stock compensation and depreciation, were up from $29.7 million a year ago to $33.2 million this year. We're down $1.6 million sequentially versus the first quarter of 2019. Repeating a mantra that you've heard before, in general, G&A expenditures will vary from quarter to quarter and will grow over time with inflation and complexity. We continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage, given the topline growth we've experiencedOur GAAP operating income growth was 9.1% for the quarter. Excluding Hurricane Harvey, that same operating income would've grown at 15.5%. Our net interest expense, you can see, is down slightly year-over-year given our lower average net debt balance. Our other income of $4.8 million is largely a gain on the sale of an asset, specifically a now-replaced data center. You also see that adjusted out in our non-GAAP reconciliation.Our second quarter income tax rate was 20.4%, a reflection of the lower U.S. federal tax rate that we've discussed on prior calls, as well as one-time benefits from stock option exercises, which we again reflect in the non-GAAP presentation. Our GAAP net income increased from $103.3 million a year ago to $131.4 million this year, for the second quarter, an increase of 27.2% year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, our net income grew 11.5% year-over-year. Excluding the effects of Hurricane Harvey and including an assumption for tax rates, that same growth rate would be 18% plus or minus for non-GAAP net income year-over-year.The non-GAAP schedule -- we've already talked about the major adjustments on that page for the second quarter for this year, which include both the disposal of nonoperating assets as well as the excess tax deduction for stock option exercises. I'll just quickly remind folks that the major adjustment for last year, for the second quarter, was the $10 million adjustment of the one-time transition tax charge that's a reflection of the tax reform assent in that quarter.I'll turn out attention briefly to Germany before coming back, then, to the balance sheet and cash flow. I would encourage folks, for further background, to review the transcript of our first quarter  , where we described in much greater detail the nature of the market and our efforts there. It represented a one-time deep dive, so to speak, into the business. But, as a quick substantive update, we now have 12 locations up and running in pursuit of critical physical footprint across the country.At Copart Germany, we're now running daily auctions across those locations, but the strong majority of our volume sold to buyers outside of Germany. We think that reflects the power of the Copart brand name, our buyer network, and technology platform, and it frankly is a strong testament to the inefficiency of the current market model for total losses in Germany. Our unit sales in Copart Germany are approximately 8x the same volume for a year ago for the second quarter.We also continue to demonstrate our ability to purchase cars through Wreck Online, a listing service that we own, and to sell them at a positive margin at Copart Germany auctions. As you know, we also continue our dialogue in parallel with insurance carriers in Germany, and believe that a Copart model akin to what we have in the U.S. and the U.K. is ultimately the right answer for that market as well, for a host of reasons, including both total loss and claims costs for carriers as well as the claims experience policyholders.Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement, our operating cash flow for the quarter, gross CapEx is $74.4 million. About 60% of the CapEx was attributable to capacity expansion and lease buyouts, with the balance attributable to maintenance and other activities. We also purchases 7.6 million shares of Copart stock in the open market at a weighted average price just below $48.00, for total outlays of approximately $365 million. We funded these purchases with cash on hand and a revolver draw of $93 million as [audio cuts out] at the end of the quarter. We still available liquidity of more than $750 million.With that, I'll turn the call over to EVP Will Franklin. -- Thank you, Jeff. Let me provide a few comments about our operational performance for the second quarter. Copart, once again, delivered another strong quarter. Our U.S. volume, when adjusted for the Harvey activity in the same quarter last year, grew by 5.7%.Our volume growth continued to be driven by organic growth and market wins within the insurance market and our continued expansion into the noninsurance markets. Organic growth in the salvage market is driven, we believe, by an increase in total loss frequency as high repair costs and our elevated auction returns are leading to a higher percentage of claims resulting in an economic total loss. The growth in our auction returns has significantly outpaced the growth in used car values.Using January 2017 as a baseline, the Manheim Used Car Index has grown 8.4%. Using the same baseline, ASPs we are generating at our U.S. auctions for only insurance cars has grown by 35%. While the rest of the industry is quickly moving toward the digital remarketing convention, we have been completely digital since 2003 when we introduced our BB2 platform. We have continually improved our auction platform, now BB3, over the last 16 years, and is commonly recognized as the standard in the industry.The efficiency of BB3, and our elevated marketing focus on international buyers, have led to a significant growth in bidding activities from those buyers. Our full U.S. website is now translated into seven languages. In addition, we have elements of our website that accommodate languages native to 135 countries. And currently, we sell from the U.S. into 147 countries.In the quarter, 38.4% of all U.S. units sold were to international buyers, and 46.9% of the value of the units sold were to international buyers. In total, over 70% of all the vehicles sold on our U.S. website received at least one bid from an international buyer.Our marketing efforts have two goals -- to bring more buyers to our auction, and to get those who attend to place more bids. We have been successful in both efforts. The number of unique bidders was up 13% and the number of bids received per lot sold was up 8%. Breaking down the growth in unique bidders further, we saw an 11% increase in domestic bidders and a 22% increase in the international unique bidders.The growth in our ASPs has been the primary driver in a 6.4% increase in the U.S. revenue per car. Also contributing to that growth are the additional services we're providing to both the buyers and the sellers. The noninsurance markets continue to be a focus of growth in our U.S. strategy. These markets include franchised independent dealers, finance and leasing companies, fleets, charities, equipment dealers, and wholesalers. Excluding the charity and municipality markets in the U.S., our noninsurance volume grew by almost 20%, and by more than 100% over the same quarter last year and the same quarter two years ago respectively.The growth in volume was spread broadly across multiple seller segments. Volume from dealers was up 14%, finance companies 24%, wholesalers 24%, rental car companies 62%, and fleets and industrial equipment were up 41%. We have successfully grown our noninsurance volumes as we developed better systems integration into fleets, banks, and dealerships as we had developed sales and operational programs targeting individual segments, and as we continue to increase the auction returns that we're delivering to our noninsurance sellers.Turning to the U.K., we delivered another very strong quarter as we saw growth in volume of 11.8%. In local currency, revenue and EBIT grew by 21.7% and 23% respectively. The growth in volume came from increases in both the insurance business, driven once again by market wins and organic growth, and growth in our noninsurance business as we grew our U.K. dealer volumes.We also continue to see meaningful growth in both Brazil and Canada as the value we offer in terms of technology, processes, land, and people has allowed us to expand our market share in those countries. In Canada, we increased our volumes in our local currency revenue by 8.4% and 21.5% respectively. In Brazil, our growth was even more remarkable, increasing our volume and our local currency revenue by 22% and 36.5% respectively.Jeff has already provided commentary on Germany. With that, we note that our operations outside of the Americas, the U.K., and Germany for the quarter remained immaterial in both revenue and EBIT. Globally, we are seeing rising labor, health insurance, and cellphone costs, all of which have led to an increase in our average cost to process each car.Our inventory was up in the U.S., internationally, and worldwide by 5.9%, 11.1%, and 6.6% respectively. When adjusted for Harvey, the growth in the U.S., internationally, and worldwide was 7.2%, 11.1%, and 7.7% respectively. The year-over-year growth in our U.S. inventory over the prior eight quarters has averaged over 9%, and we expect this trend to continue. To accommodate this growth, and to provide stand-alone capacity along the Gulf of Mexica and the East Coast, we have engaged in a massive capacity expansion initiative. In the last three weeks alone, we have announced new yards at Harleyville, South Carolina, serving the Charleston area; Antelope, California, serving the North Bay and Sacramento areas; and Mocksville, North Carolina, serving the Charlotte area. In total, these three yards added over 114 acres of capacity. So far, this fiscal year, we have announced 14 new facilities -- four in the U.S., one each in Brazil and Canada, and eight in Germany.Currently, in the U.S., we have 17 expansion projects in the construction phase and 29 projects in the engineering phase. These 46 projects alone represent thousands of acres of capacity and will...That concludes my comments. Todd, I'll turn the call back over to you for the Q&A session.Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing *1 on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, press *1 to ask a question. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. We'll take our first question will come from Bob Labick of CJS Securities. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. -- Hi, Bob. -- Hi, Bob. -- Good morning. -- Hi. I want to -- a couple real quick questions on Germany, and then one on the noninsurance growth, which was very impressive, that you just talked about. Starting with Germany, obviously over the last, I guess, 6-12 months, you've really accelerated your pace of rollout in your growth there. Can you talk about -- what has surprised you the most over the last 6-12 months during this acceleration phase? -- I think the biggest surprise was just how well the team performed in terms of opening up so many yards so quickly. When we got there this summer, and started looking at changing our strategy in terms of what would make us the most successful, we realized we needed a network. And that's what's worked for us in the U.S., and the U.K., and other markets -- Brazil, Canada -- is we have a stronger network. We have a better -- an easier ability to pick up cars quickly and provide our services, and really just the team's performance and ability to do that is probably the most surprising thing.Second, I'd say, is just the amount of buyers that we've been able to bring in. Once we started to hold auctions -- and we're auctioning well over 500 cars a week now -- once we started that process and had regular auctions available to the members, the marketing team's just done a really great job on getting our brand out there and cultivating buyers for our auctions. So, it's been very positive. We've talked about it in the past. I like Jeff's comments, which are let's -- let us succeed and perform and then we'll report on those results. But we're very happy with what we see in Germany. -- Okay. Great. And I know you want to succeed and perform first, but I just wanted one more question and then I'll move off it. I know you talked about, potentially over the next several quarters, flipping an insurance company to the U.S. style. Do you still believe that's possible or likely? And if that doesn't happen over the next couple of quarters, what would be the reason that it wouldn't happen? -- Well, I do think it's going to happen. The reason it will happen is associated with friction that you have today with the process. So, you're requiring the insured to hold the vehicle and then have some buyer come to their house and pick the vehicle up. And there isn't an insurance company that I have met in Germany yet that isn't concerned with customer service and net promoter scores and giving the best possible brand experience that they can give. And obviously, when we send a uniformed driver in and pick the vehicle up, bring it to our location, and then auction it, and the end buyer's picking up at our location, you don't have that touch with the buyer and the insured.And that can be a negative. There can be a number of scenarios that I could outline for you where the buyer ends up wanting to have a conversation with the insured about the salvage. And clearly, there's not an insurance company that wants that. The second reason is return. We're able to buy cars, as Jeff as mentioned on previous calls -- we're able to buy calls basically through the platforms and then bring them over to our yards and auction them off and get a higher return. And that is just very, very simple. You're allowing buyers from around the country and the world to bid on product that they know they're going to get. There's no contingency. There's no question. If they bid, they're going to own it.Whereas, when they bid on the platforms, there's a less than 10% chance of knowing you're going to get the vehicle. Even if they're high bidder, they may not get the vehicle because the insured may sell it somewhere else, through a body shop or through some other -- through the dealership rather than to the buyer. So, you're taking away that element of unknown and making it a sure -- a guarantee that you're going to get the vehicle. And then, you have the logistical component. And we said this before, it should not be underestimated. When a buyer has to -- when a buyer bids on something and has to pick it up and go to three different locations, three different insureds homes, and pick that vehicle up within a certain amount of timeframe, that adds a degree of difficulty.When a buyer can bid on three different Copart locations and buy a half a dozen or a dozen vehicles so the can get a lot more product, and then they can take three weeks to pick it up, as opposed to having to get it out within four days, that's just a better experience for the buyer as well. So, I just -- I don't have any doubt at this point that we're going to see continued traction in that market. -- Great. That was really helpful color. Thank you. And then, just one last quick one -- obviously, you just discussed very impressive growth of noninsurance from dealers, finance, wholesalers, rental cars, etc. Who were the primary buyers of these? Are these the new unique bidders coming online? Or just talk a little bit about the buyer base there, how it may be different than your core, or if it is exactly the same. -- No, Bob. I think the profile of our buyer base changes constantly based on the product that we're offering. And you're seeing buyers that have an appetite for these different types of cars, and even heavy equipment that we're offering -- and that's the -- that just demonstrates the efficiency of our auction platform. We easily get to those buyers. Those buyers easily get to us and are able to view these cars. -- Bob, I'd just add to that that I think both are true. So, we expand as the nature of the cars that we offer evolves. Our buyer base expands further as well. But it's also true that the existing buyer base is thirsty for the kind of cars that are offered by the dealer consigners. Otherwise, by the way, they wouldn't consign through us. As much as we'd like to say we're fantastic or independent dealers and so forth, they vote with their feet and they vote as a reflection of the auction prices they achieve at Copart auctions. So, I think it's a testament to the power of that buyer network that they're doing quite well and bringing more cars to Copart over the time. I think that also has a virtuous cyclical affect as well because then those newer, or less damaged, or nondamaged, cars then bring further buyers into the network as well. So, I think it's a marketplace that continues to expand on both sides -- buyers and sellers. -- Great. Thanks very much. -- Thanks, Bob.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Craig Kennison of Baird. -- Thank you for taking my questions. Will, I wanted to start with you on the noninsurance business -- continue to see great growth there. Can you provide examples of systems integration tools that you're using to drive your noninsurance volumes with dealers, fleet operators, or rental companies? -- Sure. I mean, each of these segments tend to migrate to different platforms for their system operations. For example, the finance companies use a system called AutoIMS. The dealers use Dealertrack or DealerSocket -- a number of those other systems. The buyers seem to come to us from AuctionACCESS. And it's extremely important for us to write the integrations that are needed to reduce any friction that is caused by operating the two different systems -- our system and theirs. And we have a significant initiative along the lines of creating those integrations. And that's just part of it. It's not just the systems. It's the processes.For example, heavy equipment -- transportation of a piece of heavy equipment could cost $4,000-5,000 as opposed to well under $100.00 for an insurance company. The titling process for charities, where you got to pick up the title when you pick up the car, is completely different than the titling processes for dealerships. Dealers are much more concerned and in need of after auction services, like counterbidding -- and I can go on and on. Finance companies have rules that surround repossessions, even voluntary repossessions, with which we have to provide special documentation and compliance. And so, it's just not a matter of being integrated into their software systems. It's being able to change our processes to accommodate their specific needs. -- That helps. And then, to what extent is the growth fueled by new customers trying your services versus customers that you've already landed that are dramatically increasing the use of your service? -- It's both. We're seeing organic growth. We're seeing people -- customers that we've had for years that we're contacting again. We're, like I said, eliminating the friction -- whether it's systematic or process -- encouraging them to send us cars. And the returns that they are receiving have driven more and more volume. It's not one big thing. It's a combination of a lot of little things that we're doing internally. -- Got it. And then, I also wanted to ask about the total loss rate trend in the U.S. and in Europe. Where do you think that loss rate is headed in 2019 and beyond? And then, when you look at Europe, do you have any data to frame where the total loss rate is today and where that may be headed? -- Craig, I'll comment on the first of your question as per total loss rate. I think this is, as you know, the one way tailwind behind the business for the last 40 years, right? That the cars, once they're in accidents, are evermore prone to being totaled than repaired. I think that's an unassailable macro factor that's really hard to read on a micro basis. So, trying to forecast that quarter-to-quarter, even year-to-year, is tough. We do think the overwhelming forces at work here will drive it upwards over time. There's no particular ceiling that we have in mind. So, I don't have a good point in time forecast for you for 2019.As for Europe, I think the data -- we haven't seen a comprehensive data source that's quite as exhaustive as CCC here in the U.S., so don't have a comparable number to share with you. The U.K., as you know, is very different from Germany, for example, even at how they practice -- or how they handle total losses. But no, we don't have any point estimates as precise as the major sources we have here in the U.S. -- Got it. Hey, thank you. -- Thanks, Craig.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. -- Hey, good morning, guys. -- Bret. -- On the purchase car trend in Germany, is it possible to get the agency volumes up without flipping the insurance companies, in the sense that, if the individual's still selling the car, once you have enough auction traffic, will they send you the car on consignment as opposed to you having to buy it? -- Right now, we're acquiring cars so we can hold auctions. So, we're doing that through the platform. We do have some noninsurance volume coming in now, as well. So, we're starting to process vehicles for companies that service the insurance industry as well as rental car companies. But currently, the strategy is to illustrate the benefits to the large insurers and then have them switch over to our model. -- Okay. Great. And then, on Will's comments around the real estate pipeline, could you put -- maybe some timeframe around hose thousands of acres? Is that going to be a very large near-term acquisition of real estate, or is that 46 projects over a period of years? -- I think years is too long. I think within 24 months the vast majority of all those 47 projects should be delivered. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. -- Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, Will, when you talked about the noninsurance, did you give the percentage breakdown of what percentage of vehicles were noninsurance this quarter versus last year? Or can you give that?Hello? -- Yeah, we're still waiting to get that. Do you have any other questions while they gather that information? -- Oh, certainly I do. In terms of the gross margin on the purchase vehicles, it was -- sequentially, it was down a couple hundred basis points. Is that just an impact of more growth in Germany, or is that currency, or what? -- It is a reflection, in part, of growth in Germany. It is largely not currency, because currency would affect both sides of that ledger, Gary, right, because of the buy-ins. -- Right. Okay. -- It's partially Germany. It's partially also that purchase car banks can affect this as well. So, as the -- if the prices, for example, can rise for certain purchase cars -- we talked about this before. But the more a car bought and sold for, the lower [audio cuts out] dollar spread grows [audio cuts out] do not expect on a $10,000 car to make double the profit you would on a $5,000 purchase car, for what it's worth. -- Okay. And then, lastly, I wanted to ask about the vehicle pooling cost. They were -- year-over-year they were up pretty dramatically. What would account for that? -- That's largely an effect of the accounting change, Gary. So, it -- to make a long story short, the -- anyway, check the second quarter transcript. I think you'll find pretty robust discussion there of how the accounting now forces us to push more revenue -- we used to pull more revenue forward. Now, we push more back, which hangs more of it on the balance sheet, which is -- and the corresponding costs, which is why BPC is up so dramatically. -- Yeah, OK. That would explain it. And them, lastly, Jeff, I got on the call late. I actually got hooked into the wrong call. Could you give me some of those unit volume numbers that you generally address at the beginning of the call -- or unit volume changes, or whatever? -- Yeah, I'll give you the big ones. So, unit sales -- nominal unit sales climbed 0.6%, U.S. unit declined 3.7%, international growth of 18.7. Excluding Hurricane Harvey, global unit sales growth of 7.7, U.S. unit growth of 5.7, ex-Harvey and ex-charities we said in the U.S. we said was 7.5%. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Gary, I got that number for you on the percentage of non-insurance vehicles sold last quarter. In the U.S., it was 22.9%. In the same quarter last year, it was 20.8%. -- Okay. Thank you. -- You're welcome.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. -- Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could disaggregate the increased average selling prices. I would think some of it's mixed. Is there a way to maybe just look at what the ASPs have done, just for the insurance segment? -- You're right. A portion of it is mixed, and we don't -- we haven't separated the impact -- the change in mix versus the increase in ASPs solely for insurance companies. So, I'm not sure we can provide that to you on the call. -- I think Will did provide the stats on Manheim on a two-year basis, and U.S. insurance only being up 35%. -- Right. But not the impact it has on revenue. -- Right, not the impact on revenue. But the point is that ASPs are up, and up significantly year over year, including for the insurance segment in isolation. So, it's not just mix shift. It is also significant increases in insurance ASPs in the United States. -- Gotcha. That's what I'm trying to arrive at. So, when you think about what's deriving this, is there any metrics you can cite in terms of the total loss rates? Are you seeing that total loss rates are increasing even more for younger vehicles than for older vehicles, or anything you can demonstrate -- use to demonstrate that there's a younger vehicle being totaled today than historically? -- I think the themes you've heard us talk about on the last few calls all still hold true, which is that we are seeing on average slightly newer cars being totaled. So, if we look at the model year of the car we sell, we are selling more newer cars than -- today than we were a year ago, and that's been true for a while. We are also selling less damaged cars, so the cars are totaling more easily. We have certain metrics to -- the insurance companies do, rather, and they provide them to us, regarding repair estimates. So, how much is the repair estimate relative to the intact value of the car? And we are seeing, by that particular barometer, less damaged cars entering our system over time.On the flipside of this, is all the bidding phenomenon that Will described. So, I think we are seeing newer and less damaged cars on the supply side. And on the demand side, you are seeing more international buyers -- more buyers period, by the way, domestic and international -- but also diversified and global buyer base for our cars. So, it's both of those things working in concert that has driven selling prices up. -- Gotcha. And just lastly, there, I mean, the total loss rates have been pretty amazing, and it sounds like you're still looking for that 7-9% volume growth. Do you have any data on accident frequency? What are you seeing there? Are accidents still down year-over-year? Do you think some of this collision avoidance technology is yet impacting accident frequency, or do you think it's still too far off? -- We probably don't have any better data than you do, so we follow third-party sources like the FastTrack data and so forth. And what I'd say first is that, for the vast majority of this company's history, accident frequency has declined slightly -- steadily, but very slightly -- over time and it's been dwarfed by, of course, total loss frequency on the other side of the equation. So, that has driven organic unit volumes up very meaningfully over time. I do think that the rapid increases in accident frequency we saw from 2011/2012-2106 have tapered. So, accident frequency may be declining somewhat -- maybe flat. But it's not rising at the rate that it had previously -- total loss frequency, as far as we can tell, continues its upward trend. -- Yeah, so that's helpful. Thank you.Thank you. We'll take our next question from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. -- Yep. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Industry growth in Germany -- I think you mentioned, Jeff, you guys are at 12 locations. As a footprint, is that a sufficient network to service the country today? And how is the salvage industry in that market growing? Obviously, you guys are growing rapidly, taking share. But is the market also growing high single digits similar to the U.S.? -- So, as for the footprint, I think the -- this is sufficient for us to participate actively in Germany. There's no doubt in my mind that, over time, as we penetrate the market to grow our platform, we will invest dramatically more still in landing capacity there. So, the 12 is a good spread geographically across the country. But in terms of sufficiency of capacity, we are still in the very early innings of our participation in Germany. Your second question, again, was, Derek (sic)? -- Just on industry growth in Germany. Is it similar to the U.S., in that high single-digit range? -- That's a tricky question to answer. So, even your point about our taking shares is a very nuanced concept in the sense that we are taking share from what is a very different traditional salvage model, through the listing service, etc., which I'm sure you heard and can review again from the second quarter call. But in a nutshell, I don't think the underlying characteristics should be different from the U.S. and the U.K. in the sense that the cars are relatively old across the system. So, Germany is a mature economy that has had cars for a long time. So, the average fleet age, likewise, is old, in comparison, by the way, to developing markets or to economies that have grown tremendously in the last decade or two -- China, and India, and the like -- where the cars are relatively new by comparison.So, the cars are old. The cars are expensive to repair, meaning labor costs are high, parts costs are high, regulatory burdens are also meaningful -- meaning you have to restore airbags back to intact condition to drive cars. All of those same underlying forces are similar in Germany, but for like-for-like salvage auction statistics in Germany, we don't have them because they don't exist, right? We are the first ones to attempt to deploy the Copart model, so to speak, in Germany. -- Fair. Thanks. Will, I think you mentioned that over 30% of U.S. vehicles are now going abroad. And I'm assuming that some of those vehicles are going over to Europe. So, can you talk about the buyer base in Germany to the extent -- I would just love to hear your thoughts around -- over time, as you develop the German market and the further EU market, does that cannibalize any of the international demand that you're seeing at your U.S. auctions today? -- No, it really doesn't. Most of our international activity is in the less developed countries. Most of our cars provide affordable transportation, and our top three are Mexico, which is obvious because of its proximity to the United States. The next two are the UAE and to Nigeria. And we're also seeing significant growth in the Caucasus countries. There is some cross pollination in our buyers in Germany, but it's not significant in its scope. And we don't think it'll have a cannibalization impact on our international activity as Germany develops. -- Okay, great. And then, last one for me -- just on capital allocation, you guys obviously chose to deploy capital toward share repo on the quarter, and you funded it with some short-term debt. Understanding you don't want to comment on any future activity, but has your appetite culturally to maybe carry more leverage on the business changed today, given some of the scale you've seen -- you gained in the recent years? -- No, I don't think there's been a philosophical shift at Copart, if you go back just a few years, even. At the end of 2014, we had leverage on the balance sheet for share repurchases we consummated in the summer and -- summer of 2015 and December 2015. So, we had a little bit more leverage then, even than we do now. But no, there's no philosophical shift in how we think about leverage. We generally prefer to be -- to have meaningful financial flexibility, which gives us strategic flexibility when it comes to acquiring land, pursuing international growth and so forth. So, we'll continue to be a relatively low leverage institution. -- Got it. Thanks so much, guys.Thank you. Again, if you would like to ask a question, please press *1 now. We'll take our next question from Derek Glynn of Consumer Edge Research. -- Thank you for taking my question. As you think about additional growth opportunities outside of North America or Europe, China and India stand out as potentially two large markets in the long run. Can you provide an update on how you view those opportunities and whether investments have been made to expand there? -- I think you captured the thought well, in that they are very promising markets long term. But for a host of reasons, the markets haven't yet materialized to nearly the same extent that they have in Europe and the United States. So, we'll be there when it emerges, but it's not in the next -- not on the next couple of years anyway. -- Okay. Understood. Thank you.Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. -- Thank you. Thank you, for coming on the call, and we look forward to reporting on the next call on Q2. Thanks again.

While this sales increase was modest, especially  of more than 10%, Copart's net income grew faster and was up 27% from the year-ago quarter to $131.4 million.Data source:  .Slowing sales growth has been an ongoing trend for the company over the past several quarters. Sales growth of just over 5% in the most recent quarter follows an increase of 10% in the first quarter and an 18.7% jump in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Looking back over the past year and a half, Copart's latest Q2 revenue growth was the lowest year-over-year increase in the past six quarters.The reason for Copart's stagnating revenue growth comes from the company's service revenue, which accounted for 86% of its total sales in the quarter. Service revenue increased by less than 4% in the second quarter 2019, compared to nearly 30% growth in the year-ago quarter.As was the case last quarter, Copart's yard operations expenses (the cost to house vehicles and sell them) decreased, which helped the company increase its gross profit in the second quarter. That increase, mixed with lower income taxes, helped earnings jump in the quarter even though total sales slowed down.Copart's vehicle sales continued to grow in the second quarter, with revenue up 19% from the year-ago quarter to $68.1 million. Vehicle sales accounted for 14% of total revenue in the quarter.Additionally, the company ended its second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $108.2 million, down slightly from $195.3 million from the year-ago quarter.Image source: Getty Images.Copart's share price popped following the release of the second-quarter results and are up nearly 6% at 1:15 p.m. on Thursday, indicating that despite slowing sales, investors are happy with the company's earnings growth.Its share price is up about 20% over the past year even after it  in late 2018. That drop came after the company reported its fourth-quarter results, but part of the slide was likely a reaction by investors to a broader sell-off in the market.Though Copart doesn't provide any earnings guidance for upcoming quarters, investors should continue to watch its sales figures closely.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This auctioneer of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is expected to pos  of $0.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.5%.Revenues are expected to be $494.35 million, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Copart, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Copart will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Copart would pos  of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.47, delivering a surprise of +2.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Copart doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Granted, the market started 2019 with the advantage of a steep selloff during the final three months of last year, setting up a big bounce out of an oversold condition. Traders remain confident at current levels, however, not flinching at the first whiff of potential trouble.The  15% advance from the late-December low hasn't just put the broad market back into a bullish mode, however. It has yanked some stocks out of a rut and back into an uptrend as well. In many of those cases, that turnaround coincides with a fundamental turnaround from the company itself.With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of the nine best U.S. stocks to plug into for a turnaround effort. All of them have made good forward progress, developing some momentum as a result. A closer read of their respective headlines also reveals the much-needed rhetoric has taken a turn for the better, reflective of fresh profit growth, sales growth or both.In no particular order\u2026Some investors had altogether given up on Snapchat parent  (NYSE:  ), convinced there just wasn't room for a third social media name in an environment that included  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ). SNAP stock, between its February 2017 high hit shortly after its IPO and its low in December of last year, lost more than 80% of its value, while slowing user growth  .A glimmer of hope started to shine during the final quarter of last year. Its daily user total stabilized, and the habitual losses finally began to shrink.It's far from an ironclad turnaround, but it has been enough to spark over a 70% rebound from its December low.Like Snap, beauty company  (NYSE:  ) is a name many investors had given up on. Shares fell 80% between early 2016 and the end of last year, mostly in response to an uninterrupted streak of declining revenue and shrinking profits.It's another name, however, that may have turned a corner nobody was expecting it to. COTY stock is up nearly 80% since its late December low, with most of that gain spurred by last quarter's revenue and earnings. Both  .Bonus:  , setting the stage for some much-needed change in how the organization is managed. Bolstering the bullish argument is this week's report that  is  at its current price.Yes, the name behind popular casual gaming titles like  ,  and  is still alive and kicking, even though its top games have largely run their course. In fact,  (NASDAQ:  ) CEO Frank Gibeau  \"Zynga's turnaround is now complete,\" referencing last year's 5% improvement in revenue, leading into more earnings growth for this year.The key has been a successful transition to mobile. Mobile engagement now  , and Zynga has made a point of developing or acquiring the right games to engage players where they want to play. Its purchase of Gram and Small Giant gave it  and  , respectively, and both have been needed hits.ZNGA stock is up 24% year-to-date after a lackluster 2018.Despite Tuesday's 9% setback,  (NASDAQ:  ) shares are still up over 25% for the year so far, unwinding what has been a pretty miserable past few months.The stock's budding turnaround was largely prompted by hope for major progress this year. At the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference held very early this year, Nektar announced several ambitious goals for the year, including the  .Investors also gave the company a little credit for the launch of a couple early-stage trials of autoimmune drug NKTR-358, which has drawn the interest of  (NYSE:  ). Though its NKTR-214  , the market may be thinking it treated NKTR stock too harshly in response. (NASDAQ:  ) isn't exactly a household name, though it may have a place in some portfolios.The company is predominantly an automobile auction outfit, able to handle sales of fleet vehicles as well as it can offload cars for individuals. It's especially well known as a buyer of junked or un-drivable cars and a seller of salvageable parts.It's an interesting business. Whereas automobile manufacturers like  (NYSE:  ) or  (NYSE:  ) are now facing the downside of 2015's so-called \"peak auto,\" in many regards that's proven beneficial for Copart. The cars those drivers replaced had to be dealt with somehow, and given that most of Copart's auctions are consigned auctions, the company has a plentiful, low-to-no cost supply of inventory. Mostly though, it's a non-cyclical business that's expected to grow revenue by 10% this year.CPRT stock may only be up about 10% so far this year, but it was one of the hardest-hit U.S. stocks during the fourth quarter. That leaves plenty of room for more recovery. (NASDAQ:  ) is a manufacturer of equipment and supplies for the dentistry industry \u2026 a boring lineup that has been reasonably consistent (even if not perfect) in terms of revenue growth.That reliability did the stock little good for the better part of last year. Between its January high and October low, XRAY stock was cut in half, primarily due to  that most investors didn't expect. By the time all was said and done, shares reached a seven-year low in the latter part of last year.Though some degree of selling was certainly understandable, the bears arguably overshot. The 26% rebound since the end of October says investors are correcting their mistake in front of what should be a turnaround year. Analysts are only calling for about 2% sales growth in 2019, but that should be enough to improve per-share profits by 11%.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)There was a time not too long ago when investors and consumers were wondering if  (NYSE:  ) would ever shrug off the impact of its  . Consumers were anything but quick to forget and forgive.Last quarter's results, however, suggest the new mix of management may be just what the struggling Tex-Mex eatery needed.  , while total revenue grew 10% thanks to store openings. Perhaps most compelling of all, however, was the earnings beat. Analysts were calling for a profit of $1.37 per share, but Chipotle reported income of $1.72 per share.There's still work to be done, to be sure. But, the work that's been done so far has been enough to drive CMG stock to a 40% gain since the end of last year. (NYSE:  ) has had a surprisingly tough past three years, although most of that pain played out while it was still called Valeant Pharmaceuticals \u2026 the company that racked up too much debt buying small-market drugs only to find  on its aggressive pricing policies at the worst possible time. With the proverbial party abruptly coming to a close in late 2015, Valeant shares lost roughly 97% of their value between July of 2015 and mid-2017.It's curious though. With very little fanfare despite measurable (albeit slow) fiscal progress, BHC stock has made nothing but higher lows and higher highs since the middle of 2017.The 47% gain from its December low is exaggerated thanks to the steep pullback preceding that reversals, but the bullish high-low pattern has become pretty reliable.By the middle of 2017, the athletic apparel industry - and the athletic shoe industry in particular - was in trouble. Celebrity endorsements had become gratuitous and expensive, peaking right as consumers grew tired of paying big prices just to wear the same sneakers that stars like Kevin Durant and LeBron James wear.Mike Packer, owner of  ,  , saying \"Over the last two years, companies have taken retro basketball and in-line product and spun off too many colors, too many stories. \u2026 Some of these models are being brought to market for their third or fourth time. It loses the allure.\"The shift took its toll on  (NYSE:  ) stock. Shares tumbled more than 60% in 2017.Things have been different in the meantime, however. Realizing it has to get back to basics and work strategically with key suppliers like  (NYSE:  ), the retailer has hammered out enough improvements to drive a 20% gain from its December low.

In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Copart currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.63%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's nex  to be released on February 25, 2019.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 225 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new August 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $42.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $47.08/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CPRT stock at the current price level of $47.08/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.64% if the stock gets called away at the August 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CPRT shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CPRT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Shares have lost about 6.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Copart due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Copart reported adjusted earnings per share of 47 cents in first-quarter fiscal 2019 (ended Oct 31, 2018), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the bottom line was 33 cents.Net income was $114.1 million, reflecting an increase of 47.2% or $36.6 million from first-quarter fiscal 2018.Copart's revenues rose 10.1% to $461.4 million from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $459 million. Compared with the prior-year quarter, service revenues increased to $394.8 million from $374.1 million. Revenues from vehicle sales were $66.6 million in comparison with $45 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Gross profit improved 20% to $195.9 million from $163.3 million a year ago. Total operating expenses increased to $310 million from $295.2 million recorded in the prior-year period.Operating income increased to $151.4 million from $124 million a year ago.Copart had cash and cash equivalents of $320.3 million as of Oct 31, 2018, compared with $274.5 million as of Jul 31, 2018. Long-term debt, revolving loan facility and capital lease obligations were $398.6 million as of Oct 31, 2018, similar to the figure recorded on Jul 31, 2018.At the end of three months of fiscal 2019, Copart generated net cash flow of $107.7 million from operations compared with $93.4 million in the year-ago period.It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.At this time, Copart has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["omentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Copart currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CPRT that show why this auctioneer of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For CPRT, shares are up 0.04% over the past week while the Zacks Auction and Valuation Services industry is down 3.24% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.59% compares favorably with the industry's 7.54% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Copart have risen 0.95%, and are up 16.74% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved -0.71% and -2.3%, respectively.Investors should also take note of CPRT's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, CPRT is averaging 1,117,434 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CPRT.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CPRT's consensus estimate, increasing from $2.11 to $2.12 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CPRT is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Copart on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

From the beginning of 2018 till Oct 31, the company opened 6 locations across Europe and the United States apart from acquiring companies with existing locations. Sufficient auction locations aid Copart to add more cars in inventories and sell those at auctions, thus, driving the company's revenues.Further, the company sees good growth opportunities in the European market, majorly across Germany and Western Europe. This impelled Copart to invest and add or open locations on this continent. In first-quarter fiscal 2019, it added six locations in Germany. During the same time frame, the company had fifteen locations in the United Kingdom. These locations are expected to aid the company's growth in Europe's competitive marketplace as well as drive its top line. | In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Copart's earnings and revenues surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's global unit sales rose 4.1% year over year, with the United States contributing a positive 2.4% and international unit contributing 14.3%. Internationally, growth was driven by the United Kingdom and Germany.However, too much presence in international markets makes the company vulnerable to foreign currency fluctuations and country-specific policy threats. During the first quarter, Copart's year-over-year revenue growth was partly offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar in comparison with the pound and Brazilian real.The company's general and administrative expenses witnessed 13.1% year-over-year rise to $44.5 million. Out of the total amount, growth initiatives in the United States cost $37.3 million while internationally, Europe's business expansion cost $1.5 million. Additionally, over the past year, three hurricanes have increased average cost per vehicle for Copart. Continuous rise in expenses might hamper the company's profit margin.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Copart's earnings in fiscal 2019 has edged down 0.5%. Further, over the past three months, shares of the company have lost 9.4% compared with the  's decline of 11%.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For the iShares Edge MSCI USA Size Factor ETF (Symbol: SIZE), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $95.03 per unit.With SIZE trading at a recent price near $82.97 per unit, that means that analysts see 14.53% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SIZE's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Copart Inc (Symbol: CPRT), Cognex Corp (Symbol: CGNX), and Johnson Controls International plc (Symbol: JCI). Although CPRT has traded at a recent price of $48.73/share, the average analyst target is 16.29% higher at $56.67/share. Similarly, CGNX has 15.06% upside from the recent share price of $40.85 if the average analyst target price of $47.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting JCI to reach a target price of $38.33/share, which is 14.80% above the recent price of $33.39. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CPRT, CGNX, and JCI:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n  \nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

The  ended Friday's action at 2632.56, down 0.66% to cap off a sizable full-week loss and log the lowest close since May.Doing the bulk of the net damage was  (NASDAQ:  ), falling 2.5% most only the heels of news that it was  in Japan due to poor sales.  (NYSE:  ) technically logged the bigger loss, however, closing 3%, making its lowest close since 2009 as the market increasingly prices in rising odds that it won't be able to dig its way out of its hole.There were some winners.  (NYSE:  ) gained 9.2% after  its acquisition by  (NYSE:  ). There were just fewer winners than losers on Friday, however, leaving most stock charts poised to move even lower even if the broad market is ripe for a bounce. Among the most noteworthy names on the verge of even bigger trouble are  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). Here's why.In mid-October, Visa looked like it was in trouble, only to turn things around right before falling under the pivotal 200-day moving average line. That bounce effort has petered out again though, letting V shares slide back below the 200-day line.This time, though, the event is framed by an even uglier backdrop. A rebound is even less likely now, and there's plenty of room for more selling.Click to Enlarge \u2022 The weekly chart of V stock puts things in perspective. The 2017/2018 runup was impressive, but left the credit card middleman's stock vulnerable to profit-taking. Friday's close below the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white, is a marked beginning of that kind of move.\u2022 On the daily chart, we've already seen or are nearing key bearish crosses of moving average lines. In particular, the pink 50-day moving average line is about to move below the 100-day moving average line.\u2022 The most plausible landing points, if this selling keeps going, are the Fibonacci retracement line at $121.70 or March's turbulence around $116.Back in early October, Copart shares tried to turn things around from a rough September, but were struggling to do so. Namely, after falling under it in September, CPRT shares  that's plotted in white on the daily chart.Since then, Copart has broken under the technical support level around $51, marked with a dashed line. Worse, that floor has since been defined as a ceiling that's giving the bears a chance to regroup and set the stage for another bearish leg.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 Though capped under $51, the falling 50-day moving average line, marked in purple, is bearing down fast. The next bump of that line could shake CPRT out of its sideways range.\u2022 The slowdown in the selling isn't a complete surprise. The recent lows are right around the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line at $47.80, which is based off of the major low in early 2016 and this year's high.\u2022 The trigger for the next wave of selling may well be a break below October's low around $46.20, plotted with a red dashed line.Finally, with just a quick glance, Paypal Holdings shares look like they're just going through a volatile patch. And, maybe that's all this is.Given all the bearish crossunders of key moving average lines we've seen since October, though, it might be wise to respect the possibility that the undertow has changed direction. One more downward move could break a key technical floor and open the selling floodgates.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 The technical support line in question is currently at $75.77, but rising slowly. The floor, plotted with a red dashed line, has tagged most of the major lows going back to late last year.\u2022 In the meantime, the purple 50-day moving average line has fallen below the gray 100-day average, and is on the verge of moving below the white 200-day moving average line \u2026 a so-called death cross.\u2022 The weekly chart not only puts it all in perspective, but also shows where the next potential support level is. It's the $69.50 area, where PYPL found support several times a few months ago, and where the 38.2% retracement line presently lies.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["onic Automotive, Inc.

The stock has moved down 17.3% compared with 15.5% decline recorded by the industry during the period. | Let's see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Copart has been growing its network of facilities to manage increasing volume. Apart from North America, the company has been expanding its footprint in Germany and western Europe. During the to-be-reported quarter, it planned to open numerous locations, both in the domestic and international markets. Further, strong used-car price environment will help Copart drive its revenues.However, continuous rise in general and administrative (G&A) expenses is hampering the company's margin. This rise is primarily due to the acquisition of National Powersport Auctions and the buyout of AVK - a Finland-based salvage auto auction company - in March 2018. A similar trend is expected to continue in the coming quarters, owing to inflation and increase in Copart's business complexity.Additionally, the company's exposure to international markets makes it vulnerable to currency fluctuations and country-specific policy threats.Our proven model does not conclusively predict earnings beat for Copart this quarter.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 20, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This auctioneer of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +39.4%.Revenues are expected to be $458.48 million, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.32% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Copart, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -11.51%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Copart will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Copart would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.42, delivering a surprise of -10.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Copart doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new January 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $43.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $47.98/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 73%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.33% return on the cash commitment, or 20.62% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of CPRT stock at the current price level of $47.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.27% if the stock gets called away at the January 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CPRT shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CPRT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

(NASDAQ: CPRT)Q1 2019 Nov. 21, 2018 , Good day, everyone and welcome to the Copart Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal 2019 . Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, Chantelle. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the first quarter conference call for Copart fiscal 2019. It's my pleasure at this point to turn it over to Jeff, who will go through the financials. We will then come back to Will, who will give you an update on US, International and then I will give you an update on what is happening in Germany since there's a lot of changes going on there and pass that to Jeff as well. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff. -- Thanks, Jay. I'll start today's call with the Safe Harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of disposals of non-operating assets, foreign currency related gains and losses, and certain income tax benefits related to accounting for stock option exercises. We've provided the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above.In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf.Turning our attention first to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we achieved a record first quarter in unit sales revenue, gross profit, and operating income. The period presents a somewhat noisy comparison in comparison to the first quarter of last year given the events of Hurricane Harvey last year and Florence and Michael this year. We'll provide metrics during this call with and without those events to provide you a cleaner comparison. Starting at the top line, our global (ph) revenue grew 10.1% year-over-year. Excluding those three hurricanes I just mentioned, revenue would have been 15.1% instead. We were burdened by an unfavorable year-over-year currency effect on revenue of $0.3 million on foreign operations primarily due to the relative strength of the US dollar in comparison to the pound and the Brazilian real. Our global service revenue grew (ph) 5.5%. Again, excluding those three hurricanes, global service revenue would have grown at 11% instead. Purchase (ph) (technical difficulty) was 48%, split approximately equally between US and internationally in terms of the absolute growth. The growth in US was driven by a mix of things including NPA and CoCorrect (ph).Internationally, our growth was driven by the (technical difficulty). As you know from following Copart, our actual Copart owned inventory is still relatively modest with $19.7 million (ph) at quarter-end, small in the context of our overall business since (technical difficulty) is reflected in the gross value while (technical difficulty) revenue reflects only the net. Our global unit sales grew 4.1% year-over-year with US unit growth of 2.4% and international unit growth of 14.3% (ph). Excluding those three hurricanes, our global unit sales growth would have been 5.6% with US growth at 4.2% and the international growth, of course, unchanged. Our nominal global inventory decreased year-over-year at 1.5%, but excluding those three hurricanes, our global inventory was up 10% year-over-year in comparing the October ending balance versus the October ending balance of a year ago.Turning to our gross profit. Gross profit grew from $163.3 million a year ago to $195.9 million this year or 20% growth. As you may recall, the first quarter of '18 was burdened by Hurricane Harvey, which represented a net drag on the quarter of $17.2 million of the gross profit line. The first quarter of '19 is likewise burdened by expenses related to Hurricane's Florence and Michael which collectively represented $4 million of gross profit loss in the quarter. We have not treated this event as I quote, extraordinary event. We believe that storm readiness and response is an essential service that we provide to our customers and although catastrophic events tend to be unprofitable for Copart and in the case of major storms like these, substantially so, we believe our commitment to exceptional service in these events distinguishes Copart from the competition.Excluding these three events from gross profit in both periods would have yielded gross profit growth of 11% or meaningful leverage on our unit growth of 5.6%. Our gross margin rate increased from 39% to 42.5% for an increase of 350 basis points. That, of course, includes the burden of Hurricane Harvey a year ago as well as Florence and Michael this year. Excluding all three of those events, gross margin rate would have declined slightly, approximately 180 basis points with a strong majority of that decline attributable to the mix shift in purchased cars. On ASPs, I'll provide just a quick headline with Will to provide much more color thereafter. Our ASPs grew 13.1% in the US despite lapping a strong ASP growth quarter a year ago in the first quarter of '18 of also 13% or thereabouts.Turning to our general and administrative expenses ex-stock compensation and depreciation grew from $29.5 million a year ago to $34.8 million. US growth in this respect of $3.8 million largely related to costs associated with supporting our growth initiatives as well as certain litigation costs and a $1.5 million increase internationally is largely related to the expansion of our European business. As we have repeatedly said, our general and administrative expenses will grow over time with inflation and complexity, but we continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage over time given strong top line growth. Our GAAP operating income grew from a $123.9 million to $151.4 million or growth of 22%. Excluding the hurricanes, operating income would have grown an approximate 10% year-over-year. Our net interest expense was down due to a lower net debt balance. Our first quarter income tax rate of 23.3% is a reflection of the lower US federal tax rate you heard us talk about on prior calls. We are now at a 21% US federal tax rate for the full fiscal year '19.Our GAAP net income increased from $77.5 million a year ago to $114.1 million this year or growth of 47% year-over-year. As I'm sure you recall, we experienced a somewhat complex quarter in the fourth quarter. The first quarter is relatively straightforward in comparison with very limited non-GAAP adjustments to net income and therefore the net income of $77.1 million a year ago in comparison to $113.6 million this year is similar with growth of 47% year-over-year.One last topic, turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, I'll pause here to talk about revenue recognition 606 or the Rev 606 new accounting standard. This is the first quarter in which we've implemented those new revenue recognition principles, which reflects largely a reversion to how Copart previously accounted for its revenue, prior to the implementation of Rev 605 in fiscal 2011. So under the new accounting standard, to oversimplify, we will largely recognize revenue in connection with a particular vehicle at the time of its auction, including for example services we provide with respect to inbound towing, entitled processing. The one-time cumulative adjustment to retained earnings is a reduction of $23 million. Certain revenue and corresponding costs that had been recognized in Q4 and previously under the prior accounting standards are now recognized in Q1 and beyond while revenue and corresponding costs that previously would have been recognized in Q1 are instead deferred to Q2 and beyond. The long and short of it is that the net effect on our P&L in Q1 was not material in terms of either revenue or our profit metrics. The new revenue recognition standards also affect our balance sheet in non-cash ways. For example, because we will not recognize revenue as earned until the time of auction as a general matter, certain of our accounts receivables that we would previously have booked in Q1 will now instead be booked in Q2. So on our balance sheet, you'll see the AR balance will nominally reflect a decrease of $60 million (ph), but the change in cash from the cash flow statement on accounts receivable of $29.3 million is a more accurate reflection of like-for-like AR (ph) growth year-over-year. The same logic applies to vehicle pooling costs, we will now defer more of our costs into Q2 and have quoted (ph) deferred costs from Q4 that we've now recognized in Q1 in subsequent periods. As a result, VPC growth on our balance sheet of $39 million significantly outpaces like-for-like VPC growth of $13.6 million as reflected in our cash flow statement.On cash flow itself, we generated operating cash flow for the quarter of $107.7 million with CapEx of $62 million and change, a little over half, call (ph) it 55% of our CapEx was attributable to capacity expansion and lease buyouts with the balance attributable to yard equipment, IT and other. And with that, I'll turn it over to Will for more color on the business. -- Thank you Jeff and I'll provide a few comments about our operational performance for the quarter where we once again delivered a very strong quarter. In the US, our volume grew by 4.3% when adjusted for all cat activity, which includes Hurricane Harvey last year and Hurricane's Florence and Michael this year. Our volume growth continues to be driven by organic growth and market wins within the insurance market and a continued expansion into the non-insurance markets. Organic growth in the salvage market continues to be driven by we believe an increase in total loss frequency as high repair costs are leading to a higher percentage of accidents resulting in an economic total loss. We continue to aggressively develop our non-insurance business, which include franchise and independent dealers, finance companies and leasing companies, fleets, charities, municipalities, equipment dealers and wholesalers. The growth in volume was spread broadly across multiple seller segments. Volume from dealers was up 29%, finance companies 11%, wholesalers 54%, rental car companies 30%, and fleet and industrial equipment up 77%.The only segments in which we experienced declines were charities and municipalities as we intentionally restricted our sales and marketing activities in these low profit segments. We have successfully grown our non-insurance volume as we develop better systems integration into fleet, bank and dealership operating systems, developed a more focused internal programs targeting the specific operational needs of individual segments as we continue to increase the returns that we're delivering to our non-insurance sellers. In total, our US non-insurance volume grew by 14% and 44% over the same quarter last year and the same quarter two years ago. However, excluding charities and municipalities, our non-insurance volume grew by 30% and 116% for the same quarters. In total, non-insurance business represented approximately 25% of our total US volume.In the US, our service revenue per car, excluding the impact of Harvey on a quarter basis was up almost 6%. The increase in revenue per car was due primarily to higher ASPs, which grew by 12.7% as more than half of our total revenue per car is tied to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle. The increase in ASPs were driven by a number of factors: a 4.5% increase in the value of used cars as measured by the Manheim Index, which in October reached the 140 mark for the first time, a 15.2% increase in the value of crushed car bodies, beneficial mix of cars sold as non-insurance cars of the powersports vehicles are generally run and drive and yield a higher selling price, the increase of our digital marketing activity, and the continuing trend of insurance companies totaling newer, more valuable and less severely damaged vehicles.We continue to expand our remarketing activities and to enhance our auction platform. On a quarter-over basis, the number of unique bidders was up almost 25% and the increase the number of bids received per lot was up almost 6%. Our outreach to international buyers continues. Our US website is now translated into seven languages. These languages are native to 135 countries. We now sell cars from our US yards to 147 countries. Despite the headwinds caused by the stronger dollar, buying activity from international buyers on a quarter-over basis increased. Total sales to international buyers was over 23%. When we include all export activity including buyers with domestic addresses who only export, our international market represents over 34% of all (ph) units sold. We believe these activities contributed to the record US ASPs and auction return percentages.Now turning to our international operations. Our revenue grew from $68 million to $90.2 million or 32.5%. International service revenues grew from $42.7 million to $51.2 million or 19.9%. Our purchase car revenue grew from $25.3 million to $38.9 million or 53.9%. EBIT grew from $17.9 million to $21.1 million or 18% as purchase car revenue inherently yields a lower margin per vehicle. Volume grew by 14.3% driven primarily by growth in the UK, Germany, and Brazil. Jeff and Jay will provide far more detailed comments on our progress in Germany later in the call.Globally, we are seeing rising diesel fuel prices, labor and health insurance cost. Nevertheless, when adjusting for the abnormal costs associated with Hurricane Harvey last year and Hurricane's Florence and Michael this year, our average cost to process each car grew by only 2.7% in the US and 3.5% worldwide over the same quarter last year. In total, the incremental costs this quarter associated with Hurricane's Florence and Michael was approximately $4.3 million. To provide the CAT support our insurance customers come to expect, we must make financial commitments early in the CAT process. Accordingly, before the storm hits, we obtain and we stage equipment and people. We obtain additional land capacity and we arrange for additional sub-haul (ph) capacity. We do this on a scale appropriate for the worst possible scenario. For hurricane's Florence and Michael, we relocated 180 people, 75 loaders (ph), we arranged for an additional 500 trucks for sub-haul capacity and we committed to 17 new temporary property leases. We'd like to acknowledge the outstanding work of our CAT teams and to reinforce Copart's continued commitment to supporting our insurance customers during all CAT activity. Our CAT adjusted inventory was up in the US, internationally and worldwide by 10.4%, 14.1% and 10.9% respectively.The growth in US inventories suggest a continuation of a double-digit quarterly volume growth expectations. Accordingly, we remain extremely active in our yard expansion program to accommodate the growth and in support of our effort to provide permanent CAT capacity in CAT regions. During the last quarter, we entered into 21 land purchase and lease contracts. We closed on 11 contracts. In North America, we are currently engaged in 26 land development projects representing over 1,200 acres of capacity. That concludes my brief comments. Now we'll turn the call back over to our CEO, Jay Adair for further comment. -- Thank you, Will. Good morning again everyone. Before we discuss Germany, I'd like to give you an overview of the UK. We knew 15 years ago that we need to be a global business to win. We entered the UK in June of 2007 with an acquisition of a small company that had three locations called Century Salvage. Shortly after that, we purchased Universal Salvage giving us nine locations across the UK. Today, we have 15 locations allow us to pick up quickly and economically across the UK. To win, we knew we needed a network of locations. We grew the business organically by winning new business, by opening additional yards, and through some future acquisitions.For those of you that have followed us over the years, you know that we used to act as principal on the vast majority of the insurance cars that we sold in the UK. At the beginning, we didn't have the track record in the UK that we obviously had in the US. So we were happy to buy cars and make money in the process. Over time, we simply showed the carriers the favorable spreads that we were generating on our trades and in doing that, they shifted to a consignment model instead of selling their vehicles to us. We do this because it is better to be on the side of our customers as a partner rather than as a vendor purchasing vehicles. Now, Copart UK is the number one place to go to buy a salvage vehicle in the UK, selling well over 300,000 units a year and generating the highest returns in the market.To deliver on the Copart promise, in Germany, we have a network of yards, a marketplace, people, and the technology to deliver on that promise and I'm happy to say that we're there today in Germany. Because Will is focused on running the US, Jeff has been able to spend a lot of time working on Germany to get us to this point. So I'd like to turn it over to Jeff now to give you an update on the German operations and I'd like to thank all those that were involved in the last six months in Germany on making the success that we've seen happen for Copart. Jeff? -- Thanks, Jay. On the topic of Germany, Germany you've heard piecemeal from us of course over the years and as promised on the first quarter call, we wanted to take this opportunity to describe the opportunity and our status in greater detail. I'll start first with a description of the German industry more broadly. The German insurance market -- auto insurance market operates very differently from the UK and the US with respect to total loss claims. In the US for example, when you as a covered policyholder total your car, the insurance company effectively buys the car from you and what happens thereafter is invisible. As you know, the insurance company then consigns the car through Copart and keeps the proceeds of the auction.In Germany by contrast, nearly every car in an accident, even a mangled one, is owner retained. So when an accident occurs, the insurance company estimates how much value the policyholder has lost by comparing the pre-accident value or PAV of the car with a post-accident residual value of the vehicle and pays the policyholder that loss of value. How does the insurance company assess that post-accident value? The carrier registers the car on multiple listing services. In effect, miniature auctions on which buyers bid for vehicles. The insurance company generally then chooses the highest bid from across all of these listing services to be the quote residual value from which the indemnity payment is calculated and then paid to the policyholder. The policyholder then has a 21-day option period to sell the vehicle to the listing service auction quote winner at the residual value just established, but there's a catch, these listing services are a really tough experience for the buyers themselves.First, the buyers are obligated to honor their bids for a full 21 days after bidding tying up their capital. Second, the buyers have the obligation to buy the car, but the owner of the vehicle does not have an obligation to sell it to them creating a fairly severe adverse selection problem. And thirdly, perhaps most importantly, they will ultimately close on fewer than one in 10 vehicles on which they are the quote winning bidder on a listing service. That makes it impossible to plan their own dismantling and rebuilding business and of course, it further complicates tying up capital on cars you largely won't win. So the punch line is that buyers are constrained by their capital and how many vehicles they can bid on and given adverse selection, will bid depressed values for cars.So who ultimately loses in this inefficient process? Insurance carriers are establishing their indemnity payments or their financial losses on claims based on what is an artificially depressed residual value. The cost is paid by them and ultimately by German policyholders who have to cover excess loss costs with their premiums.We'll then turn our attention to Copart Germany's evolution. In 2012, recognizing that we needed to understand the market firsthand, we acquired Wreck Online Marketplace, one of the leading listing services in Germany. Then in 2016, we opened our first auction location in Germany in Bad Fallingbostel near Hanover. In our last , we talked about evolving our strategy in Germany as well. That evolution in short is as follows: we intend to pursue insurance company consignments in parallel with our efforts to purchase cars in our listing service. In the past, when we've entered new markets as Jay just described, in the UK for example in 2007 and in the charities business in the US, we have sometimes established our presence by buying cars first. We intend to move very quickly to build the infrastructure that advantages Copart in our more mature market, that includes the land that enables us to store cars efficiently, I'll talk more about land in a moment, trucks in a geographic footprint enables us to tow cars economically, and vehicle auction volume that attracts buyers and sellers alike.In 2018 so far, we have announced our next six locations. That physical footprint is critical because it enables fast pickup across the entire country and a central capability in a competitive marketplace for cars. It enables cost efficient pickups. As you've heard us describe in the US in the past, every yard reduces towing costs and improves pickup times because every yard is closer to some of the cars than (ph) our current network would be. And lastly it's worth noting the importance of buyer convenience because the majority of the cars that we sell through Copart Germany auctions are purchased by foreign buyers outside of Germany. Having yards enables our buyers to accumulate vehicles and pick them up more efficiently in larger batches.Regarding our progress beyond land, we are purchasing and selling vehicles in Germany at a meaningful positive spread at our Copart auction locations. Every car we buy and sell adds to our knowledge base and improves our ability to buy and sell the next subsequent car. Our intention is to run bi-weekly auctions at each of the sites we have announced with more to come. We're hiring staff for our yards as well as drivers for our trucking network. We use a combination of owned trucks and third-party sub-haulers to build out our logistics network. We've deployed our next generation IT system which we call COBALT (ph) in Germany as well.Ultimately, we believe that the strategy we're pursuing in Germany is broadly applicable with some local refinements to the other large economies in Western Europe. We started with a buyer in Germany and let's finish there as well. For the first time in Germany, the Copart Germany model will deliver an actual certain auction process. A buyer who bids on a car and provides the highest bid on a vehicle will ultimately own the car. We, for the buyers benefit, now have the logistics benefit of multiple locations at which a buyer can store cars until they officially pick them up.As a general practice over the past 25 years or so, we tend to tell you what we've done after the fact as opposed to promising it in advance. We'll continue to honor that approach in general, but we recognize that Germany and Western Europe are substantial enough opportunities to warrant a more substantial check in as we have provided today. We look forward to growing our business in Germany for many years to come. We're energized by the progress and momentum in Germany thus far and are excited by the size of the opportunities ahead of us. With that, we'll turn it back to the moderator for Q&A.Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Craig Kennison, Baird. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for the terrific summary on Germany. I had a question on the consumer experience in Germany. How does a German consumer find out about Copart or your listing service and is there anything you need to do to promote the service in ways that you don't have to promote it in the US? -- The consumer, Craig, I would argue is a participant today in the total loss process as you heard us just describe, the insurance carrier provides them with the indemnification payment for their loss, then hands them the details of an offer provided by a third-party. It's then the consumer's responsibility to orchestrate that subsequent sale of the car to that winning bidder from the listing service. So if anything in Germany today, the consumer is arguably too involved in that process. You can imagine they are trying to orchestrate the sale of a one-off vehicle from your home or from a repair shop to an individual you have never known in the past and will never see again in the future who may in fact even be picking up a car from a foreign country is a complicated endeavor. I don't think that Copart's branding among consumers is essential in Germany. I think building our network and building our credibility with insurance companies and certainly with buyers which I think you know we already have tremendous credibility with the international buyer base. That's much more important than winning the hearts and minds of the consumers individually. -- So if you think of all of the totaled cars in Germany, to what extent are you getting a listing opportunity on those cars? What's your market share of listing opportunities if you will in Germany? -- That's frankly hard to quantify, Craig, in part because for every car that does experience a severe accident like that, carriers generally speaking will list the car on multiple services, WOM or Wreck Online Marketplace, the business I described a few moments ago is certainly one of the handful of clear market leaders. So, our market share position I described is strong without being able to quantify precisely. -- And then the final question on Germany here, just obviously you are purchasing a higher percentage of cars there at a more or less kick-start liquidity. Can you give us a feel for the economics of that and how quickly you can turn a car. So if you invest, you know, a few thousand dollars in a car, how quickly does that car turn over? And thank you. -- It turns over reasonably quickly. The timing process is certainly not more complicated than it is in the US for example so the turnover isn't a challenge per se. The economics I think the punch line is that we have been able to buy the cars on these listing services, subject to the same adverse selection problems I just described for the marketplace broadly, then turn and sell them at Copart Germany and earn positive profits in the process of doing so. I think that the sample size at this point is probably not large enough to provide a very detailed unit economic P&L picture, but the punch line is we are able to make money as evidence then that the current listing service model is inefficient and costing carriers and policyholders more than it should. -- Thanks for the detailed overview. -- Thanks, Craig.Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Bob Labick, CJS Securities.Lee Jagoda for Bob. Good morning. -- Good morning.So just following up on Germany, I take it you guys have about 11 new yards in Germany today. What do you think you need to be fully built out in Germany and how long do you think that, that process could take before we see multiple insurers actually buy in? -- Okay, well we've announced to date eight locations correct? -- Seven. -- Seven, OK. We've announced seven locations and we will end up announcing 12 by the time we're done. I would argue we've got enough of a network now we can handle cars. So we've got more than enough capacity. We can pick vehicles up quickly and we're not picking them up economically yet, but we'll be there very soon, I'd say within 90 days, we'll have the economics right that we'll be happy with what is costing to get a vehicle picked up. The next step is the marketplace, so we're -- by acquiring all these vehicles as Jeff said, we're getting a strong feel for what they're worth so we can be even more competitive buying more vehicles and making a spread on those vehicles. So that will improve, but what's more important than really buying vehicles and making a spread is that we're creating a marketplace where our customers when they come to Copart, they're guaranteed to get that car.This isn't about going on a platform and one out of 100 times I submit a bid, I end up getting the car because most of the time I'm out-bid, I don't know it, and then when I am high bidder, the insured decides not to sell it to me because they flip it to the dealer or to somebody else, so through adverse selection. So this is a sure thing, guaranteed that when I bid on Copart, I will get the car. All of our auctions or I should say the majority of the cars that we're selling at auction are not on reserve. So there are no reserve auctions or if you bid, you own it. So that has been our focus, our focus has not been on getting insurance companies to come onboard yet, because it's about building the network, it's about building the logistics, it's about having the marketplace where buyers are coming every single day and finding product and buying that product and by doing all that through our people and our technology, we'll then go to insurance companies and show them our spreads, very similar to what I said in my opening comments that we're going to show them the spreads we're making and say why don't you just processing it this way instead of doing it through the platforms.Additionally, as Jeff said and this is one of the biggest parts to me, it's not only that we think there's money being left on the table due to an inefficient marketplace and that's why they list -- literally there are major insurers that list on all three of the major platforms because they'll get different bids through the platforms. So that piece is important, but to me what's more important is that you're -- in Germany, you are telling the insurer that your vehicle is worth EUR30,000 prior to the accident, it's now worth EUR10,000 after the accident, you are giving him a check for EUR20,000 and telling them to dispose of the vehicle to a buyer that they have no idea what the process is. So, not only do they have the option of selling to that buyer, but then they've got someone that is at the shop or maybe the vehicle is at their home and they've got an adjuster that's talking to them and they are an appraiser and they are working all these to figure out who should I sell the vehicle to in the end and have to deal with that. So, it clearly is our belief that if they are given a check for EUR30,000 and the vehicle is picked up and disposed of and they never have to deal with it, it's a far superior customer experience from the insurance company's perspective and from the insured's perspective.That makes all the sense in the world. Just so I'm clear though, how many if any insurance companies are currently participating on your platform today and as outsiders what are the next milestones we should be looking for? -- Yes, we have a few, I'd say three maybe four customers that are starting to utilize the website now to sell vehicles, but it's not in any way material yet, they are more wanting to try some recovered theft vehicles, some hail damage vehicles et cetera to dispose those vehicles. There's a transformation that has to take place where they're not just dealing with inventory that they're stuck with in the sense of recovered theft or hail damage, but that they actually say that this is the process going forward and again I can't -- I really can't state it enough, Jeff and I and the rest of the team have been making a number of trips to Germany in the last six months and I can't tell you how confident I am that we're going to see insurers that will switch to the process. It's just -- the numbers don't lie. When you look at the returns we're getting on vehicles and you see the amount of times that the insured sells the vehicles somewhere other than the platform, those two combined plus the experience for the customer I think you're going to see in the next six months some customers switching their process and converting to Copart and the Copart model.Good, that sounds great. Thank you very much for the color. -- You're welcome.Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust. -- Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just kind of wanted to go back in again on Germany and kind of thinking through here obviously there's a lot that's been done in the last year from building infrastructure, the IT system and just what I'm assuming a lot of investments in the initiative. So just kind of we think going forward should we be expecting significantly more investments or are we this is kind of the run rate and to kind of look at it this point going forward or just kind of trying to get a gauge on where we are from just an investment standpoint. And then lastly, I just kind of wanted to follow up on the last question in just thinking about if you have received any push back from insurance companies or any reason so far where maybe they're just not getting it or why they wouldn't immediately switch just considering the returns you can show them. That would be great. Thanks, again. -- Thanks, Stephanie. I think as you know, we tend not to provide any forward-looking guidance on any aspect of our P&L, revenue, cost or otherwise, but in short I think you can tell from this description today that we have made real strides in Germany, but still have meaningful growth aspirations from here as well. So certainly our hope is that we are investing much more capital because that's a reflection then of ongoing growth in the business. I don't think we're prepared to quantify that for you in any way quick (ph). As for your second question about any resistance from the insurance carriers, I don't think there is a lack of willingness or interest. I think the point is that a model like the one in Germany has evolved for a reason and there are tax and regulatory and commercial practices that have been long-standing in Germany. This is a radically different model, I think very clearly superior, but it certainly will take time to prove to them as Jay was describing to you the principal car purchase path that the economics are overwhelming and so there is no resistance per se, I'd say strong interest, strong curiosity in our model. -- Great, I appreciate the color. Thanks again.Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Daniel Imbro, Stephens Inc. -- Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up -- a quick one on Germany. You know I think you guys mentioned there are three major platforms in the German market, but given the higher returns that you're generating with your model, do any of the incumbent players have the ability or desire to change strategy as they see you guys succeeding in that market? -- We haven't seen any indication that they are -- that they have the desire and I think we have a fairly strong reason (ph) they wouldn't have the ability regardless. So recall that a majority of the buyers at Copart Germany today are international. So that's on the backs of Copart's global reputation on the back of Copart's already established international buyer base. If somebody tried to replicate that from scratch solely for the purposes of having a more competitive listing service in Germany, I think that would be a tall order. So no, there's no indication that they have endeavored to do so and some skepticism anyway on our part that they could. -- Okay, and then staying over there in Europe, with Brexit and the UK right now, can you maybe just talk through how you guys think different outcomes could play out in your business or for one, what percentage of the UK business is exported to Continental Europe and how a potential Brexit outcome could change or disrupt your UK operations? -- I think you saw some disruption a couple of years ago and a year ago with wild currency fluctuations. That certainly affects our business as you know in multiple ways and so when the pound is weaker, the earnings are reflected in our P&L at a much lower US dollar rate. That said, I think Brexit clearly remains very much a TBD as the portion of cars are sold outside the UK, I don't think we disclosed that number, but it is meaningful. So there are cars in the UK that go to other places within Europe and practically beyond Europe as well. We expect trade to continue of those cars and precisely at what tariffs and under what regime will ultimately emerge I think remains to be seen. -- Thank you guys, and then one last one, moving back to the US business, we seem to have been US salvage industry growth slowing a little bit. And part of that is noise from the cat events, but even so shaking out the mid-single digit range, what are you guys seeing in the industry today and has your volume outlook that you previously indicated of kind of high-single digit industry growth, has that changed at all? Thanks. -- Not really. It may have moderated slightly but given the difficulty in getting land, we really haven't reduced our efforts and expansion in any meaningful manner. And these trends -- we try not to react for quarterly changes in trends. We think that in the long run that we're going to see increases in total loss frequency just because of all the dynamics that you all heard about pre and post repair inspections and scans or complex cars and younger cars, all that intuitively leads us to the conclusion that total loss frequency will continue to grow. -- Thanks, best of luck.Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Bottiglieri, Wolfe Research. -- Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just first one to the -- global inventory ex-cat was up 10%, or ex-hurricanes when you call that way, and volume was up 4%, I guess how many points of that inventory growth was from international and then like what else would you attribute the accelerated (ph) exit rate from? -- I think we gave that. I mean international was up 14% and US was up 10.4%. So there was (technical difficulty) internationally. -- Okay and why such strong growth in inventory growth in the US then looking forward, what do you see that's driving that? -- We don't predict. We can look backwards and say that our average volume growth rate over the last 17 quarters has been 10% and while there will be natural fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter, we really don't see influences change significantly that have driven that thus far. So we think it's going to be in that range. -- Got you. Okay. I'm trying to understand the European market all a bit matter both on the supply side and the demand side. At this point, sourcing for the insurers, is the super majority of your purchases coming from listing services and then what would the mix like of your own wreck listing service versus the third-party ones? -- (multiple speakers) I mean you heard Jay describe a handful of customers who are consigning cars to us but still the strong majority of the cars sold in Copart Germany today are cars purchased on our listing service. -- Got you, OK, and then demand side, can you talk about the customer mix, how that might differ from what you see in the US, can you give us a sense of -- I don't think there is a very big salvage part industry in Europe yet today, so could you maybe talk about how the buyers are different and kind of how you see it evolving if you do to remain (ph) in this market? -- I think the buyers are ultimately somewhat similar because they are from outside of Germany, so some of the countries that are meaningful buyers even in Copart US cars today have become the buyers of Copart Germany vehicles as well. They are no doubt dismantling a portion of the cars for parts and are no doubt rebuilding a good number of them to be put back on the road as well. -- Okay, thanks for the help.Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. -- Good morning everyone. Well, you cited various categories of growth in the non-insurance side. I got, it was dealers were up 29%, could you give me the other segments and the growth that you saw there? -- (multiple speakers) Sure, finance companies which includes banks and leasing companies was up 11%, wholesalers is up 54%, rental car companies was up 30%, and industrial equipment companies were up 77%. -- Okay. Thank you. And then 25% of your total US volume in this quarter was non-insurance. What was the percentage last year? Do you have that handy? -- I do. It was a little over 22%. -- Okay, and then just with these non-insurance cars, I would assume that they get sold a hell of a lot faster than the salvage vehicles, you don't have to clear title and settle with an insurance company on that. Does that -- as these grow as a percentage of your US cars sold, does that kind of somewhat distort your inventory growth in a sense that these cars are flushing out a lot quicker versus the salvage cars? -- It can, so each segment that we talk about has its own profiles, its own characteristics. So you might make assumptions about a quicker cycle time overall. Some segments are actually a slower cycle time, but in general, you're right it has a -- as a group a quicker cycle time and therefore increases the velocity of our yards, improves the utility of our land. -- Okay and then just so I make sure I'm understanding Germany. Germany it's an owner retained. You're actually still going to the owner and buying the car, correct? You are not -- the insurance company is not retaining the car in what you're doing? -- Correct. -- All right, do you and I know, Jay, mentioned that, obviously you're going to try and employ the same strategy that you used in the UK to move from a principle (ph) agency over time but are there any UK insurers that are writing in Germany right now that could maybe be you know take the lead in this and kind of start nudging the German insurance companies toward going to this contingent basis? -- Yes, Gary, we're just in the process right now of preparing the data to share it. So our approach has been very simple. We felt without a marketplace and without a network, we couldn't offer an insurer a vehicle in Munich our service and then have to tow it six hours north up to Hanover. So we've got the network now, we've got results of the auctions that we can share and it's really about sharing that data in the next 90 days and one of the most compelling parts of this to me is yes, we're making a spread and you can see that and that's great, but one of the most compelling parts is the fact that when they are high bidder on one of the platforms -- when a buyer is high bidder on one of the platforms and that is the high bidder that is given to the insured, that the majority of the time the insured doesn't sell at him.So there's a whole secondary auction that's taking place and the platform writes is the number that the insurance company uses. So that's the number that they're saying OK, your car is worth 10 grand, it was 30 before the accident. Here's a check for 20 and this buyer will buy it off you and then the majority of the time, the insured does not sell it to that buyer. Instead they go out into the secondary market through people that work at the BMW dealership that's doing the repair, through other sources they're going out because (technical difficulty) came out to them and it's not too hard in Germany, we figured that out -- it's not too hard in Germany to figure out where a damage -- obviously in the US, I'll give the example, it's not too hard to figure out where a damaged Ferrari is in Dallas, there's not that many dealerships. When you get into Germany, it's not that hard to figure out where a damaged BMW or Mercedes is in Munich. And so you can make phone calls and talk to them or you even have a route where you just walk into the dealerships and you look at the salvage and they put you in touch with the insureds (ph) and you're buying that product off of them for more than the platform bid.So this is really about showing the insurance company, it's not only a better service for the insured, but it's about showing them that there is this whole secondary auction, it's an inefficient marketplace and the biggest frustration we talk to our buyers, why do they love Copart so much, the biggest frustration is they bid on the platforms and the majority of the time, they don't get the car. They've been on Copart, 100% of the time they get the car and that allows a buyer to know exactly what they're going to repair, if they need parts, they've got the parts, if they're going to do a rebuild, they've got the vehicle for rebuild and then they can store it at Copart for the next two weeks while they build a run and send a truck out to pick nine cars up and haul them back to Poland. So that's really -- the benefits there are really obvious and it's just about us in the next 90 days (ph) articulating that now to customers. -- Thank you very much. -- You're welcome.(Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from James Albertine, Consumer Edge. -- Thank you so much and good morning to everybody. Great details on Germany, a lot of questions obviously already and I know you don't give guidance. So I wanted to ask sort of a rearward-looking question here a little bit. Are you, can you tell us rather if you're on plan or if you're slightly ahead of plan with respect to your -- what you had budgeted for growth in Germany and the reason I ask, given the radical change you're bringing to the market and the tax and regulatory setup, I want to understand what the impetus may have been whether it's consolidation of buyers or sellers or what have you that may have accelerated the investment there in Germany and if we can think about the rest of Europe potentially being a little bit faster as that market consolidates over time? -- Okay, well I think the big change is that we have spent the last two years trying to understand the marketplace with a single location and you know, it's a learning process, the first part I'd say, you've got to learn how the market works and there's been a lot of us trying to figure out why is the insured, why is our buyer on our platform the high bidder and they don't get the car. And then you eventually realize as you reach out and make phone calls and talk to people, you find out and you kind of decipher how the marketplace works and that's how we've now come to the conclusion that there's a secondary auction that takes place, a bunch of other facts that we know about the marketplace and I would say that it's a big investment in time and it's a big investment in dollars and we wanted to make sure that we knew that our model in our minds would work and we came to that conclusion this year and that's why we opened up so many locations to build a network of facilities where we can pick cars up quickly, store them, liquidate them at auction and replicate that process over and over and over.So it was really about being prudent in our approach upfront and learning and we've spent the last two years doing that and now we're in a very quick pace to accelerate the market in terms of units going through auction and accelerate the market in terms of getting clients to convert now to the Copart model. And this is simple math, right. They're going to convert and the insured is going to be happier that they don't have to deal with a buyer coming in at eight o'clock at night to pick the vehicle up and so that's a win. They're going to see net promoter score increases from a customer service standpoint and they're going to see more money in their pocket because they are not losing the vehicle in the secondary auction. So this should benefit the insured and benefit the insurance company and our research so far proves that to be the case. Do you want to add to that? -- Maybe as a quick follow-up then Jay, if I may. Given the progress you've made, the learnings, and the breakthrough you've had or seems that you're having in Germany, does that lower the degree of difficulty to go laterally kind of across Europe or will you have to effectively start over in a similar way as you did in Germany if you were to shift into other markets and then if I can ask one of Jeff, you know you talked about the economics and you said it's profitable, look your ROIC over time, I would guess this is a very compelling opportunity economically, but from a modeling perspective and there's no guidance here, but wanted to get a sense -- this must be coming on as sort of dilutive to your corporate EBITDA margins near-term I would imagine. Is that a fair assessment while you're maturing in that market? -- So, let me tackle those questions individually. First is your question as to the rest of Western Europe. It's certainly the case that we are building the muscle memory now to understand how to roll out in a market with some level nuances and its own refinements. Certainly our ability to succeed in Germany will inform our process in other countries. So there will be additional work to be done. So it's not simply replicating the next morning in Spain or in France or otherwise, but I think, we will have enhanced our capabilities and enhanced our reputation and the friction should be lower for the next iterations of this approach.As for the probability of the model, I'd first note that, given the principal nature of it, I suppose, if you wanted to literally talk about the math on a -- because they are principal cars, they are clearly dilutive to the margin rate both on the gross line and the operating profit line. As for how the balance of it will evolve over time, I think we'll just ask you to be patient and see in future quarters. We're not in a position to provide a forecast. -- No, understood and appreciate it and best of luck. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our final question will come from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. -- Hey, good morning guys. -- Good morning. -- A quick -- I might've missed this. Did you size the German market? How many cars total there annually? -- We haven't. We characterize it as substantially larger than the UK market. For example, just by comparison, I think if you look at the metrics whether it's population, GDP, per capita GDP et cetera I think we believe it's meaningfully larger than the UK and we view the Western European market collectively as being similar or larger (ph) than the US. -- Okay, great. And then a question on the non-insurance US vehicles. Do a higher percentage of those go to export, in the sense that there's less concern around a condition report, what is essentially an old car, is your export mix shifting as that mix shifts? -- Certainly, some are appropriate for our export market, but I would say that, without knowing exactly because I haven't looked it up, I wouldn't (ph) think it'd be too materially different than our normalized 4% (ph). So 35% is probably an appropriate expectation. -- Right, directionally probably a little bit higher simply because the scrapped cars are sold in state. So a local car that's going to be melted down pretty much right away will be sold within a pretty narrow radius of the location of the yard and so simply by virtue, dealer cars generally not being melted down, there's probably a higher mix that go export, but I don't think the difference will be dramatic. -- Okay great. Thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we have no further questions in the queue. So I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. -- All right, thanks Chantelle. Thank you everyone for attending the first quarter call for Copart and we look forward to reporting on next year and wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving.Thank you very much.

His primary residence remains the gray stucco Nebraska home he purchased for $31,500 nearly 50 years ago, according to Forbes, and his folksy Midwestern manner and penchant for simple pleasures -- a cherry Coke, a good burger, and a good book are all near the top of the list -- have been well-documented. : Validea is an investment research service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

On the bottom line, however, that translated to adjusted (non-  ) earnings of $102.6 million, or $0.42 per share, up 20% from $0.35 per share in the same year-ago period, but well below the $0.48 per share predicted by most Wall Street analysts.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.To be fair, and as I  shortly after the plunge, Copart management explained during the subsequent conference call that the company's earnings were hurt by roughly $20 million in one-time charges stemming from acquisitions and changes in accounting for depreciation and amortization. But while those charges are typically accounted for through most companies' non-GAAP adjustments, accounting rules dictated that Copart's adjusted results this quarter still include a non-cash depreciation charge of $10.5 million from \"assets newly placed into service as well as changes in the useful lives of fixed assets.\"\"We achieved a record fourth quarter and unit sales revenue, gross profits and operating income,\" Copart CFO Jeff Liaw elaborated during the call. \"We're quite pleased by what we believe is strong underlying operational and financial performance, but it was of course a complex quarter given certain non-recurring, non-cash charges,[...] as well as a slight mix shift to purchase cars and year-over-year changes in our tax rate.\"It likely didn't help that Copart stock had climbed nearly 50% year to date leading up to last month's report, leaving some investors itching to take profits off the table at any sign of perceived weakness. But putting aside its nonrecurring charges, this was as strong a quarter as any shareholder could have hoped for. And for patient investors willing to ignore the noise, I think the stock should rebound in the coming quarters as Copart's underlying strength becomes clearer.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Although the  managed to claw back some of what was at one point an intraday loss of 0.17%, the 0.04% loss the index ended up logging yesterday was still not a gain - and the market needed a decisive gain.That modest loss could have been much bigger had it not been for  (NYSE:  ), which advanced 1.9% as investors continue  . On the other hand, the market's small loss might have been a respectable gain has  (NASDAQ:  ) not suffered a 7.6% loss as the market continues to figure out just where it stands with rival  (NASDAQ:  ).That headline-driven action is exactly why none of these story stocks are well-suited for trading right now. The key at this time is getting the right read on stock charts, and it's the charts of  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) that are most telling as we head into Wednesday's session.The past several days haven't been enjoyable ones for bank stocks, and KeyCorp hasn't been an exception to that norm. But, the sheer scope of the selling has some traders suggesting the weakness may be about to be replaced by bullishness again.And, that may well be the way things pan out. If not, though, KEY shares are one bad day away from breaking under a crucially important support level. Worse, KeyCorp is facing the test with an eyebrow-raising backdrop.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 The make-or-break line joins most of the major lows going all the way back to April and is plotted with a red, dashed line on both stock charts.\u2022 KeyCorp has used this line as a pushoff point before, but this time is different. This time, it's in the shadow of a major lower low; the August peak was below March's high.\u2022 In the weekly timeframe, KEY has not only already broken below another important support line, plotted in blue, but we've also already seen a bearish MACD cross. The downward momentum is already formed.After an amazing 2016/2017 rally, Copart was due for a wave of profit-taking. That's what happened last month. In response to a disappointing fourth quarter report, CPRT shares were up-ended in a huge way.It wasn't the setback in and of itself that's put the stock in jeopardy right now, however. It's what's happened in the meantime, or more specifically, what's not happened in the meantime, that's brought Copart shares to the brink of another round of major selling.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 The real killer here was Monday's retest of the moving average line, plotted in white, at $52.97. The bulls were willing to push up and off the developing support level around $50.86 and try to get back above the long-term moving average line, but the buyers couldn't get over the hump.\u2022 Now CPRT shares have peeled back, and once again are putting pressure on the support line at $50.86. If it snaps, there's not much left that will be able to stop a second wave of selling.\u2022 Zooming out to the weekly chart not only gives us some more perspective, it gives us a couple more prospective technical floors. The nearest one is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line is at $47.77, and the next is the 61.8% retracement at $35.70.Last but not least, Akamai Technologies shares are no stranger to volatility. In fact, you can pretty much count on wide, wild swings from it. Thanks to Monday's bearish hint and Tuesday's confirming clue, though, odds are very good that we're all the way back into an all-too-familiar selling groove.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 The big clue is this week's move below the 200-day moving average line, which is plotted in white on both stock charts. Crosses of this long-term moving average line tend to last a while, up or down.\u2022 Simultaneously, we've seen bearish crossovers - or crossunders, technically speaking - of all the other key moving average lines. This underscores how well developed the new downward momentum has been developed.\u2022 The clincher, so to speak, is the fact that so much bearish volume has taken shape just since early last month. The Chaikin is back under zero on the weekly chart, while the daily chart's accumulation-distribution line is now sloped downward.

(NASDAQ: CPRT)Q4 2018 Sep. 19, 2018 [Operator instructions] Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 . Just as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, chief executive officer of Copart Inc. Sir, please go ahead. -- Thank you, Katie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Q4 and year-end call for Copart. I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Liaw, who will give you an update on finance, and then Will Franklin will give you an update on the operations in the business, and then we'll open it up for questions. With that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to Jeff Liaw, CFO.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Copart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! -- Thank you, Jay. I'll start with the safe harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of income taxes on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings net of deferred tax changes, disposals of non-operating assets, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition-related fees and integration charges, reservers from legacy sales tax liabilities, foreign-currency-related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued this morning.We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both the GAAP and non-GAAP bases described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC.We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf. Now turning our attention to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We achieved a record fourth quarter in unit sales revenue gross profits and operating income. We're quite pleased by what we believe is strong underlying operational and financial performance, but it was, of course, a complex quarter given certain nonrecurring noncash charges, which I'll elaborate on further during this call as well as a slight mix shift to purchased cars and year-over-year changes in our tax rates.Starting with the top line. Our revenue grew globally at 18.7% year over year with a modest contribution from beneficial year-over-year currency effects of approximately $1.5 million. We experienced global service revenue growth of 16.3%, which is largely the best reflection of underlying growth in the business. Purchased car growth of 37.7%, driven by NPA Copart Direct, Germany, among others.Actual Copart-owned inventory at the end of the quarter was $16.7 million, which, as you know, is still small in the context of the overall business. As you know, if you are following Copart for some time, you purchased car revenue on a nominal basis overstates it's growth and contribution to the business. If we reflected only the net margin in our financials or if we were to gross up our service revenue generally for the average selling prices of cars, purchased car revenues would appear much smaller in comparison. We experienced global unit sale growth of 10.2% with U.S.unit growth of 9.8% and international growth of 12.2%. Will will provide additional color on the growth drivers, but we did experience growth in both insurance and noninsurance volumes. Our global inventory grew by 3.8%, slightly more than that excluding catastrophic inventory from both last year and this year. Our gross profit grew from $167.5 million to $188.4 million in the quarter, or 12.5% growth.That said, the fourth quarter of 2018 was burdened by a one-time nonrecurring depreciation charge of $10.5 million, due to assets newly placed into service as well as changes in the useful lives of fixed assets. The fourth quarter of '18 was also burdened by $1.9 million of writedowns of assets and certain separation costs in connection with our acquisition of the business in Finland. The gross margin rates decreased from last year, 44.2% to 41.9% or a decline of 230 basis points. That said, the nonrecurring depreciation charge represents 230 basis points of that contraction by itself.Furthermore, the slight mix shift to purchased cars represent another 70 basis points or thereabouts. The Finland writedown is an additional 40 basis points. The punchline being that in a quarter in which our gross margin rate declined year over year by 230 basis points, those factors alone represented 340 basis points or more than the total decline. We grew ASPs in the quarter year over year by 11.9% in the U.S., despite lapping a strong ASP growth quarter a year ago in fourth quarter of 2017 of 7% net.Will will elaborate again, but this is continuing the phenomenon we talked about previously of newer cars being totaled, less severely damaged cars being totaled, increased bidding activity, strong used car price environment and a solid scrap-price environment as well. Turning our attention to general and administrative expenditures. I'll start with the line item, excluding stock compensation and depreciation. G&A ex those factors increased from $29.8 million a year ago to $42.8 million this year.Of that $13 million increase, $5.6 million is a nonrecurring payroll expense in connection with certain executive stock option exercises, which we have normalized in the non-GAAP EPS presentation you see in the press release. An additional $1.4 million of noncash reserves in connection with certain sales tax liabilities, those together are $7 million of $13 million increase and through one-time issues. Furthermore, approximately $2.9 million of our G&A growth is due to the acquisitions of NPA and the business in Finland. The balance then represents actual growth in general and administrative expenses for the quarter.As we have said routinely on our calls and interactions with our investors and others, our general and administrative expenditures will grow over time with inflation and with increases in complexity of our business, but we continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage given the top-line growth rate that we've experienced. Finally, few other points on G&A and other portions of the income statement. G&A depreciation increased by $1.6 million year over year, of which materially all is in connection with the acquisitions described previously at NPA and AVK. Our GAAP operating income grew from $110.8 million to $134.8 million, or 21.7%.If you include the one-time matters that I described previously, the depreciation and amortization charges of $10.5 million, the $1.9 million writedown in connection with the Finnish acquisition, the sales tax liability, the payroll liability as well as an additional $1.1 million impairment of an intangible asset in connection with the historical acquisition, those factors together represented $20 million of decreased operating income in comparison to what, otherwise, would have been. Our operating margin for the quarter was likewise depressed by 450 basis points attributable to those factors. Our net interest expense was down year over year from $5.5 million to $4 million given the lower debt balance. I'll turn our attention to income taxes.In the fourth quarter, as you know, there are additional complexities as tax reform comes into clearer focus, with both the change to our recurring tax rate as well as one-time effects on deemed repatriation and deferred taxes and the like. Our Q4 effective rate of 17.3% benefited from certain nonrecurring tax offsets, including the exercise of stock options, which again you see reflected in the adjusted EPS schedule. Our full-year normalized rate for fiscal '18 would have been approximately 28%, excluding those one-time factors. That said, as you know, our U.S.federal cash tax rate for fiscal '19 will be 5.9% lower than what we experienced in fiscal '18. Due to the full-year benefit of tax reform because our fiscal year straddles the calendar year, we received a portion of the benefit in fiscal '18 with the full benefits in fiscal '19. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter increased from $70.3 million to $109.7 million, or a 56% year-over-year increase. On a non-GAAP basis, our net income increased from $82.4 million to $102.6 million, or growth of 24.5%.In the non-GAAP net income reconci -- reconcilliation schedule, you will see there the $2.9 million in deferred-tax adjustments, the impairments of the long-life assets, the charges we incurred in connection with the acquisition of our Finland business as well as the legacy sales tax liability. Not included in that reconciliation is the depreciation and amortization charge I described a moment ago. The effective share count, the last comment before we get to EPS, has increased from 237.6 million a year ago to 244.4 million, or a 3% increase with majority of its increase attributable to our increase in share price due to the treasury method of accounting for stock options. Our non-GAAP EPS then has increased from $0.35 to $0.42.Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was $157.9 million and capex of $106.4 million in the quarter. As a slight deviation from the past few quarters, 40% of these expenditures were for yard and transportation of equipment. Tax reform created a one-time benefit for us of acquiring equipment and placing it into service in fiscal '18 of approximately an incremental 6% that we would not receive had we made those purchases in fiscal '19 and beyond, which cost us to accelerate the limited set of purchases into fiscal '18. The balance of our capex, as usual, was attributable largely due to capacity expansion and lease buyouts.And the last three commentary I provide is on Germany before turning it to Will for additional explanation. As you know already, we have been running options at our two existing Copart Germany locations. In comparison to conventional remarketing method in Germany, Copart Germany's options are already achieving substantially better returns at auction. As we penetrated German market, these superior returns will ultimately accrue to the benefit of German insurance carriers, policyholders, our buyer base and Copart itself.If you consider the key to drivers of our success and the markets in which we are more mature, we have world-class capabilities in developing a robust buyer base, real estate per vehicle storage, physical logistics for transport and access to vehicles. On each of those four fronts, we have substantial initiatives under way that we'll discuss with you in greater detail on the next call. With that, I'll turn it over to Will Franklin. -- Thank you, Jeff. First, let me provide some updates on Hurricane Florence. As we have stated previously, our goal is to be a constant state of readiness for these CATs. That requires us to have permanent CAT storage capacity.Relative to Florence, in a region, we have recently added a 90-acre facility near Raleigh and a 96-acre facility located in Spartanburg, South Carolina. In addition, we have available new facilities near Charleston, Winston-Salem, Atlanta, and Fredericksburg, which are near completion, yet currently available to store cars. To supplement these new facilities and our 11 existing facilities in the CAT region, days before the storm hit, we secured 17 temporary storage locations. We also mobilized almost 100 loaders, hundreds of tow trucks, a dedicated CAT teams, and we staged in the region our six mobile command centers.In total, we estimate that we have spent nearly $1.7 million in preparation for Florence prior to the landing of the storm. Our response to Hurricane Florence demonstrates our unmatched CAT capabilities and our commitment and our ability to execute during these events. In a CAT, we don't have the luxury of waiting for the storm to clear and then assess our needs. We have to be on the ground days, even weeks beforehand, preparing for the worst outcome.Florence was a Category 4 hurricane, the same as Harvey, while out in the Atlantic. It landed as one and quickly dissipated into a tropical storm. While it's too early and the claim cycle is no certainty, we believe volumes generated in Florence will require only a limited use of our CAT resources. Now let me provide some commentary on our fourth quarter's operational results.In the U.S., our volume grew by 9.8% for the quarter and 12.9% for the year. When adjusted for CAT activity, the year over growth was 10.7%. Our volume growth continues to be driven by organic growth and market wins within the insurance market, continued growth in the noninsurance markets and our NPA acquisition. Volume from noninsurance sellers, which includes franchise and independent dealers, finance companies, charities, municipalities, equipment dealers and wholesalers grew by 27.6%.In total, noninsurance cars comprised 23.5% of total U.S. volume, compared to 20.2% for the same quarter last year. The growth in volume was spread broadly across multiple seller segments. Volume from dealers was up 26%; bank and financial institutions, 23%; railcar companies, 29%; wholesalers, which almost doubled at 99%; and industrial equipment, which more than doubled at 122%.In the U.S., our service revenue per car was up almost 6%. The increase in revenue per car was due primarily to higher ASPs, which grew by 11.9%. The increase in ASPs were driven by a number of factors: a 4.8% increase in the value of used cars as measured by the Manheim index; an 18% increase in the value of crushed car bodies; the beneficial mix of cars sold, as noninsurance cars and powersport vehicles are generally run-and-drive vehicles that yield a higher selling price; and the increase in our marketing activity. We're also seeing a behavioral change in the industry as insurance companies are totaling cars with less damage.We continue to expand our marketing activities and to enhance our auction platform. We have two objectives: first, is to increase the number of bidders that participate in our online auction; and second, is to increase the bidding activity of those who do. We are executing well on both. The number of unique bidders is up over 30%.And the increase in number of bids received per lot is up almost 9%. Our marketing activities seek to identify and encourage buyers, wherever they are in the world, to search our website to join our auctions. Despite the headwinds caused by the stronger dollar, buying activity from international buyers increased. Total sales to buyers with international business addresses was 23.8%.When we include all export activity, including buyers with domestic addresses who only export based on license, our international market represented 34.2% of U.S. units sold. Our international buyers and exporters also influenced auctions by pushing bids higher by being the second high bidder. When we include this metric, our international buyers and exporters impact over 50% of all U.S.items sold. Additionally, our work on auction dynamics include -- continues as we improve the effectiveness on our online auction platform, which we believe to be the best in the world. Due to increased -- due to the electronic nature of our auction platform, we can capture all search and bidding activity, including individual product preferences and bidding tendencies. Utilizing that data, we may, when appropriate, extend the auction for certain units in anticipation of further bidding activity or employ other measures to elicit additional bids.We are also addressing the change in bidder behavior as they move toward mobile searching and bidding by improving our mobile experience. This quarter, 40% of all web traffic and 24% of winning bids were on mobile, up 80% and 20%, respectively. In Canada, our volume grew by 29% for the quarter and 46% for the year due to market wins as well as organic growth within the market as the Canadian salvage market, like the U.S. market, has seen growth in total loss frequency.In addition to the growth in volume, we have seen a meaningful growth in revenue per car as Canadian ASPs, like U.S. ASPs, have risen in Canada over 14%. To accommodate the increase in volume in Canada, last year, we expanded our yard in Calgary by 14 acres, and we expect to announce a 14-acre expansion of our Edmonton yard in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019. Turning to the U.K.We delivered another strong quarter as EBIT in GBP. And after eliminating the impact of a one-time payroll tax expense associated with an option exercise was up 10.8%. The growth was driven by an 8.1% increase in volume and an increase in revenue per car also tied to higher ASPs. U.K.ASPs were also beneficially impacted by change in mix as dealer car volume grew by 18.7% and represented 10.2% of total volume, compared to 9.2% in the same quarter last year. We are also seeing meaningful progress in Brazil, where volume was up almost 9% quarter over and 10% year over. This growth was achieved in a very challenging market. Brazilian new car sales in 2017 were down 40% from 2013.The car park is aging and auto policy account has been declining. Nevertheless, we have grown volume by gaining market share, due, we believe, to our ability to deliver exceptional operational and marketing results. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our revenues and EBITDA grew by almost 11% and 30%, respectively, after adjusting for a beneficial one-time adjustment. We believe Copart Brazil will become an increasingly more meaningful contributor to our overall financial performance.We're see -- seeing rising diesel fuel, labor, and health insurance costs across the board. Nevertheless, on a consolidated basis and excluding the costs associated with the exit of dismantling activity in Finland, our average cost to process each car grew only marginally over the same quarter last year as we leveraged our best cost model. Our inventory was up in North America, the U.K., and worldwide by 3%, 5.5%, and 3.8%, respectively. This quarter, North America sales grew by 10.2%.Over the last 16 quarters, our year-over-year quarterly volume growth has averaged 11.3%. We have previously discussed extensively the drivers for the growth in the North America total loss market. While the growth rate and accident frequency is moderating, we see no such trend in total loss frequency. We expect to see continued growth in both car park and total loss frequency.Accordingly, we remain extremely active in our yard expansion program to accommodate the growth produced by both market wins and organic growth in the insurance market, our continued expansion in the noninsurance markets and our need for additional CAT capacity. We did not announce the opening of any new yard this quarter, however, in addition to the yards in Leipzig, Germany; Spartanburg, South Carolina; Curitiba, Brazil; and our new NPA site, Madison, Wisconsin, which we have all opened after the close of the last quarter. We currently have 28 other land development projects currently under construction, representing over 1,500 acres of new capacity. 26 of those are in the U.S.and one each in Canada and Germany. That concludes my remarks. Katie, now we'll turn the call back over to you for Q&A.Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. -- Good morning. -- Hi, Bob. -- Hi. Wanted to just take a step back on G&A. You gave us a lot of detail there, and I'll certainly go back to the transcript and stuff. But just -- I know you won't guide to numbers specifically, could you talk a little bit about the profile as a percent of sales? Has anything materially changed, whereas there'll be negative operating leverage going forward? Do you still expect to get operating leverage on that line? And how should we think about G&A going forward, given the significant volatility over the last few quarters? -- Thanks, Bob. In short, yes, we do expect to achieve, as we have very consistently in history, operating leverage on G&A. This quarter, as you know, was noisy on the nonstock comp, non-D&A, non-G&A line item. The $13 million increase included $7 million itself just on the payroll taxes and the legacy sales tax liabilities, right? So those are true nonrecurring not in the baseline, so to speak.Then there was about $3 million that we picked up from the acquisitions of our businesses in Finland and in NPA, and the balance is the actual \"growth\" in G&A for the quarter. So yes, we do expect to achieve leverage. There will be some inflation as we add complexity in the business, as we expand into Germany and the rest of Western Europe initiated the best work. There can be modest increases, but still, on balance, we will achieve better growth in operating income than we do in gross profit and revenue. -- OK. Super. And then I think Will touched on this in the end and on last call. You've, something like an 11% or close CAGR in volume over the last four years in the U.S.car volume. Have you kept up with that in land? I know you've reported lots of land acquisitions, but you haven't given us a sense of how much you picked up. And so I guess the question is, have you kept up with the volume with land? And if not, what have you done to maintain the efficiencies in the yards as the utilization rate seemingly creeps up? -- We have kept up, Bob. We -- I can't say this, though, that whatever excess capacity we had three years ago has dissipated. But our procurement, our acquisition and our development activity is one of our primary focuses here as across the world. We employee -- I think, a very aggressive -- and when I say aggressive, I mean, a high assumption in terms of growth rate when we plan our expansion and our capacity needs.I think we're -- we're developing to that number. So when you look at those elevated growth rates we're anticipating and the additional permanent CAT capacity that we're pursuing, it's a big job. But to answer your question, we think we've got it covered. I'd like to say we've got 28 projects in construction.I think you'll see a number of those being announced in the next two quarters. And if you look at the targets that we're pursuing and I would say contracts that we have entered into, there's about another 45 of those. So I think we're well situated to accommodate the growth in the market as well as any CAT needs. -- OK. Great. And last one from me, just on Germany. Can you give us some updates in terms of the number of either insurance companies or rental car companies that are participating in those auctions and other milestones we should look for there as you build out? I think you mentioned there is another yard to come there as well. -- Hey, Bob, Jay. Yes, we've changed some of our approach and strategy in the German market, and we're going to give you an update on that in the next quarter. So where we've got two locations today, we're going to be opening a significant number of locations in this quarter. I don't like to talk about what we're going to do.I'd like to talk about what we've done. So in the next Q, we'll be reporting on how many new locations we've opened. And we're clearly looking at the market as we've got to have the logistics and the facilities in place to service the insurance industry. With that said, we are handling some insurance volume in that market, but primarily, the majority of the volume that we're handling right now is noninsurance, and that allows us to build their salvage vehicles they've just not procured directly from the insurance, they're procured directly from owners of vehicles.These are owner retentions where the insurance company has had the insured retain the vehicle, and we've reached out to the insured and acquired the vehicle from them to flip it through the auction. And in that environment, what we're doing is, we're creating a marketplace. So today, we're the largest auction house in the country that you can come. I'll give you a great example today.We had 150 cars on auction in Hanover. All those vehicles, if you bid, you own them. And that is the only auction environment I know of in Germany, where you have a 100% chance of getting the car if you bid on it. Everything else is -- in the country is contingent auction environment, where you may not end up getting the vehicle.So we're selling -- you can go online. I can tell you we're selling over 400 cars a month right now. But you can go online and look at the auctions, I'd encourage everyone to do that and then let's wait until next quarter and we'll report on a much bigger update on our strategy and our approach in that market. But I'll finish by saying, it's taking up a significant amount of my time now.I'm spending a fair amount of my own time on Germany, and we are very committed to the market in succeeding before the end of the calendar year in terms of large locations and large volume. -- Bob, let me elaborate briefly on that point. So the sourcing cars from policyholders directly bars the function of the way the German insurance markets and its indemnification provisions have evolved over the years. However, then sales at Copart Germany, that's what led me to the statements that we clearly are achieving better returns. So our conviction that the Copart's model is the right one for the German insurance market long term remains as true as ever, and the evolution, Jay described, is merely how we achieved that outcome. -- OK. Great. Super color. I appreciate that.Thank you very much. -- Thanks, Bob.Thank you. Our next question will come from Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. -- Hi, thank you. I just wanted to, sorry, go back and follow up on the G&A -- or I'm sorry, overall operating income and kind of the one-time expenses. I'm happy to do this off-line if that's easier. But I think you mentioned that there's about $20 million in nonrecurring in the quarter.Of that, what was broken out in the non-GAAP kind of adjustment schedule in the press release? I just want to make sure I'm getting it correct based on that. -- Sure, Stephanie. In the non-GAAP schedule, you have everything but the $10.5 million of depreciation and amortization that burdened the gross profit for the quarter. Otherwise, in the non-GAAP reconciliation you see on a post-tax basis the pre-tax numbers that I just walked through. -- Got it. OK. So that's helpful. So really -- and you said the operating income had $20 million of one-time that we would not expect to occur kind of going forward? -- Correct. -- Got it. OKy, that's very helpful. My next question is actually just on Brazil. I think that -- very positive there and kind of almost seems like -- and I think the comment that it's going to be a more meaningful contributor.Is there something that has materially changed just in the last couple of months in that market either on your end or from just the market standpoint to cause this to be larger contributor or kind of just more color there would be really helpful? Thanks. -- Yes. No, there is a change, it just wasn't recent. It take -- We entered the market, I think, in 2012. And it takes a while to build out not only your team but your processes and to gain the kind of reputation that you need to grow the business, the kind of reputation, the kind of brand that we have here in The United States.And in Brazil, we're starting to gain that brand recognition, especially with the insurance companies. And you saw that we had expanded north in Betim. Recently, we added a new yard south in Curitiba. And we think there's opportunity to grow simply because we operate better than everyone, we think, and we provide the highest returns through our remarketing efforts, and we just think it's -- the byproducts of that will be growth in our volume and our presence in the market. -- And are you -- will you be able to provide the percent contribution Brazil had in the quarter? Or by top -- or should I wait until the 10-K? Or kind of how should we go around that? -- Yeah. No, we haven't sized in that respect, and we probably won't until it becomes a material number with respect to the total. -- Absolutely. All right. Well, thanks. -- Thanks, Stephanie.Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. -- Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I think you mentioned a small issue, but a change in lives of fixed assets, some change in assumption there. Can you shed more light on that decision? -- Yes. So in short, I was commenting in total on the $10.5 million nonrecurring depreciation charge that burdened yard expenses showed up in gross profit. And the two drivers there are: one, assets newly placed into service with a substantial depreciation charge associated with that as well as change of certain useful lives, and this is based on change in management estimates. We have a number of facilities with different useful lives, and we harmonized them, so to speak, and adjusted them accordingly.So that charge is not one you would see on an ongoing basis quarter to quarter. -- Yes. And I guess, I'm just trying to understand what drove that decision to change the length of the lives? -- It's a -- well, I think you know, in the past few years alone, we have significantly increased our own experience in acquiring land and developing it, including with our own in-house team in Bright Excavation. So I think our -- the information we have available to us, our understanding even of our land has improved significantly even -- over the past few years. So in reviewing historical fixed asset ledgers, we bring that heightened awareness to bear and that caused us to revise certain of those numbers accordingly. -- Thanks. And then as we think about Germany and maybe the acceleration in activity there through the end of the year, should we anticipate costs running ahead of revenues for a period of time here? -- Craig, I think from the perspective of the overall P&L, I think the effect would not be that pronounced of what you just described. So there are certainly will be moments when we invest when we have costs that are ahead of the contribution. There will be moments when the opposite is true, when we see the flow through of the contribution in connection with costs that we had previously invested. I don't think that on balance, you would see, from your perspective, a meaningful drive on the P&L. -- Got it. And then with respect to capex, could you just lay out your plan for capex spending in fiscal '19 and maybe give us some of the bigger buckets where you expect to allocate capital? -- Capex in fiscal '19 will -- will continue to be dominated by capacity expansion. So it will be land developments and acquisitions, in some cases, lease buyouts. So I think the rough number, over the past eight quarters, would be 85% or so of our capex has been for those ends. As for capacity, in general, you know that our capital expenditures have been in the past few years.We largely expect that to continue into fiscal '19. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Craig.Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. -- Hey, guys. -- Hey. -- I wanted to ask about revenue per unit. It's been really strong for some time here. Obviously, ASP growth has contributed to that. But you guys have also talked about some of the things that you've been doing around being dynamic in the auction.So I'll be curious to fix what you can to delineate between how much of the ARPU increase is from external factors, a reflection of the market and how much of it is because of decisions you guys are making? -- Ben, I think to be fair those variables would be really hard to isolate because they both happen concurrently with literally every auction we run, right, so we can't isolate either the market effects or what we do as opposed to what we do we can to some extent. But what I would tell you is that both have been meaningful. That is, we've looked at the market for used car prices, they are very strong, but they are certainly not up 12% year over year either, right? So there's some function of the marketplace being strong. There's also some meaningful function of our innovations, our member recruitments, our auction management. -- Fair enough. And then my second question is just around a follow-up on capital allocation. Cash continues to build on the balance sheet. And I know you don't make a practice of talking about your future plans for buyback, but I'd be just curious, we haven't heard an update around the M&A landscape in some time.I'd just be curious to hear a little bit more about how you think M&A fits into your future prioritization of use of cash flow? -- Fair question, Ben. M&A certainly has been a part of Copart's journey over the past few decades. It has driven growth in the business in some cases. I think that will continue to be true going forward.That said, I think, as you know, in our core markets, in which we are strongest, the U.S. and U.K. and so forth, there are more limited opportunities to acquire companies. Beyond that, we do revisit this topic from time to time.We always have our hurdles that: one, we have to like the acquisition in isolation, that it has to make financial sense, it has to generate the kinds of returns on capital that Copart is going to expect; and secondly that it has to dovetail well with our strategic initiatives broadly, whether that's international expansion in Brazil, Europe, and the like or expanses into additional future spaces. So that ruborous calculus hasn't changed at all. We won't largely comment on this kind of activity until, after the fact, as you know, for all these reasons. But M&A will be a part of Copart's future as well. -- And just a quick follow-on to that. A lot of the acquisitions you guys have made historically have been either geographically or capacity focused. When we think about building out future capabilities, are those all elements of your business that you can build organically? Are you looking at targets from time to time that potentially bring capabilities to bear fruit for Copart as well? -- The latter. So two illustrations, National Powersport Auctions, an acquisition we completed in June of last year, clearly an extension into the non-salvaged powersports arena. So the additional capabilities via acquisition, that was not organic per se. And even in Germany, our first foray into Germany was in connection with the acquisition of WOM, which is one of the lifting services you heard us describe on prior conference call as well.So from time to time, we will expand beyond what I would characterize as Copart's traditional salvage auction business in our M&A activities. But for the reasons we just described, those, of course, have had higher hurdles still. If it deviates from what we know and have done day-to-day forever, we have to be that much more sure. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. -- Thanks, BenOur next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. -- Hey, good morning, guys. -- Good morning. -- Hey, Bret. -- As we, maybe, accelerate the business in Germany, I think in the early comments, you discussed your purchased vehicle volumes were up partially as a result of Germany. Do we think the purchase mix is going to accelerate from here? And I guess, what do you think about the gross margin impact going forward? -- Bret, I think to be -- I think, it's a fair question. I think, to be fair, we don't -- we wouldn't manage the business that way, right? I understand that if the purchased car volume were to increase, that would, quote, depress our nominal margin rate, but that's not a particularly sophisticated way to run the business where we want to maximize contribution and profit. And so we wouldn't speak in those terms except when we end up on quarterly calls like this one. -- I was just wondering whether we should think about that going forward as we try to project your nominal margin rate. Is Germany's acceleration going to be meaningful from here? -- On Germany specifically -- let me comment more generally, on Germany, specifically, I think you heard Jay and I both say, we'll have a whole lot more to say on the next call than on this one. But more generally when Copart has grown into new spaces, we have often expanded first through the purchase car model, right? Until we have achieved liquidity and proven it to the various counterparties in the market, we are often better off buying the cars ourselves, selling them in auction, generating a profit and including to all the market participants that we do so. Over time, that very naturally evolved the consignment model as was true, for example, in the U.K., most notably. Or you may remember from back in the day, we were heavily tilted to the purchase model when compared to consignment.The opposite is true today, as we've achieved that liquidity. So when we are growing in new spaces -- NPAs is another example. NPA has a five -- historically, had a five-store footprint, so to speak, in The United States. They had tremendous credibility among dealers, in and around those locations.As they expand beyond those geographies, initially will they buy more bikes to prove their model? Yes. And the same will be true in Germany and could be true in other international markets as well. So it will have an effect, but as per that too lengthy paragraph about purchased cars, I wouldn't overweigh that in the overall analysis. But yes, I think purchased cars could or will outgrow consignment sales for the near future. -- OK. And then a follow-up question to Will's commentary around Florence. Sounds like an incremental $1.7 million spent to prep, and I think volumes may be light coming out of that storm. Is that about the magnitude of the loss? Was there -- or the impact of the CAT that may come from Florence? Or are they incremental expenses that have -- that will come along the way? And obviously, I guess there will be some volume to offset that expense? So it may be less than that one, seven? -- Yes. It's really too early to tell. When all the water subsides and the claims start coming in, the assignments come in, then we'll have a better picture. The $1.7 million that I quoted was just what we spent to prepare for the storm.So there'll be other expenses to follow on throughout the course of next weeks and months. -- OK Thank you. -- You're welcome. -- Thanks, Bret.Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. -- Hi, good morning, guys. U.S. inventory was up 3% year over year. Were you comping against the impact of catastrophic events last year? -- Not largely. Hurricane Harvey hit in August of last year. So July 31, '17, would -- had some catastrophic events, hailstorms and the like, but not the meaty ones you might have in mind. -- So it's more of a seasonal impact then. It's just ebbs and flows, but this is a seasonally slow time for accidents. Is that more a way we should read that? -- The seasonality, I don't think, would factor into a year-over-year number, but I think this even should be said the same year over year. -- OK. And then your tax rate, you said, was I think somewhere around 28% for the year or -- and then you said something about a 5.3% decrease for next year. Is that 5% decrease of that 28%? -- Yup. Fair question. And I would reference here -- the fiscal '18 normalized tax rate u include big lumpy stuff like the stock option exercise would have been approximately 28% blended for the company. That 28% includes the 26.9% U.S.federal and that includes state income taxes and foreign taxes and the like. The point about fiscal '19 is that for the U.S. portion of our income, which historically is in the 80% to 85% range of the total income for the company, on that specifically, our U.S. federal rate will decline from 26.9% in fiscal '18 to 21% fiscal '19.So that will, in and of itself, somewhat meaningfully lower our tax rate in fiscal '19. -- OK. So that's real helpful. And then could you just -- I was trying to write this down. Could you just give me your unit growth in the U.S.and international and then on a combined basis in the quarter? -- 9.8%, U.S.; 12.2%, international; global, 10.2%. -- Ok. And then, lastly, on your ASPs, you said the U.S. were up about 11.9%. I couldn't write this down.Again, how much of that change was due to scrap? -- It's tough to quantify. We can tell you how much scrap was up. The scrap year over year, it remains a pretty healthy environment; it was up 18%. I think sometimes the perception is a little overwhelmed on the importance of scrap in our business.So if you consider the typical car at Copart's sales, the passengers may have had a ton and a half of total content, a crushed car body, just to use rough numbers, $200 per ton. So it's $300 of scrap content in a car for a car that sells for thousands, right? So even if the scrap is up 18%, you're talking about a $40 or $50 change to the underlying value of the car that sells for thousands of dollars. So the expected matters, in particular on our lowest-end vehicles, I expect it has virtually no effect on the cars that will be rebuilt and brought back onto the roads. Instead on a theoretical forum, you can imagine that 10 years from now when that car is done, that scrap value will be back.But I think the scrap matters; it's a contributor, but I don't think it's nearly -- it's not that meaningful portion of that ASP. -- OK. Thank you.Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow up on the dealer first, kind of, descriptive details. I'm not sure I got them all, but I think you're up 90% last quarter year over year.Maybe I'm misinterpreting that metric. But can you give the comparable metric, like for it was this quarter? And then collectively you've given these like different subsegments, like in rental cars and the whatnot. If you're kind of aggregating what you are doing in the whole car space and how that's growing, maybe just provide some context to what that also had done last quarter? -- Well, I'm not sure what the numerical questions that you had. I can talk about the segments in general. I think we're finding that -- we're attracting more and more buyers for these types of cars, which allows us to -- just the chick and egg, provide higher returns, which allows us to approach those who have these types of cars and ask them to test our remarketing and our auction platform. And through that process, they've founded to be fruitful in terms of increasing their returns, and in turn, has grown that market.We've also developed specific programs for different buyers. So we have a different program for equipment sellers, we have a different program for wholesalers, or may have a separate program for financial accounting. So we're getting more astute in identifying their specific needs and addressing those through our processes and our technology. -- Got you. Let me rephrase it differently. Did your growth in dealer cars accelerate or decelerate, and what you've done last quarter is the simple question? -- It accelerated. -- Accelerated? OK. That's helpful. OK. And then maybe, just holistically, as you think about the strategy, given that you are growing pretty aggressively, but I would think your capabilities and service are lower and than -- like your platform effect is a little bit lower right now.Can you talk about how your product is differentiated relative to the incumbents? And what's deriving that growth? And how we think about the sustainability of how much longer you can compound this growth and dealer consignment? -- We think there's long runway ahead of us in terms of growth and dealer consignment. I think we're in the first or second inning of this game. And I think we're refining our processes. We're adding more resources to the pursuit of this volume.And we think that the sellers who are trying and utilizing our platform are very happy with the results. So I think there's a robust opportunity ahead of us with respect to dealer cars. -- Gotcha. OK. Thank you for the time. -- Thanks, Chris.Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I'll now like to turn it back over for closing remarks. -- All right. Thanks, Katie. Thank you, everyone, for attending the call, and we look forward to reporting on Q1 in November. Bye-bye.[Operator signoff]When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Copart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is on pace for a loss in 2018. While the 1% decline year-to-date isn't broadly catastrophic, it has been fueled by several shares that have simply been cleaved. But there is a silver lining: This has created a number of deeply discounted stocks to buy.History has shown us that when rates rise, stocks typically decline - at least temporarily. This was the case in 1994, 2006 and last February. The market's latest swoon, caused in part by more upward pressure on interest rates, may be painful, but it too may just be temporary. That's little comfort to owners of numerous stocks that have fallen precipitously off their recent highs. But that is good news for bargain hunters that are looking for battered stock picks to grab up off the ground.Here are 10 deeply discounted stocks to buy - companies that are anywhere from 20% to 50% off of their 52-week highs:Market value: $19.5 billion52-week range: $34.14-$9.04% off 52-week high: 44.3%Advanced Micro Devices' (  , $19.03) stock still is doing fantastically in 2018, up 80% for the year-to-date. Wins in several markets - client CPUs, server GPUs and graphics chips for data centers and gamers - have revived the previously struggling chipmaker.Still, AMD stock is off by well more than 40% since September amid a broad selloff in technology, and thanks to a disappointing Q3 report. The company's revenues, while up year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter, missed expectations, as did fourth-quarter guidance.Stay focused on the longer-term fundamental outlook. Many analysts believe AMD can maintain its momentum and challenge Intel (  ) and Nvidia (  ) through a combination of licensing and customization. Moreover, the company is becoming much better at turning its growth into profits. Wall Street analysts expect 170% growth in adjusted earnings this year to 46 cents per share, followed by another 37% pop to 63 cents per share in 2019. Remember: This was a company that, before 2017, hadn't turned a full-year profit since 2011.Market value: $50.3 billion52-week range: $110.81-$70.09% off 52-week high: 35.9%Celgene (  , $71.02) is off more than 30% from its 52-week high, much of which came from October's downdraft. Generally, investors are nervous about the portion of revenue -- north of 60% -- that comes from blockbuster drug Revlimid, which treats multiple myeloma, a white blood cell cancer. They're also nervous that Revlimid will face generic competition starting in 2022. Further, a blunder with the FDA last year for multiple sclerosis treatment ozanimod and the failed trial for a Crohn's disease drug have not been forgotten.But investors may be fretting about Revlimid too much and forgetting that Celgene is continuing to grow. Celgene's profits have expanded by more than 17%, compounded annually, over the past five years. And diluted earnings for the first nine months of 2018 have come to $4.02 per share, already besting last year's full-year earnings of $3.64.Celgene actually has a deep pipeline for drugs to treat lymphoma, anemia and multiple sclerosis. Celgene's formulations are expected to hit the market in 2019 and 2020. Analysts at CFRA -- a unit of Standard & Poor's -- believe that Celgene could introduce five meaningful drugs by 2020. Celgene is acquisitive, too, and healthy cash flow from Revlimid can finance new deals while pipeline products gain traction.Market value: $11.4 billion52-week range: $67.08-$35.44% off 52-week high: 26.6%There's almost no company like Copart (  , $49.27), the globally operating leader in online vehicle auctions. It has other businesses, too, including processing and selling salvage vehicles to dealers, \"dismantlers,\" rebuilders and exporters on behalf of banks, finance companies, insurers and fleet operators.Copart sold off nearly 20% in September after it reported disappointing earnings. The top and bottom lines grew, but profits of 42 cents per share came up shy by 4 cents. Management dutifully explained how a variety of one-time costs, including those from Hurricane Harvey, had impacted earnings. But the Street was unconvinced, and the stock has remained stubbornly off its highs.The miss isn't as concerning when you consider the company still is in expansion mode; analysts see high-single-digit revenue growth in the cards for both this year and next. Also in September, Copart opened its second facility in Germany. The new facility in Leipzig can store up to 4,500 vehicles will host biweekly auctions. The location provides entry to the Eastern European market for autos, too.Market value: $20.5 billion52-week range: $116.65-$78.78% off 52-week high: 26%Dollar Tree (  , $85.99) has wildly underperformed this year thanks in large part to a trio of negative reactions on quarterly earnings. That includes an August report in which DLTR reported disappointing same-store sales and reduced its guidance for the current fiscal year.Despite desultory sentiment, Dollar Tree still is on track to grow revenues by 3% this fiscal year, and profits by 13%, analysts say. Unlike full-price retailers who are struggling to squeeze top-line gains into bigger bottom lines because of competition from e-tailers, Dollar Tree is somewhat detached. Its Dollar Tree merchandise sells for $1, and its customer base tends to do little online shopping.Today, Dollar Tree operates more than 15,000 stores across its namesake brand and Family Dollar, which it purchased in July 2014. For context, Walmart - America's largest retailer by revenues - operates 5,358 stores. Analysts point out that while DLTR is underperforming rival Dollar General (  ), which is trading near 52-week high, shares of the former may offer more upside.Also intriguing is a new stake by activist shareholder Carl Icahn, who some believe will push Dollar Tree to exit the Family Dollar purchase via a sale or spinoff.Market value: $26.8 billion52-week range: $151.26-$86.01% off 52-week high: 42.0%Electronic Arts (  , $87.66) makes video games, but it is constantly changing as it strives to provide quality content. EA's  is among the top performing games in the industry, and its success is likely to be continued through future editions. Digital sales -- versus packaged software -- currently contribute more than half of Electronic Arts' revenue, and management aims to increase that amount in order to benefit from the higher margins on digital, while also enabling it to distribute more of its content to current customers.The company is putting resources behind its eSports and mobile gaming, which could boost growth.Electronic Arts' strategy is aided by some compelling macros and trends. Among them are 2.6 billion gamers around the world and EA's 300 million registered players, who it can market new and upgraded products to. Further, EA has demonstrated its ability to capitalize on favorable gaming trends. Through the fiscal year ended in March 2013 through the fiscal year ended in March 2018, earnings have exploded from 31 cents per share to $3.34, or about 61% compounded annually. (Though it masks some lumpiness in between.)Market value: $3.3 billion52-week range: $287.79-$112.78% off 52-week high: 51.4%Inogen (  , $139.93) shares have been halved since their September peak, and much of that came after the company reduced full-year guidance for EBITDA (a measure of operating profitability that backs out items such as interest and taxes) to a range of $60 million-$62 million from a range of $65 million-$69 million. That's mostly because of continued sales and marketing investments expected in the fourth quarter of 2018. The balance of the drop appears to be tied to the overall downdraft in the market that started in mid-September.Neither of these reasons justify cutting the company's value in half.Millions of Americans rely on some form of oxygen therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Inogen has brought innovation to the market to rapidly earn share with a portable oxygen concentrator. Portability offers patients a vast improvement over bulky oxygen tanks and has expanded the size of the overall addressable market. The advantages portability offers are equally disruptive in international markets.Inogen is capitalizing on these dynamics with an aggressive direct-to-consumer sales network, increasing its business to business efforts with financing and private-label partnerships, and aggressive international expansion. Since 2015, INGN has grown revenues from $159 million to an estimated $345 million to $355 million this year, and adjusted EBITDA from $8.1 million to the expected $60 million-$62 million range.Wall Street has overreacted to INGN's bad news. This is still a briskly growing company that decided to invest in itself.Market value: $5.6 billion52-week range: $23.08-$15.76% off 52-week high: 22.1%Low-cost airline JetBlue (  , $17.99) is also flying well below the clouds, but it has a plan to gain altitude. At a recent investor day, management said the company is aggressively switching capacity from underperforming destinations such as Daytona Beach, St. Croix, Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, the District of Columbia and Santiago (Dominican Republic), and adding capacity in more profitable routes emanating out of Boston and Fort Lauderdale.The dip in shares comes at an inflection point in JetBlue's growth and development. Bank of America/Merrill Lynch thinks that the company has now achieved the scale required to effectively compete in the capital-intensive airline business and can now focus on more returns-oriented investments like its premium Mint service -- JetBlue's version of first class -- as well as its cost-cutting initiatives.Airline profits are often a rollercoaster affair, primarily because of fuel costs, but JetBlue expected to keep growing revenues steadily at 9% annually this year and next.Market value: $4.5 billion52-week range: $127.32-$83.78% off 52-week high: 20.3%National Beverage (  , $101.45) has been dogged with shareholder lawsuits and claims that its LaCroix sparkling beverage brand isn't as natural as the company claims. But these seem like border skirmishes that don't really detract from the underlying fundamentals of the company, which include a singular focus and growth on both the top and bottom lines.In September, National Beverage announced it achieved the billion-dollar mark for annual revenues, on Q2 revenues of $292.6 million that marked the company's 15th consecutive quarter of top-line growth. Earnings, while volatile, increased from $1.01 per share in 2013 to $3.19 in the fiscal year ended April 28, for compound annual growth of nearly 26%.While $1 billion in sales may not sound like much compared to the likes of Coca-Cola (  ), which delivered $35.4 billion in sales last year, National Beverage's focus on sparkling water and juices creates a much more compelling, albeit riskier, growth profile.Looking ahead, initial efforts to penetrate the Canadian market have shown the LaCroix brand to be popular with consumers there, which is encouraging given the strong global demand for sparkling water.Market value: $2.4 billion52-week range: $36.90-$18.76% off 52-week high: 45.6%Penn Gaming (  , $20.06) is a regional casino stock that operates or owns interest in 40 gaming facilities across 18 states. Its portfolio spans 49,400 gaming machines, 1,200 table games and 8,800 hotel rooms.The stock has been falling steadily since July, but growth drivers could change the story. On Oct. 15, Penn completed its acquisition of Pinnacle Entertainment, cementing its position as a regional gaming leader. Penn said in a press release that it expects the deal to be accretive to Penn National's free cash flow per share in the first year after closing, and that the deal should enjoy about $100 million in expected annual run-rate cost synergies.In addition, sports betting may make a material contribution to Penn's top and bottom lines as it rolls it out across its broad portfolio of properties.Market value: $2.4 billion52-week range: $43.95-$31.08% off 52-week high: 25.1%Freight hauler and logistics company Werner Enterprises (  , $32.93) has been punished in 2018, with shares losing a quarter of their value from its 52-week high.Although its profit margins lag those of other top freight companies such as Knight-Swift (  ), look for improvement in already-solid margins over the next several years because of Werner's fleet investments. Today, the average age of trucks in Werner's fleet is 1.8 years, versus approximately six years for the industry.Further, Werner has been addressing a persistent labor shortage with pay increases of approximately 27% since 2015, recruiting among veterans and training at 13 locations around the country. Another positive driver, according to Wells Fargo analysts, is that truckload capacity is getting scarce, adding a tailwind to pricing.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported adjusted earnings per share of 42 cents in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jul 31, 2018), missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents.

Still, Copart believes the downgraded status of Florence to a tropical storm means it should require only \"limited use\" of its resources.Copart CFO Jeff Liaw also explained that the company's net income was negatively impacted by around $20 million in one-time charges related to acquisitions and a change in depreciation and amortization.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on September 18, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This auctioneer of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +34.3%.Revenues are expected to be $446.35 million, up 17.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Copart, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.71%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Copart will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Copart would post earnings of $0.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering a surprise of +8.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Copart doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

And it's up 34% year to date and 84% in the past 12 months.The used car industry is far more complex than most people realize, and it has only gotten more complex since the advent of the internet. In the old days, you would trade in your used car and it would get an inspection from the dealer and would likely end up on one of his lots somewhere.Then regional and local auctions started to become more common. Cars and other vehicles would get sent to major auctions where dealers could sell used cars that weren't moving in their particular markets and get models that were in more demand.Also, these were places where vehicles would show up from natural disasters like last year's hurricanes. Insurance companies wrote off the vehicles and the owners either walked away from them, donated them or junked them. We're talking thousands of vehicles.Places like CPRT end up with these vehicles. It also receives repossessed vehicles and impound vehicles.Now add to this the effort by the Barack Obama administration to get older, less fuel efficient and higher polluting cars off the street by offering incentives to trade them in. There was a huge response to this program. But the unintended consequence was it made used cars harder to come by since the older models couldn't be resold in the U.S.But that also started a new market overseas. Smart business people decided to sell all these vehicles to resellers in emerging markets, where new cars are very expensive and difficult to come by.So, from its humble roots in California, CPRT is now a global used vehicle seller to all manner of customers. It has 200 locations in 11 countries and has 125,000 vehicles up for auction every day.Again, in the U.S. the used car market lacked inventory for quite a while, which meant used car prices were high, and low interest rates meant car salesmen we're finding it very easy to sell new cars with longer financing to prospective buyers. But now, interest rates are on the rise, which will squeeze of the new sales. Plus, used vehicle inventory is on the rise, so prices are coming down.All this is reflected in the outsized growth CPRT has displayed in the past year. And as its reputation grows, so will its inventory and its reputation both here and abroad.The final important aspect to remember is that these trends are long term. The don't shift from quarter to quarter. Rates in the U.S. will continue to rise, and a cheaper dollar means these cars will see increasing demand abroad. Domestically, local and online resellers benefit from a growing inventory and better margins.CPRT revenue was up 28% in the past quarter and income was up 40%.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["onro, Inc.

However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Because the fund has amassed over $319.21 M, this makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Consumer Discretionary ETFs. IBUY is managed by Amplify Etfs. IBUY, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the EQM Online Retail Index.The EQM Online Retail Index utilizes a rules based methodology to select a globally diverse group of companies with 70% or more of revenue from online and virtual sales.Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for IBUY are 0.65%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0%.It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Tripadvisor Inc accounts for about 4.24% of the fund's total assets, followed by Iac Interactivecorp (IAC) and Copart Inc (CPRT).IBUY's top 10 holdings account for about 36.11% of its total assets under management.The fund's year-to-date return has gained about 15.68%, and is up about 42.06% in the last one year (as of 06/01/2018). IBUY has traded between $33.55 and $47.70 in the past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.70 and standard deviation of 16.30% for the trailing three-year period.

Efficiency level, which measures a company's capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company's potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value shows that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

The United States and its allies have launched target missiles on Syria, dragging the benchmarks down in the final hours of trading on Apr 13. Such escalating tensions, however, shouldn't dampen investors' spirits for long.After all, mounting military tensions, historically, has had no effect on markets but on humans. In fact, markets in crisis have usually recovered quickly. Keeping this in mind, investing in solid growth stocks doesn't seem to be a bad proposition.Western powers had carried out missile attacks at the heart of Syria's chemical weapons facilities. The United States, France and Britain launched 105 cruise missiles on three chemical weapon facilities, including a development center in Damascus' Barzeh region and two installations near Homs. The strike was carried out after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had sanctioned a chemical weapon attack on civilians in Damascus.This retaliation was the biggest by any Western force against Assad and his superpower ally Russia. However, the Western countries did mention that the strikes were limited to Syria's chemical weapon facilities and not aimed at Assad. Nevertheless, such targeted military strikes against the Syrian government have dented investors' sentiment of late.Investors should not fear a missile strike on Syria as such attacks have limited impact on the stock market, especially over the long run. Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief global investment strategist at  & Co, said that immediately after a military strike, markets tend to lose around 0.3%, but there is nothing earth-shattering about it. Such movements happen during every normal trading session almost.In fact, post-crisis lows open up good buying opportunities, per an analysis conducted by Ned Davis Research. After major geopolitical crisis in the past century, they have found that the market rebound has been so solid that within six months it stands higher than where it was before the catastrophe.Ned Davis Research analyzed that the Dow Jones Industrial Average on average fell 3.2% after any crisis, yet by six months, the blue-chip index manages to recover from the lows. In fact, it scales higher in 12 months' time. If the Sep 11, 2011 attack is to be considered, the index tanked 17.5% five trading sessions later. But, it bounced back in less than two months and was higher than where it had been on Sep 10.Trump has tweeted that attacks on Syria were \"mission accomplished.\" This also suggests that the President won't be carrying out attacks that may raise risks of a broader conflict, involving Russia.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), in the meantime, showed that bearish sentiments in the market jumped 6.1 percentage points to 42.8%. The Syrian crisis and China's trade surplus with the U.S. improving, thereby, adding fuel to the ongoing trade conflict added to the bearish sentiments.However, the AAII survey is always used as a contrarian indicator, boosting traders' confidence when the readings get scary. And why not? As investor sentiments are now decidedly bearish, the market has neared a bottom, which means it has only one way to go, that's upward.With the markets expected to scale north after a crisis, investing in sound growth stocks seems judicious. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a  of A or B. This combination offers the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space. operates as an omni-channel retailer in the United States.

Efficiency level, which measures a company's capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company's potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value shows that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.In addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see  .(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 18.Here are four stocks from the 18 that made it through the screen: provides sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis.

Such escalating tensions, however, shouldn't dampen investors' spirits for long.After all, mounting military tensions, historically, has had no effect on markets but on humans. In fact, markets in crisis have usually recovered quickly. Keeping this in mind, investing in solid growth stocks doesn't seem to be a bad proposition.Western powers had carried out missile attacks at the heart of Syria's chemical weapons facilities. The United States, France and Britain launched 105 cruise missiles on three chemical weapon facilities, including a development center in Damascus' Barzeh region and two installations near Homs. The strike was carried out after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had sanctioned a chemical weapon attack on civilians in Damascus.This retaliation was the biggest by any Western force against Assad and his superpower ally Russia. However, the Western countries did mention that the strikes were limited to Syria's chemical weapon facilities and not aimed at Assad. Nevertheless, such targeted military strikes against the Syrian government have dented investors' sentiment of late.Investors should not fear a missile strike on Syria as such attacks have limited impact on the stock market, especially over the long run. Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief global investment strategist at  & Co, said that immediately after a military strike, markets tend to lose around 0.3%, but there is nothing earth-shattering about it. Such movements happen during every normal trading session almost.In fact, post-crisis lows open up good buying opportunities, per an analysis conducted by Ned Davis Research. After major geopolitical crisis in the past century, they have found that the market rebound has been so solid that within six months it stands higher than where it was before the catastrophe.Ned Davis Research analyzed that the Dow Jones Industrial Average on average fell 3.2% after any crisis, yet by six months, the blue-chip index manages to recover from the lows. In fact, it scales higher in 12 months' time. If the Sep 11, 2011 attack is to be considered, the index tanked 17.5% five trading sessions later. But, it bounced back in less than two months and was higher than where it had been on Sep 10.Trump has tweeted that attacks on Syria were \"mission accomplished.\" This also suggests that the President won't be carrying out attacks that may raise risks of a broader conflict, involving Russia.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), in the meantime, showed that bearish sentiments in the market jumped 6.1 percentage points to 42.8%. The Syrian crisis and China's trade surplus with the U.S. improving, thereby, adding fuel to the ongoing trade conflict added to the bearish sentiments.However, the AAII survey is always used as a contrarian indicator, boosting traders' confidence when the readings get scary. And why not? As investor sentiments are now decidedly bearish, the market has neared a bottom, which means it has only one way to go, that's upward.With the markets expected to scale north after a crisis, investing in sound growth stocks seems judicious. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a  of A or B.

Efficiency, which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company's financial health.However, it is difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio.We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company's business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough phase in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.This ratio is used to measure a company's capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.This is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company's potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Another popular efficiency ratio is the operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

Efficiency, which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company's financial health.However, it is difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio.We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company's business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough phase in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.This ratio is used to measure a company's capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.This is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company's potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Another popular efficiency ratio is the operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.In addition to the above mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) - to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)(Only Zacks Rank #1 and Buy-rated stocks can get through.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,904 stocks to only 20. Here are four of the 20 stocks that passed the screen. provides hematology products and solutions. The company has a Zacks Rank #1.

Consider  , a firm in the Auction and Valuation Services industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, CPRT has beaten estimates by at least 20% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Two quarters ago, CPRT was expected to post earnings of 26 cents per share, while it actually produced 33 cents per share, a beat of 26.9%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 38 cents per share, when it actually saw 47 cents per share instead, representing a 23.7% positive surprise. | Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Copart. In fact, the  for CPRT is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This is the case for CPRT, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.81%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that CPRT has a great Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile.

After all, efficiency is a potential indicator of a company's financial health.Moreover, a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company's business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that it will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.This ratio is used to measure a company's capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.This is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company's potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Copart Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $35.50. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $49.00. The standard deviation is $5.286.But the whole reason to look at the  CPRT price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CPRT crossing above that average target price of $42.30/share, investors in CPRT have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $42.30 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

After all, efficiency is a potential indicator of a company's financial health. Moreover, a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine.

After all, efficiency is a potential indicator of a company's financial health. Moreover, a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.In addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 21.Here are five stocks from the 21 that made it through the screen: provides online auctions and vehicle remarketing services.

Efficiency, which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company's financial health.However, it is difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio.We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company's business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough phase in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.This ratio is used to measure a company's capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.This is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company's potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Another popular efficiency ratio is the operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

Investors can pick momentum stocks using it to eke out satisfactory returns. The strategy was formulated by Richard Driehaus using the buy high and sell higher principle. Its success has helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron's All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: \"I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.\" In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine.

(NASDAQ: CPRT)Q1 2018 Nov. 22, 2017 Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Q1 fiscal 2018 . Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated.Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, Chantel. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Q1 earnings release conference call for 2018. With me, in the room today is Jeff Liaw, CFO and Will Franklin, Executive Vice President for Copart. With that, will turn it over to Jeff Liaw who will give you some color commentary and then over to Will Franklin and then we will open up for questions.So, it's my pleasure to introduce Jeff Liaw. -- Thanks, Jay. I'll start with the safe harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures including non-GAAP net income per diluted share which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of foreign currency related gains and losses, impairment of long-lived assets, certain income tax benefits, foreign income tax credit limitations and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the 'Investor Relations' link and in our press release issued yesterday.We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyzed our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a complete discussion of these risks that could affect our business, please review the 'Management's Discussion and Analysis' portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC.We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf.Now, turning to the Q1, Copart enjoyed another record Q1 in unit sales revenue gross profit and operating income. As you can see in the press release, we grew global revenue by 21% year over year for the Q1. The underlying factor this year was slightly beneficial year-over-year currency effect of 1.7 million dollars on foreign operations primarily due to relative strength in the British Pound after lapping the BREXIT event in June of the last year 2016. Excluding the effect of hurricane Harvey, revenue grew by 15.8%.A little color on this front. Under current revenue recognition guidelines, we do recognize revenue for certain pre-auction services we provide including, for example, towing and flood cleanup services. As a result, we boosted the revenue for some cars not yet sold through our auctions. We enjoyed global unit sales growth of 10% with US growth of 11% and international growth of 5%.US unit growth was driven primarily by market growth, territory wins, new customer wins as well as the effects of catastrophic events and acquisitions. If we exclude catastrophic events from both periods, last year and this year, for the Q1, US unit sales grew by 10.6% year over year. Excluding acquisitions, US unit sells grew at 8.3%.Turning to inventory. This is again the non-GAAP inventory measures. These are literally the cars in Copart facilities. Global inventory grew by 17.5%.Excluding [inaudible] inventory from both periods, inventory growth would have been approximately 7% for the period with less than 1% of the inventory growth attributable to acquisitions. Our service revenue grew 67 million dollars year-over-year or 21.8%. Our purchased car revenue growth of 6.1 million dollars or 15.8%, continuing the trend you've seen in recent quarters as we've migrated business from principal to agency arrangements. Our gross profit grew from 145.3 million to 163.3 million with a decrease in gross margins from 42% to 38.9% which is a mix of offsetting factors.I'll start first with the favorable gross margin and gross profit driver of an increase in average selling prices for our cars.In the U.S., we experienced an increase year over year of almost 14% in average selling prices largely due to increased selling prices for our insurance carrier source cars due to a combination of factors which we will expound upon further along in this call but a few things of note. The first is that we are observing newer cars being totaled. We're also seeing less severely damaged cars being totaled. For our auctions, despite seeing substantial unit growth year over year, we're seeing heightened bidding activity in excess of unit growth, meaning we have more bidders and more bids per car that we're listing.We are also benefiting from what appears to be a strong used car price environment. The Manheim Index is up almost 6% year over year with 6 consecutive record months. And lastly, we are experiencing a reasonably sound scrap environment, up 11% year over year.The unfavorable driver of gross margin rate and gross profit for the period, of course, is the catastrophic expenses we incurred in the period of approximately 36 million dollars. In a catastrophic event, we incurred two types of cost including first, unit-related expenses such a sub-haul expenses and flood cleanup services as well as period expenses such as rent for temporary facilities, personnel, and travel-related expenses. In this period, we incurred substantial expenses on both fronts. Per our prior discussion about revenue, because we incurred the majority of our sub-haul and flood cleanup expenses in this period, our future mix of catastrophic costs will shift more toward ongoing period expenses including rent, people, and travel.The net effect for us in this quarter of hurricane Harvey was an approximately 17 million dollars pre-tax loss. Over the full lifetime of hurricane Harvey, we expect to incur a net loss to serve our customers.Turning to general and administrative expenses, we were down from 35.2 million last year to 34 million this year ex-DNA. This is largely the result of lapping 5.2 million dollars in payroll taxes from a year ago in connection with certain executive stock options exercises. Excluding this, [inaudible] increased by 4 million dollars, approximately half of which is attributable to acquisitions and the balance organic. Our GAAP operating income grew from 104.8 million dollars to 123.9 or 18%.If we normalized simply for the payroll expenses incurred last year, operating income was up 13%. As noted previously, our net catastrophic losses this quarter of 17 million dollars, so excluding this event and also normalized for payroll expenses, operating income grew by some 28% year over year. Our net interest expense for the quarter was down from 5.6 million to 5.4, due largely to a lower funded debt balance.Last note on the P&L. On non-GAAP net income, grew from 66.3 million to 77.1 million, a growth of 16%. This excludes the book tax benefits of our early adoption of ASU 2016-09 regarding the tax treatment of certain stock option exercises. This also excludes US 3 million dollars as a loss on the disposal of certain non-operating assets.A tidbit here worth noting, when we acquire real estate, we allocate purchase price based on market values to land, buildings, and improvements. In this case, we demolished certain buildings acquired almost 10 years ago because we had a higher and better use of that capacity which is for storage capacity for our vehicles. After adjusting for the stock split, year-over-year non-GAAP share counts up slightly from 234.7 million to 236.8 million with the majority of this increase attributable to the effect of a higher stock price. The bottom line is a 15% increase in non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share.One last note on cash flow and I'll turn it over to Will. Operating cash flow for the quarter of 93.3 million dollars compared to 74 0.3 million a year ago due to a combination of factors including increased cash earnings. Our capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately 41.5 million of which approximately 70% is for land and development, continuing the theme you've heard us talk about in prior calls, our 2020 program to grow capacity to serve our customers.With that, I'll turn it to our EVP, Will Franklin. -- Thank you, Jeff. Let me add a few comments, provide some color on our performance in the quarter as well as some color on what's going on in the industry. Copart delivered another strong quarter. This quarter we grew our worldwide revenue and EBIT by $73.2 and $19.19 respectively.Excluding the impact of hurricane Harvey, our revenue and EBIT growth would have been 54.7 million and 36.5 million dollars respectively and the growth rate in revenue and EBIT would have been 15.8% and 34.8% respectively. In North America, our revenue growth excluding the impact of Harvey was 49.9 million dollars or 17.3%. In North America, non-Harvey unit volume was up 9.6% and was driven by organic growth and market wins. In the insurance car market, we continued growth in our non-insurance business and our recent NPA acquisition.We continued to experience growth in the overall salvage car market. Despite the introduction of accident avoidance technology as propagation throughout the car park, accident frequency continues to grow. According to independent fiscal services, the average quarterly growth in the number of paid collision claims for the last 18 quarters has been 4.7% and in the last quarter reported, the growth was 0.3%. However, even more impactful than the increase in claims frequency is the increase in the total loss frequency which over the last 7 quarters has grown at an average rate of 6.7%.Total loss frequency is the percentage of time that a car involved in a claim is sold rather of that repaired or restored. It is important to note that the growth in total loss frequency as incurred in an environment of increasing used car values. We see nothing in the near future to suggest an abatement in the growth in either claim frequency or total loss frequency.In North America, our quarterly insurance volume has grown in absolute unit terms at an average rate of 12% since the beginning of our fiscal 2015. We also continue to see growth in volume from our non-insurance suppliers. These suppliers include franchise and independent dealers, finance companies who give us the repossession of these vehicles, charities, municipalities, equipment dealers and brokers. On a quarter-over basis, volume from the franchise and independent dealers grew by 23%.These cars are typically rent-a-drive cars, yielding higher ASPs with higher profitability and bearing a shorter cycle time. Overall growth excluding NPA and our non-insurance volume was 13%. In North America, excluding the impact of Harvey, our revenue per car on a quarter-over basis was up approximately 7%. Revenue increased due primarily to higher ASPs.Used car pricing was up almost 5.9% and we saw a beneficial change in the mix of vehicles sold at auction as we saw a meaningful decreased in the number charity cars and a significant increase in dealer cars and we added to our mix the motorcycles from NPA which carried a higher ASP and higher revenue per transaction.We are also seeing what we believe to be a less severely damaged car being totaled by the insurance companies. Finally, we saw an increase in revenue from sellers as we adjusted our pricing to certain sellers to more accurately reflect the valuable land utilized in our operations. We are also seeing the benefit of our marketing efforts to our international buyers and the impact it's having on our ASPs. Total bids from international buyers were over 35% higher than the same quarter last year and included for the first time bids from Albania, Turkmenistan, and Gibraltar.In North America, the value of products sold to international buyers increased to 21.9% from 19.8% for the same quarter last year.Turning to the U.K., we saw a marginal decline in units sold resulting in part from our decision to eliminate less profitable programs. Nevertheless, expressed in GBP, revenue grew by 1.1% and gross margin grew by 6.8% and we continued to focus on the more profitable markets. We can change to see meaningful progress in Germany [inaudible] by weekly auctions for three insurance suppliers of two major rental car companies. Auction buyer participation is exceeding our expectation as a number of participants and the number of unique bidders per auction is higher than those same metrics for the US.Returns achieved through our Copart auctions in Germany significantly exceed those achieved through the existing remarketing convention in which vehicles are placed on listing board for a period of two days and high bids are accepted to a 21-day contingency period in which the seller may withdraw the offer.Key to our growth in Germany is the expansion of our network of facilities. In addition to the soul operational facilities which are located near Hanover, we have purchased, are in the process of developing two new facilities in northern Germany, one near Berlin and the other near Leipzig. We expect to begin phasing-in operations at these locations within six months. We continue our efforts to open at least three other facilities in Germany, one in the western and two in the southern areas of the country.We're also seeing meaningful progress in Brazil where volume was up 21% and EBIT contribution was up 140%. Nevertheless, on an overall basis for the quarter, our operations outside of North America and the UK while profitable remain immaterial in both revenue and EBIT. At the end of the quarter, our North America revenue was up approximately 20%. Excluding [inaudible], North America inventory was up more than 8%.Inventory outside of North America remained relatively flat. On a consolidated basis and excluding the abnormal operating costs associated with hurricane Harvey, our average cost to process each car remained relatively consistent with the same quarter last year. We remain focused on controlling our G&A expense and we are pleased with our efforts to gain leverage by limiting its growth. The total G&A expense for the quarter was 34 million dollars and included 1.8 million dollars of additional G&A expense associated with the NPA operations.Excluding the additional NPA cost, G&A remained very consistent with the prior three quarters despite increases in both unit volume and the number of yards. It should be noted that extreme weather events, as cited by CCC, are occurring more frequently and are impactful to our volumes and operations. In 2016, the insurance industry experienced 750 extreme weather events. In 2015, that number was 730.During the 10-year period ending in 2015, the average number of events per year was 590. [Inaudible] and our ability to address them on behalf of our insurance customers are becoming an increasingly important part of our service offerings. Our goal of providing an immediate land capacity to our insurance customers during the [inaudible] along with the continuing organic growth in the insurance market and our growth in the noninsurance business is driving our need for more land. During the last fiscal year, we opened 12 new yards and we expanded 15 existing locations.In total, we added almost 700 acres of capacity. Our expansion activities continued into this quarter and will continue throughout the year. During the quarter we opened two new yards, one in Exeter, Rhode Island, and one Andrews, Texas. In addition, we expended seven existing locations and opened one sub-lot.In total, we added approximately 226 acres of new capacity. With the new yards and the new expansions already in the construction phase including [inaudible] yards in Houston, North Carolina, New Jersey and Alabama, we could add another 1000 acres during the remainder of this fiscal year.That concludes my comments on the quarter. Chantel, we will turn the call back over to you for the Q&A session. -- Chantel.Thank you very much.

Once again, to ask a question, please press star 1 on your touchtone phone now.Our first question will come from Bob Labick, CJS Securities. -- Good morning and congratulations on a nice start to fiscal 2018. -- Thank you, Bob. -- I want to start with the NPA, the National Power Sports. What did you learn since you've had it in the fold? How's it going versus your expectation expectations and are you looking at additional adjacent growth opportunities? Are there any on the radar now or how should we think about [inaudible]? -- Thanks, Bob. So, the National Power Sports acquisition, I think, we completed in June of this year and it has performed according to our expectations. We acquired the business believing, as you may recall from our prior discussion that but it was both an excellent stand-alone investment as a company well positioned in an attractive marketplace with room to grow ahead of it and it was also very strategically relevant to us given our recent focus on the power sports arena with crash toys and otherwise that it would ultimately help us serve our existing customers as well. That piece has remained very much intact.The company's performing well. The team is excited to be part of the family as well. So, no surprises there. -- Okay. -- And then the question about other, not particularly, I think we wouldn't speculate on any forward-looking M&A activity but no, it's not per se part of the systemic program. -- Okay, great. And then congratulations on the progress in Germany. You've answered many of my questions there. So, I'll just shift to, I think, the other news on the call which is really interesting was the positive pricing on US insurance cars.Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about how much of this is perhaps temporary as a result of used car prices were up because of the hurricane? How much is it a structural shift? And what are the drivers behind that shift of newer cars being totaled? -- I think that what we're seeing is it's not a one-time event. I think it's a trend. I think what's happening is we're saying the increase in repair costs driven by a number of different factors and we've talked about this very extensively, the complexities of the cars, the exotic metals. We're also seeing consolidation in the repair industry where it's predicted by the year 2020, 45% of all repairs will be handled by MSOs.All these are leading to an increase in repair cost which in turn are leading to a higher salvage frequency in the new and more complex cars. -- Okay, super. Well, thank you very much. -- Thanks, Bob.Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Craig Kennison, Baird. -- Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions as well. I wanted to ask about Harvey first of all. I think on the last call you said you were assigned 85,000 vehicles.I'm wondering how many of those have you actually sold and how many remain to be sold? -- So, the sales of the units this quarter of approximately 12,000 or thereabouts and the pickup activity, they're still staggered. We, by and large, completed the pickups in this quarter. -- Got it. -- Just to point out again what Jeff said previously, the majority of the expenses associated with processing these cars, the recovery and the storage and [inaudible] land occurs at the very beginning of the process, right up to the assignment and that's why you see the loss generated in this quarter. So, you see some choppiness in the impact of the storm on our financial results for the next couple of quarters but on an overall basis, we expect to have a loss. -- Yeah, that's very helpful, as you frame it. And maybe following up on that, well, of the 36 million costs reported associated with Harvey, does that include all the cost to process the cars or just the abnormal costs above and beyond what it would normally take to process the vehicle. -- That's the abnormal cost and primarily is due to the extra storage, the extra labor cost and primarily extra towing cost. -- Thank you. And then shifting gears, the incremental margin in the quarter look to be fantastic. I mean, your EBIT margin on a quarterly basis appeared to be up almost 500 basis points based on our math. I mean, how sustainable is that trend? What is really driving that incremental profitability and, again, how sustainable is it? -- Well, we [inaudible] providing a forward-looking guidance, as you know, Craig. There's nothing particularly distorting the quarter, I'd say, meaning beside the [inaudible] obviously which we helped to normalized for you. So, you're seeing the benefits in some cases of some operating leverage, some strong unit growth, leveraging our existing facilities and infrastructure. You're seeing of course of G&A has not grown anywhere near the rate that our revenue and gross profit has.So, I think it's largely operating leverage on the G&A level and then, of course, the selling price phenomenon you heard Will and me both talk about. -- Yeah, makes sense. Hey, congratulations. Thank you. -- Thank you, Craig.Thank you. Our next will come from John Healy, Northcoast Research. -- Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the comment you guys made about the cars that you're seeing completely to the yard being a little bit younger. Is there any way to think about that by kind of bucketing the age of vehicles? I know a lot of the industry data sometimes look at cars less than three years old or three to eight years old and maybe older than 8 years old. Is there a way to think about kind of what you're seeing today in terms of your mix in maybe that 0 to 3 or 3 to 8-year-old car population? -- John, we don't intend to provide any further data publicly but the logic is what you just described. So, we look at it on a histogram basis how many cars are 0 to 1, 0 to 5, 6 to 10, etc. and that's what yielded the commentary you heard today which is that we are seeing a newer mix of cars in Q1 of this year as compared to the Q1 of last year. -- I might add another comment that there's another metric that we look at and that's the estimated repair value to the ECV of the car and we're saying what we hope, we think, is a trend of cars being totaled at a lower repair to ECV ratio. -- Okay. And then I wanted to ask about the cost associated with Harvey event. On the kind of processing side, how much of that processing cost you think would stay in until those vehicles are absolutely sold? How much of that kind of what I'd say variable expense line item should we see into Q2 and Q3? Thanks. -- John, we're not prepared to be more specific on that front except to say that, as you heard from Will, a good chunk of the costs for us are the towing expense and also the flood cleanup. Those expenses were largely incurred in Q1. That said, there is ongoing processing cost, as you might call them, including the rent for temporary facilities, including personnel. So, we still have a lot of extra folks who are on the ground there in person managing the volume we've got as well as the travel and of course expenses that comes from having extra personnel deployed there.So, those expenses will continue in subsequent quarters. -- Okay, great. Have a great Thanksgiving, guys. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. -- Hey, good morning, guys. What are you seeing on title transfer time [inaudible] Harvey? Is the product moving pretty quickly? And it seems like you've got, is it 70,000 odd cars left to clear? -- No, we don't have 70,000 left to clear but yeah we have seen a slowdown and it's just the capacity of the states that process these titles. We're doing everything that we can on our end and initially, we saw times that were consistent with what we would expect in normal operations but more recently we've seen a slowdown. -- Okay. I think you said that you had 85,000 assignments on the last quarter conference call and you said you had done 12,000 on Q1 or. So, are there fewer than 70,000 remaining? -- No, we've got more than that but what we're dealing with right now, Bret, is we've already sold more cars in November than we sold in last quarter. So, trying to do the math when we're selling at such a fast rate, I think two things from listening to that question is the majority of the vehicles will be sold in this quarter. So, in Q2, the quarter we're in now, we're going to unload the majority of those vehicles, we will be selling the remaining Q3 and Q4 but the majority will go in Q2. The second thing I would say is because we've incurred, what Jeff said, 17 million of expense ... -- 36 million in expense, 19 of revenue. So, 17 million net loss. -- 17 million dollars net in the last quarter, it'll be profitable going [inaudible]. They're going to benefit Q2, they're going to benefit Q3 and benefit Q4 but overall we will lose, as we explained earlier. -- Okay, great. I a couple times in your prepared remarks you mentioned account wins. Is there anything meaningful shifting on the insurance side? -- Nothing that we would identify specifically. We're always competing for business [inaudible] competitive market but we're also always trying to improve our service offerings and our products and I think we're doing a very good job in doing that. -- Okay, great. And then you said 1000 acres possible in the balance of fiscal 2018. Would that get you to sort of where you need to be from a real estate standpoint or are we looking against 2019, growing real estate beyond that level? -- If the trends continue, we're seeing 10% growth in just the insurance salvage market. That means we'd have to add 700 or 800 acres a year to keep pace. And in addition to that, we've employed or a new approach to [inaudible] where we want to be able to land bank large [inaudible] capacity in high-risk areas and that also [inaudible] our need for land. So, I don't see the need for land abating for the next couple of years. -- Okay, great. Thank you. -- Thanks, Bret.Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu, Stephens Inc. -- Thanks. I'm [Inaudible] in for Ben. Congrats on a nice quarter. So, G&A is actually down year over year and Jeff, I think you called out that we're a big driver was [inaudible] over a step-up in payroll taxes [inaudible] options.Going forward, do you guys still expect it to on a dollar basis but leveraged as a percentage of sales and is there [inaudible] revenue growth that you need to get that leverage? -- Well, to answer your question, yes, we expect it to grow and I'm convinced [inaudible] that with the increase of products and technology and volume and land capacity but we also don't expect it to grow as fast as our revenue. So, we think that while it gross, it's still leverageble. -- Okay, can you maybe talk about what's driving the improvement of that margin? Is there any big call out you're doing or is it a lot of smaller things that are driving these efficiencies? -- For an earlier question, I think our margins are driven by unit volume leverage. So, the benefits of selling additional units through our facilities, so to speak, so that obviously grows over time as well. The selling prices of our vehicles have been strong. You've heard a fair bit of commentary on that today as well.And then, lastly, I think the point you raised at the outset of your question here which is G&A which grows but typically not at rates anywhere close to the kind of revenue growth rates we're experiencing today. -- Okay, thanks. And then moving over to Europe, I know you guys have commented that the German market is really representative of the EU. You guys talked about the progress in Germany but are there any other specific European countries you guys are looking to expand into in the near and immediate term. -- Well, we're currently in Spain and think we have the same opportunity in Spain. We have one existing facility in Madrid and we're currently looking at expanding into the areas of Barcelona and the [Inaudible]. So, I think that would be the next area that we'll probably be focusing our efforts. -- Okay. Well, that's it from me, guys. Thanks so much. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question will come from Matthew Paige, Gabelli. -- Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. Just one question for me today and I know they make up a very small portion of the car park but do you have any color as to how claim or totaling frequency on electric vehicles compares to their traditional counterparts? -- I think your premise is the right one which is the sample size remains so small but it's in most respects too early to tell. The combination of factors would be electric vehicles are often made out of more complex substrates. So, the panels are more difficult to repair. They also often come with additional safety technologies or cameras on the perimeter which again also further escalates repair costs and could or should lead to total loss rates being higher but it's too early to render a definitive conclusion on the [inaudible]. -- All right, great. Appreciate the color. Happy Thanksgiving.Thank you. Once again, we will take any final question by pressing the star 1 on your touchtone phone. Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research. -- Hey, good morning, everyone. A couple of questions here. Because a lot of these cars that you're getting in hurricane Harvey are freshwater cars versus saltwater, I know you said you only auctioned off 12,000, a small amount relative to what you've been assigned but can you give us some idea relative to other hurricanes where there has been saltwater damage? Are you seeing a lift in the price of the cars because they're freshwater damage or that doesn't really matter at all? -- We are, Gary. And I think it goes beyond the nature of the damage. I think that the interest companies and the repair shops are completely overwhelmed by the [inaudible] volume in those areas and I think we're getting better cars than you might in a different environment. So, the ASPs on the Harvey cars are higher than in other [inaudible] than overall company average is. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then did you guys call out what Cycle Express added in revenues this quarter or can you do that for us? -- We didn't. We just provided the color that the US new sales would have been paid 8.3% excluding [inaudible]. -- Okay, all right. So, you don't call it out. That's fine. And then lastly, you mentioned that you're seeing strong growth on the non-insurance vehicles, particularly on the franchise and independent dealer side.A couple of questions here. Has there been any shift in the amount of cars that are non-insurance? I believe it kind of hovers around 20%. Are you seeing it shift higher now as a percentage? -- Yes, non-insurance cars are growing as a percentage excluding Harvey of course and that's been driven primarily by cars from the franchise and independent dealerships but there are other segments that have been growing as well. -- I mean, if it was 20%, has the shift been now at 22%, 23% or is that something you just haven't called out? -- It's something we haven't called out. We talked about the growth in that market itself which was 13% last quarter. -- All right, OK. And then in terms of these non-insurance vehicles, on an overall basis, especially the ones that are trade-ins, are they lifting your cumulative average selling price or are you still looking at maybe the 10 to the 12-year-old car that's going to get $2,000 at an auction. -- Well, six quarters ago where much of your [inaudible] and non-insurance cars came from charity, it was actually detrimental to our average ASPs but that's no longer the case. So, we've made some adjustments to our approach to charities and we've reduced the number of cars coming from that market. At the same time, we did spend significantly our efforts in the areas of franchise and independent dealerships. We have new programs in place.We have new resources focused on it but probably more importantly, we're getting higher returns than we have been in the past on these types of cars and that's all leading to more volume. Those cars have a higher ASP or [inaudible] to our overall ASPs. -- Thank you. Have a great Thanksgiving.Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Ryan Brinkman, JP Morgan. -- Hi. Good morning. This is Samik on for Ryan Brinkman. I just wanted to get your outlook first on pricing.You have strong momentum when it comes to ASPs this quarter but as we sort of go through the processing of vehicles related to the hurricanes in the coming quarters, do you see it having a sort of a more depressing or a bit of pressure on pricing going forward just given the volumes you will be processing or do you think the mix is strong enough here to offset that? -- The mix is [inaudible] the hurricane would more than offset the supply factors you just described. So, the typical hurricane car sells for more than our standard insurance sourced vehicle. -- Okay. Then when I look at the cost headwinds you had of 36 million in the quarter and when I compare that to the closest competitor, they had roughly 5 million of costs and I was wondering if you had any thought. I know don't have [inaudible] the exact nature of their cost but if there are any thoughts you have what's driving that big difference between you and your closest competitor in the abnormal cost related to the hurricanes? -- As you noted, we don't, of course, have any visibility as to how they account for the catastrophic events. I'll note off course that our quarter doesn't end [inaudible] the same time that theirs does. So, that may be a driver. We just know that 36 million dollars is what it took for us to provide excellent service to our customers in connection with these catastrophic events.It's hard for me to comment on theirs. -- Okay, great. Thank you. -- I mean, it's just part of one weather area which I think we exceeded, I think, the expectations of our insurance [inaudible]. We actually obtain in excess of 800 acres of storage capacity at a cost of 15 million dollars and I think those types of efforts generate costs in excess of what otherwise would be expected in these situations. -- Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks for taking our questions.At this time, we no further questions in the queue. -- Thank you, Chantel. Thank you, everyone, for attending Q1 call for Copart. Happy Thanksgiving and we look forward to reporting on Q2 next year.Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this conference has now concluded.

Copart's management said  that the expenses from Hurricane Harvey will carry through the next few quarters, and that auction revenue (from the sales of the vehicles) probably won't be seen until the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.This means that Copart isn't likely to see its bottom line grow until the vehicles' costs subside  after the company is able to start selling the extra vehicles its picked up from the hurricane.

In the first quarter, the company incurred costs of $35.8 million and generated $18.6 million in revenue from hurricane-related vehicle sales, for a net loss of $17.2 million before taxes.Copart had warned analysts  that Harvey was going to add to costs in the Q1 without showing up as sales until the third or fourth quarter.

Copart doesn't provide specific quarterly financial guidance, but both the top and bottom lines were well ahead of investors' expectations for earnings of $0.27 per share on revenue of $377.4 million.Image source: Getty Images.Within Copart's top line, service revenue climbed 21.8% year over year to $374.1 million, while vehicle sales revenue grew 15.8% to just over $45 million.Copart's operating results also included $35.8 million in abnormal costs related to Hurricane Harvey during the quarter, including temporary storage facilities, subhauler premiums, overtime labor, equipment leases to handle increased volume, and travel and lodging expenses for reassigned employees. Net of the roughly $18.6 million in revenue associated with that increased volume, Copart incurred a pre-tax loss of roughly $17.2 million from the hurricane.Even so, that only partially accounts for Copart's top-line outperformance this quarter.

Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  , which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in RBA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 94 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 87 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers has seen seven downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 19 cents a share from 24 cents over the past 30 days.The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 12.6% in the past month.R  | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Auction and Valuation Services industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Copart, Inc.  .

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Copart is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CPRT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 27 cents per share for CPRT, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CPRT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +7.14% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year back test shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that CPRT has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

Here's a rundown of the company's most recent results.Data source: Copart.Copart's net income and earnings-per-share drop came mainly from an impairment charge.Image source: Getty Images.Management noted on the call that the impairment charge Copart experienced in the fourth quarter was for the remaining \"technology assets\" that it had to write off back in fiscal 2015. The $19.4 million cost should be the last of the charges Copart has to pay.Additionally, management spoke briefly about its purchase of National Powersport Auctions. CFO Jeffrey Liaw didn't get into specific numbers, but did say that the acquisition will be accretive to Copart \"right away.\"Copart's executive vice president of operations and shared services, William E. Franklin, also said on the call that the company is continuing its expansion of vehicle yards and that, \"Our expansion activities will continue as we believe industry trends will drive significant future growth and volume.\"Copart usually doesn't offer any forward guidance, but management did talk extensively on the call about Hurricane Harvey's effect on the company's business and how it will impact the next few quarters.CEO Jayson Adair said that the company had already picked up more than 40,000 vehicles damaged by Harvey in the Houston area, and that it'll likely see more than double that number by the time all of the vehicle processing is complete. Adair said there will be \"significant costs\" associated with renting out the space to store all the vehicles in the short term.Additionally, Copart won't generate revenue from the sales of those vehicles at auction until the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. All of which means the company will likely have a lot of expenses in the first quarter fiscal 2018, which will hopefully be offset by revenue later in the year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As you might know, value stocks are fundamentally strong companies with solid growth potential that are trading for less than they're worth -- which means there's also a greater chance they'll outperform the market in the long run and provide rich returns.Right now, Motley Fool investors believe vehicle auctioneer  (NASDAQ: CPRT) , power-and-gas utility  (NYSE: ED) , and pharmaceutical heavyweight  (NYSE: PFE) are offering excellent entry points for retirees. Here's why. In past roundtables, I've offered up car companies like  and  as viable value stocks for investment -- cheap stocks that, assuming things stay the same and the auto industry continues to cycle from highs to lows to highs again, should do fine in the long run. But what if things  stay the same? What if the entire automotive industry gets disrupted by the arrival of electric vehicles from companies like  ?Image source: Getty Images.When investing for retirement, the last thing you want to worry about is your entire company being made obsolete due to a change in technology. That's why I'm going to suggest an investment in one company that should do just fine whether Americans are still buying gas guzzlers a few decades from now, or whether they've switched over to the electro-buggies.What kind of company could survive a change that big? The answer is Copart.Copart is the kind of company that enters the picture at an automobile's end of life. Running auctions primarily of vehicles salvaged from auto accidents and facilitating their resale to buyers planning to dismantle said vehicles, Copart doesn't really care what kind of  those cars and trucks (used to) run on. It's concerned with squeezing the last bit of value out of a dead automobile before it goes to the great junkyard in the sky.This is a good business to be in and likely to remain so, even if electric cars eventually take over the world. Last quarter, Copart grew its sales 8%, and grew its profits nearly three times as fast. Copart stock sells for only 18.2 times earnings -- which doesn't sound particularly cheap, but really is if Copart can hit the long-term earnings-growth-rate target of 18.6% that Wall Street has set for it. (By the way, last quarter, the company grew earnings  %.)That works out to a  ratio of less than 1.0 -- and in my view, it makes Copart stock a value stock that's just perfect for retirement. : A defensive stock is ideally a great choice for retirees, simply because a company in a non-cyclical business is better equipped to generate stable revenues -- and, therefore, shareholder returns in the long run. Electric-and-gas utility Consolidated Edison is a fine example, and the stock's currently trading at a pretty compelling seven times price to cash flow.Con Ed is a highly regulated business, as it provides electricity and gas to millions of customers primarily in New York City and Westchester County at decoupled rates, or rates aligned with pre-established revenue targets. What that means is that Con Ed's revenues are pretty much known in advance, which explains why the company's profits and cash flows have been northward bound in recent years. data by Of course, Con Ed isn't the kind of company to grow gangbusters, but in retirement, you're better off with a low-volatile, stable business than a high-risk one. And it's not that Con Ed hasn't generated good returns for shareholders -- the stock has gained nearly 64% in the past five years. Much of it has to do with dividends -- Con Ed has increased its dividends for 43 consecutive years, with the stock yielding 3.3% currently. In fact, Con Ed is the only utility to have made it to the coveted  list.With Con Ed now also tapping  and renewable-energy opportunities, I expect its top and bottom lines to grow at a faster clip in coming years. Con Ed's potential growth, combined with dividends, should make it a perfect retirement stock. Value can come in many forms.  The pharma titan Pfizer, for instance, offers investors a top-notch clinical pipeline that sports 96 total compounds and possible line extensions, a mountain of cash reserves, and one of the best dividend programs within its peer group. For retirees, though, the big-ticket item is the sheer diversity of Pfizer's revenue stream.Unlike many big pharmas and blue-chip biotechs that derive half, or even more, of their total revenues from a single flagship product, Pfizer's  basically ensures that its risk stemming from patent headwinds and/or new competitive threats is far less than the industry average. In the first quarter of 2017, for instance, Pfizer didn't have a single product that made up more than 9.9% of its total sales.Although the one particular drug -- the pain medicine Lyrica -- that composed 9.9% of the drugmaker's sales in Q1 is facing its own patent cliff, Pfizer's trio of novel cancer drugs -- Bavencio, Ibrance, and Xtandi -- should keep its top line moving in the right direction going forward. In other words, Pfizer's \"strength-in-numbers\" strategy is proving to be an efficient remedy against the never-ending battle with generic competition.On the dividend side of the equation, Pfizer's yield of 3.85% is close to the top within its immediate peer group. While the drugmaker's 12-month trailing payout ratio of 102% might be a tad worrisome, Pfizer has ample free cash flows -- over $15 billion -- and cash reserves -- $14.7 billion -- to more than cover its dividend in the years to come. Simply put, a dividend reduction is a highly unlikely scenario in the near term, despite the company's elevated payout ratio.All in all, Pfizer is a stock that offers several layers of value, making it a great pick for retirees.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After all, the average  stock sells for over 26 times earnings at recent prices. That's a steep premium to historic levels.In fairness, there's more to it than just the market's P/E ratio, but value-minded investors are having a harder time finding stocks that offer both a solid business and a reasonable price.Yet, there are values to be had, if you know where to look. Three stocks worth a hard look right now? Auto-salvage expert  (NASDAQ: CPRT) ; a surprising tech leader with huge profit potential,  (NASDAQ: YNDX) ; and beaten-up online travel review site  (NASDAQ: TRIP) .Image source: Getty Images. (  ): It's somewhat ironic to have found Copart as a great bargain stock to buy. After all, the company is in the business of selling junked, wrecked, and otherwise salvaged cars. But with its stock trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of just over 18 and a PEG ratio around 1, it's a lot like finding a pristine 1964 1/2 Mustang buried in the weeds at your neighborhood salvage yard.And Copart isn't just a cheap stock. Over the past five years, the company has grown earnings per share almost 150%, through a combination of expansion, cost efficiency, and share buybacks. Over that period, net income has increased 121%, while management has repurchased almost 10% of shares outstanding.And there's more growth in Copart's future. The company has done a solid job growing its business and expanding its relationships with some of the United States' largest auto insurers, but the auto-salvage business is still ripe for further consolidation both domestically and in the other 11 countries Copart operates in. And as one of the largest players in the business, Copart's scale is a real competitive advantage that should help it continue growing for years to come.Put it all together, and you have an industry leader with solid growth prospects, trading at its cheapest valuation in years. That's a textbook bargain stock to buy. (  ): Tell me if this sounds like a bargain stock to you: It trades for 63 times trailing earnings and has seen its net income fall 60% in the past two years. Oh, yeah -- and it's a company operating primarily in Russia -- a bastion of excellent business prospects. (Yes, that's sarcasm).OK, so maybe this isn't your prototypical \"bargain\" stock, but I think shares of Yandex are appealing at today's prices. Hidden underneath all the doom and gloom of the company's falling profit is that sales have been climbing at an impressive rate, up 28%  over the past four years.The real reason Yandex's profit hasn't kept up is that it's been aggressively reinvesting in itself. Product and development costs have jumped 270% since 2012, and sales, general, and administrative expenses are up 265% over the same time frame. What are these investments in? Primarily, the future of Yandex: e-commerce, online-to-offline (O2O) investments such as tickets and taxi-hailing services, and even TV programs.Those types of investments take a lot of up-front cash, and success isn't guaranteed. But Yandex is building a moat around itself by differentiating what Google currently offers in Russia. Eventually, the spending on that infrastructure will subside, and profits can boom.If you're looking for a real reason to believe that Yandex is a bargain, look no further than the company's price-to-sales ratio, which currently sits at 6. That's a full 75% cheaper than it was at the end of 2011. (  ): Online travel-review site TripAdvisor has been a tough stock to hold over the past few years. Shares have fallen by more than 60% from their peak because management made the bold decision in 2015 to become a one-stop shop for customers.The company wants to control the entire consumer experience by becoming an online travel agent, just like  and  . To realize this dream they rolled out an \"Instant Booking\" feature across the site, which allows customers to make their travel arrangements without ever leaving the company's platform. In theory, this move should lead to outsize revenue and profit growth for years to come.However, TripAdvisor has struggled to translate this business model change into financial success. The company's top line has stagnated since 2015, which isn't something growth investors like to see. To make matters worse, the Instant Booking rollout has proven to be expensive. When combined, TripAdvisor's profits have tanked. data by Despite the company's financial struggles, a look below the headline numbers shows that the TripAdvisor community is as strong as ever. As of the end of 2016, TripAdvisor welcomed an average of 390 million unique visitors per month. That figure compares quite favorably with the 315 million unique visitors recorded as of the end of 2014. Meanwhile, the number of reviews and listings on TripAdvisor's platform also  .In all, TripAdvisor continues to demonstrate that its platform and brands are as popular as ever with customers. If you believe that the company's Instant Booking rollout will be a success in the long term, then buying shares today could prove to be a smart decision.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Most of the good news came from the company's global unit sales growth of 18% in the second quarter, which management said was \"consistent across the United States and [sic] as well as our international segment.\"One negative note Copart's management mentioned came from currency exchange headwinds. \"We did experience a detrimental year-over-year currency effect on revenue of approximately $9.5 million,\" Liaw said. He noted that this came from the weak British pound relative to the dollar, which was down 17% year over year.Copart typically doesn't provide guidance for the coming quarter, and it didn't budge on that this quarter. However, management did say that the second quarter is traditionally one in which the company builds up inventory, and accrues additional costs as a result. Liaw mentioned that in the second quarter Copart received more units than it could sell and that \"we have borne a substantial portion of the costs already for which the units will be sold later,\" which could help improve gross margin later this year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ:  ), Liquidity Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:  ), S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:  ) and TransUnion (NYSE:  ).Industry: Business Services, part 1Link: The business services sector provides ancillary services to other industries in the market. Hence, the core business of one company in this sector can be a business service for another. Importantly, this dynamism opens the door to many business services' companies.Notably, business service accounts for a major portion of a country's gross domestic product (GDP) with the gradual shift in the global economy from agriculture to industry and even business services. Therefore, the sector plays a major role in a country's overall development.Following the election of Donald Trump as the 45 th U.S. President, gross domestic product is now expected to rise from the current projection of about 2.2%. Employment is also anticipated to improve. Also, Trump's \"business friendly approaches,\" expectation of a lower tax rate, softer regulation and inclination toward higher interest rates are likely to favor the sector.The intensely competitive business services sector must diligently work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues in order to maintain its profitability. Focus on functions and activities in line its core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale as well as improving competitive positioning.The fortunes of business service operators are closely linked to the health of the broader economy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), gross domestic product is estimated to increase in the upcoming quarters too. While in the GDP growth was 1.9% in the ultimate quarter of 2019, the growth momentum is now expected to accelerate by 2.2% in 2017 and 2.6% in 2018.This improving outlook for the U.S. economy is therefore a net positive for the sector. The bureau presently estimates total industrial production to increase 1.5% in 2017 and 3% in 2018, thus offering opportunities of growth and expansion to business service providers. Moreover, a projected rise in expenditure should support the business service sector.Economic sensitivity aside, business service companies are quite conservatively managed, with a large number of players sharing excess cash with investors through dividends and share buybacks.Nonetheless, the business service sector is highly fragmented, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. Per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to the overall revenue. However, given the group's unique nature, Zacks has classified it as one of the 16 sectors (the S&P's official GIC classification has only 10 sectors where business services are grouped within the 'Industrials' sector). Notably, with about 3.3% of total market capitalization, the sector is estimated to generate 2.8% the total income in 2017.This industry covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about $620 billion, though many companies mentioned below do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry.Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries at the medium or M-level and 256 industries at the expanded or X-level. We rank all 256 X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the  page.The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 257+ industries is by dividing it into positive, neutral and negative categories depending on the Zacks Rank. The outlook for the top one-third of the list (Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third of the list (Rank of #89 to #176) is neutral, and for the bottom one-third (Rank #177 and higher) is a clear negative.Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks - the core of our Industry Rank - has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (one to three months). We have eight X-level industries within the Business Services sector, namely Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services, Business Services, Consulting, Financial Transaction Services, Outsourcing, Staffing and Waste Removal Services.Auction/Valuation Service ranked #22, Business Information Services with a rank #59, Financial Transaction Services having a rank #76 and Waste Removal at #83, are industries that falls in the upper one-third and have a positive outlook.Staffing at rank #91 and Outsourcing at #164 are positioned in the mid one-third of all Zacks industries and have a neutral outlook.Business Services at #195 and Consulting at #209 are the ones that fall in the lower one-third and have a negative outlook.Our top pick from the Auction/Valuation industry is Copart, Inc. (NASDAQ:  ) and Liquidity Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:  ), which sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We favor S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:  ) and TransUnion (NYSE:  ) carrying Zacks Rank #2s from Business Information Services. From business information service we have picked S&P Global Inc., which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  .The valuation of the business service sector seems expensive. The Business Service sector is currently trading at 10.6X EV/EBITDA multiple. This is expensive when compared to its own traded multiple (trading near its high end of 11.11x and median of 10.47x) in the last one year as well as S&P 500 (10.15x). Shares of the sector also underperformed the S&P 500 in the last one year period.Infact the sector ranks at bottom 38% of our Zacks Sector classification.The fourth-quarter earnings season is at its peak with 82.6% of business service providers having already reported their numbers. The sector's earnings witnessed 12.1% growth on 3.1% revenue improvement. The bottom line compared favorably with the numbers delivered by the S&P 500 (6.1% earnings increase) though the top line compared unfavorably with the index (4.6% revenue growth). Beat ratio of 68.4% for earnings was weaker than the S&P 500.Overall earnings for the fourth quarter are estimated to increase 10.8% for the sector compared with a 7.5% increase for the S&P 500. Revenues, on the other hand, are expected to exhibit growth of 7.5% compared with 3.9% for the S&P 500.For full-year 2016, earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 3.0% on 3.4% revenue growth. This compares favorably with the S&P 500's expected earnings decline of 2.4% with revenues likely to inch up 0.7% from the 2015 level.Notably, our  report shows that Business Service is one of the most impressive sectors in terms of positive growth.Looking ahead, earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 10.9% on 3.7% revenue improvement for 2017. This compares unfavorably with the S&P 500's expected earnings growth of 12% but is better than the estimated revenue improvement of 3.6% from the 2016 level.Follow us on Twitter: Join us on Facebook: Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339 This material is being provided for informational purposes only and nothing herein constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a security.

Efficiency is a measure of a company's potential to convert its available input into output. Different studies have shown that there is a direct relationship between a company's efficiency level and its price movement. So investing in efficient companies may prove to be profitable.There are a number of ratios to measure how efficiently a company utilizes its assets and liabilities to produce outputs. In this article, we have considered four popular efficiency ratios to select efficient companies. The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory is considered to be one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is suffering from weak sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4-quarter average of total assets. Like the above two ratios, high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient. Efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control its operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.As efficiency level varies across different industries, it is best to select those stocks that have higher ratios compared to their industries. Along with higher ratios, we have considered only those stocks that have either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in order to make the strategy more profitable.(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,700stocks to only 22.Here are five stocks from the 22 that made it through the screen: (NYSE:  ) provides a portfolio of renal and hospital products. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 27%. (NASDAQ:  ) develops and markets software solutions. This Zacks Rank #1 company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 87.4%. (NASDAQ:  ) designs, manufactures, sells, and supports power conversion products and solutions. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 12.3% and carries a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  . (NASDAQ:  ) operates in the pharmaceutical industry and focuses on research and development in the area of drug delivery. This Zacks Rank #2 company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 32.8%. (NASDAQ:  ) provides online auctions and vehicle remarketing services. This Zacks Rank #2 company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 9.1%.While backtesting over a two-year timeframe (Nov 28, 2014 to Nov 25, 2016), considering a four-week holding period, a portfolio following this strategy provided a total return of 22.5% compared with the S&P 500's return of 6.4%.

Efficiency is a measure of a company's potential to convert its available input into output. Different studies have shown that there is a direct relationship between a company's efficiency level and its price movement. So investing in efficient companies may prove to be profitable.There are a number of ratios to measure how efficiently a company utilizes its assets and liabilities to produce outputs. In this article, we have considered four popular efficiency ratios to select efficient companies. The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory is considered to be one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is suffering from weak sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4-quarter average of total assets. Like the above two ratios, high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient. Efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control its operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.As efficiency level varies across different industries, it is best to select those stocks that have higher ratios compared to their industries. Along with higher ratios, we have considered only those stocks that have either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in order to make the strategy more profitable.(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,700stocks to only 22.Here are five stocks from the 22 that made it through the screen: provides a portfolio of renal and hospital products. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 27%. develops and markets software solutions.

This Zacks Rank #2 company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 9.1%.While backtesting over a two-year timeframe (Nov 28, 2014 to Nov 25, 2016), considering a four-week holding period, a portfolio following this strategy provided a total return of 22.5% compared with the S&P 500's return of 6.4%.

Hence, the core business of one company in this sector can be a business service for another. Importantly, this dynamism opens the door to many business services companies.Notably, business service accounts for a major portion of a country's gross domestic product (GDP) with the gradual shift in the global economy having moved from agriculture to industry to now business services. The sector, therefore, plays a major role in a country's overall development.The intensely competitive business services sector must rigorously work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues so that its profitability does not suffer. A focus on functions and activities close to its core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale, besides improving competitive positioning.The fortunes of business service operators are closely tied to the health of the broader economy. As per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), domestic economy has been expanding (at a rate of 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016 and 1.4% in the second quarter) on higher contribution from personal consumption expenditures and increased residential fixed investment. The growth momentum is now expected to accelerate by 1.5% in 2016 and 2.5% in 2017.This improving outlook for the U.S. economy is therefore a net positive for the sector. Though the bureau presently estimates total industrial production to decline 1% in 2016, the same is expected to be on the growth trajectory in 2017, with an estimated increase of 1.4%, thus offering opportunities of growth and expansion to business service providers. Moreover, a projected rise in expenditure should lend support to the business service sector.Economic sensitivity aside, business service companies are quite conservatively managed, with a large number of players sharing their excess cash with shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Nonetheless, the business service sector is highly fragmented, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. As per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to the overall revenue. However, given its unique nature, Zacks has classified the group as one of the 16 sectors (the S&P's official GIC classification has only 10 sectors where business services are grouped within the 'Industrials' sector). Notably, with about 3.4% of total market capitalization, the sector is estimated to have 2.9% share of income in 2016.This industry covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about $620 billion, though many companies mentioned below do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry.Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries (at the medium or M-level) and 256 industries at the expanded or X-level. We rank all 256 X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 257+ industries is by dividing it into positive, neutral and negative categories depending on the Zacks Rank. The outlook for the top one-third of the list (Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third of the list (Rank of #89 to #176) is neutral while that for the bottom one-third (Rank #177 and higher) is a clear negative.Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks - the core of our Industry Rank - has an impressive track, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (one to three months). We have eight X-level industries within the Business Services sector, namely, Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services, Business Services, Consulting, Financial Transaction Services, Outsourcing, Staffing and Waste Removal Services.Auction/Valuation Service ranked #9 is the only industry that falls in the upper 1/3 and has a positive outlook.Business Information Services with a rank #96, Business Services at #114, Financial Transaction Services #164 and, and Consulting ranked #165, are positioned in the mid 1/3 of all Zacks industries and have a neutral outlook.Outsourcing at #181, Waste Removal at #213 and Staffing at rank #230 are industries that fall in the lower 1/3 and have a negative outlook.This allocation points to a neutral to negative outlook for the sector.Our top picks from the Auction/Valuation industry is Copart, Inc. (NASDAQ:  -  ) sporting Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) We favor Accenture plc (NYSE:  -  ) from Consulting carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). InnerWorkings Inc. (NASDAQ:  -  ) sporting Zacks Rank #1 is our top pick from the Business Service industry. MasterCard inc. (NYSE:  -  ) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:  -  ) carrying Zacks Rank #2 are our top picks from the Financial Transaction Service industry. You can see  .The third-quarter earnings season has commenced with 13% of business service providers having already reported their numbers. The sector's earnings witnessed 19.8% growth on 10.3% revenue improvement. The figures compare favorably with the numbers delivered by the S&P 500 (1.3% earnings increase on revenue improvement of 2.9%). Beat ratio of 100% for earnings and revenue compare favorably with the S&P 500.Overall earnings for the third quarter are estimated to increase 7.1% for the sector versus a 2.9% decline for the S&P 500. Revenues on the other hand are expected to exhibit growth of 8.6% versus 1.2% for the S&P 500.For full-year 2016, earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 3.8% on 5.4% revenue improvement. This compares favorably with the S&P 500's expected earnings decline of 2.5% with revenues likely to remain flat with the 2015 level.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar.

Regardless of the fact whether it is a fledgling company or an established corporation, consistent earnings growth is what everyone looks for. And why not? If the company doesn't make money then it won't last in the long run and will eventually run out of steam.This metric is also considered to be the most significant variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. In addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.We have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company's earnings failing to meet market expectations.So, what are earnings estimates? Earnings estimates embody analysts' opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost controls. Thus, earnings estimates are a valuable tool for investors. Analysts can also examine the cash flow based on these periodic earnings estimates to determine the fair value of the company.Here, we have picked stocks that have displayed historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and are witnessing positive estimate revisions, we added the following parameters: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) stocks are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.

Richard Driehaus, a pioneer in this field, came up with a momentum strategy on the back of the \"buy high and sell higher\" principle. The success of Driehaus' investing strategy earned him the honor of a place in Barron's All-Century Team.Portfolios built on Driehaus' methodology also proved to be profitable over a significant time frame. For instance, the American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) portfolio, which followed this strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10- year timeframe, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500.Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: \"I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.\" In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a momentum score of 'A' or 'B'. Our research shows that stocks with a  of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

Regardless of the fact whether it is a fledgling company or an established corporation, consistent earnings growth is what everyone looks for. And why not? If the company doesn't make money then it won't last in the long run and will eventually run out of steam.This metric is also considered to be the most significant variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. In addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.We have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company's earnings failing to meet market expectations.So, what are earnings estimates? Earnings estimates embody analysts' opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost controls. Thus, earnings estimates are a valuable tool for investors. Analysts can also examine the cash flow based on these periodic earnings estimates to determine the fair value of the company.Here, we have picked stocks that have displayed historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and are witnessing positive estimate revisions, we added the following parameters: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) stocks are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off. You can see  : Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history. : Companies that witnessed year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal. : Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks. : Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week. : Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,674 stocks to only four.

The company, which provides online auction services for car sellers as well as marketing services, reported results that showed improvement during the fourth quarter.Data source: Nasdaq and SEC filings. YOY = year over year.Copart's results revealed that unit sales continued to increase, which helped to improve revenue in several key business segments.Copart CFO Jeffrey Liaw mentioned on the  that unit sales increased because of \"elevated driving activity, accident rates, and total loss frequency\" (that last term refers to when a car is involved in an accident and then considered a total economic loss). The company noted that total loss frequency increased by just 1.2% in 2014 but increased 6.8% this year. Copart's management also said that all three factors are helping to increase the company's North American salvage market share.Additionally, Copart's executive vice president, William Franklin, said that the complexity of new vehicles and increased technology components means that car-part demand is expected to increase. \"Cars are becoming more complex as they incorporate exotic and lightweight materials, inter-fit construction processes, sensors, cameras and other electronics, all of which demand that shops employ new equipment, tools and training, as well as acquiring more replacement parts per repair,\" Franklin said on the call.The company also noted that because of its increase in sales volumes, it will make more land acquisitions for new salvage yards than it previously anticipated. It was going to add 20 new yards in North America, but said that number will be higher now (though it didn't specify how much higher).By Liaw's own admission, Copart doesn't traditionally give a lot of guidance, but he did say on the call that the same factors that have been important for the company over the past two years will continue to be key areas to watch in 2017: \"I'd say just looking backwards say four to eight quarters, big drivers are currency, scrap values, [and] catastrophic events, which can cause higher than normalized cost incurrence.\"The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

(Symbol: CPRT) saw new options become available today, for the May 2017 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 242 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new May 2017 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $47.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $50.59/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.40% return on the cash commitment, or 8.14% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of CPRT stock at the current price level of $50.59/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.68% if the stock gets called away at the May 2017 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CPRT shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CPRT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%.

A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company's price performance. Hence, a portfolio comprising efficient stocks will be ideal for investors who are looking to derive healthy returns irrespective of market conditions.We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company's business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.This ratio is used to measure a company's capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.This is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company's potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater the chance is that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.In addition to the above mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) - to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 24.Here are five stocks from the 24 that made it through the screen: (  ) is a global leader in the development and support of technologies for production of semiconductors, flat panel displays, data storage products, solar cells, architectural glass, and other advanced product applications.

(Symbol: CPRT) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new October 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 45 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $52.34/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CPRT shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CPRT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Efficiency is a measure of a company's potential to convert its available input into output. Different studies have shown that there is a direct relationship between a company's efficiency level and its price movement. So, investing in efficient companies may prove profitable.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios to select potential stocks in order to build a profitable portfolio. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory, is considered as one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value may indicate that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value will indicate that the company is suffering from weak sales, which led to excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4-quarter average of total assets. Like the above two ratios, high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control its operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.As efficiency level varies across different industries, it is best to select those stocks that have higher ratios compared to their industries. Along with higher ratios, we have considered only those stocks that have either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in order to make the strategy more profitable. The values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers. : Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.The use of these very few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,700stocks to only 19.Here are five stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen: provides a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions, principally to licensed dismantlers, rebuilders and used vehicle dealers.

Efficiency is a measure of a company's potential to convert its available input into output. Different studies have shown that there is a direct relationship between a company's efficiency level and its price movement. So, investing in efficient companies may prove profitable.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios to select potential stocks in order to build a profitable portfolio. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory, is considered as one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value may indicate that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value will indicate that the company is suffering from weak sales, which led to excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4-quarter average of total assets. Like the above two ratios, high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control its operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.As efficiency level varies across different industries, it is best to select those stocks that have higher ratios compared to their industries. Along with higher ratios, we have considered only those stocks that have either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in order to make the strategy more profitable. The values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers. : Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.The use of these very few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,700stocks to only 19.Here are five stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen: (  ) provides a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions, principally to licensed dismantlers, rebuilders and used vehicle dealers.

Hence, the core business of one company in this sector can be a business service for another. Importantly, this dynamism opens the door to many business services companies.The intensely competitive business services sector must rigorously work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues so that its profitability does not suffer. A focus on functions and activities close to its core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale, besides improving competitive positioning.Notably, business service occupies a handsome share in a country's gross domestic product (GDP) with the gradual shift in the global economy from agriculture to industry to now business services. The sector therefore plays a major role in a country's overall development.The fortunes of business service operators are closely tied to the health of the broader economy. As per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), domestic economy expanded at a rate of 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016, which benefited from higher contribution from personal consumption expenditures and increased residential fixed investment. The growth momentum is now expected to accelerate by 1.7% in 2016 and 3.0% in 2017.This improving outlook for the U.S. economy is therefore a net positive for the sector. Though the bureau presently estimates total industrial production to decline 0.9% in 2016, the same is expected to be on the growth trajectory in 2017, with an estimated increase of 3.5%, thus offering opportunities of growth and expansion to business service providers. Moreover, a projected rise in expenditure should lend support to the business service sector.Economic sensitivity aside, business service companies are quite conservatively managed, with a large number of players sharing their excess cash with shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Nonetheless, the business service sector is highly fragmented, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. As per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to the overall revenue. However, given its unique nature, Zacks has classified the group as one of the 16 sectors (the S&P's official GIC classification has only 10 sectors where business services are grouped within the 'Industrials' sector). Notably, with about 3.4% of total market capitalization, the sector is estimated to have 2.8% share of income in 2016.This industry covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about $620 billion, though many companies mentioned below do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry.Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries (at the medium or M-level) and 256 industries at the expanded or X-level. We rank all 256 X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the  page.The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 257+ industries is by dividing it into positive, neutral and negative categories depending on the Zacks Rank. The outlook for the top one-third of the list (Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third of the list (Rank of #89 to #176) is neutral while that for the bottom one-third (Rank #177 and higher) is a clear negative.Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks - the core of our Industry Rank - has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (one to three months). We have seven X-level industries within the Business Services sector: Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services, Business Services, Consulting, Financial Transaction Services, Outsourcing, Staffing and Waste Removal Services.Auction/Valuation Service ranked #10, Consulting ranked #14 and Financial Transaction Services with #59 rank are industries that fall in the upper 1/3 and have a positive outlook.Business Information Services with rank #95, Business Services at #103, Waste Removal at #110, Outsourcing at #161 and Staffing at rank #176 are positioned in the mid 1/3 of all Zacks industries and have a neutral outlookThis allocation clearly points to a positive to neutral outlook for the sector. Notably, none of the industry fall in the bottom one-third tier of our ranking.Our top picks from the Consulting industry are FTI Consulting, Inc. (FCN) and Gartner Inc. (IT). We favor Total System Services, Inc. (TSS) from the Financial Transaction Services industry. Copart, Inc. (CPRT) and Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc. (RBA) are our top picks from Auction/Valuation Service industry. Each of them sports Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The earnings picture for the business service sector in the first quarter of 2016 was better than the S&P 500.Earnings witnessed 6.6% growth on 5.3% revenue improvement. The figures compare favorably with the numbers delivered by the S&P 500 (6.4% earnings decline on revenue decline of 0.8%).With the companies gearing up for their second-quarter earnings results, let's find out what's in store for the business service sector.Earnings for the to be reported quarter are estimated to decline 0.2% for the sector and 5.9% for the S&P. Revenues on the other hand are expected to exhibited growth of 7% versus a decline of 0.7% for the S&P.The graph below shows year-over-year bottom-line growth of the business service (BS) sector in comparison to the S&P 500.The graph below shows year-over-year top-line growth of the BS\nsector in comparison to the S&P 500.The graph below shows year-over-year top-line growth of the BS sector in comparison to the S&P 500.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In simple terms, it is how much money a company generates. In other words, when you subtract the cost of production from revenues, you get earnings. But why is everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts, captivated by this metric? This is because earnings are the ultimate indicator of profitability and also have a direct impact on the share price.An upbeat earnings result more or less leads to an uptick in the share price. Earnings expectations too play a crucial role in share price movements.Despite generating earnings growth, companies have on several occasions seen their share prices falling. This happens when a company's earnings fail to meet market expectations. So, what are earnings estimates? These are analysts' expectations of a company's future quarterly or annual earnings. Earnings estimates embody analysts' opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, expenses and cost control.Earnings estimates also help an analyst to use cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of a firm.

At the same time, it's important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or the appropriate benchmark.If you see that a stock is underperforming on the fundamental factors, then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns.At the same time, it is imperative that you determine whether or not a stock has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Identifying stocks delivering better performances than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having fundamentals indicating that it has room to move higher is the best way to go about this.Finally, it is important that we determine whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter's (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 12 weeks, 4 weeks and 1 week.) Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks. Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks - that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&P 500 in 23 of the 26 years - can get through. A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen out the low priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Here are 5 of the 8 stocks that made it through the screen: : Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Dave & Buster's Entertainment owns and operates dining and entertainment venues in North America. The company carries a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM score of \"A\". It also has an excellent earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 104.8%. : A provider of electronics contract manufacturing services, San Jose, CA based Sanmina boasts a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM score of \"A\".

(Symbol: CPRT) saw new options become available today, for the February 2017 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 242 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new February 2017 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of 20 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $49.32/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 71%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.44% return on the cash commitment, or 0.67% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:    Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.53% boost of extra return to the investor, or 3.82% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 25%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 22%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $49.32) to be 21%.

But, what exactly do earnings represent and why do they draw so much attention? This is simply because earnings indicate how much money a company makes. Take a company's revenue over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and, there it is, you have earnings!This metric significantly influences a company's share price. Upbeat earnings results generally lead to an uptick in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the share price.On numerous occasions we have seen a company's shares falling in spite of generating earnings growth. This happens because of missing estimates. Here, earnings estimate revisions come into play. These are analysts' expectation of the future earnings power of the firm that helps in determining the stock price movement. But what exactly do earnings estimates represent?Earnings estimates embody analysts' opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, expenses and cost control. So, while zeroing down to buy stocks with solid earnings growth, it is also important to figure out whether its earnings estimates are on the rise or not.We have selected stocks that not only possess historical earnings growth but are also seeing an increase in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we added the following parameters: (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed.

These strategies cushion portfolios against big market drawdowns like the ones investors saw early this year.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility (  ) posted a fresh 52-week high of 38.09 on the  . Its bolting RS line is a sign that it is outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.The exchange traded fund invests in roughly 80 of the least volatile midcap stocks, including salvaged-car auctioneer  (  ), ranked No. 1 by IBD in the auto parts industry group.Stocks with the lowest price volatility get the biggest weighting in the XMLV portfolio.However, two industry experts strike notes of caution about this popular asset class.Low volatility ETFs tend to be stuffed with more established, dividend-paying names. A potential Fed interest-rate hike in June or July could dent high-dividend sectors such as utilities or consumer staples, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P  Intelligence, wrote June 1. His research note preceded Friday's dismal jobs report, which was perceived to set back the likelihood of an imminent rate hike.Rosenbluth suggests that investors may want to consider a small, new rival to the hugely popular iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (  ) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (  ).Like SPLV, PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (  ) invests in low volatility stocks in the S&P 500. But there's a difference.SPLV looks for the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past 12 months. XRLV invests in the 100 stocks that show both low volatility and low interest-rate risk. It removes stocks that have historically lagged when rates are rising.XRLV has a zero weighting in utilities and 14.6% in consumer staples, both of which are rate-sensitive sectors. By comparison, SPLV has 21.1% and 20.8% weightings in the respective sectors. Also, XRLV has a 17.5% weighting in the financial sector vs. 13.0% for SPLV. Banks and some other financial services tend to benefit from increasing rates. (KO),  (WM) and  (PEP) and a host of other stocks are common to both portfolios.But medical equipment maker  (TMO) and credit-ratings agency  (EFX) are among XRLV holdings not to be found in SPLV.As a new ETF, XRLV should be traded with care.Moreover, low volatility stocks may be starting to look expensive. \"As more money has piled in (to low or minimum volatility ETFs), valuations have richened commensurately,\" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar Inc., wrote in a May report.Johnson looked at the historical relationship between the beginning value of the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index's price-to-cash-earnings ratio and subsequent 3-year annualized returns. He found that the richer the starting valuation, the lower the ensuing return.\"At current levels, newcomers to the low volatility part could be setting themselves up for disappointing future returns,\" Johnson cautioned.This year, low volatility ETFs focused on U.S. large caps have surged in popularity.IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (  ) absorbed a staggering $5.37 billion in new money through May, more than any other equity exchange traded fund. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (  ) soaked in $1.04 billion over the same period.Smart fund investors are  . Both XMLV and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Low Volatility (XSLV) have positive net flow year to date.They're outperforming their large-cap peers too. XMLV was up 11.6% year to date through June 2 vs. 8.9% for XSLV, 6.8% for XRLV and 6.6% for SPLV.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, gained 4.0%.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - June 24, 2016 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Business Services, Part 1, including  and Industry: Business Services, Part 1Link: The business services sector provides ancillary services to the other players in the market. Hence, the core business of one company in this sector can be a business service for another. Importantly, this dynamism opens the door to many business services companies.The intensely competitive business services sector must rigorously work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues so that its profitability does not suffer. A focus on functions and activities close to its core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale, besides improving competitive positioning.Notably, business service occupies a handsome share in a country's gross domestic product (GDP) with the gradual shift in the global economy from agriculture to industry to now business services. The sector therefore plays a major role in a country's overall development.The fortunes of business service operators are closely tied to the health of the broader economy. As per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), domestic economy expanded at a rate of 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016, which benefited from higher contribution from personal consumption expenditures and increased residential fixed investment. The growth momentum is now expected to accelerate by 1.7% in 2016 and 3.0% in 2017.This improving outlook for the U.S. economy is therefore a net positive for the sector. Though the bureau presently estimates total industrial production to decline 0.9% in 2016, the same is expected to be on the growth trajectory in 2017, with an estimated increase of 3.5%, thus offering opportunities of growth and expansion to business service providers. Moreover, a projected rise in expenditure should lend support to the business service sector.Economic sensitivity aside, business service companies are quite conservatively managed, with a large number of players sharing their excess cash with shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Nonetheless, the business service sector is highly fragmented, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. As per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to the overall revenue. However, given its unique nature, Zacks has classified the group as one of the 16 sectors (the S&P's official GIC classification has only 10 sectors where business services are grouped within the 'Industrials' sector). Notably, with about 3.4% of total market capitalization, the sector is estimated to have 2.8% share of income in 2016.This industry covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about $620 billion, though many companies mentioned below do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry.Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries (at the medium or M-level) and 256 industries at the expanded or X-level. We rank all 256 X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the  page.The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 257+ industries is by dividing it into positive, neutral and negative categories depending on the Zacks Rank. The outlook for the top one-third of the list (Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third of the list (Rank of #89 to #176) is neutral while that for the bottom one-third (Rank #177 and higher) is a clear negative.Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks - the core of our Industry Rank - has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (one to three months). We have seven X-level industries within the Business Services sector: Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services, Business Services, Consulting, Financial Transaction Services, Outsourcing, Staffing and Waste Removal Services.Auction/Valuation Service ranked #10, Consulting ranked #14 and Financial Transaction Services with #59 rank are industries that fall in the upper 1/3 and have a positive outlook.Business Information Services with rank #95, Business Services at #103, Waste Removal at #110, Outsourcing at #161 and Staffing at rank #176 are positioned in the mid 1/3 of all Zacks industries and have a neutral outlookThis allocation clearly points to a positive to neutral outlook for the sector. Notably, none of the industry fall in the bottom one-third tier of our ranking.Our top picks from the Consulting industry are FTI Consulting, Inc. (  ) and Gartner Inc. (  ). We favor Total System Services, Inc. (  ) from the Financial Transaction Services industry. Copart, Inc. (  ) and Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc. (  ) are our top picks from Auction/Valuation Service industry. Each of them sports Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

Behavioral finance has shown investing can be just as much about the person as it is the numbers and often investors are their own worst enemies. I want to cover quite a few of these emotional snares in this article so you can identify and avoid them in the future.IAAAve broken the psychological and emotional pitfalls down into two sections in order to keep them easier to remember. Positive traps and biases will cover more optimistic thought processes while negative will include the more pessimistic side. AA Potentially the most dangerous emotion. To put it bluntly, we have a tendency to believe we are much smarter and much more capable than we really are. While it's only human nature it can be very hazardous nonetheless for investors to assume they're great at picking stocks. Numbers back this up as studies have shown when we say we're 90% sure of something, we're right about 70% of the time. Instead of assuming you're brilliant and can pick excellent stocks out of a hat, practice a value investing approach and diligently select stocks based on fundamentals and value. AA The tendency to \"anchor\" thoughts on a reference point that may have no relevance to the decision on hand. Investors commonly get caught in this trap focusing on recent performance, or price paid, all too often. When reviewing or valuing a company one can get \"anchored\" on one's own valuations, a company's earnings or even analyst sentiment. This can lead to purchasing and holding on to stocks purely based on emotion and not analysis. AA Another risk that stems from both overconfidence and anchoring is confirmation bias or the act of selectively filtering information that supports an original opinion. For instance, investors may seek out data that backs up their initial decisions to buy stocks rather than analyzing if they might have made mistakes. This type of behavior also leads to us adjusting our reasoning for purchasing a stock in the first place. This is dangerous and inhibits us from viewing our decisions as objectively as we should. AA Yet another danger to which overconfidence may lead, selective memory is the art of remembering the past inaccurately, selectively picking out the parts that suit our needs or buff up our self-image. This is a fatal flaw because it means we can never learn from our mistakes, a terrible thing in the world of investing.Now for a few dealing with the dark side.

There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let's focus in on  as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CPRT's status as a solid momentum stock below:While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics-such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of CPRT, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 23.4% to 21.8% while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 39.1%. Clearly, CPRT is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.While looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock, you shouldn't forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there. This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season which is obviously vital for momentum investors.Right now, CPRT is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter's earnings estimate projections. In the time frame, EPS estimates for Coparthave gone up by 7.7% compared to an industry average move of 5.5%, suggesting that not only is CPRT heading in the right direction, but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too.While the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with CPRT as of late too.Over the past two months, 5 earning estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that 5 estimates have moved upwards with no downward revisions for the next year time frame too. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago CPRT was expected to post earnings of $1.94/share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $2.07 for the full year now, representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would-be investors.Given these factors, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that we have CPRT as a security with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of 'A'.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep CPRT on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(NASDAQ: CPRT) reported third-quarter earnings on May 26, and the auto recycler and auction-services provider turned in double-digit revenue and earnings growth. This makes two quarters in a row of solid revenue growth after a sales stall in late-2014 through 2015. Management doesn't appear ready to rest on this rebound, with the company continuing to invest in more capacity.Here's a closer look at Copart's third-quarter results, and what management said going forward.Revenue and net income in millions. Data source: Copart, Inc.Executive Vice President of U.S. Operations and Shared Services William Franklin talked about a shifting trend in the U.S. that's driving top-line growth.Next, Franklin discusses how the company is turning that growth into even bigger profits by maintaining discipline on operating expenses:In the second quarter, Copart announced plans to open another 15 yards during the next 12 months, and made significant progress on that front. It acquired five yards, and placed two of those in service during the third quarter.Based on the recent trends of more people driving more miles, and the average age of cars on the road, management is clearly betting that the extra capacity will pay off in continued growth going forward. The company is also in a position to fund much of that growth with cash flows, as the $65 million capex spend in the quarter showed.When it comes to shareholder return growth, share repurchases look to remain a big driver. The company has repurchased some 14% of shares outstanding during the past 12 months, and still has 44.5 million shares available for repurchase under the current board-approved repurchase program. That's more than 40% of the company's entire shares, so it's likely that we'll see a continuation of this aggressive buyback program in the future.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $43.79/share today.Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

The company reported 8.5% sales growth, 13% profit growth, and a 20% jump in earnings per share.Here's a closer look at the results, as well as three key takeaways from the quarter.\n  \nRevenue and net income in thousands. Source: Copart.The strong U.S. dollar has had a two-sided impact on Copart's business over the past year or so. To start, Copart has invested in growing its business outside the U.S., acquiring and opening salvage operations overseas, and the revenues those facilities produce (almost always in the local currency) translates to fewer dollars. The company said foreign exchange had a negative-$3.5 million impact in the quarter.The second part is that 20% of its North American auction buyers have historically been international bidders. On the , CFO Jeffrey Liaw pointed out that the U.S. dollar is at or near a 10-year high against important currencies such as the euro and Mexican peso. He also said that international buyers generally purchase higher-value cars. Of course, international buyers have purchased fewer cars in this environment.But things could be turning around. Even though the dollar remains strong, Will Franklin, executive VP of U.S. operations, said foreign participation was up in the second quarter, sequentially.Scrap values are also affecting revenue, driving down average selling prices, or ASPs. Liaw said that January auto body scrap values were at five-year lows and down 68% from the post-recession peak in September 2011. Scrap prices play a role in the ASP for the majority of units, since the company's business is largely work it does for insurance companies, selling off totaled cars to recyclers and parts dealers.The impact of falling scrap prices can be seen in the spread between unit growth (12.9% worldwide) and revenue growth (8.5%). However, management said that internal data indicates ASPs are stabilizing.Over the past year or so, Copart management has repurchased 14.8 million shares, more than 11% of shares outstanding. Doing so improves per-share returns (as evidenced by the spread between net income and earnings-per-share growth in the quarter), but at a cost.The recent Dutch auction was completed in December, and the company repurchased 8.3 million shares at $39 per share, while the company bought around 6 million shares in July 2015, when the stock was trading at about a 10% discount to the current price.The key? Debt has been the primary source of funding for share buybacks. Yes, the company has used cash on the balance sheet to buy the shares, but the source of that cash is debt.  , Copart refinanced its existing debt and at the same time increased that debt by about $400 million, while adding $300 million to the balance sheet.The terms of that debt were better and cheaper than its prior obligations, but the answer to whether this use of debt was the right move will only be answered over time.On the earnings call, Franklin said the company expects to open 15 new yards in the next 12 months and is actively working to expand another 18 existing facilities in North America, and that it will spend approximately $100 million in capital expenditures over that period. This growth outlook is largely the product of expanded and new contracts with insurance customers in North America.At the same time, the company continues to keep operating costs in check. Copart spent $32.5 million on general and administrative expenses in the quarter, down $2.5 million from one year ago. The company's average G&A spend over the past five quarters is down significantly from the five quarters before that, even though the company's revenue and geographic footprint has grown over that time.Technology has been a key driver, allowing the company to increase its scale and scope, without having to increase administrative staff or other operating costs to support this growth.Copart operates in a business where it probably must continue to focus on costs and opportunistic expansion. The average car on U.S. roads continues to get older, but this trend is as much about automakers that are building better cars than about anything else, so it doesn't necessarily indicate a huge future opportunity. But at the same time, falling gas prices have led to more miles driven, which leads to more accidents. And it's those accidents that produce the majority of the cars Copart sells.So while it's not a typical growth industry, Copart can expand by taking market share and can use cost-controls and share buybacks to further improve per-share value and returns. At least that's the game plan management has laid out and continues to execute on.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Copart is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CPRT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 45 cents per share for CPRT, compared to a Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CPRT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.27% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent Array0 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that CPRT has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Copart, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in BID.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $2.24 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.92.Also, for the current quarter, Sotheby's has seen 3 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 97 cents a share from $1.33 over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 15% in the past month.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Auction/Valuation Services industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Copart, Inc.  .

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $42.28/share today.Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of CPRT stock at the current price level of $42.28/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $45.00.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CPRT shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CPRT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $45.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of Copart, Inc. (Symbol: CPRT) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.7, after changing hands as low as $35.07 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 29.2. A bullish investor could look at CPRT's 28.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

In the last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 4.40%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Advance Auto Parts drives profits through its relentless focus on store expansion. During the 16-week period ended Apr 25, 2015, the company opened 25 stores. The rise in store count ensures higher availability of parts, thereby leading to higher sales. Advance Auto Parts is also poised to benefit from growing stability in the industry and an increasing average age of vehicles, along with a rise in the number of miles driven. The combination of a steadily improving job market and lower gasoline prices are also likely to boost the company's results.However, price competition poses a serious threat to Advance Auto Parts as it competes with national and regional automotive retailers. Moreover, the improvement in the quality of new vehicles leads to reduced need for the maintenance and repair of parts. This, in turn, hampers demand in the automotive maintenance market.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Advance Auto Parts' Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate stands and Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at $2.25. Advance Auto Parts carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Copart, Inc.  will report fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Sep 22.

This equated to a 2.3% growth rate for the first half of the year, marginally higher year over year.Mirroring the performance of 2014, the U.S. economy had a roller-coaster ride with an unenterprising start to 2015 followed by an unexpected surge. Reminiscent of the performance in 2014, the odds are currently staked pretty high for a similar glide in the second half of 2015 as seen last year. Experts anticipate third-quarter and fourth-quarter 2015 GDP to grow in the vicinity of 2.0% and 2.6%, respectively.On the surface, it appears that the economy failed to receive any 'slingshot' momentum from strong second quarter growth, primarily due to the fallout of the growing global malaise on domestic activity. Strong dollar appreciation and prevailing macroeconomic turmoil continue to adversely affect exports and corporate investment levels.Solid appreciation of the dollar has dented the export basket, as the U.S. goods and services have been rendered expensive upon foreign soil. Lower  have further added to the woes of the industries that directly or indirectly source businesses from the energy sector. While the first-half 2015 exports declined 1%, imports increased 5% on a year-over-year basis, leading to a high negative balance of trade.Non-defense capital goods orders (excluding aircraft), one of the closely watched parameters for business spending plans, contracted 0.3% in September - the largest decline of this kind since November 2009. Inflationary pressures remained muted and cast enough doubt whether the Fed will actually raise interest rate from the near zero levels in the latter half of the year.The Markit Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data declined to 54.5 in October from 55.0 in September - the weakest expansion of the private sector output since the beginning of the year. This represents a general slowdown in new business growth and a cautious spending pattern by clients. Consequently, there was a slight reduction in backlogs of work across the service economy. This in turn led to softer employment growth within the service sector owing to reduced pressure on operating capacity.The U.S. job market is also feeling the heat with only 136,000 and 142,000 job additions in August and September respectively, although the unemployment rate declined to 5.1% as less people are seeking active employment at present.With a high positive correlation with the economy, the U.S. Industrials sector is likely to be adversely affected by the turn of events. As the companies take stock of the situation and deliberate on their future course of action, let us take a glimpse into how the third-quarter earnings season is shaping up so far.About 39.1% of the total S&P 500 companies in the Business Services sector have reported their earnings results till Oct 23, 2015. With a 'beat ratio' of 77.8%, total earnings for these companies are up 6.9% year over year. Revenues increased 2.8% compared with the year-ago period, with a 'beat ratio' of 66.7%. The entire Business Services sector is expected to perform relatively better than the overall equity market with an earnings growth expectation of 1.0% in the third quarter versus -3.4% for the S&P 500 index. (Read:  )The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry hinge on a healthy economy with decent prospects for job growth, higher disposable income and new business initiatives. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies.Given the lacklustre forecast, it might be a good idea to zero-in on a handful of Business Services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings surprise should help these stocks outperform in the near term.The Business Services sector covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. Amid a diverse range of companies in the Business Services arena, picking the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a colossal task. An easy way to narrow down the list is to look at stocks that have a solid Zacks Rank and a favorable  .Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. The Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP is usually a harbinger of an earnings beat and serves a perfect success formula on a platter. For investors seeking to benefit by applying this strategy to their portfolios, we have mentioned three Business Services stocks below, which match these criteria, and thus may be potential winners this earnings season.

However, profits increased strongly from the year-ago period, jumping more than 40%, while cash and equivalents also increased, and debt fell slightly.Good or bad results this quarter? Let's take a closer look.At the end of last quarter, Copart had increased its cash position substantially, entirely through debt. The company ended January with $590 million in cash and equivalents, a $300 million increase from the beginning of that quarter. The company's long-term debt load increased by $400 million over the same period.As of the end of April, the cash pile had grown to more than $678 million, and long-term debt had actually gone down about $9 million, leaving the company with significantly more liquidity than necessary to operate the business.When questioned about this on last quarter's , CEO Jay Adair was relatively vague in his reasoning:There was some discussion about potential buybacks, but Adair played his cards close to the vest, and it sounds like you can put all that cash under the \"flexibility\" umbrella for now.Copart continues to reduce its operating costs. General and administrative expenses fell 13% to $25.9 million. Normalizing for a $29 million impairment charge last year related to its acquisition of QCSA, total operating expense fell more than $15 million.While a big part of the total decline in operating expense was related to much lower direct sales, the company's efforts to focus on cost containment is paying dividends.It's important to understand that Copart derives revenues in essentially two ways: direct sales (cars that it buys and then sells) and auctions of cars for other owners (mostly insurance companies).This is divided into \"service revenues\" and \"vehicle sales\" in the company's earnings statement. The service revenue business has been strong the past couple of quarters, with the revenue decline tied to falling direct sales. Adair addressed this on the last :In other words, the company is refocusing its buy-and-sell business on profitable results, not empty revenue.It's after market hours on May 27 as I write this, and it's not clear what Mr. Market will do once trading starts, but the bottom line is, Copart management is focusing on what they can control in reducing operating costs and restructuring its car sales business to be more profitable, while preparing for what it can't control by establishing a significant cash cushion.While history is littered with management's ineffective use of cash burning a hole in their pockets, we have some evidence that Adair and his team can be disciplined with capital, having shown even this quarter that they can drive costs down and improve profits even as the business transitions, and not throwing money at perceived problems. Only time will tell if they can keep it up, but good management starts and ends with prudent capital allocation decisions.Historically speaking, the odds are probably in their favor. Not a bad place to be if you're an investor.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"... But you'll probably just call it \"how I made my millions.\" Don't be too late to the party --  when the Web goes dark.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

It has 26 regional distribution centers.O'Reilly's stock has been enjoying an impressive run. The company's share price shot up 50% in 2014. It's risen 8% so far this year.Why the investor enthusiasm?\"The industry had very favorable weather last year, which helped create a lot of demand,\" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Higginbotham. \"Everyone's revenue grew nicely. Just as that tailwind seemed to fade, gas prices fell. So there was a nice handoff from weather to lower gas prices.\"O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have been \"consolidating\" the industry and taking share from the mom-and-pop players, he adds, which has increased their negotiating power with a very \"fragmented\" vendor base.\"That has driven big gains in margin and working capital efficiency, which has also (helped) the stock performance.\" he said. \"With longer and longer payment terms from their vendors -- having more days to pay -- players like O'Reilly have been able to fund inventory at almost zero cost, which allows them to take even more share from the mom-and-pops. (That) leads to even better negotiating leverage and so on, a dynamic which (I refer) to as the 'auto parts retail virtuous cycle.'\"O'Reilly's stock popped around 8% on Feb. 5, following a strong fourth-quarter report late the day before.Earnings climbed 26% to $1.76 a share, ahead of the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $1.76 billion, also beating forecasts.Same-store sales rose a hefty 6.3% from a year earlier.O'Reilly management did not respond to a phone call requesting a comment for this story.The company announced that it approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under its share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, raising the aggregate authorization to $5 billion. The additional $500 million is effective for a three-year period beginning on Feb. 4.Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Craig Kennison calls O'Reilly a \"wonderful\" company.\"At the end of the day, commercial repair shops are in the business of fixing cars and the best way to serve them is to have the right part at the right time at the right price when they need it,\" he said. \"It's about parts fulfillment. I think O'Reilly has the right distribution infrastructure to get parts to consumers and repair shops when they need it.\"If you look at the financial metrics, (O'Reilly generates) a tremendous return on capital, it has very strong cash flow and a good (stock) buyback strategy to return capital to shareholders,\" he added.What differentiates O'Reilly from the other auto parts retailers is that it has the \"strongest history and most consistent execution of a mix of retail and commercial businesses,\" adds Higginbotham.He says that auto parts retailers that historically have had a retail focus are \"moving more\" into the commercial business.\"O'Reilly has the most dense distribution of all the players,\" he added. \"It has the most distribution centers per store. That allows them to fulfill orders more efficiently, more often, which is more crucial in the commercial business than the retail business.\"The commercial business, Higginbotham adds, is a \"different ball game\" in terms of having to be able to say yes to as many requests as possible. He says that having the supply of products to meet the requests means investing a lot in inventory and distribution.\"O'Reilly is best at doing that,\" he said.Higginbotham says that several years ago, store growth was the big driver of O'Reilly's strong performance.More recently, it's been a function of the company's \"superiority\" in terms of execution, which has helped it gain a lot of market share, he adds.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O'Reilly to see a 16% rise in full-year 2015 earnings to $8.55 a share. They expect a 13% gain in 2016 and a 14% increase in 2017 -- lower growth than in years past but still strong.Lower gas prices should be a nice tailwind for the industry, says Higginbotham.\"Lower gas prices are an important driver because if gas is cheaper, people tend to drive more and it puts more wear and tear on their cars,\" he said.They tend to benefit the low-income consumer -- the do-it-yourself customer -- the most, he adds.Lower gas prices can have a \"meaningful\" impact on spending on car repairs, adds Kennison.\"In a tough economy people will defer spending on car repairs,\" he said. \"At some point the deferment catches up.\"Lower gas prices give consumers the resources to fix some deferred maintenance items.\"O'Reilly is part of IBD's Retail-Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group, which also includes Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone,Copart (  ),Pep Boys (  ) and a handful of others. O'Reilly gets the highest IBD Composite Rating of those companies, a 98 out of a possible 99, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock price gains.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["argain hunters are wise to pay careful attention to insider buying, because although there are many various reasons for an insider to sell a stock, presumably the only reason they would use their hard-earned cash to make a purchase, is that they expect to make money.

In the last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.05%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Advance Auto Parts enhances profits through its relentless focus on store expansion. During the 53-week period ended Jan 3, 2015, Advance Auto Parts opened 151 stores and closed 19. The rise in store count ensures higher availability of parts to customers, thereby leading to higher sales volume. In addition, the company benefits from its hub store strategy. Also, Advance Auto Parts is poised to benefit as the industry continues to show stability with the increasing average age of vehicles, along with a rise in the number of miles driven. The combination of a steadily improving job market and lower gasoline prices will have a positive impact on the company's results.However, price competition remains a threat for Advance Auto Parts, as it competes with national and regional automotive retailers. Moreover, the improvement in the quality of new vehicles leads to reduced need for the maintenance and repair of parts. This, in turn, hampers demand in the automotive maintenance market.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Advance Auto Parts' Earnings ESP is -1.20% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.47, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.50. Advance Auto Parts' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP.

The highlights:Let's take a closer look at the details of the release. The revenue shortfall needs explaining, but management's efforts to get costs in line is starting to really pay off. Let's dig in.Until management gives us more detail, it's hard to really know what the driver there is, and whether it's a short-term speed bump or a longer-range concern. According to the release, service revenue increased slightly to $238 million, while vehicle sales declined $13 million to $37.75 million in the quarter. While the company makes the majority of its money selling cars for insurance companies and other third parties, its direct sales business is still important. It will be interesting to hear what management has to say on the .Over the past several earnings calls, CEO Jay Adair has commented on the efforts that management has made to reduce operational expense. A big part of these efforts were tied to the QCSA Direct acquisition last year that left the company with a number of redundant locations, and it took the company some time to rationalize its new combined footprint. A number of QCSA Direct locations were closed or relocated in the process.Additionally, the company's move to Texas last year has helped reduce some overhead expense. So far in 2015, it's paying off.General and administrative expense in the quarter came in at $27.6 million, versus $31.2 million last year, good for almost a 12% reduction. Yard operations decreased $1 million in the quarter, after rising in the first quarter. However, this cost can fluctuate more based on sales activity, and as a percentage of service revenues, they have declined to 49.8% in the first six months of the year, from 51.1% in the same period last year.In December, Copart took out a significant amount of new debt, via $400 million in secured notes and a $300 million term loan. The company used part of the proceeds to refinance prior debt but ended the quarter with about $400 million more debt than it had a few months ago. The upshot is that the company also has significantly more cash on hand now than before -- almost $430 million more -- with a total of $590 million in cash and equivalents.Furthermore, the company now has a $300 million line of credit, which it has not drawn on as of the end of the quarter.The rates look reasonable (after you wade through all the ways the rate is reached) but quite variable. If interest rates remain low for the next few years, and -- here's the big caveat -- if management uses the proceeds effectively to grow and improve the business, this could be a great time to use relatively cheap debt.It's also worth noting that a  /Merrill Lynch analyst upgraded his rating on Copart stock on earnings day as well, moving the stock to \"buy\" with a price target of $45. Kiss of death? Let's hope not.OK, in all seriousness, the only real yellow flag in the release was the sales miss, and what that means will depend on what management has to say to explain what happened. The new debt could be good, or it could be trouble, frankly, depending on what management does. However, I think that as long as founder Willis Johnson is still involved -- and he is, on the board of directors -- and still a major shareholder, we can trust management to use the cash wisely. However, only time will tell, and it really is a matter of trust.On the positive side, the company continues to run more efficiently and cost-effectively. Assuming there's not a long-term problem with sales, Copart's operational excellence should lead to more profit growth going forward. But we need management to explain that sales miss ... 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

(Symbol: CPRT) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 21st expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 228 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CPRT options chain for the new August 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of 65 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CPRT, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $36.45/share today.Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.86% return on the cash commitment, or 2.97% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $35.00 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of 25 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of CPRT stock at the current price level of $36.45/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.43% if the stock gets called away at the August 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CPRT shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Copart, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CPRT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 10% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

(Symbol: CPRT) touched a new 52-week low of $30.47/share. That's a $7.07 share price drop, or -18.83% decline from the 52-week high of $37.54 set back on 04/04/2014. Large percentage drops always require that the stock post even larger percentage gains from the low in order to recover the old price point, and for CPRT that means the stock would have to gain 23.20% to get back to the 52-week high. For a move like that, Copart, Inc. would need fundamental strength at the business level.Here's a rhetorical question: Who knows more about fundamentals at the business level than the company's own insiders? So let's take a look to see whether any company insiders were taking the other side of the trade as CPRT shares were being sold down to this new 52-week low, focusing on the most recent trailing six month period. As summarized by the table below, CPRT has seen 2 different instances of insiders buying over the past six months.\n  \nIn the short run, while the new 52-week low suggests the stock is at the cheapest price and perhaps therefore the best bargain it has been over the last 52 weeks, the low print also means anyone who has purchased the stock over that timeframe is staring at an unrealized loss. Oftentimes, that factor drives a stock's technical analysis metrics by creating overhead resistance, with investors who bought higher now anxious to reverse their trade once they are back to breakeven. The chart below shows where CPRT has traded over the past year, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages included.Time will tell whether the insider purchases foretell a future rebound for CPRT shares, which are presently showing a last trade of $30.49/share, slightly above the new 52-week low.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ere are 5 stocks added to the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) List today:View the entire  .Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

So has demand for replacement parts and repair work. The upshot for the aftermarket parts industry has been a consistent flow of new business.Leading auto parts retailers such asAutoZone (  ),O'Reilly (  ),Genuine Parts (  ) andAdvance Auto Parts (  ) have produced years of top- and bottom-line growth. They continued to do so in 2014, and are expected to keep it up this year.Meanwhile, the stocks -- all part of IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group -- generally have enjoyed a steady rise in value. The group touched a record high on Dec. 31, and on Friday was up 23% from an October low.The industry's new wrinkle is that the stocks have kept climbing even as new-vehicle sales in the U.S. reached their highest point since the middle of last decade.U.S. light vehicle sales hit 16.44 million units in 2014, according to a Jan. 5 report from Sterne Agee. That was the highest total since 2006. Those numbers are expected to keep ticking higher this year.Numerous industry forecasters -- including Kelley Blue Book, TrueCar, LMC Automotive and J.D. Power & Associates -- project that new-vehicle sales will reach about 17 million units in 2015.In theory, a rise in new-car sales should hurt the aftermarket parts industry. In the past, more new cars on the road meant less need for replacement parts and repair work.That's no longer necessarily the case. Morningstar analyst Liang Feng points out that a rise in new-car sales doesn't translate into fewer older cars on the road.\"Investors have been concerned that new vehicle sales will reduce aftermarket parts demand, but what we are seeing is that even people buying new vehicles are keeping older cars as second vehicles or selling them to someone else. So you still see demand,\" Feng told IBD. \"We've also seen an increase in the overall used-car market because vehicles are lasting longer.\"The average age of light vehicles on the road in the U.S. stands at 11.4 years, according to the most recent estimates from industry researcher IHS Automotive. That figure is expected to hold steady this year and then tick up to 11.5 years by 2017 and 11.7 years by 2019.Meanwhile, the auto parts market has gotten another lift from lower prices at the gas pump.\"With gas prices at multiyear lows, we expect vehicle miles traveled to continue to grow, increasing demand for auto parts while providing relief to the low-income consumer,\" Sterne Agee analysts Ali Faghri and Michael Ward noted in a recent report.They cited AAA data showing that the average price for unleaded gas in the U.S. in November was $2.77 a gallon. That was around 15% lower than a year earlier and the lowest price in over four years.Sterne Agee also cited Department of Transportation data showing that U.S. vehicle miles traveled in October increased 2.1% from the previous year. It was the eighth straight month of gains. The number of miles driven was up 0.9% year to date through October, the latest month for which data are available.IBD's Retail/Wholesale Auto Parts group includes nine stocks and, on Friday, ranked No. 45 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. That ranking is up from No. 117 as recently as 13 weeks ago.O'Reilly rates highest in the group with a Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Others in the group with Composite Ratings of 90 or higher are Advance Auto Parts, Genuine Parts and Copart.Not all stocks in the group are parts retailers.Copart (  ) conducts salvage vehicle auctions for insurers, charities, dealerships, banks and other organizations.LKQ (LKQ) is an auto recycler, with a national network distributing salvaged auto parts to repair shops.The retailers themselves do more than just sell parts to weekend Do-It-Yourself (DIY) mechanics. They also provide wholesale parts to mechanics and auto shops, and some also provide in-house auto repair and maintenance services -- all of which falls under what the industry calls its Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) segment -- for customers who don't want to do the repair work themselves.Although some investors might view the aftermarket auto parts sector as a defensive play -- one that does best in shaky economies -- the current years-long run of gains and financial success has outlived that notion.\"The trend toward the aftermarket has been going on for a long time,\" Feng said. \"There might be some cyclical factors, but the long-term trend has been favorable.\"The U.S. light-vehicle auto care market is expected to reach $254 billion this year, according to data from the Auto Care Association (ACA), an industry trade group that represents parts manufacturers, distributors and retailers as well as repair shops. That's up 3% from about $246 billion in 2014. The figure is seen climbing to around $273 billion in 2017.\"The thing we see that's most interesting is that, even in the face of high gas prices, the industry has done very well. With gas prices going down, it only stands to benefit,\" said Ron Rossi, the ACA's director of market intelligence.Sterne Agee's Faghri expects retailers with strong commercial programs -- namely, O'Reilly and Genuine Parts -- to outperform the group as a whole when 2014 fourth-quarter results come in.Changes in technology are affecting the aftermarket parts industry in a few different ways. The most prominent has to do with the cars themselves: they work better than they used to, and they are equipped with systems that make them easier to diagnose, maintain and repair.\"No question cars are being built to last longer,\" Rossi said. \"Technology is playing a part both in terms of what's in the car to keep it on the road longer and also in terms of diagnostics available both on-board and in the shops.\"E-commerce is having an effect as well. As more consumers look to save money by purchasing auto parts online -- either direct from manufacturers or through third-party distributors -- retail shops will likely see a drop in business.Though that poses a threat to the auto parts business, just as it has for other retail businesses, Morningstar's Feng warns against overstating the threat.\"The main concern with e-commerce is, if you want to buy the part cheaply you can get it for a much lower price online,\" he said. \"At the same time, it takes longer to get the part when you order it online, and most consumers are impatient when it comes to getting their cars fixed. Most would rather go the shop and purchase the part immediately than wait for it to come in the mail.\"Lower gas prices should have the most immediate impact on the aftermarket auto parts industry, watchers say.\"Gas prices are down significantly, and that will encourage people to use their vehicles more, so we assume miles will increase and lead to more wear and tear and business volume for our industry,\" the ACA's Rossi told IBD. \"Things look very positive for our industry going forward.\"In addition to boosting the number of miles people drive, lower gas prices \"also have a positive effect on discretionary spending, especially for the low income consumer,\" Sterne Agee's Faghri and Ward noted.\"The extra disposable income could help unleash the over $40 billion\" in spending on deferred vehicle maintenance, they said. This in turn \"could provide even more growth\" to the aftermarket auto parts industry.In a separate report, the two analysts said lower gas prices \"will also help expedite the shift towards the larger and fast-growing Do-It-For-Me segment and away from Do-It-Yourself, as consumers are more likely to use a repair shop rather than service their vehicles on their own.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Copart, Inc.

Though the fourth quarter results represented an increase of almost 22% compared to the year-ago period, Copart's net income for the full year actually declined. However, a little perspective goes a long way.Copart's fiscal year 2014 acquisition of QCSA Direct expanded the company's reach, as well as its ability to participate in non-insurance markets, like the donated car auction business through Desert View Auto Auctions, which will remain a stand-alone brand.Due to a number of contractual obligations with some QCSA customers, Copart wasn't able to completely integrate the Quad Cities locations into Copart until the fourth quarter. The result was that basically zero operational efficiencies from the acquisition will occur until 2015. CEO Jay Adair from the second quarter :In short, those inefficiencies have just now been worked out of the newly combined companies. Furthermore, a failed software rollout had a major impact on the full-year results. More on that later. Copart's international expansion accelerated in 2014, with the company making acquisitions in Brazil, Germany, Spain, and the United Arab Emirates. While these operations -- according to management on the  -- are still not all profitable, the cost structures are essentially in place, and simple revenue growth in those markets will lead to profitability.International growth will be a key focus in coming years. On the call, Adair pointed out that Copart and its largest competitor (LKQ, a salvage operator) already have the majority of the domestic market -- which is rather mature -- and he doesn't see any significant acquisition targets out there. Internationally, however, most markets are dominated by small, regional players that don't have Copart's advantages of scale and technology.Adair also stated that the focus for 2015 will be on cost and efficiencies. While they would not specify a number or a target for reduction, the management team realizes that it's time -- with the QCSA integration behind them, the groundwork for international expansion laid, and all of the company's corporate resources now located in Texas -- to focus on ways to work on operating costs in the field, and to reduce general and administrative costs at headquarters.Adair summed it up on the : Copart took a $29.1 million impairment expense in 2014, tied to a failed integration of an  ERP system. The company is pursuing litigation against Sparta Consulting -- now called KPIT -- the consulting company that was contracted to implement the system. How significant is that $29.1 million? If the company can recoup those losses, it would be worth about $0.15 per share in earnings.If the ERP system had performed as expected (and the vendor installing it performed as expected) Copart would have been able to use depreciation and amortization rules to carry the cost of the system over the life of the system versus this substantial one-time charge to 2014. While there is no guarantee the Copart will win its case -- or even that it will get all $29 million back if it does win -- this is something that's worth keeping an eye on.It's not great that Copart's earnings went backwards in 2014, but this management team has a long track record of success. The good news is, a lot of groundwork has already been laid, with international expansion, the QCSA integration complete, and the wrapping up of relocating headquarters staff. All that management needs to do is fine-tune things, and profits should bounce back in 2015. A major technological shift is happening in the automotive industry. Most people are skeptical about its impact. Warren Buffett isn't one of them. He recently called it a \"real threat\" to one of his favorite businesses. An executive at Ford called the technology \"fantastic.\" The beauty for investors is that there is an  this megatrend.  to access our exclusive report on this stock.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2014 The Motley Fool, LLC.

When Shiller's CAPE smooths out earnings, this has two effects. The obvious one is that it eliminates the short-term volatility of earnings. Less obviously, it reduces earnings to playing something like a long-term moving average of  . Compare, for example, CAPE with the real S&P 500 index divided by its twenty-year moving average. There is very little difference in the two, and using the deviation from the moving average has only been slightly less predictive of future returns than has CAPE. The question then inevitably arises: when earnings volatility is stripped out, how much value is being added to market analysis?(Sources: All charts in this article come from calculations from the data graciously provided by Robert Shiller on his  ).In my  , as well as in articles I wrote last year, I pointed out that bull markets are typically contra-cyclical (\"counter-cyclical\" sounds too much like monetary or fiscal policy), while bear markets are highly cyclical. That is, in a bear market, stocks ([[SPY]],[[DIA]],[[QQQ]]) tend to be positively correlated with commodities ([[GSG]],[[DJP]],[[RJA]]), inflation, earnings, and interest rates ([[UST]],[[IEF]]), but in a bull market, stocks are negatively correlated with these factors. In this chart, you can see that during bull markets, annual changes in stocks become, not only disengaged from earnings, but inversely correlated with changes in earnings. (In fact, that stock prices become inversely correlated rather than merely indifferent suggests that we cannot simply attribute these rallies to \"  \" as a recent headline suggested, but that is a whole different article).The interesting thing about the current market is that it appears to have transitioned from a post-crisis bear rally (2009-2011) to a proper bull market (2011-?) in much the same way that the market did in the early 1920s. Ninety years ago, the market shifted from a bear rally in 1922-1924 to a bull market that lasted until the fall of 1929. Those transition years, 2011 and 1924, respectively, also saw the last hurrahs of a commodity boom, as well as political and economic crises abroad. The initial crises of 2009 and 1921 were also experienced as brief but very sharp earnings collapses that manifested themselves, somewhat unusually, as P/E expansions.Shiller's Cyclically-Adjusted Price/Earnings ratio, just like it says on the tin, denudes the P/E ratio of these cyclical distractions.My hunch is that cycles (i.e., short-term fluctuations) contain important information about the market. The cyclical/contra-cyclical modes in the market already strongly suggest that, but in this article, I wanted to investigate two interrelated questions, one general and one specific:1. What insights do we lose when we smooth out earnings?2. What might earnings volatility be saying about the present market?My answer to the first question is that, over the five- and ten-year ranges, earnings volatility seems to contain important information about future returns. And, in answer to the second question, I believe that the first answer suggests that the parallels with the 1920s are not merely coincidence: earnings volatility would seem to be indicating a strong bull market until the conclusion of the decade. In other words, there seems to be something about a temporary, severe earnings shock that reflects or creates conditions consonant with a raging bull market; that is, a bull market that exhibits all of the contra-cyclical behavior listed above.All of these observations raise difficult questions, unfortunately. What accounts not only for contra-cyclicality but changes from contra-cyclicality to cyclicality and back? Why would the severity and brevity of an earnings shock appear to result in earnings growth in the short-term but P/E expansion in the medium? Is \"earnings volatility\" really the right way to frame the phenomenon, or is there something else going on?Let's not wander into those thickets quite yet, though.Instead, let's begin with a more basic question about CAPE and its theoretical underpinnings. Investors buy shares to gain access to future profits. Shiller points out, however, that CAPE and future returns are inversely correlated. The inverse correlation shows that investors have unrealistic expectations about future earnings growth, which is why they should be smoothing out the earnings cycle in the first place.But, why not ask how well P/E ratios predict earnings growth, rather than just returns? After all, if fluctuations in returns are driven primarily by share price movements (which they are), then wouldn't a negative correlation between CAPE and returns simply indicate that investors are not good at predicting share prices or that they do not care about stock prices as much as we think they do or should?I was surprised by what I found when I ran the correlations between CAPE and raw P/E (that is, P/E calculated using concurrent earnings) against earnings and returns over three-, five-, ten-, and seventeen-year periods. (I threw the three- and seventeen-year comparisons into the mix randomly). As you can see in the table below, CAPE is negatively correlated with returns over the short-, medium-, and long-term. So is raw P/E, although the relationship is clearly weaker and less uniform. Raw P/E, however, does a fair job of predicting future earnings growth, whereas CAPE does not have any relationship with subsequent earnings.\n  \nThe first thing worth noticing is the gap between how well P/E ratios of whatever stripe predict returns and how well they predict earnings. Why might raw P/E be negatively correlated with returns but positively correlated with earnings, for example? I think the second chart in the article already suggests why that might be, but we can compare ten-year returns and ten-year earnings growth to make sure.From the late 1950s, returns and earnings tend to both be positive but also inversely correlated with one another, at least until the earnings collapse of 2008-2009. If earnings collapse, stocks tend to be highly correlated with them, but if earnings growth is positive, stocks will inversely correlate with the trend of earnings. It would seem that the stock market fears high profit growth and collapses in profits and thrives on an odd combination of positive but declining earnings growth.I was even more surprised, however, when I compared raw P/E with earnings growth over the subsequent ten-year period in the chart below. The correlation coefficient in the table above doesn't really seem to tell the whole story.P/E has predicted earnings growth surprisingly well in the last half-century, except for the earnings growth of the 2000s, when there appears to have been a strong inverse correlation. If you then overlay subsequent stock market returns, it appears that P/E is positively correlated with subsequent earnings growth only during bull markets, and is negatively correlated during bear markets.In other words, it appears that P/E correlates with subsequent earnings growth only if there is a subsequent bull market. If you take a rolling correlation between P/E and subsequent earnings growth and index returns, it appears to confirm that relationship.How on earth could that be?It might be mere coincidence, but because of the connection represented in the second chart in this article (the relationship between bull markets and cyclicality/contra-cyclicality) and the problem represented in the following two charts, it occurred to me that this relationship between P/E, earnings growth, and returns might mean something.So, we have to return for a moment to that second chart. Because bull markets are contra-cyclical (share prices and earnings are negatively correlated) and bear markets are cyclical (the two are positively correlated) and, at least over the last century, bull and bear markets coincide with expansion and contraction of the P/E multiple, we can condense this relationship into \"earnings beta,\" which is the product of the correlation between earnings and stock price changes and the relative volatility of earnings (the standard deviation of changes in earnings divided by the same for share prices).The problem with the relationship between earnings beta and market returns was that, over the very long run, it appeared to be positively correlated with stock market expansions and contractions, but after World War II, it appeared that it might be predicting five-year returns. Because I first observed the relationship as a backward-looking one rather than a predictive one, I opted for the former interpretation, but the latter was troubling, because the extreme levels of the measure indicated either that we had been through a very bad bear market or that we were about to go through one that might be worse than that of the 2000s. But, since P/E predicts earnings growth only when a bull market follows, it occurred to me that the correlation coefficient and relative volatility might be talking about different if related things.Think about the collapse of earnings in 2009 and what subsequent ten-year earnings will look like. Earnings fell something like 85% year-on-year, but they quickly reverted to their post-World War II trajectory. If earnings remain perfectly flat over the next five years (that is, until the spring of 2019), it is mathematically inevitable that the ten-year growth rate in earnings will peak in March 2019 at 30% annualized growth, which is double the historic peak. Or, imagine that earnings fall immediately from their December 2013 $100.2 level to the December 2003 level of $48.74 and remain there until 2019. Ten-year earnings growth will still peak at 20% per annum, comfortably above every other ten-year period's growth rate.Unless earnings achieve an exceptionally pitiable level precisely in the Spring of 2019 or achieve absolutely otherworldly growth before then, there is a very high probability that the P/E ratio of the 2000s will be highly correlated with subsequent earnings growth for the current decade. If that is the case, based on historical extrapolation, we can infer that the 2010s will be a period of exceptional stock returns.Really? Is that a remotely rational conclusion? There are only two possible explanations for why this connection between P/E, subsequent earnings growth, and stock returns could make any sense: either it is pure coincidence or earnings volatility bears information about the future direction of the market not captured by CAPE.A slightly less hocus-pocus demonstration of this relationship between P/E and earnings is represented in the two charts below. Rather than comparing the correlation between P/E and  earnings growth with future returns, they compare the correlation between P/E and  earnings growth with future returns. And, in this instance, the relationship is the opposite: a  correlation between P/E and historical earnings growth over the five- and ten-year spans does a fair job of predicting subsequent returns. The correlations between P/E and earnings growth, whether subsequent or concurrent tend to be a little above 0.4 or below -0.4, respectively. Earnings volatility appears to be communicating something.A connection between volatility and subsequent returns would leave us with some knotty problems. First, it implies that the level of earnings volatility is more important than the direction of that volatility. That is, it does not matter whether earnings shocks are positive or negative; as long as they are volatile, it would seem to be good for stocks in the not too distant future. (An earnings shock such as the one in 2009 would be disastrous in the short run but wonderful in the medium for stocks). Second, whether there is a positive or negative shock to earnings, if we can assume that stocks will go into bull mode in relatively short order, we can also assume (again, especially since 1913) that P/E will expand and stock fluctuations will inversely correlate with earnings fluctuations (again, see the second chart in the article). In other words, a rebound from a negative shock to earnings (as in 2009) will primarily redound to the greater glory of stocks, not earnings.In the following charts, you can see the relationship between the log of the relative volatility of earnings to subsequent five- and ten-year returns. The correlations are positive but very weak (just shy of 0.2), but I think our eyes do not mislead us by suggesting that earnings volatility plays some sort of role. If we compare the relative volatility of earnings with the rolling correlation between P/E and subsequent earnings growth, there is a relationship, but there is something else going on, too. There is a breakdown of some kind as earnings have become more and more volatile over the last four or five decades.Volatility certainly cannot explain everything, then. I suspect, however, that there is a relationship between volatility and the progression of the correlation between earnings and share price fluctuations (the relationship in the first chart and the earnings beta measure) that I am not fully grasping, perhaps due to my feeble mathematical imagination. Perhaps the P/E ratio itself contains information that is not captured by either earnings volatility or CAPE contains individually.Instead of reducing all of this to a single mathematical variable, then, perhaps we can try a narrative approach. I am imagining a process such as the following one, with each stage lasting something like five to ten years:1.  . Stocks are increasingly correlated with earnings; earnings are also becoming more and more volatile.2.  . Earnings become extremely volatile due to the inevitable crisis, stocks decouple from earnings (as well as interest rates, inflation, and commodities).3.  . Stocks are now strongly inversely correlated with earnings (and interest rates, inflation, and commodities). Earnings volatility falls relative to stocks.At the very end of the third stage, a switch occurs: earnings accelerate, but so do stocks. That is essentially the end of low earnings volatility and the contra-cyclical relationships. Back to stage one.In this narrative guise, I think my summary of the unfolding of stock market supercycles is not all that different from Shiller's description of particular episodes of market history in  . He notes, for example, the eerily steady earnings growth of the late 1990s. But, there are also important qualitative differences between the interpretations implied by an approach which focuses on earnings volatility and one that excludes that volatility.For one, the first approach deemphasizes the absolute level of the P/E ratio, whereas the relationship between CAPE and returns is entirely a function of the absolute level of the ratio. I think the former approach, although still theoretically and mathematically embryonic, allows greater flexibility in terms of market analysis and goes some way towards explaining why P/E has bottomed at a relatively high level in the current cycle and may give us some indication of gauging when this market will peak.Intermediate corrections aside, this market looks set to be bullish over the remainder of the decade. The extreme market volatility that only ended in 2011 suggests that there are at least a few more years to go, and the low correlation between stock fluctuations and earnings fluctuations also suggests that this bull market has not fully matured as of yet.So, how should we think about the relationship between earnings and the market? There are so many ways to look at the relationships discussed here. Let me see if I can recast these relationships somewhat with a single chart. It will not be especially simple, but perhaps it will put the relationship between earnings growth, volatility, and returns in a more straightforward way.In the following chart, we will take a look again at the relationship between P/E,  earnings growth, and  stock market performance. I have also inverted P/E and stock returns to highlight the critical relationships. Above, we noted that an inverse correlation between concurrent earnings growth and P/E implied a bull market in the following five to ten years, but I want to shift the focus a little.There are a few features that should be immediately recognizable from the beginning of the discussion. First, that P/E tends to be highly correlated with returns only after World War II (as well as in 1924-1930, but not 2008-2011), reflective of the market's modern tendency for P/E to be driven by multiple expansion rather than changes in earnings. At the same time, we can see that earnings growth has increasingly tended to be inversely correlated with both stock prices and the P/E multiple (note: because the scale for stock returns and P/E is inverted, this will appear as a positive correlation), although earnings since World War II are more consistently positive over the long term (at least until the 2000s).Beyond that, however, is the relationship between peaks in earnings growth and changes in stock market performance. You might notice that peaks in earnings growth often roughly coincide with changes in the direction of the stock market, especially stock market peaks, even though annualized changes in stocks and earnings tend to be inversely correlated, especially during bull markets!Earnings peaked in 1906, roughly around the same time as stocks. Late in the Roaring '20s, earnings growth spiked upwards again, peaking in 1931 (due to the 1921 collapse in earnings). The 1959 peak in stock return growth was led by the peak in earnings growth a few months earlier. In 1997, earnings growth peaked again, a few years before the top in the market.As discussed in a previous section of the article, we already know (as much as anything can be known about the future) that earnings growth will peak in 2019 at a historically high level, probably twice the 1950s peak.What is less noticeable perhaps is that earnings growth also peaks  the conclusion of bear markets, however. Stocks bottomed in 2009 but earnings topped out in 2012. In 1974, stocks bottomed; earnings peaked in 1981. In 1939, stocks bottomed, and earnings peaked in 1943. Stocks bottomed in 1921, earnings peaked in 1924. With the exception of the 1981 peak, most earnings peaks were due to violent earnings recoveries.If you look at the 10% line on the earnings growth axis, you can see that peaks in earnings growth seem to be tied more to changes in long-term stock market direction than either the peaks or troughs of the stock market itself. The difference seems to be one of a difference in timing and volatility.What about the market of the current decade of the 2010s? CAPE is too blunt an instrument to say anything especially reliable about such a specific time frame, but the timing and volatility of changes in earnings and share prices suggests that a significant P/E expansion during a stock market collapse is the formula for exceptional medium-term (five- to ten-year) gains. Perhaps the single most interesting thing about this chart is that market bottoms concluded with often very high P/E ratios (1894, 1921, 1939, 1946, and 2009). The only one that did not was the 1974 bottom. Prior to the 1960s, almost every instance of P/E peaking above 20 was during a market bottom  The 1920s were uncharacteristically modern insofar as P/E was raised to the 20-level primarily by surging stock market prices rather than falling earnings. It was only in the 1960s and 1990s that this 1920s pattern was to be repeated. In 2009, the market reverted to the form it took back when long-term earnings lacked the implicit growth guarantees.Fluctuations in the volatility of earnings seem to be intimately linked to stock market performance. Within the context of the cyclical and contra-cyclical behavior of the market relative to inflation, interest rates, and commodity prices, as well as earnings, greater precision in predicting markets may be possible by focusing on the relationship between cyclicality and secular trends. Until a greater understanding of these relationships can be pieced together, I would summarize the current situation in the following way:We had not experienced an earnings shock such as the one we had five years ago for eighty years. History seems to suggest that they are followed by stock market booms that last not much longer than a decade. As the boom unfolds, the statistical rebound in earnings growth tends to peak with the market, even as the annualized fluctuations in earnings and stock prices become increasingly inversely correlated. By that point, the absolute level of P/E, by any measure, will probably be even higher than it is now. An end to the stock boom sometime around the end of the decade does not seem improbable.

Understanding the actual influence may be crucial to navigating the next few years. To paraphrase Upton Sinclair:The common belief is that lower marginal income tax rates lead to stronger growth. This would be an inverse relationship where the growth rate and tax rate move in opposite directions. The empirical reality differs starkly.Below we will look at logical framework of why low marginal tax rates are bad for growth and then show the empirical evidence that they are. Using this evidence we'll build regression models that have predicted long-term growth with much better accuracy than most economists. Finally, we will look at why low marginal tax rates are a bigger influence behind bubbles than low interest rates.Growth benefits from business owners having a low average income tax rate with a high marginal tax rate. Their average rate has to be  .If marginal tax rates are too low, business owners take more personal income out of business revenue, leaving a smaller portion to be spent on wages, equipment, training, research, inventory and marketing. Dollars spent on deductible items within a business have a larger growth effect than dollars pulled out as personal income. Many of the dollars pulled out may do little for growth and only serve to bid up prices of rare art works, beachfront property, gold, stocks, bonds or luxury goods.If low marginal tax rates are in place long enough the diversion of business revenue away from expenditures with a high growth effect eventually results in a Great Depression or great recession.Marginal tax rates appear to have a curvilinear relationship with growth. If the top marginal rate is above or below that optimal rate, growth suffers.The chart below shows annual GDP growth from 1920 through 2013 with the top marginal tax rate leading two years. We'll examine other lead times below, but for now let's look at the lead time with the best correlation.Each point on the scatter plot (left graph) represents what growth was one year shown on vertical scale and what the tax rate was two years before on the horizontal scale.The highest point represents 18.9% growth in 1942 and a top marginal rate of 81.1% in 1940. The lowest point represents the economy shrinking 12.9% in 1932 and the top rate of 25% in 1930. The second lowest point on the chart depicts GDP shrinking 11.6% in 1946 and a 94% marginal tax rate in 1944. The green curved line is the best quadratic fit of the data. The red line is the best linear fit. This same data is shown in the time-series plot on the right. The blue line shows annual growth. The green and red lines are estimates of the influence the top rate has on growth based on the best linear and curved fits in the scatter plot.Here is a closer look at the scatter plot with a theoretical inverse correlation shown in pink. Most people seem to believe in something like the pink line.In the chart above, the red line shows a positive relationship where growth and the tax rate move in the same direction. The green line shows a positive relationship through the marginal tax rate rising into the mid 60s percentile rage. Those who are uncomfortable with this positive relationship correctly point out that correlation does not prove causation. For example, it is true that rising ice cream sales do not cause warmer temperatures. On the other hand, if there were a theory that warmer temperatures caused ice cream sales to decline (an inverse correlation) while the empirical data showed a positive correlation, the theory would be proven false. And so it is with the theoretical pink line in the chart above.Economists and others, who promote this belief that lower marginal rates lead to faster growth, never specify when the influence is supposed to occur. To get specific would make it too obvious the theory is wrong.To make the point, let's examine lots of lead times and multiple time periods. For the time period from 1920 through 2013, I have examined all the lead times from zero years (concurrent) out to fifteen.Below are two scatter plots, one with no lead time and the other with a three year lead time.Note the red linear best fit correlations have a positive slope in both charts. The best fit linear correlation was positive with every lead time up to 8 years. It was inverse for the lead times from 9 to 14 years, but not statistically significant, particularly if the tax variables outlined below are accounted for. The strongest inverse correlation had a 12 year lead time with an R-square of only 0.04. The inverse correlation is probably just an artifact of the volatility of growth from the 1920s through the 1940s. If we analyze growth from 1950 through 2013, the correlation between the top rate and annual growth is positive for every lead time from zero through 23 years.Now let's take a closer look at the correlation/influence low marginal rates had in The Great Depression and great recession.The chart above shows the correlation/influence of the top rate on growth during the 1920s and 1930s. Annual GDP growth is shown in the grey bars using the black scales. The top rate is shown in the dashed red line using the red scales. Note the red time scale is pushed forward 2 years to show the leading influence. During the 1920s, the top rate was cut in a series of steps from 73% to 24%. It was only at 24% in 1929 and then went to 25% in 1930. The top rate was at 25%, or less, for seven years. These seven years correlate with the growth from 1927 through 1933. This was the weakest 7 year period in history where GDP annualized declining 3.2% a year as symbolized in the lowest point on the black line above.In June 1932, the top tax rate went from 25% on the portion of income above $100,000 to 63% on income above $1 million. After the two year lag, GDP grew 11% in 1934. GDP and industrial production set new highs in 1936. However, non farm jobs did not fully recover until 1940.This tax increase appears to have started the recovery from the Great Depression. A few days after the tax increase, the stock market hit its depression low in early July. It rose 135% from June 1932 to July 1933 for the best 13 month period in U.S. history.Strong growth in the early 1920s corresponded with high marginal tax rates. The decline into The Great Depression followed low marginal rates. Recovery came with high marginal tax rates. Crucial to the high marginal rates being effective were high brackets that allowed business owners to have a low average tax rate if they plowed revenue back into the business.We will look more at the importance of tax brackets later. Let's go ahead and see the tax policy around the great recession. For better context the chart below starts in 1984 and looks at growth related to both the top tax rate and the capital gains rate.In thechart above the top rate (in green) leads growth by two years as in previous charts. The capital gains rate (in blue) leads growth by four years. The model (in red) combines the influences of the two tax rates. The tax rate axes are scaled so that a move up or down in the tax rate matches the move up or down in the model.Higher marginal tax rates are good for growth in the period and range covered in the chart above. The great recession started in 2007,four years after the capital gains rate was cut. The other two recessions in the chart also correspond to a cut in either the capital gain rate or top rate. The eight years from 2007 through 2014 are influenced by the top rate of 35% and the capital gains rate of 15%. The model estimates growth of 0.9% for these eight years. Bycontrast , the strongest year of growth, 1984, corresponds with a 50% top rate and a 28% capital gains rate.The bottom red line in the chart showing the estimated 7 year growth rate suggested the 2007-2013 period would grow at 0.9%. Actual growth was 1.1%. I am expecting the rate for the 7 year period ending this year to head down toward or below the 0.9% estimate.Growth volatility during a business cycle is mostly smoothed out by looking at the 7 year growth rate. The close fit between the model and 7 year growth rate implies most of the variation in long run economic growth in the last 30 years has been determined by the incentive marginal tax rates give business owners to either plow money into deductible expenditures within the enterprise to avoid taxes, or to pull it out as personal income.In other words, prosperity benefits when business owners build wealth within their business or in starting new businesses, rather than taking large personal incomes and making financial investments. The growing wealth within a business can remain untaxed until the owner takes it out as personal income, the business is sold or it gets taxed in the estate. Tax brackets play a pivotal role in balancing the incentives to build a business and avoid taxes.High tax brackets are the key to having a low average tax rate with a high marginal rate. For a person in the top 0.01% of society it would make a lot of difference to their average tax rate if a marginal tax rate of 60% kicked in at $200,000 or $200 million. Below we will look at what the top bracket has been, then see its positive relationship with growth and finally at how it interacts with the top rate and capital gains rate to influence growth.The chart above shows how the bracket has changed since 1920. The black line in the chart above shows the top bracket has ranged from $5 million (1936-1941) to $29,750 in 1988. In Constant 2012 dollars (green line) that range is $83.6 million to $60,000. My research suggests adjusting the bracket by per-capita GDP gives more significant results. The red line shows the top bracket this year is just under 9 times last year's per-capita GDP. The highest multiple was 8,571 in 1936 which would be the equivalent of about $450 million today.In 1965 the top bracket was cut from $400,000 to $200,000. Since 1965, the bracket has never been above 56 times per-capita GDP. Prior to that, it had never been below 118 times. The top bracket has its strongest influence on growth with a three year lead time. The next several charts will examine the difference between the high bracket era and the low bracket one. The dividing point will be 1968 to account for the 3 year lead time.The chart below shows the linear correlations between growth and the top tax bracket in the high and low tax bracket eras.Each dot in the scatter plots represents the annual growth rate one year and the top bracket as a multiple of per-capita GDP three years earlier. The strongest growth on the chart, 18.9% in 1942, corresponds with a top bracket that was 7,435 times per-capita GDP in 1939. The high bracket era scatter plot on the left has a positive sloping dark orange best fit line. The low bracket scatter plot in the middle has a positive sloping light orange best fit line. This influence on growth is also shown in the time series plot with dark and light orange lines.The high bracket era appears to have a steeper sloping best fit line, but if the low bracket scale went from zero to 10,000 rather than zero to 60, it would be obvious that the low bracket era actually has a steeper sloping best fit line.The top tax rate has curvilinear correlations with growth in both the high and low bracket eras. The best curvilinear (quadratic) fits in the chart below suggest the growth optimizing top rate is 64% in the high bracket era and 54% in the low bracket era.In the high bracket era the highest growth corresponds with an 81% top tax rate. Conventionally, this strong growth is attributed to WWII. I have come to believe it is mainly due to the highest tax brackets in history and a favorable capital gains tax rate. The strongest growth in the low bracket era came with a top rate of 50%.While the 50% rate appears to have improved growth, it probably could have been better. In the five years the top rate was 50%, the top bracket averaged 8.7 times per-capita GDP. This low bracket pushed many of the near affluent into the arms of tax shelter salesmen. There were a lot of junk investments where uneconomic oil prospects were drilled. Office and apartment buildings were completed with no tenants ready to move in. There is not enough data to make a precise estimate, but I suspect the bracket that would give the 50% tax rate the optimal balance between a low average rate and a high marginal rate would be about 30 times per-capita GDP, or about $1.6 million based on last year's GDP. If the top rate got into the mid 60 percentile range, the optimal bracket is likely in the hundreds of millions.The capital gains tax rate like the top rate appears to have curvilinear relationships with growth where the growth optimizing capital gains rate in the high bracket period is around 54% and the low bracket's growth optimizing tax rate is around 27.5%.Unlike the top tax rate, the capital gains rate appears to differ in its lead time between the high and low bracket eras. In the High bracket period the dark blue best fit curve is based on the capital gains rate leading growth by 5 years. In the low bracket period, the light blue best fit curve is based on leading growth by 4 years. The difference in lead time may have more to do with different time periods or some other factor than with the level of the bracket.In the high bracket period the best growth, 1942, corresponds with a 39% capital gains rate, while the Great Depression was influenced by a 12.5% tax rate.In the low bracket period the best growth, in 1984, lines up with a near optimal 28% tax rate. The great recession corresponds with the 15% tax rate. The back to back recessions of 1980 and 1981-82 were influenced by the above optimal capital gains rate of 39.9%.The capital gains tax rate around 39% highlights the importance of a low average tax rate with a high marginal rate and of the tax bracket. When the top bracket was over 7000 times per-capita GDP, the rate of 39% appears to be favorable to growth. When the bracket was less than 20 times per-capita GDP this rate appears to be detrimental to growth.In the chart below the black line shows growth. The dark red line shows a regression model combining the high bracket influences of the top tax rate, the top tax bracket and the capital gains tax rate. The lighter red line show a regression model for the tax policy influences in the low bracket era.The low bracket model estimates a growth rate of 0.8% for the years 2007 through 2014. Estimated growth picks up to 1.4% for 2015 and 2016, assuming the top rate remains at 39.6% for the rest of the year.The chart below shows the 7 year growth rate and the 7 year estimate based on the high and low bracket models.I have found no other theory of what influenced long-term growth over the last 95 years that comes close to the explanatory accuracy of the above interpretation of tax policy.It appears popular to blame the Fed and low interest rates for bubbles in asset prices, but this finger pointing does not withstand empirical analysis. The culprit is low marginal tax rates.If low interest rates caused financial bubbles, we would have had bigger bubbles in the 1950s than we have had so far in the 21st century and the biggest U.S. stock bubble of all time would have been preceded by low interest rates.The table below shows the conditions in seven year periods leading to bubbles in 1929, 2000 and 2007, as well as a control period 1950 to 1956 when interest rates were unusually low while marginal tax rates were very high and there were no bubbles to speak of.\n  \nThe period leading into the 90% stock decline from 1929 to 1932 had the highest interest rates in the table and the lowest marginal tax rates. The financial crisis was preceded by the second lowest marginal tax rates and fairly normal interest rates.Bubbles happen when the price of an asset is bid up well beyond the underlying intrinsic value of the asset. For stocks, this process appears to be influenced by marginal tax rates. As discussed above when marginal tax rates on personal income are low, more revenue, or even equity, is pulled out of businesses as personal income. Some of this money pulled out is then used to buy stocks,thus bidding up the price. So low marginal rates tend to weaken companies on the inside and bid up the price on the outside: practically the definition of a bubble.Low interest rates may contribute to bubble formation if marginal tax rates are low. If marginal rates are high, low interest rates more likely contribute to investment in productive capacity inside a business.While I don't have a precise measure of bubbles such that I could calculate a lead time with which marginal tax rates lead to inflated stock prices, I suspect the 15% capital gains rate in place through 2012 is still influencing stock prices into bubble territory. There are various measures such as Tobin's Q, Shiller's PE, the ratio of stock value to GDP and my PEses that all point to stocks being quite overvalued.The PEses is approaching the 2007 high and is higher than any time prior to 1997. Valuation has a strong correlation with real total returns for periods of about 15 to 20 years. While Dr. Robert Shiller popularized looking at returns over 10 year periods, the correlation is stronger with longer periods.Here is the correlation of total real S&P 500 returns over 17 year periods (black line and scales) and the inverted PEses on a log scale (red line and scales).The chart depicts that when valuation is high (red line is low using inverted red scale) that return over the next 17 years is low. Where low valuation (the red line is high on chart) leads to higher returns the next 17 years.The last point on the black line plotted at March 2014 is based on an estimate of the average closing price for the first 21 days of March. It shows a 17 year annualized real return of 4.62% from March 1997. The PEses of March 1997, 41.1, plotted directly below estimated the return would only annualize 0.1%. This is biggest underestimate on the chart.The correlation since 1960 has been very strong, but in the last two years, the 17 year return has held up in the 4% to 5% range while the estimate plunged to about 0%. In the past when the actual return was far above the estimated return, such as 2001 and 2007, the market fell enough to bring the actual return down to or below the estimate. It remains to be seen if or when that will happen this time. There is more information on PEses in this  .The last point on the red line shows PEses at 45 and implies the return over the next 17 years after inflation and dividends will annualize losing about 1%. This would be comparable to the period ending August 1982. I expect all of that loss to come in the next few years and set up an extraordinary buying opportunity.Valuation is not a timing tool and can easily be off three years or more. Just because this or any other measure of value shows a market to be overvalued does not mean it will not be more over valued next year.While stocks are probably in bubble territory, the deflation may not come until economic and/or earnings growth turns down. The signs pointing to this are quite mixed: a few suggest the decline has started, some that it is several months away, while others don't even show a decline coming.Prosperity depends on the wealthy building businesses that create more wealth and employment, as opposed to living a life of ease off existing wealth. The tax policy that most encourages prosperity appears to be a low average income tax rate on the wealthy with a high marginal rate.The lagged effect of low marginal tax rates suggests the baseline growth rate is around 1% this year and 1.5% in 2015 and 2016. Growth closer to the long-term average of 3.3% should begin in 2017 when the lagged effect of increasing the capital gains tax rate should begin influencing growth.With an expected growth rate near 1%, normal fluctuations in growth mean deeper recessions and a larger percentage of time in recession than during times where the normal growth rate was above 3%.Forecasts that growth will return to 3% this year or next probably assume that 3% is still the normal baseline growth rate. If that were true, the last eight years all of which have been weaker than 3% should make growth bouncing up to 3% a sure bet. If a sub 1% growth trend is the reality, the last four years of above trend growth make a decline in growth a strong probability.Current market valuations rest on the assumption that we are returning to \"normal\" growth. If/when growth falls back to 1% or turns negative this year or next, the jarring gap between expectation and reality could create a stock market crash.The combination of weak growth, high valuation and the shift to unfavorable  create the potential for a 40% to 80% decline in U.S. stock indexes (  ) sometime in the next one to five years. Protecting capital should be the primary concern.Diversification abroad should play a key role in protecting and growing capital. The U.S. has had the reputation of the least dirty shirt in the hamper the last few years and U.S. stock valuations rose relative to international indexes. A decline in the growth rate and especially a recession could reverse the relative gain of the last few years. However, if the U.S. market goes down, other stock markets will likely follow. International bonds probably merit a larger-than-normal slice of the portfolio in the next year or two.

If you can't find a margin of safety - you have to hold cash.Two people who read  sent me these emails]:And the second email:That's what I'm doing now. I have 75% of my portfolio in cash. And I am underperforming. I am up 5% in 2012. The S&P 500 is up 11%. It is no fun making 5% a year. And it is no fun being beat by the S&P 500.But when you keep 75% of your assets in cash - you know that has to happen. I would love to be 100% invested. I would always love to be 100% invested. But when I can't find stocks I like with a margin of safety - I stay in cash.It's odd for me to have 75% in cash. I can't think of any time in recent years where I kept more than 50% of my portfolio in cash for more than a month or so. It just never happens. But it's happening now. It's been happening for most of 2012.Why?We all have rules. We all have habits. We all have ways we like to invest. Most investors diversify more than I do. I have low standards when it comes to diversification. I have high standards when it comes to stock selection.Like I said in a recent article - my required rate of return is 10%. If I don't think I can make 10% a year in a stock - I don't buy that stock.So I have a rate of return hurdle. I also have a value hurdle. I need to know the stock I am buying is - conservatively calculated - worth more than what I am paying. I need clear and convincing evidence of that.I also have a safety hurdle. We'll call it a comfort hurdle. I need to be comfortable with the industry, the organization, the management, the balance sheet, etc. There needs to be a low risk of catastrophic loss.I don't like looking at stocks where I think there is a real chance of losing 50% of my investment.I don't own banks. Over the last few years - there were many cheap banks. There still are some. Many of them have a real risk of catastrophic loss. You could lose 50% of your money if the world goes against you.That is not true in  . That is not true in  . That is not true in  . Or in  .Those are companies in industries with solid demand. They are businesses with solid competitive positions. If you know they are cheap - and you know they can make you 10% a year - those are stocks you can feel safe buying.So when I say I'm not finding stocks to buy - I am saying I'm not finding stocks that check all 3 boxes at once. They need to be worth more than they are trading for. They need to be safe. And they need to offer a return of 10% a year.There are some stocks I know are safe. A good example is  . That is a safe stock. Demand for the service is stable. It will be around as long as car insurance. Copart's competitive position is solid. I like the management. The balance sheet - which is chock full of land - is fine. It's clearly a safe stock.But is it cheap? Copart trades at 21 times earnings. It trades at over 4 times sales. And the price to book is so high it has no meaning.So I like Copart. I follow Copart. But I don't own Copart. It only checks one of the boxes I need checked. It is a good, safe business. But it isn't cheap. And it doesn't promise 10% annual returns. So I can't buy the stock.Then there are stocks that are cheap. No one doubts they are cheap. But are they safe? Are they the kind of business I feel comfortable owning?Think about  . Or  . Or even  .Whether you can buy these stocks depends on where you draw your circle of competence. HP is definitely outside my circle. There is not even a kernel of understanding in that business for me to latch onto. I don't know their products. I don't know their customers. I don't see how they differ from others.And I'm writing this on an HP desktop. But I only own that desktop because another - non-HP computer - broke. They could ship an HP that day. So I bought an HP. I don't like or dislike the desktop. And I wouldn't buy another HP.A lot of companies - mostly big companies - fall into the HP category for me. They are big. They compete with other big companies. And I'm not sure I understand what they do. Why they make the products they do. Why they provide the services they do. And why any customer would stick with them.These stocks may make good bets. It might be a great idea to buy Hewlett-Packard LEAPs. I don't know. It isn't the kind of stock I am looking for. Because I'm looking for a business I understand. Where I understand the company's behavior. And I understand their customer's behavior. That - more than anything - is what gives me comfort.So no HP for me. No matter how cheap it is. What about Bank of America?  has a preferred investment in Bank of America. He obviously thought the common stock was cheap. He got 10-year options as part of the deal.I'm a Bank of America customer. And I have no doubt that - in five years - they will have more of my dollars at their bank than they do now. That's a good sign.There are very few businesses that can count on getting more of my business in the next five years. I'm sure  will make more money off me in 2017 than they do now. I'm sure  will make more money off me. And I'm sure Bank of America will too. That's about it.These businesses all have some things in common. They scale well. They have big competitors. And parts of the experience they offer are unpleasant.Amazon benefits from how little I liked shopping at  . It was never a fun place. Some people like being in actual stores. I'm not one of them. So Amazon doesn't need to match stores on price to keep my business. I'm always willing to pay up a little for the convenience of online shopping, home delivery, etc.Southwest is a more direct winner. They offer more frequent flights on the routes I want. They have good prices. And I like the actual experience a bit more. Again, very big, unimpressive competition is part of why I can be sure I'll fly Southwest even more in the future. The alternative is worse.So why am I sure I'll bank more with Bank of America? It's a sticky business. It's a big hassle to move. They own a broker - Merrill Lynch. Online banking is important to me. Their brokerage and online services can match anyone's. And I don't like going in a branch. So superior customer service by a local competitor won't get my deposit.Finally, the real reason Bank of America has my business is location. My old bank was Wells Fargo. I liked Wells Fargo better than Bank of America. I still do. But Wells Fargo doesn't have a branch I can walk to. Bank of America has one a couple blocks from my apartment.Does that mean Wells Fargo can open a branch next door and get back my business? No. Banking is a sticky business. I moved banks when I moved. Moving my account for any other reason is a pain I don't need. Bank of America will have to drive me away with mistakes. A competitor can't win me over if I'm even remotely content. Banks are not something people shop for. They are something they switch only when they need to. Like when their current bank screws up. Or when they move.So Bank of America won my deposit with location. They've won a lot of deposits that way. And even a competitor like Wells Fargo can't do much to them. In the U.S., every bank has a small share of national deposits. The competition between big banks - for deposits - is not as rough as the kind of competition Amazon and Southwest have to deal with. It's more local. And more fragmented.That makes it sound like I could buy shares of Bank of America. And I could - if all that mattered to a bank is deposits. I have no doubt Bank of America will get cheap money far into the future.The problem is the past. And what they do with deposits. I need to worry about everything Bank of America did in the past. And all the loans they will make in the future.I like to put 25% of my portfolio into one stock. I don't feel comfortable putting 25% of my portfolio into Bank of America. It is cheap. And it can return 10% a year. But it's not in my comfort zone.Finally, there's  . This stock is also clearly cheap. And it's also a business where I have experience as a customer. I'm running Windows 8 right now. I love it. I have no idea what the long-term future of Windows will look like.I also have an Xbox 360. And - of course - I use Microsoft Office. I'm very likely to use all three - Xbox, Windows, and Office - in their next generations. So Microsoft has their hooks in me. And in a way HP doesn't. My next desktop will not be an HP. My next operating system will be Windows.Microsoft seems like an easy business to understand. And in some ways it is. But it depends a lot on what computers look like. It worries me a lot that the line between my desktop and my Kindle Fire is not a wide one. Windows only has a moat in one of those devices.I just don't know what the future of computers will be. And whether there will be a place for Windows. And how big it will be. So I know Microsoft is cheap. But I'm not comfortable buying it.Why did I turn a question about macro investing into a question about micro investing?Because that is always what it comes down to. I have 75% of my portfolio in cash - because I said no to stocks like Microsoft and Bank of America and HP. Not because I have a view of the market. Not because I have a view of the economy.If the stock market was overpriced and the economy was in the toilet and Carnival was trading for $15 a share - I would buy it. Why? Because in 20 years, I believe the cruise industry will be bigger than it is today, Carnival will be the leader in the cruise industry, and the leader in the cruise industry will earn its cost of capital. If those things are true - and Carnival is trading for a fraction of book value - then I should buy Carnival. Nothing else matters.The macro picture - by which I mean the level of the stock market, the strength of the economy, and the level of interest rates - will change a lot in 20 years. It changed a lot during the 23 years in which  owned Coke. But if he was right about Coke in 1989 - he didn't need to be clairvoyant about the future of everything else.Thinking about the big picture is often dangerous. Because it's often used as a way to justify dumb decisions. Not clearly dumb decisions. But borderline decisions. Carnival at $35 a share is a borderline decision. If you are right about fuel prices - that they will be lower in the future than they are today - you may make buckets of money buying Carnival at $35 a share. If you are wrong, you may not. It's a borderline decision at $35 a share. It is clearly a good decision at $15 a share.Waiting is the hardest part of investing. You have to wait long enough to buy a good idea. And once you own the idea, you have to wait long enough to see it play out.Right now, I am waiting for a good idea. And that means I made 5% this year. And the market made 11%. That's the price of a good idea.The value of cash is as an option. Cash is an option on future, lower stock prices. For a market timer - it's an option on future, lower general stock prices. For a stock picker - like me - cash is an option on future, lower specific stock prices.I don't have 75% of my portfolio in cash because I think the stock market will be lower in the future. I have 75% of my portfolio in cash because the price of Carnival and Copart and  are not low enough yet.Those stocks may get cheaper in the future. If they do, I may buy them. Or they won't get cheaper. And I'll never get to buy them.The only other option is lowering your standards. Which  refused to do in 1965. Stock prices were too high. He couldn't find good ideas to buy. It wasn't the game he was used to playing. So he wound down his partnership.Why didn't he just stay in cash? Because he was investing for others.

The theory is that the unusually close proximity of the moon to the Earth at the time probably caused higher than expected tides, which dislodged extraordinarily large icebergs. What struck me about the article is that it mentioned that the captain of the Titanic was assigned to this maiden voyage  because he was a highly experienced, knowledgeable and careful seaman of the North Atlantic. I hadn't known that he was so credentialed. What we all do know is that those unusually large icebergs made their way much further South than expected, into the shipping lanes.So here is a situation where an experienced professional was extremely comfortable operating in a certain environment and in a certain manner. Yet the environment had changed beyond his expectations and, because he was operating the ship the way he would given past conditions, the captain was headed for disaster. And we all know what happened as a result of his complacency.The lesson of the Titanic's captain could have similar implications for your stock portfolio. Perhaps you're a seasoned investor and have been selecting stocks the same way for 10, 20, or even more years. If so, how do you truly know if your stock-picking strategy still works? Have you been keeping perfect records to know with confidence that your strategy outperforms, or are you simply \"remembering\" that your stock picks have been profitable? (Numerous behavioral studies have shown that people tend to remember their successes and ignore their failures. We condition ourselves to \"believe\" we're better at performing a task than we actually are. Humans are an optimistic species. It's a trait that served us well during our evolution, but it may not serve us so well in our modern, complex world of investing.)On the other hand, if you're new to stock investing, what kind of ideas do you have that will lead to higher returns? Would you like a way to test those ideas?Furthermore, how would you like to have access to numerous data items like  ,  and corporate financial statements for thousands of companies? After all, the more informed you are; the better decision maker you'll be. Does the appeal to test your ideas over many historical time periods, including up and down markets and economic cycles, appeal to you? Would you like to get a sense of the riskiness or  of your strategy? In other words, wouldn't it be good to know the frequency and size of the \"icebergs\" inherent in your strategy? Wouldn't you like to know if  , value, or growth strategies (or combinations thereof) perform better over time?Zacks offers a tool that allows you to find answers to these questions. You can use the  to navigate all the different data available, discover strategies that lead to higher returns and test it all for confident trading. It truly is a one-of-a-kind product, available to the individual investor. With the Research Wizard, you're only limited by your imagination.Let's look at an example. Sticking with the non-complacency theme, I decided to not only look at stocks with the best  , but those that most recently appeared as Zacks Rank #1s (Strong Buys). So I'm avoiding complacency here by selecting the freshest and best Zacks Ranks.Testing a strategy of the stocks that just became a #1 within the last week yielded a 10.8% annual average return--compared to a 0% annual average return for the S&P 500 from 2000-2011. So $10,000 invested in this strategy at the end of 1999 would have returned $34,062 at the end of 2011, versus $10,049 for the S&P 500. The strategy was, however, slightly more risky with the largest losing period returning -32.5% compared to -27.5% for the S&P 500. The number of stocks in the portfolio averaged just above 30 over this 11-year timeframe, and portfolios with a smaller number of stocks tend to be more volatile.Here's how to find the stocks that just became Zacks Rank #1s:Here are five stocks using the above methodology (3/16/12): - The Kroger CompanyKroger, a Cincinnati-based company, operates as a retailer in the US, and manufactures and processes food for sale in its supermarkets. This company has become a new Zacks #1 Rank of a \"Strong Buy\". The improvement in the Zacks Rank is due to several quarters of  and recent upward revisions in both quarterly and fiscal earnings estimates. - IntercontinentalExchange, Inc.IntercontinentalExchange, an Atlanta-based company, operates regulated exchanges, clearing houses, and over-the-counter (OTC) markets for agricultural, credit, currency, emissions, energy and equity index contracts. This new Zacks #1 Rank has a solid history of earnings surprises and just had four estimate revisions in the last seven days, and five in the last 30 days for both its current fiscal quarter and annual earnings. - Herbalife Ltd.Over the last year, this company has had super strong earnings surprises of at least 15%. Couple those surprises with at least eight revisions for both the current quarterly and annual earnings estimates over the last 30 days, and you have what adds up to a Zacks #1 Rank. Herbalife, a network marketing company, sells weight management, nutritional supplement, energy, sports and fitness, and personal care products worldwide. - Westlake Chemical Corp.Westlake manufactures and markets basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and fabricated products. This company has delivered a positive earnings surprise six out of the last seven quarters and had at least two quarterly and annual estimate revisions within the last 30 days. Earnings surprises and upward earnings revisions lead to a good Zacks Rank. - Copart, Inc.Copart provides online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. This Zacks #1 Rank's latest earnings report beat expectations by over 20%, which has caused upward estimate revisions within the last week and month for both quarterly and annual earnings.Because I'm a strong proponent of self-improvement, I encourage you to verify your strategies and try to improve upon them with the  .

Not just bad companies in need of restructuring, but also really good companies. In a perfectly efficient market, this wouldn't happen. The fact is that \"perfectly efficient\" exists only in the textbooks. In the real world, investors sometimes arrive en masse at the wrong conclusions.Just this week, Copart (  ), a company I consider extremely high-quality for many reasons, announced the results of its tender offer that expired on Friday (1/14). For those not familiar with the company, it is a car auction company with a broad physical presence combined with a powerful internet presence. The company has historically eschewed debt, has high insider ownership, is known to think very long-term (and isn't afraid to invest in the business) and generates significant cash and a high return on capital.In December, the company announced a major transaction, tapping its line-of-credit to repurchases approximately 13% of its stock at $38. As you can see in the chart below, they announced their intention when the stock was about 35, a price that is mid-point of a tight range for the past 18 months. The stock immediately gapped up and gravitated towards the tender price. The results indicated a much smaller-than-expected number of shares tendered, and the company actually decided to increase the purchase to 15% of its outstanding shares. The stock actually jumped above the tender price on the results.Efficient market? I don't think so, as absolutely nothing has transpired except for the announcement of the tender offer, the analyst revisions to estimates (major accretion) and the tender results. The stock was too cheap before in my view - investors weren't properly adjusting the PE for the large cash balance. The spent $463mm but now have just $200 mm roughly in net debt compared to over $1 billion in equity. Additionally, there was a minimal short-interest, so this is all about long investors paying up for higher earnings potential.Another example is C.R. Bard (  ), which began December 9th with cash in excess of debt of about $300mm. It announced that day that it was going to offer $750mm in debt to repurchase stock. The book value of its equity was $2.2 billion, so the move will leave it still with below average leverage given net debt of $450mm. The company also announced a restructuring, which muddies my analysis, but the clear driver is that EPS estimates immediately went up due to the lower sharecount. $750mm, if it is fully used to repurchase stock, is about 9% of the company. It worked like a charm:So, you are probably asking yourself, \"Why is this guy telling me NOW. This is the type of thing I want to hear BEFORE it happens\", and that's very fair. Investors in my models don't have that issue, as we own CPRT in the  BCR in  . With a look to the future rather than a celebration of recent events, I will share some recapitalization candidates that exist just among my  One of the reasons I have liked stocks since the summer and continue to do so is that there are lots of opportunities well beyond just my focus.Consider these, though:I will stop here, with three names from three different economic sectors. It's not hard to find many other examples of high-quality companies loaded to the gills with cash and low to reasonable valuations. These companies exist among the smallest to among the largest companies. Some may go the route of the LBO or acquisition, others may choose to be more aggressive on their capital structure on their own.

This bullish call spread cost $2.45 and willl roughly double the trader's money if the car-scrapping company closes at or above $40 on expiration.CPRT rallied 4.85 percent to $36.95 yesterday after management said it would buy back about 13 percent of the company's outstanding equity for $38 a share, a level not seen since September 2009.
