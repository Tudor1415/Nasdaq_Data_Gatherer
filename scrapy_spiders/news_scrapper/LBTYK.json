{"Content": ["(RTTNews) - Liberty Global plc (LBTYA, LBTYB and LBTYK) announced Wednesday that Liberty Global Ventures and Zouk Capital, a sustainable infrastructure and growth technology fund manager, formed a 50:50 joint venture partnership. The JV, Liberty Charge, will roll out on-street residential electric vehicle charging points in the UK.Zouk is the manager of the Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund or CIIF, established by the UK Government in 2019 to help develop public charging infrastructure points for electric vehicles throughout the country.The 50:50 joint venture was originally set up as a small incubation initiative within Liberty Global Ventures last year. It will now focus on providing the under-the-pavement power and communications infrastructure necessary for electric vehicle charging in residential areas.The partnership supports Liberty Global's efforts in this space following on from its Virgin Media Park and Charge or VPACH project, which aims to deploy \n1,200 charging sockets in towns and cities across the country by early 2021.Neil Isaacson, who has been leading Liberty Charge's market development activities, has been appointed CEO of the venture.

However, for the mid-term, the company backed 2022 guidance of revenue growth. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer noted that the coronavirus crisis has had a limited impact on its first quarter financial results and that its four key markets have performed well in a unique and challenging environment.Separately, Telefonica announced an agreement with Liberty Global plc (LBTYA, LBTYB and LBTYK) to merge their operating businesses in the U.K. to form a 50:50 joint venture.Liberty Global's Virgin Media will be combined with Telefonica's O2 to create a nationwide integrated communications provider with over 46 million video, broadband and mobile subscribers and 11 billion pounds of revenue. The transaction is expected to close around the middle of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals. In the transaction, Telefonica would receive 5.7 billion pounds in total proceeds, while Liberty Global would receive 1.4 billion pounds in total. The JV is expected to deliver substantial synergies valued at 6.2 billion pounds.For the first quarter, Telefonica's net income declined 56.2 percent from last year to 406 million euros. Adjusted net income was 619 million euros, down 30.1 percent.OIBDA amounted to 3.76 billion euros, down 11.8 percent on a reported basis and down 1.7 percent in organic terms.Meanwhile, OIBDA of the four core markets increased 0.8 percent organically from the prior year.OIBDA margin was 33.1 percent, down 2.5 percentage points from last year.Revenues were 11.37 billion euros, a decline of 5.1 percent on a reported basis and down 1.3 percent organically mainly due to lower service revenues while handset sales remained broadly stable. Revenues of the four core markets increased 0.1 percent organically.Further, the company confirmed the announced 0.40 euro dividend for 2020.In Spain, Telefonica shares were trading at 4.18 euros, down 2.36 percent.

Thank you, operator, and hello, everyone. I appreciate you joining us on the call today. And clearly, we have a lot to talk about, so I'm not going to waste much time with formalities. I'm going to jump right into what will be the most important topic, which is how we're managing through the COVID-19 pandemic.First of all, our hearts and prayers go out to everyone, who suffered through this crisis. These are clearly unprecedented times and I am particularly proud of our 27,000 employees across eight countries, who have dedicated themselves to keeping their customers connected, entertained and informed.You can imagine, our primary focus has been on their safety and well being, and while the policies and requirements vary by country, nearly 90% of our team has been working from home and we are deep in preparation for their return to the office and the field on a gradual basis.And we appreciate that this is an extraordinary time for our customers as well. So in addition to providing them with the same reliable and robust connectivity services we're known for, we've been improving their experience in a multitude of ways. We're boosting speed and increasing data caps. We're offering additional entertainment services, especially for kids and we're aware that our customers are experiencing economic challenges as well.So very careful to keep folks connected and help them manage through the crisis, even offering lifeline services where it's necessary. And we're paying special attention to our B2B customers, increasing capacity and providing emergency mobile coverage to hospitals and ensuring quick turnaround on product changes.As an essential service, we have crews and trucks in the field every day, in maintaining our networks, installing new customers and building plans. Our Lightning Construction crews for example are working as we speak. Of course, with additional precautionary measures, but we're on pace to light up at least 350,000 new homes this year. By the way, we've included a slide on Project Lightning in the appendix to see we'd have those details for the quarter.Now, at the outset of the crisis, many wondered whether any network could withstand the increase in usage that would inevitably occur under these circumstances and the answer for us is a clear yes.Our fixed broadband network has seamlessly absorbed 20%-plus increases in the downstream and 50%-plus increases in the upstream bandwidth with no problem at all. So, recent investments in infrastructure and speeds and connectivity products have really proved invaluable for all of us.From a trading point of view, our sales have been largely stable, but down from pre-crisis levels. And at the same time, as many of our peers have reported, we've seen a considerable drop off in churn.We're also experiencing softness in some of our premium sports products. That's not surprising. But in markets like the UK and Ireland these are zero-margin packages for us. And we don't make much money and neither impacting cash flow.On the mobile front, store closures are impacting handset sales and usage has dropped off a bit, as folks offload to Wi-Fi. But in many markets we're on our way to reopening and recovering. For example, two-thirds of the shops in Holland are now open and back in business, and for us, it's just a matter of time we believe.And Charlie is going to address, what all this means to our financial guidance for the year. On one hand, we're fortunate that we have very little exposure to things like advertising or other sectors that are experiencing disruption right now. As a group, our services have proven to be even more vital for consumers during this crisis. On the other hand, we're realistic about the impact this may have on bad debt and potential price increases and mobile roaming revenue, overall customer activity.Like our peers, we're assessing the medium-term impact of the pandemic on our business. And we expect to have a more thorough update for you in the second quarter . There were a lots of uncertainties on the road ahead from lifting of lockdowns to testing a vaccine, but we feel well-positioned to power through this.In the meantime, we are not suspending or changing guidance. We're actually pretty encouraged by our operating and financial prospects for the balance of the year.Let me reset the agenda here a bit, just for a minute and hit a couple of additional highlights on Slide 5. By the way, we're talking from slide. If you can get a hold of those it'd be very helpful for you.Now, despite the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, we delivered a solid first quarter operationally and financially. In fact, the quarter was largely in line or ahead of our internal expectations. I'll talk about this more when we dig into Virgin Media results. But we remain focused on a handful of key performance drivers in our European markets, in particular customer growth, customer ARPU and Fixed-Mobile Convergence.And we did well on all three of these with largely stable customers versus the prior quarter, solid ARPU growth versus the prior quarter and year-over-year, and good mobile additions. And have pointed that these operating strategies are working, right? We have over 32 million gigabit-ready homes across our European footprint, with 1-gig services launched in nearly 12 million of those homes.We're widening the distance between us and our competitors, when it comes to broadband speeds. We had a 22,000 broadband service in the quarter as a result. And our Fixed-Mobile Convergence bundles drove nearly 115,000 postpaid mobile addition.Now finally, a quick update on capital allocation. At the end of February, we authorized a $1 billion share buyback and through the end of April, so in about two months, we've repurchased $500 million of stock at an average price of mid-$16 range. So we're generally buying through 10b5-1 plans according to preset grids or pace accelerated as the stock declined, shouldn't be a surprise to most of you.Now, let me move to the most important announcement today, that is, of course, our agreement with Telefonica to combine our UK operations, Virgin Media and O2. We are really, really excited about this transaction and the partnership with Telefonica. Over the last several years, we've been successfully executing a very clear plan to create national Fixed Mobile Convergence champions in all of our markets.Now, in some cases, we've sold our broadband operations to mobile operators like Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone. We share that exact same belief in convergence by the way. And we've closed those transactions at premium multiples, highlighting the big disconnect between public and private valuations.In markets like Belgium, we acquired MVNO, and are thriving with Fixed Mobile Convergence in that country. And in Holland we joined forces with Vodafone in a 50/50 joint venture to create what is now the fastest growing and most important mobile broadband and entertainment provider in the market.This deal follows that path. By combining O2, the largest and most reliable and admired mobile operator, together with Virgin Media, the country's fastest broadband network and most complete and innovative video platform is a powerhouse combination.First, it gives us the scale to invest competently in gigabit broadband and 5G right when it matters most. That's now. And second, with the best network infrastructure, market-leading positions and world-class brands, we'll have the strength to compete aggressively for customers.And third, of course, the combination delivers significant synergies that will accelerate operating cash flow and free cash flow. Now, we know the playbook well, as we've executed on it many times. It's also a strong statement by both Liberty and Telefonica that we believe in the UK, and are right behind the government's desire to bring next generation connectivity to consumers and businesses as fast as possible.So let's dig in a bit on the transaction itself on Slide 6. There's plenty of detail here, so I'll try to hit the key points. The main deal points are in the left hand side of the slide. This will be a 50/50 JV in all respects. Obviously, we have experience with this structure in Holland and we know can work well.It feels like a very good fit with Telefonica. We have similar values, comparable operating goals and strong leadership on the ground. The economics of the deal are derived from relative valuations at the formation of the JV. You've all seen this equation before.In this case, we value Virgin at a total enterprise value of GBP18.7 billion, resulting in an equity value of GBP7.4 billion, that's assuming, of course, GBP11.3 billion of debt is transferred into the JV. O2 was valued at GBP12.7 billion and will be transferred in debt-free, but with some working capital and debt-like items. So to equalize the ownership, Telefonica need to receive a payment from us of about GBP2.5 billion and that's based on 12 to 131 numbers. That's just math.And the math could change as debt and debt-like items evolve between now and closing, but we expect it to be largely the same, perhaps maybe even -- the payment could be a bit lower. Just the O2 business is largely unlevered. We do intend to recapitalize the JV with about GBP18 billion of total debt, which means each partner will receive recap proceeds on or before closing of approximately GBP3 billion that covers more than our portion of the equalization payment. And that to recap in Virgin Media, Ireland, which will stay outside of the JV, we should end up with net cash proceeds of about GBP1.4 billion or $1.75 billion.It's worth pointing out that this is also a delevering event for our business, which will go from 5.5 times to 5 times leverage in UK. Transactions is obviously subject to regulatory approval, which we anticipate will be reviewed at CMA and should be closed hopefully by the middle of next year, if not sooner.And moving to the right hand side of the chart. The rationale for this combination from our perspective is very compelling. I've covered some of those points already. We're creating a clear convergence champion in our largest market and one of Europe's most attractive. But the transaction also creates real value for shareholders. We've argued for quite some time that our stock doesn't reflect any equity value for Virgin Media. Clearly, this deal changes that debate. And with an implied multiple of 9.3 times in 2019 OCF were 25 times 2019 operating free cash, flow and there is substantial equity value in our UK business, even before net cash proceeds or synergies.Now, as you've read, the synergies are currently valued at an NPV of GBP6.2 billion as reflecting run rate benefits of around GBP540 million per year. It's worth pointing out that, that compares really favorably the other fixed mobile convergence deals we've been associated with it. In fact, it's on the lower end as a percent of the combined costs. Of course, we have a very strong track record of executing and over delivering on synergies, so hopefully that number should be good.On the bottom right, we present some financial metrics you can see that the two businesses together generated GBP11 billion in revenue in 2019 and GBP3.7 billion of OCF or EBITDA. That's before intercompany service charges in the JV structure.And like our Dutch operation, we expected JV to generate significant distributable free cash flow, and then we should benefit from recap and through the dividends down the road. This is, of course, one of many, but a significant driver of the deal for us.Now, Slide 7, just provide some additional background on the combined group. I've already referenced the JVs best-in-class fixed broadband mobile infrastructure. I think the key point here is that this deal will undoubtedly enhanced our confidence and strategic positioning when it comes to expanding our network leadership in the market. O2 has already rolled out 5G to 30 communities, and Virgin has already rolled out gigabit speeds, 2 million homes with the rest of our footprint ready to roll.We know that when the power of 5G meet 1-gig broadband, there is no looking back. And both we and Telefonica see eye-to-eye on the infrastructure network opportunity here. On a whole host of levels, O2 is an ideal partner for Virgin Media. They're extremely well placed in the mobile market with the lowest back book, front book exposure, the lowest market churn, and very high NPS. We've done some of our own research, which confirmed what we knew that both brands have strong customer appeal. What we didn't realize was that the appeal grows even stronger, when the brands are considered together. And that's a great starting point of fixed mobile convergence, as are these other data points, 8 out of 10 Virgin customers use someone else's mobile service today, which provides a huge pool for cross selling O2 to mobile service.Even more compelling research show that 50% of O2 customers that don't have Virgin broadband, are more interested in adopting a converged product, an O2 or Virgin than they would be from another broadband provider. So the fundamentals are here, are very prosperous partnership and we're excited to get started. And after big transaction like this always good to step back and reflect on the composition of our business and assets. And the value creation strategy we're focused on.You'll see that on Slide 8, which shows our major operating businesses laid out along with other assets. And I'll provide just a few quick observations here. Number 1, we have significant scale across Europe. These operations together will serve 80 million fixed and mobile subs, and what we believe are the best European markets. Together, they represent over GBP24 billion in revenue that's taking the JV revenue plus our consolidated revenue, and over GBP8 billion of operating cash flow calculated on this new basis with significant levered free cash flow generation.The second big takeaway is that our three largest assets are or will be less than 100% owned. As much as anything that's a function of European market today, which is rapidly consolidating to drive scale and generate the synergies. Sometimes you need partners and we're certainly willing to join forces to create that value. Sometimes it's public shareholders partnering with. Sometimes it's a strategic operator. So long as there's scope for liquidity and transparency on value we're satisfied.The third point is that the value creation strategy is largely the same across the footprint. We're building national FMC champions, partially because many incumbents are vulnerable underinvested or late to the game, but also because governments and regulators want scale driven challengers. They know that consumers and businesses win when there's infrastructure-based competition. And that's been our mantra for decades, and it's just true today as it ever was.Going forward, the focus is on free cash flow. It has always been one of the most -- if not the most important metrics of our business. Now with revenue and OCF growth flattening in a more mature telecom landscape, it becomes even more important. And it's particularly coveted among European investors just look at where Telenet trade today, for example. So not surprisingly, we will examine the potential for public market listings where and when that may makes sense.At the group level, we continue to have significant liquidity in excess of $10 billion, even before this transaction closes. And of course, none of us predicted this crisis. But what we certainly feel now is fortunate to have the capital to both pursue these types of deals and fundamental FMC strategies in core markets tend to be opportunistic, which we will be. That includes our time honored strategy of driving a levered equity capital structure and, of course, share buybacks as and when appropriate.I'm using this chart as a reference, but there are many ways to look at the valuation of our group. We're not trying to be prescriptive here. But more than a few investors have asked us to put forward a simple sum of the parts analysis that shows the value gap we talked about. This is always a debate with the lawyers and the IR folks, but we've tried to provide a reasonably complete and hopefully simple version of that on Slide 9. I'll try to break this down, and of course, we're happy to take questions.The first two building blocks of value are our cash balance at Q1 and the value of our publically traded shares in Telenet. Together, those numbers add up to about $16 per share. Again, that's just an objective number. We don't assign a specific value to our interest in Holland and Switzerland on this page. But we do provide the necessary metrics for others to do that pretty easily. You can choose your methodology. There are plenty of comparables to measure against.But we think if you can get the $5 to $7 per share pretty easily for our interest in these two markets, that's supported by a 14 multiple on OFCF at the low end and 10% free cash flow yield on the high end. And if you were to use Telenet's multiple OCF, you get somewhere in the middle. So again, many will find their own numbers here. What are -- the point, though, is that our current trading levels, around $21 plus my analysts have pointed out that you could arrive at that price. On these three numbers alone cash plus Telenet stock plus our interest in Holland and Switzerland. In other words, the UK was and perhaps still it being assigned zero equity value in our share price.The left hand side of this chart, we addressed that point, and showing with just one way to look at the implied value of the transaction that we just announced. There are three simple elements here: number 1 is the expected net proceeds of $1.75 billion, which equates to roughly $3 per share; then you have our 50% of the estimated synergies, which adds up to about $6 per share; and finally, there is an implied transaction value for the underlying Virgin Media business when we combine. And we had O2 agreed, as I just mentioned, GBP18.7 billion, which after debt represents an implied value for the equity today of around $14 per share of Liberty Global.If you add all that up, you get to about $23 per share. And that's just on the UK business. And we understand that everyone will have a different view, a different valuation approach. And in particular, some might argue that the implied value of Virgin in the deal and then the combination is a challenging one or not acceptable. We don't agree with that, of course. But if you want to haircut the deal multiple by 20%, and put it us in the mid-7s. You still get the $16 per share with the entire transaction. It's hard to argue that we don't have a considerable value gap here. And I think, you're all capable of doing the math on your own.And we just wanted to give you those components and hopefully clarify what we've been talking about for some time. And one more slide here in Virgin Media to help round out the operating update, and then pass it to Charlie.And as you'll say, there are more operating update slides like this in the back for other assets. But you see that we're trying to focus here on the data that we believe is most important for tracking progress in our core market, namely, winning and retaining customers across our fixed mobile B2B business; secondly, growing ARPU, the up-sell and cross-sell; and third, driving fixed mobile convergence.We're also focused, of course, on extending our network reach and speed leadership, and driving cost efficiencies. In fact, on the cost efficiency side, we've been forced to accelerate some of the transformation in our care and sales capabilities, to be more digital to operate more efficiently and that's going to pay dividends on the other side. And there are a few good visuals in the middle two columns here. You'll see firstly, that Virgin Media's customer base has been largely stable just under 6 million.In fact, the number is only moved about 20,000 customers in five quarters. Yes, as we show the customer gains we pick up in lightning or often offset by the customer losses in the BAU footprint, but the numbers are not significant in either direction. You can also see a strong customer ARPU trend in the last five quarters, with 1.2% growth year-over-year in the first quarter. And this has driven larger than price increases and against cross-sell and up-sell, but also underpinned by product innovation, and improved base management.We are continually seeking to enhance the value for money proposition for customers in this market with things like our next gen V6 set-top box and broadband speed. In fact, in the past quarter we boosted over 1 million customers to 100 megabit broadband speeds bringing our average speed across our base, average speed to 140 megabit. Just by reference for reference purposes. The rest of the UK market is averaging consumer speeds of 30 megabits a second. So we are -- our average Virgin customer is getting broadband speeds 4 to 5 times faster than the rest of the market.As we pointed out, often 95% of that UK network is already won't get ready. And we've launched those speeds across major towns in the 30% of the footprint. I put us on track for networkwide coverage of 1 gig in 2021 delivering 50% of the government's national gigabit ambition four years early. I think there's an offset there. Now Lutz and the team have also been -- already focusing on cross selling to mobile -- mobile into the fixed base following the launch of convergence bundles about a year ago.And the Q1 postpaid net ads were good at 72,000. So fixed mobile convergence is already working at Virgin, we're at 22%. Fixed mobile convergence ratio with plenty of runway. Remember, Telenet, VodafoneZiggo are in the mid-40. So, as we all know, fixed mobile convergence drives higher NPS and lower churn as the fundamental rationale for the deal we announced today. So it all knows and good start to the year for Virgin Media even in light of the pandemic. OFCF margins are strong at 23% before lightning and 17% after, our SOHO customer base grow 7%.And the team is managing through the headwinds we identified at the beginning of the year, the increase in network taxes and the contract notification programming costs, we've been managing through those very, very well. In fact, NPS is up, there's no return is down. I think the group is really well positioned to come out of this COVID period very, very strong. So and that's for me.I'll pass it over to Charlie, and then we look forward to getting your questions. Charlie? -- Thanks, Mike. And now I'm on Page 12, divisional overview, Mike has given you the key operational highlights of Virgin Media. And in the appendix, we've included similar pages, showing the key operational drivers for our other major fixed mobile convergence businesses. In the interest of time, we're not going to review these pages in our remarks today, but please do contact the IR team if you want to discuss them further.On this page, we set out the key financial metrics, which we were using to assess the performance of these national FMC champions. Our focus continues to be to drive OFCF or OCF minus accrued capex, and free cash flow as these markets mature in terms of broadband penetration.Now for reference, we've also included a page in the appendix setting out our view of 2019 free cash flow for each of our divisions after the allocation of interest and the central technology and innovation capex. But for the quarter on this slide, I will focus on the underlying OFCF trends year-on-year, revenue in the UK anonymous slightly down 0.6%, but OCF declined 3.5%, OFCF before Lightning Construction capex increased $18 million to $372 million for the quarter.We increased our investments in Lightning compared to 2019 Q1 and spent $99 million, with 93,000 homes released during the quarter. Revenue growth in Belgium was slightly down at 0.4%, OCF up 0.6% and year-on-year OFCF down $10 million to $187 million. As John already explained in the Telenet earnings call, there was an acceleration of prepaid sports rights costs, and some front loading capex in Q1, which contributed to this year-on-year OFCF decline.But for the full year, confirmed that, excluding the effects of the lockdowns in the second half of the year, they expect to deliver full year rebased OFCF growth of 1% to 2% on an IFRS basis and adjusted free cash flow the lower end of the previous GBP415 million to GBP430 million guidance range. This assumes that they will gradually exit the lockdown starting in May, with a gradual economic recovery thereafter.In Switzerland, UPC was caught up in the continuing price competition in that market, which resulted in an accelerated decline in consumer and SOHO customer ARPU. This contributed to 2.7% decline in revenue. They also had an acceleration in prepaid sports rights cost in the quarter, as well as accelerated spending capex contributing to a lower OFCF of $55 million. However, based on current expectations around the impact of COVID. We expect cash generation to improve and the company remains on track to produce around $170 million of free cash flow for the full year, which includes central opex and capex allocations.In Holland, VodafoneZiggo had a very strong quarter with revenue growth of 3.3%, OCF growth of 4.9% and OFCF of $258 million, as they outperformed our expectations in virtually every operating metric, showing the strength of these converged national FMC champions.They're now expecting stable to modest rebased OCF growth for full year. And have maintained their original free cash flow guidance of GDP400 million to GDP500 million and potential cash for shareholders distributions. Now, again, this assumes no further deteriorations as a result of COVID.On the page entitled Group Overview, we set out the key financial metrics for the group as a whole. Revenue declined 0.3% for the quarter, an improvement over the declines from the previous four quarters, despite the impact of COVID-19. OCF growth also improved compared to the last three quarters of 2019, a minus 3.6% in line with our pre-covered expectations.OFCF continue to improve and excluding Lightning Construction capex was $593 million for the quarter, up from $569 million a year ago. The continuing reduction in capex intensity contributed this. And capex as a percentage of sales prior to Lightning Construction capex at 19.4%, lower than the previous four quarters.Liquidity remains extremely strong. Cash, including our $2 billion investments in separately managed accounts was $7.4 billion. Now, as many of you know, our SMAs are invested in low-risk liquid investments. Both our SMAs and money market accounts are now largely invested in government securities, as opposed to AAA funds, which will lead to a reduction in interest income going forward, but ensure maximum security for the cash.For the available revolving credit facilities in our operating companies, the group as a whole has $10.3 billion of liquidity. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 5.2 times growth and 3.7 times net EBITDA. The cost of debt continues to decline as we continued our refinancing program during Q1 and now stands at 4.1% with an average life in excess of seven years.On the page titled adjusted free cash flow, we lay out the key components of free cash flow. Q1 OFCF before Lightning Construction capex was $595 million, and our net interest for the quarter was $579 million. We make virtually all our interest payments in Q1 and Q3. So this phasing is in line with our expectations.Cash tax was positive for the quarter of $5 million. And we expect the full year 2020 figure to be lower than the full year 2019 figure of $358 million, partly due to reduced U.S. tax payments. The distributions in the JV in Holland were $11 million for the quarter, but we continue to expect full-year distributions of GBP200 million to GBP250 million, in line with VodafoneZiggo's recent guidance.And as is typically the case in Q1, working capital was negative at $250 million, largely due to the phasing of vendor financing program. And as in 2019, we continue to target broadly flat net working capital flows to the year.Adjusted free cash flow before Lightning Construction capex was negative $218 million for the quarter and negative $317 million after construction capex, which again was in line with our expectations.Turning to the outlook for the full year, we're still assessing the medium-term impact from COVID-19. And we'll give investors a further update in Q2. Despite the impact of COVID, we continue to be encouraged by our operating prospects. And unless there's another step change in the macroeconomic environment, we don't see a need to change or suspend our original full-year guidance as detailed on the slide.And note that our current assumption is that lockdowns are lifted from Q2 followed by a gradual economic recovery. And also that our original $1 billion free cash flow guidance was based on exchange rates of EUR1.13 to $1, and $1.33, GBP1. Although we don't guide on rebased revenue growth, we do expect negative impacts to revenue from reduced handset sales, and premium video, particularly sports.But both of these are relatively low-margin and have a limited impact on cash flow. We will continue to monitor the impact of the crisis on these forecasts and update you further in Q2. And so with that, I'll turn it back to the operator. And in order to address everyone's questions, we would kindly ask if you would keep to one question each.The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to our first caller. -- Yeah, hi. -- Who it is? -- Robert Grindle, it's Robert from Deutsche Bank. Hi, there. -- Hey, Robert. -- Yeah. So one question, so I'd like to ask about the JV structure and why you chose that rather than, say, a majority stake. Is this the only game in town? Or was it as you mentioned about confirming a positive equity value for VMED? Was the JV structure also interesting, given your thinking about an extended fiber builds program? Obviously, chest got a lot of fiber experience. Is that something you are aligned on? Thank you. -- Okay, that's three questions. Let me see if I can jump into those. There's always multiple ways to approach a transaction like this or a strategic move like this. But this felt to us like the best outcome and the best partner for all kinds of reasons. And I've talked about those in the remarks I just made, so you've heard that.And we're comfortable, as I mentioned, with these structures. We have experience with them. It's worked exceedingly well in Holland with Vodafone, who's been a great partner. And so, this was the transaction that was presented to us or that we also went out and sought, and the one we think will be most accretive and most advantageous.So, sure, there's always a different ways to do it. It had nothing to do with what you're describing. And then the value, the value once you decide how you're going to approach a partnership, then you agree on values, not the other way around. I don't think it was driven by value. It wasn't driven by anything other than that. It wasn't obviously the only game in town.There are multiple mobile operators in this market without fixed infrastructure. So clearly, there were other options. But again, as I said, we felt this was the best option. And credit to Telefonica for also being quite interested and focused on this. And I think it is the best fit. It doesn't change anything with respect to our -- the level of excitement we have around Project Lightning or network extension in the market. It takes nothing off the table.In fact, I would argue and I think Telefonica would agree, this increases our confidence level, in looking at a national scope, or extending convergence, best-in-class network. How you achieve that? How we finance that? And how aggressive we are, that is all to be determined. But I think the main takeaway is it doesn't change our level of excitement. It takes nothing off the table. I would say it only enhances our ability to be strategic and financially aggressive, and it makes sense, in terms of looking at our network and the opportunities that we've discussed historically. -- Okay. And thanks.We'll go next to Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research. -- Good morning. How are we -- hi, how reasonable of comp is your operating strategy, synergy upside, I mean, I think obviously leverage levels at VodafoneZiggo, that JV, so what you sort of expect from this deal? And then, if I could sneak one in about the back-book repricing in UK, and how that's going relative to your expectations? Thanks. -- Okay. Lutz, you can prepare for the back-book repricing issue. The Punch-line is, are in line. But there are lots of things that are similar in this transaction to the VodafoneZiggo transaction. Obviously, the structure itself, there are often many -- big differences too, of course, in terms of the size of the market and the competitive landscape that we find ourselves in.On the other hand, it is a similar playbook for us. And it's one we're quite familiar with. So our approach to synergies, our approach to integration, our approach to strategy to drive revenue and convergence are quite similar. And it wouldn't surprise us if down the road these two companies together are achieving similar outcomes.It's possible here we might even exceed the convergence levels that we see today. In Holland, which are mid-40s. It could be even higher in this market. A lot of it has to do with what -- how the market evolves generally and how competitors react over time. I don't believe there'll be any reaction that's worthy of discussion in the short term or even in immediate term perhaps. But how the market evolves over the longer term is what's critical.I'd simply say, when we put the business plan together, at least from our perspective, we were very conservative about the stand-alone mobile business and the challenges that it might face. And we think we were very appropriately conservative about our own business, just to be, thoughtful and not too ambitious.And I think when you put those two businesses together as you drive synergies through that that business plan. It is very accretive and quite attractive, and that obviously drove the transaction. So I think with very conservative assumptions on either business, with the synergies, which I think, as you point out, are probably conservative.Certainly, it's one of the lowest, if not, the lowest percentage we've seen in eight countries or seven countries we've been involved in FMC transactions now. But there's good reason for that. This transaction came together relatively quickly. We wanted to be thoughtful and not over promise. We've never missed a synergy budget. You would know that, Jeff, or synergy target, in fact I think almost in every case. We've exceeded our synergy budget and targets. So this should be the same. -- On end of contract verification, so we have it out in the market since February, the 10th. The churn level is exactly what we have planned for. How many customers are calling in and how many customers decide to leave us. And then, the second lever is how much discount do you offer to keep the customer connected.And the discount we have offered so far, it's only one-third of what we have planned for. So therefore, it is altogether slightly better than we have expected. But the caveat to that is that we are only six weeks into it in that quarter, and also that was precluded. And that might change, so therefore we stayed cautious. But I have to say, although the market was pretty competitive in March and in February, we are doing slightly better than expected. -- Thank you.We'll go next to David Wright with Bank of America. -- Thank you, guys, for taking the call. And, Mike, if I could maybe express some gratitude, I guess, more generally for the salary sacrifices etc in light of COVID. My question is just on the UK joint venture and spectrum costs. There is a UK spectrum auction forecast, which probably should be this year, could be next year. Should we expect in the event of any delays that, that is cost that Telefonica will bear, or is there a risk that that could drop into the JV? Thank you. -- Thanks very much, David. I believe the press release referenced this, but you might not have a chance to review, get through it or seen it. But the basic deal is that Telefonica will bring to the JV the spectrum that we both believe is necessary to achieve the plan at their cost. So that was the arrangement that we reached early on. And that so they'll deliver to the JV at their cost the spectrum when that auction occurs.Obviously, we have not been able to discuss spectrum with them in any detail. It's a very complicated and has to be quite careful. So we don't know what they're doing. We don't have any real understanding of what they may do. But whatever they end up with it'll be at their cost. -- Mike, just maybe extending on your comment on Lightning, and you've been very vocal with perceived on the valuation of Lightning, you stripped it out, etc. It's kind of dropping in at 10 times EBITDA into this deal. How did you kind of think about valuing Lightning independently as the kind of steady-state VMED cable infrastructure? -- Yeah, good question. Look, I think we each had some assets on the -- on each side of the deal that we could have argued for different values. But they have their tower interests in UK, which they thought at one point maybe it would be better outside of JV we had the Lightning transaction. But we both agreed that this is going to be a long-term partnership, that we should be doing things inside the partnership that makes perfect strategic sense and operational sense and financial sense.So let's just say that, the valuation was considered, but we didn't get into that kind of granularity, when it came to -- this is always negotiation, in terms of identifying exactly what Lightning reference includes or doesn't include. Then we didn't do this, we did -- probably approached it similarly on their tower footprint. -- Very useful. Thank you.We'll go next to Michael Bishop with Goldman Sachs. -- Yes. Thanks. Just both two very quick questions. Firstly, you're now effectively sitting on a large cash balance, and given this deal, I guess isn't consuming any of your cash. I'd just love to hear your latest thoughts on how you think about managing that cash balance effectively with this transaction, not consuming cash?And then super quickly, could I just follow-up on the last question? Clearly, you've been clear that Lightning is going into the JV. But I'm just going to ask as a follow-up on the other fiber company that you've set up, just I noticed that the $10 billion of capex over the next five years commitment doesn't really implicitly assume at least on my numbers that necessarily announcing anything with regards to the 7 million extra homes you've identified and also the fiber joint venture and those discussions. So any update there would be great. Thanks. -- Sure. On the second point, yes, anything we pursue or anything they pursue that would normally be considered a JV activity, is likely going to be a JV activity. So Liberty fibers, as you described, it is certainly something we would pursue through the joint venture. And I think, as Jose Maria said on his call, these are the issues that we'll address together in terms of pace, and speed, and financing structure and opportunity.In the meantime, we'll continue with Lightning. In fact, we think we might exceed our budget on Lightning. We can, of course, choose to spend more or less between now and closing. It just works out in working capital. But I think for the most part, you should assume that the JV will jointly address these strategic opportunities. And capital will come from both parties as a result of that.On the cash balance, I think we'll remain disciplined as we have remained discipline. As I said, nobody anticipated this environment. We always said you never know what the future is going to bring. And this was not something any of us hoped for. And on the other hand, we're thankful to be liquid and we're thankful to have cash. And we'll remain disciplined on how we deploy the cash.As I said, and have said, the first order of business is our core markets, and where we know and we already operate, that will remain the case. Secondly, we'll look within the region we operate in, would be look for opportunities for consolidation or other similar convergence strategies, I would say. We have as we've talked many times, it's Ventures portfolio, not big, maybe $1 billion of interest in existing assets that we own in tech and content.And, so we'll be careful and thoughtful about opportunities to build new revenue streams, new investment portfolios and new business opportunities. But I think we'll do that carefully and with great transparency, and probably wouldn't require the kind of capital that we have. So this is a good problem to have. It's a good question to be focused on for us. But it's not something we can give you any more clarity on that as we sit here today, Michael, but stay tuned. -- Thanks a lot. -- Now, of course, I didn't mention in that what we have used historically our excess capital for and that is these buybacks. I did mention in my remarks is that -- it's always on the list for our levered equity growth strategy. As we start to drive free cash flow and free cash flow per share, clearly, that's an accelerator of free cash flow per share. But, again, we're not being -- on this call, we're not going to be -- I couldn't give you any details about that. Obviously, we'll let you know.By the way, I know we've probably got a lot of questions. So just for everybody's benefit, our remarks went a bit longer, we're going to keep the line open. I'm sure you've got plenty of calls to get on to. And but I think we'll probably try to keep the line open for 10 to 15 minutes to be sure we get to a few more questions, since we were a bit longer in our remark today. So go ahead, operator.Yes, we'll go next to Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. -- Thanks. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Mike. -- Hi, Ben. -- I wanted to -- assuming you are somewhere where -- it's morning, OK, it may not be the case, but wanted to ask about tax implications of all this. I think you guys announced you're moving effectively all the UK tax allowances etc into the JV. You guys, I think originally reincorporated over in the UK at least partly for the tax benefits, and just wondering how that -- what the tax structure and tax leakage if anything of the JV will look like? I'm assuming that will be not much anytime soon and then implications if any for the consolidated operations, Switzerland, Benelux, etc, in terms of cash taxes as a result of this deal. -- Okay. There's no implications to other assets. The UK tax losses have always been largely ring fenced within the UK and only usable on a UK entity. So it's no implications at all for the other operations. I'll simply say on a tax structure won't be surprising to you, I think, it's quite efficient. We don't -- without getting into great detail, there shouldn't be any tax implications on formation of the joint venture. The losses that exist will be transferred and, to the best of our ability used by the JV. There are some -- as ever some nuances there. But for the most part, it's a very tax efficient transaction really for both parties and certainly for us, and we're not -- we don't see any leakage of the kind you described. -- Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on Virgin, maybe for Lutz, if he's on. What's the pricing environment look like at this point, obviously, you've got a lot of stress in the economy. Just wondering from a competition point of view of things has continued to be as tough as they've been, or if we've seen -- if you've seen any of your -- of the operators you compete with get a little more rational, so to speak, given just the focus on the macro and pressures on things like liquidity, etc? -- Lutz, go ahead. -- So -- yeah, so I think in February and March and maybe because of the start of end-of-contract notification. I would say that the market was even a bit more competitive. So when you compare the deepness of discount to a year ago, discounts were 5% to 10% deeper. And then now after COVID, obviously, right sales are down, and in fact, not so much. So we are still operating on 80% sales level, and churn went down dramatically. But in this environment, obviously, you're less aggressive in terms of promotion. And so I would say it was a bit more aggressive and we kept our strategy right. So you see that we kept our customers flat, we are looking to create a really customer relationship with high value customers. We were not looking for the low end in the broadband. We were not looking for the low end in the video. And so therefore the service revenue out of that was 0.8% and the ARPU grew to 1.2%. And this is exactly on our strategy. -- Thank you.We'll go next to Vijay Jayant with Evercore. -- Hi, Mike. I just wanted to understand, obviously, the structure now that most of your values are in JVs in the UK and Holland pro forma for this transaction. And about $1 billion of EBITDA on the remaining consolidated assets. How -- in terms of transparency and value recognition, obviously, you will make a case for that in today's presentation. How are we going to sort of track the performance of the JVs? And are you -- regarding the risk of getting sort of a discount, because most values are an equity stakes. And have you thought about, tracking stock or any structures that can show the value of those assets that you don't sort of see on a consolidated basis? -- Yeah, good question. We did try to address it a bit in the remarks, but it's worth repeating, that this does change, it takes our largest consolidated business and puts it into a JV. And so that does obviously have accounting and consolidation implications. However, because it's our largest business, we will report quite extensively on the business. And so, I don't see any reduction in transparency around the core operating companies. So firstly, I would say you get, you should be able to see through the structures and we will endeavor to report on the businesses in much the same way with arguably as much in more detail.So I think, we'll be focused on transparency for investors on the actual operating businesses, how they're performing, and we're quite engaged, of course, in all of these, and how they do. So that's point 1.Point 2, Virgin wasn't a public company when it was 100% owned. Virgin, O2, whatever name it maybe, is -- won't be a public company, when we started JV. But down the roads, there could be opportunities in that said to create public listings are or structures that, that identify and isolate value and I think show value more, more creatively and more effectively. Nothing's off the table, I mean, and we retained -- as we would expect, we did retain the ability to perhaps create trackers or things of that nature.So in the Liberty tradition, all options are available to us to ensure we're getting transparent value. But we'll be thoughtful about that over time. It is the right point, which is why we spend a few more minutes than we normally would on structure and value creation. And holding company discounts, that's your expertise. I don't think so, I would argue for it, obviously. But we certainly can't -- at this point in time, we would take a holding company discount if somebody valued the stock correctly. So I think it's all relative, and we'll have to see how we go. -- Thank you. -- You bet.We'll go next to Polo Tang with UBS. -- Yeah, hi. I just have one question, and that is does the deal with O2 preclude doing a cable wholesale deal, or a fiber JV with Sky? Or is this just not a priority at the moment? Thanks. -- Well, thanks, Polo. As I said at the beginning of the Q&A, nothing's off the table. So I think the direct answer is, no. We don't believe that this transaction either as it's pending or when closed, creates any obstacles to smart opportunity. I'm not going to comment on that one specifically, I'll simply say that it doesn't take anything off the table legally, structurally, we don't believe from a regulatory point of view. So there would be -- all the conversations that we were having and all the ideas that we were discussing, I think remain and can be executed on if they make sense. So that goes for the Lightning build out. That goes for strategic partnerships with other operators if they make sense that goes for all the kind of things that we know can be accretive and strategically valuable for the group. We still believe can be evaluated and considered. -- And I'll just clarify that on the timing for the deal -- can I just clarify the timing of the deal more now than given COVID-19 situation, something changed on your part, in terms of what spurred the move now to that deal? Or was there a change on this point? Can you maybe give some color? -- Yeah, as you would imagine, this didn't come -- I mean, the crisis that we're all facing now and with the pandemic, obviously, is somewhat recent. This is -- these are conversations that go back some time. So, as discussions and negotiations have momentum, you keep the momentum. I would say definitely, that we didn't see anything in the current environment that suggested we shouldn't continue with this opportunity, as opposed to the environment, stimulating the opportunity, it's the other way around. It's an opportunity there was always there. And we didn't do anything that created an obstacle or that should slow it down. So it's really nothing to do with the current environment. It's just the timing is coincidental. -- Thanks. -- Yeah.We'll go next to Nick Lyall with SocGen. -- Good afternoon, Mike, Charlie. And it's just a very quick one, maybe on the Swiss prices, please. They seem pretty -- the ARPU seem pretty weak this quarter. Is that just a COVID impact, maybe with some sports and PayTV items there? Is that something we should expect sort of for the rest of the year, it's in pretty structural pricing pressure points? -- I don't know, if Baptiest is on the call. -- Yes, I'm in. -- Yeah. You want to address that quickly. Baptiest Coopmans is the current CEO of Swiss business. Do you want to address that? -- Yeah. I am in Switzerland since February 1. So the market stays competitive, and we try to find the right balance between volume and value there. And that's the answer, and I think Charlie was very clear. We think we will have a $170 million cash flow out of this business this year. And the underlying trends are all improving. All-time high customer satisfaction now, company is doing very well through COVIDs. So in that sense, the next quarter you will see that. And on top of that we had a major simplification program launch that will kick in the coming quarters. -- Thanks very much.We'll go next to Christian Fangmann with HSBC. -- Yeah. Hi, guys. Quick one. I was not reading anything in the press release? Is there actually a break fee agreed, and then how about the brands? What are you planning to use in terms of -- are we seeing something similar like at VodafoneZiggo? -- No, no disclosure on the brands. This is -- it's too early to have any discussions about that or even any agreements about that. So the brands will be determined down the road, when companies actually do come together and there's a management team and we can have a thoughtful conversation about it, so business as usual for now and no update on brand. I'll simply say, we think both brands are really strong and complimentary. And that's a good thing going into it. No break fee disclosed, and no break fee agreed. -- Okay. That's very clear. Thanks. -- Yeah.We'll go next to Steve Malcolm with Redburn. -- Thanks, guys. Good afternoon and Good morning. I'll go -- give me answer one-to-one, that's fine. Just going back to the contractual situation. Can you just sort of shed me light on any MAC clauses in there? I mean, obviously, you're talking about backward looking leverage and tends to expect UK, yes, down this year. If combined EBITDA were 10%, 20% lower and leverage is in the mid-5.5%. Do you have like surface to go back and look at the overall debt in the JV, when it closes.And maybe just a quick one on the contractual position of your major content providers in the UK, BT and Sky. I take the point that your sports revenues are zero margin, but that doesn't mean that couldn't be negative margin, if you're not collecting revenues, you have to pay for them. So are you able to get relief on those sports right? While you're not filling your customers? Maybe any help on that, that would be helpful, would be great. Thank you. -- Okay. Yeah, these can go to the sports issues, your answer is yes. I think that the agreement or the release, I think, it was clear. The expectation is that we'll have leverage in 4 to 5 times range, which will be closer to the high end of that range. When we close and we expect that to be the case the market, today, it's not necessarily the ideal moment to get all of the financing lined up. Normally, we would announce and conclude all the financing before even signing a transaction. But we felt like to be -- to optimize cost capital in the optimized structure, there's no reason to do it all right now. But the gap of what remains is quite small. I think, Charlie, it's only a couple billion pounds really that isn't yet raised or ready to be transferred over, I think that's the more or less. So at best, the number more or less. So there's not -- the financing condition is not a particularly important on mobile, at this stage.Lutz, you want to address the sports issue? -- Yes. On the spot issue, so we have been following exactly what client and BT has offered their customer. So simply pause the sport contract packages if the customer wants you to, and therefore we are also in a position with those not to pay for those customers just decided to pause their packages with us. And therefore, that is not margin neutral to us. -- Okay. So you are able to -- yeah, BT and Sky have agree for you not to pay the wholesale cost for that period of time. -- Exactly. I mean, we -- obviously, you have to come to an agreement and we are in the middle of that, but that as we understand. We got this 4%. And also when you read our contract, it's pretty much like that. -- Okay. I'm sorry. If I just come back to the first question, and if EBITDA were significantly lower, is that $18 billion of debt? Or would you review it at that point? -- Well, I think the partners can always agreed to review it. Obviously, we reserve that option. But I think I don't believe in Charlie jump in here, right. We don't see any impediments to achieving that level of debt between now and closing, which is one that would likely occur. It's probably on the shorter end of that. Charlie, do you want to go with that? -- And Steve, we've gone through what's called [Technical Issues] his team and Telefonica. So we're pretty comfortable that we have built into the full cost very significant. Actually with that we were attracted you pursue very kind of resilient businesses, [Technical Issues] have done, it. It's still trading on pretty well. So I'm very, very confident. And this get the remaining couple of billion done, remember, the debt we have today are on created assets, we come across the 11 plus million. So it's already [Technical Issues] -- I'm not questioning that you can get the debt. I'm just questioning whether it's the right level of debt as EBITDA was a lot lower? -- Steve, one thing I would say that expenses are very, very [Technical Issues] which is I think as Mike indicated, there might be a little conservative. Like gives a lot more creditworthiness to work as combined than just two standup companies. So we'll see, but I think [Technical Issues] and we have to find out based on what we know today, I think. -- Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.We'll go next to James Ratzer with New Street Research. -- Yes. Thank you very much, everybody. And my continued congrats on the deal. I think the question I had today probably more for Lutz, actually, just on the UK performance, which looked pretty encouraging this quarter. I was just interested in kind of two specific areas. I mean, one, with all the extra home working going on, are you seeing signs that customers are actually upgrading their broadband packages as a result, and how supportive is that to your ARPU trend?And secondly, I mean, to what extent have you been benefiting, we simply from being able to do extra customer installs, as I understand open reach has been more limited in being able to do that. How much of a boost is that providing to the current numbers? Thank you. -- Yeah. So on the home working, I mean, in general 95% of our customers have 100 MB speed or more, right. As Mike said earlier on our average speed is 140 meg. So therefore, our customers do operate already on a very -- our consumer customers to operate on an already on its very high speed. And so therefore, we don't see additional demand on top of that currency and the consumer space. On the B2B space, we see that we have further demand, higher speed packages, working from home packages for some of our customers. So that is encouraging.And in terms of net ads, you're right, I would say, currently we are net benefiter. So what do I mean that our sales are still at 80%. And it's only online, but it's remarkable. It's obviously a more connectivity focus. So less demand on video, more on broadband, fixed broadband. And also our churn is restored now. And I think this is because of two things. One, simply you don't want to change the system, while you're so reliant on it. And second, obviously, in the market, you cannot be assured if it's a manual install, with competition that you get actually installed, why we keep on doing the manual install as well. So therefore, you're right, currently, we are growing a bit our customer base because of that.But as you said also Q1, we kept the customer base platform. So we cannot count our strategy just on the weakness of a competitor. So we can expect from us further initiatives to keep or grow our customer base. -- Great. Thank you.We'll go next to Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark. -- Thank you. I realized that over the top this question is, I think you did the right thing from a derisking and liquidity enhancement advantage point in this environment. But as an extension of the Robert Grindle question. I mean, you and John alone really have the opportunity to kind of be the ultimate, I guess, Angle, Cable Cowboys. If you had turned around and bought all of O2, and equally have the financial wherewithal to do that GBP12.7 billion enterprise value and now get seen GBP6.7 billion in synergies over a 5-year time. And so really wanted to get Machiavelli as this develops over time, he really would have had some opportunities for some very accretive stock buybacks, for obvious reasons. Is that something you ever would have looked at? I mean, you wouldn't have less complexity, I guess, in terms of financial engineering, but probably an inordinate amount of risk in this COVID-19 environment.And I realized that sort of really over the top question, but I thought I'd run it by you, nonetheless. -- Well, Matt, I mean, you would know, we're looking at all options and all alternatives. And generally we land on the one we think is the most accretive and create the most value, and this we believe is the one. So every market is different, every set of opportunities is different. And generally speaking, we're -- we never take anything off the table. We're always looking at what's in front of us. But in this case, we believe this is the right outcome. That's what I'll say. -- Right, I think that's right and congratulations. -- Okay, thanks. Now, we're 10 after here. So, I guess, Rick -- operator, we'll take one or two more and then let people get back to their day, if there are one at the moment.Okay. We'll go next to Ulrich Rathe with Jefferies. -- Yeah. Thanks very much. Mike, highlighted on footprint expansion, your and Telefonica share excitement about expanding that. Could you comment on the capacity to pull that off during a period of probably quite large scale merger integration, at the same time embarking on accelerated footprint expansion potentially? I realize even after unplanned, but how do you look at the title capacity to pull all these things together at the same time? Thank you. -- Yeah. It's a good question. And it will be something that we factor in. We wouldn't ever make strategic decisions that impact our ability to execute synergies or integrate the businesses. On the other hand, we're already out there today, every day, building, extending plan in the Street. So if we were able to do it or see our way clear to doing it, as a stand-alone company, there's nothing about being a larger, more integrated company that should change that materially.But it's the right question. It's a process of making sure you're prioritizing where you spend your time and where you have your resources focused, but as we lay that out on the page, we'll make that determination. But I don't see anything off the top in which you can comment that would somehow preclude us from having the wherewithal or the resources or the will to go ahead and continue looking at a broader network expansion if it makes.And you can always -- there's lots of ways of structuring it and financing it as well. So I think it's the right thing to think about. But on the other hand, there's nothing in my mind, that says, it's not it's not doable. We'll get there when we get there. -- All right, that's helpful. -- I think that to add to that. -- How about timing though, is -- oh, sorry. Go ahead. -- Well, I can get some of flavor to that. I think what we have done now is we have put really all network extension, so from consumer from B2B from wholesale into the Lightning unit. And they are accelerating the network extension. I mean, we have just announced the beginning of the week that we will mobile backhaul 3,000 5G sites from 3G. So therefore, we have secured vendors, for an acceleration in rollout, like we've also close a couple of LFSN deal.So therefore, the machine is growing. And the machine will run also quite independently. So therefore, it's not so much impacted by the complexity of an integration. -- Got it. Thank you, guys. Thank you.And we will take our last question from Sam McHugh from Exane. -- Morning, guys. Morning, guys. Just sticking to fiber in the UK, following BT's announcement today, do you see any kind of strategic need to move a bit faster on your own network expansion be in Project Lightning? I mean, just linked to that, I think by the end of this year, we need to implement gainer-led switching in the UK.I'm not sure if that has any kind of positive implications or negative implications here. If you have any interesting thoughts, that would be great. Thanks very much. -- Well, look, I think, BT will make the decisions that it needs to make in the context of its own financial picture. And I think they will build and we anticipate they will continue to roll out fiber and they should. So I don't know that their announcements or commentary today changes anything really, more or less confirming what they anticipated. And they should be leaning into this element of their business. And I think they'll probably do that.So I don't believe it changes it materially. And, Lutz, do you want to tackle the second question? I'm not sure I fully understood it or got all the details of it, but maybe you did. -- I mean, what we are accelerating is fixed-mobile convergence, right, the more customers we have locked in is fixed or mobile, in the better position, we are to protect them from competition, right. So we are doing more speed for our customers now. More fixed-mobile convergence and network extension at the moment, the pace you know. And we are looking for ways to accelerate that.And with all of that, I think we are operating on our plan. And I agree with Mike, I think we haven't seen anything surprising or any acceleration from BT to a previous announcement. -- Okay. And with that, we will let you get back to your day. Always appreciate you participating in these calls and your support. We're excited about this deal that goes without saying, we are creating an FMC champions -- a champion with incredible synergies, and needs great vote of confidence for us and for Telefonica in the UK. So we're excited to get it going. And I would just lastly say, stay well, stay healthy, stay safe, and we'll speak to you soon.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here\u2019s why.\u00a0I don\u2019t know about you, but most Americans these days know somebody who is struggling to stay afloat as a result of the .\u00a0I\u2019m not suggesting that Branson or Chamath Palihapitiya \u2014 who together control almost all shares available for sale \u2014 are struggling. Still, like most people, they have obligations to meet. Share sales are often the most expedient way to come up with cash in a hurry.\u00a0One of the selling stockholders is Boeing HorizonX Ventures. It owns 1.9 million shares. (NYSE:) solely owns those shares. I have no idea if it wants to sell, but given that it\u2019s borrowed  in recent weeks to survive the pandemic, it probably wouldn\u2019t look too good holding a vanity investment such as Virgin Galactic.\u00a0That said, Boeing invested last October as a way to get to the front of the line when it comes to future space travel. From Boeing HorizonX Ventures\u2019 Brian Schettler at the time of its :\u00a0\u201cBoeing\u2019s strategic investment facilitates our effort to drive the commercialization of space and broaden consumer access to safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible new forms of transportation.\u201dEither way, giving Boeing the option makes sense.\u00a0The Motley Fool\u2019s\u00a0Rich Smith recently explained that Virgin Galactic\u2019s stock price  because investors were unimpressed with the revelation that insiders intend to sell as much as 72% of the company\u2019s stock in the future.\u00a0Yes, it seems like a strange proposition. After all, wasn\u2019t it Branson that  with the grand idea of operating commercial space flights?\u201cI hope, with the launch of Virgin Galactic and the building of our fleet of spacecraft, that one day children around the world will wonder why we ever thought that space travel was a dream we read about in books,\u201d Branson said in 2004.\u00a0It\u2019s true that Branson is the visionary behind Virgin Galactic. But it\u2019s also true that many of Virgin\u2019s 500 companies are smaller investments using others\u2019 money to grow.In 2012, The Guardian published an article that reminded readers that few of Branson\u2019s diverse array of businesses are . In many ways, he\u2019s the United Kingdom\u2019s version of President Donald Trump. He often licenses the Virgin brand to others, while owning very little of those businesses himself.\u00a0For example, in 2014,  to Liberty Global (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) for $24 billion. Branson had a small stake in the company and was  to promote Virgin Media\u2019s services. Also, the Virgin group of companies had several promotional arrangements with Virgin Media.\u00a0\u00a0Richard Branson is said to be worth $4.4 billion. He currently is in a battle to , the airline he started in 1984. It is also one of the Virgin Group\u2019s most significant investments. It owns 51% of the airline with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:) owning the rest.If Branson and Virgin Group owned 100% of all 500 companies it\u2019s started, he would likely be one of the world\u2019s wealthiest persons.\u00a0It wouldn\u2019t have made sense for Virgin Galactic to go public if Branson and the Virgin Group intended to hang on to control of the company. The whole idea was to bring more investors to the table.\u00a0With an  in 2019 on $3.8 million in revenue, you can be sure that Virgin Galactic\u2019s share count in five years won\u2019t be just 210 million. It will likely be in the billions.\u00a0So, the \u201cpotential\u201d sale of 150 million existing shares in the long run is much ado about nothing.Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

Liberty Global's stock was the bigger winner from the news. Its Class A shares finished up 15% while its Class C shares rose 17%.The response was more tempered for Telefonica, with shares rising 6% during the session.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.In the U.K., Liberty Global is the sole owner of Virgin Media, through which it offers phone, TV, and internet services. Virgin Media is reportedly set to merge with Telefonica's O2 Wireless segment. O2 Wireless is one of the largest wireless carriers in the U.K.\u00a0A merger of these two operations would be a bold move for both companies. Consider that 57% of Liberty Global's 2019 revenue came from the U.K. and Ireland, where it does business under its Virgin Media segment.\u00a0For Telefonica, the U.K. and O2 Wireless make up a smaller percentage of overall company revenue, but this is an area of sustained growth: It's grown U.K revenue for 14 consecutive quarters.Some are speculating that Telefonica is hoping to off-load O2 wireless, to continue taking care of its heavy debt load. But that would be a surprise move considering that the company just said in its fourth-quarter  that sustainable growth in the U.K. was a top priority.Until Liberty Global and Telefonica validate the merger report, investors should take today's news with a grain of salt. Often the devil is in the details, and right now shareholders don't have enough clarity to understand the financial impact for either .\u00a0Investors may get that clarity soon. Telefonica is scheduled to report earnings on May 7, with Liberty Global expected to report in May as well.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Thanks operator and welcome everybody. I appreciate you joining the call today. We've got plenty of ground to cover, as usual. So we're going to have to try to keep our prepared remarks a bit shorter today, so we can spend more time on Q&A. And as you've got a number of exacts on the call with me who will be sure to get engaged as needed in that conversation, so I'll kick it off with some Q3 highlights. By now, you've come through our financial and operating results. No doubt and Charlie is going to dig into those in a moment.From my point of view, there were three key takeaways here. First, we're tracking the guidance in particular free cash flow and as we've discussed all year, that's a function in part of resetting our capital intensity levels with P&E additions down considerably we've reported 40% rebased OFCF growth, if you include Switzerland 80% if you don't, year-to-date. Again that's a major step up from prior years and it's happening across all of our key opcos. And third , we are absolutely descaling central cost both at corporate and in our centralized T&I operations, several of you have asked for clarity on this point and Charlie has an entire slide on it, coming up. The punch line though is that, the cost we incurred to fulfill the service agreements we signed with Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and our Dutch JV were more or less equal the revenue we're generating from those agreements as they rise and fall. So there will be no significant mismatch in those costs, which means the additional cost to support our remaining operations, which is largely allocated to our opcos will not be impacted by these TSA agreements and should in fact be flat to down as we move forward more on that in a moment.And as our largest operation Virgin Media naturally follows much of the same narrative. Despite continued investment in network expansion to project Lightning we've seen declining capex year-over-year and significant operating free cash flow growth year-to-date. Operationally Virgin subscriber growth and financial results continue to be impacted by competition and the macro picture, I think we foreshadowed that all year long, and I've got a slide on Virgin coming up.So let me turn to Switzerland briefly, I'm sure you all followed recent developments on our transaction to sell our business there. Obviously. We were disappointed and Sunrise was unable to secure a favorable for the rights offering that would have financed the deal, we knew there was resistance from their largest shareholder, but we were not expecting ISS to publish such a misinformed and florid report, it's unbelievable really, and that's just pushed it over the edge. So you may have noticed that both the regulatory approval and the stock purchase agreement are still valid until the end of February, you can infer from that whatever you want.Switzerland is rapidly becoming a converged market. There is no question that our gigabit networks and advanced TV platform are the most important link in that chain. As you know, we've already witnessed over 100 billion in fixed mobile mergers in Europe. Nearly all of which involve cable assets and there are more to come, pretty sure that. Two textbook examples of that convergence are our operations in Belgium and Holland, both of which are delivering on the promise of synergies, reduced churn, greater customer satisfaction and strong free cash flow. So the model works. And the backbone of that model, the backbone of these combinations in Europe is fixed broadband, just like in the US, it is the killer product that drives our bundles everywhere. That remains very competitive in Europe, you know that. We are adding data RGUs and expanding our lead on speed with gigabit broadband launched in all of our markets. In Switzerland, for example, we're marketing 1 gig networks now to about 75% of that country and in UK and we're launching giga cities as we speak and will reach over half the country with gigabit broadband in 24 months and that's the same for Holland and Belgium essentially.And then finally, in an environment like this, we feel awfully privileged to have options when it comes to our financial position. Charlie will spend a minute on the balance sheet but we're sitting on about $10 billion of liquidity today, which includes $7.4 billion of cash. The net proceeds from the Vodafone deal were in the $11 billion plus, we're obviously reduced by the $2.7 million we spent on buying back 14% of the shares in September that was a Dutch auction tender. And then there are some other factors that Charlie will run through. I'm sure we'll get a few questions on this topic. So I simply going to say that our focus with this liquidity remains the same. We're evaluating opportunities in core markets, core sectors and of course our capital structure.And the next slide provides a bit more background on Virgin Media's results. We know that a major focus for analysts and investors. I'm just going to highlight a few points here in the interest of time. As you know, our financial results in particular, operating cash flow have been mixed year-to-date and they reflect the headwinds we identified at the beginning of the year like broadband network taxes and increased content cost. In addition, we've seen increased competition ,discounting at the lower end of the market and general macro factors and that's resulted in slower RGU growth and stable revenue year-to-date.Lutz and his team are focused on a host of initiatives in the consumer business from fixed mobile convergence to 1 gig roll out and digitization, all of which are well under way and should underpin performance going forward. But they take time, and I'm happy to get into that during the Q&A and Lutz would be as well.A few positive takeaway here, operating free cash flow, as I mentioned earlier, was up over 30% through 9 months as capital intensity declined. Secondly, customer ARPU was up modestly in the 3rd quarter, driven in part by the recent price increase, which just started accruing in September. In fact, Q3 rental ARPU was up 1.7% year-over-year, while total ARPU as we tell you each quarter was impacted by declining voice usage and lower pay-per-view revenue, so it was up about 0.5%.On the mobile front , we had a great quarter in the UK with 107,000 net postpaid adds as Virgin's foray into fixed mobile converged bundles continues to pay off. Now, to fund that, to fuel that, and to composite that we just announced a new MVNO deal with Vodafone that will result in significant savings on MVNO fees , hundreds of millions of pounds in fact over the life of the contract and provides us guaranteed access to 5G services. This is a good contract for us.And then lastly Lightning is rolling on. We're closing in on 2 million homes built, we had our best customer in RGU net add performance in 4 quarters , revenue and operating cash flow are growing and the negative impact on free cash flow get smaller and smaller, every quarter, just as you would expect it to do. Now, there're plenty of speculation about our possible moves in the UK market when it comes to network expansion. And I'll just repeat what I've said before, first of all with only 5% fiber penetration in the U.K you're going to see a lot of activity by Outnet and even BT on this subject of next gen networks. That's to be expected and in our opinion as much as anything validates the broadband opportunity. But most of it is talk and as you know yourselves these plans are slow and expensive.And while everyone's busy raising capital or talking to regulators Virgin Media is making it happen, we're bringing 1 gig broadband to half of the country over the next 24 months. By the way that's without digging up streets or disrupting premises and I promise you that matters to politicians and customers. And It makes us the most important news story today in my view. UK is ranked 41st in the world of broadband speeds. If Virgin Media was a country, we'd be ranked 5th right behind Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong and well ahead of the US. So we really are the secret weapon in this market and it's smart for us to consider how best to exploit that position, but to do it efficiently and economically and I'm sure I have plenty of questions on that. So let me move on to the last slide here , which provide some operating highlights for Belgium, Switzerland and our 50-50 JV in Holland.I'll start by pointing out right upfront. You'll see a lot of similarities here. All 3 countries experienced fixed RGU losses in the quarter, but very positive in strong mobile postpaid net adds. And while each operation is reporting flat to down revenue growth, they are either delivering or projecting significant operating free cash flow margins and growth. Telenet operating free cash flow was up 45% in the quarter and they are now guiding to EUR380 million to EUR400 million of free cash flow for the full year. They also announced that they intend to dividend a large part of that out to shareholders obviously including us. VodafoneZiggo has returned to positive revenue in OFCF growth and operating cash flow growth and announced that they will dividend at around EUR600 million to us the Vodafone this year and Switzerland is hitting on all cylinders, its turnaround plan is working. Our new advanced TV set-tops and user interface are rolling out right on plan with the upgraded platform expected represent 50% of our boxes by year-end. FMC penetration is nearing 20% with NPS at an all time high and the one-gig network we're building there has helped improve fixed RGU losses for the 3rd straight quarter of this year.So I'll just wrap it a few thoughts. first. We are extremely well positioned in all of these markets to take advantage of fixed mobile convergence, financially, operationally and strategically. We've shown you how we can do that, stay tuned for more. Second, we're focused on profitable subscriber growth, at least with our current premium brands and that's going to impact volumes and competitive times as it has this year. Third , fourth and fifth, we are committed to free cash flow margins yields and growth, and this year step change is going to be hard to replicate of course. 80% operating free cash flow growth is extraordinary. But that's a long-term metric that matters to us. And then finally just to remind you we have considerable scale in our core markets in Europe, 45 million fixed and mobile subs, 7 billion of operating cash flow if you include the Dutch JV and we have considerable financial flexibility with 10 billion of liquidity to opportunistically create long-term value. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Charlie. -- Thanks, Mike. For those following. I know on the slide, titled Group overview. Revenue in the quarter was broadly stable excluding Switzerland minus 0.2% and with Switzerland at minus 0.6%. Telenet continues to be impacted by the loss of the media land MVNO contract and we also started to recognize TSA revenues from the assets we sold to Vodafone in the quarter, which contributed $26 million of incremental revenue that we don't include that in our re based growth rate. OCF declined 4.1% including Switzerland and 2.9% with assets. This is in line with our expectations for the quarter.The UK was impacted by the year-on-year increase in network taxes, which will continue to increase, but a lower rate over the coming years. We also saw an increase in programming costs related to prior year renewals such as BT Sport and UK TV and the recent, multi-year is guide agreement. Swiss OCF was impacted by cost phasing and continued investment in key revenue growth initiatives such as the EOS box roll out and the 1 one-gig upgrade of the broadband network.OFCF continues to grow strongly and was up 63% excluding Switzerland and 35% with it. Remember The Swiss numbers are impacted by the investments in those initiatives such as EOS set top boxes and the 1-gig upgrade, which we would expect to normalize over time, resulting in a lower capex figure. Liquidity remains very strong with cash sitting at $7.4 billion. And when we completed the sale to Vodafone in July, we reported net cash proceeds of $11.3 billion, which together with our Q2 cash balance of $1.3 billion came to $12.6 billion. The 5.2 billion difference is made up of the 1.6 billion UPC term loan repayment, the 2.7 billion Dutch auction tender completed in September.As one as the combination of items, including a negative free cash flow in Q3, FX movements on the proceeds of around $200 million and an escrow payment of EUR300 million in relation to the TSA with Vodafone. Together with a revolver capacity available, that means around $10 billion of liquidity. The average remains around 5 times gross and 3.5 times net. We were able to take advantage of very strong financing markets completing over $6 billion of financing, which means that virtually all our senior secured debt is now repriced and extended. Our weighted average cost of debt is now 4.1% on an average life after what refinancing activity had happened after September 30 is up from 6.8 years to 7.3 years. And again, all the debt is fixed and swept back to the underlying currencies.The next slide, we get further detail on our central costs. In total we spent around $200 million of opex and capex in Q3. And as we've discussed on previous calls, we would divide this into two buckets and then on top of the page, we set out our corporate costs, which includes cost such as centralized finance, development, HR, strategy and the like, which was $44 million for the quarter. We remain on track to reduce this to around $230 million for the year, down from $260 million last year. We continue to target around $200 million in 2020.Next is essentially technology and innovation costs, which represent network and product development spend all this spend is attributable to our retained operations in our affiliates whether they've been sold or ventured. As suggested on the last quarterly call. We estimate total T&I opex and capex of $700 million for 2019. That number is now expected to be closer to $650 million in 2019 and well on track to $600 million in 2020. And just to put that in context, Total opex and capex for T&I was $800 million in 2018. So we made some substantial progress descaling our central cost structure with more improvement coming.As you know, we do not collect revenue from Vodafone, T-Mobile in Austria and Liberty Latin America to offset some of our T&I spend. And the slide breaks, those numbers out quarterly, but to simplify it, we're currently collecting around $80 million per quarter against the total spend of roughly $150 million to $160 million , the balance is our net T&I costs and is fully attributable to our retained assets including Switzerland. Over time, we anticipate that revenue from these agreements will largely match our cost to service these contracts. So the Net spend attributable to our retained assets should be at least flat if not down.On the next slide, we try to break out the OFCF margins of the profitability of each key component of our Group to allow you to compare it to our peers and also to give you more clarity on the Virgin OFCF and particularly the free cash flow distinction between Lightning and non-Lightning operations.This slide entitled divisional overview and we show the key financials for operations before K&I attributions which we've labeled as OFCF pre-central cost allocation and after the T&I attributions which will be able to on the slide as pro forma OFCF for the year to date. We have also expect our Lightning from the core Virgin operations. Now Virgin as a whole has reported $811 million of OFCF in the first 3 quarters of the year, we estimate the core Virgin operations generated over $1 billion with a net $241 million invested in Lightning year-to-date.Belgium delivered $649 million of OFCF at a 30% margin. Despite its investment program this year, Switzerland has generated $228 million of OFCF, a 24% margin. And the Group as a whole, made $1.6 billion of OFCF including Lighting or $1.9 billion, excluding [Technical Issues]. The Dutch JV is also generating strong OFCF with $800 million generated year-to-date, it's OFCF margin of 24% should increase going forward as it completes the acquisition integration investments, with currently at 30% OFCF margin showing what is achievable to converged assets.On the next slide, total pro forma adjusted free cash flow. We show how the OFCF converts into free cash flow. On our guidance basis, free cash flow for the quarter was in line with our expectations at minus $16 million. And remember, Q3 and Q1 are where we make our semiannual interest payments and we expect more meaningful interest costs in Q4. We remain on track to spend around $2.7 billion of capex for the full year excluding Switzerland. Our cash tax in Q4 will include a payment of around $70 million relating to US cash taxes paid. But despite this, we remain on track to meet our original free cash flow guidance excluding Switzerland for around $550 million to $600 million. Switzerland has generated around $19 million of free cash flow year-to-date and we expect a full year number of around $150 million meaning even after Lightning we should generate around $700 million to $750 million of free cash flow for the year.So moving to the final conclusion slide. Our key focus remains OFCF and free cash flow delivery and we're pleased with year-to-date progress on both metrics. We're seeing strong cash flow generation despite our net OFCF investment around $350 million in Lightning this year which have exceeded means our retained assets including Switzerland should generate $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow this year. We're also focused on long-term value creation and have a significant cash position to support opportunities including share repurchases . We are reinforcing our speed leadership across our footprint with one-gig deployments, the Swiss turnaround is on track and gathering momentum and we are providing guidance both with and without Switzerland at the bottom of the page but we confirm that we are on track to meet our key targets, particularly free cash flows . And with that, over to you operator for questions.The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Michael Bishop with Goldman Sachs. -- Thank you. Just two questions from me please. Firstly on the UK RGU growth and the wider performance, and Mike, I think you said it was the best quarter in four quarters for Lightning, net adds, so you sort of backing that out given the relatively weak overall RGU trends, particularly TV. I was just wondering if you could give us some comments on what was happening in the existing footprint outside of Lightning? And then secondly, on the free cash flow and guidance, it looks like if you broadly take the 700 and 750 remove Switzerland and then sort of remove the higher dividend from Vodafone Ziggo and the Telenet free cash flow, you're basically zero free cash flow. So as we look ahead to 2020, I was just wondering if you could walk through the moving parts to give us a bit more color on how effectively the ramp, including Virgin Media could improve cash flow generation and why you think the group might be able head to in 2020. Thanks. -- Sure. Thanks Michael. Charlie, you I'm sure prepared to answer to the free cash flow question, make sure you understand that correctly. And I was asked to chime in, of course, on the UK, but in principle as you correctly say and as I pointed out the RGU growth is Lightning is pretty steady. If you could look at total net adds, broadband and telephony or video, we've been pretty consistent the last four, five quarters. And this was a better quarter than we've had in the last few marginally better, but I think it demonstrates that the product matters the Lightning Project is delivering the sort of penetration rates, ARPUs and returns that we expect and we do understand that people like the detail of Lightning. We were just trying to make the slides a little shorter today, but we weren't avoiding any disclosure on that. Lightning continues to be a terrific program for us from almost every perspective. In terms of the, in the BAU or GAU, how you define it and I think Lutz will dig into this and I made the comments in my remarks, it's a competitive market, that's for sure. Particularly, we are focused on more of the premium product and the higher end products, especially in video. So we're trying to retain customers that we view as profitable customers in our end the kind of Virgin customers that means a lot to us which means you're going to lose some customers at the lower end and that clearly happened in the BAU market in particular in video.It was not a great quarter for us in video that much we are disclosing the details that you could probably do the math and in broadband as well. We did lose broadband customers on that footprint, we have lost customers on this footprint in the past. I would say that this is an extraordinary occurrence. The GAU or BAU markets has always been a bit lumpy, depending on what's happening in the competitive environments. And I think in our reaction to what we see as a softer environment in total for broadband and video is based on consumer confidence and impacts of Brexit combined with competition at the lower end is going to have an impact on our product mix, but I think Lutz can dig into it. I think we're focused on the right things here and focused on profitable subscriber growth, which is in our minds the right thing to be pursuing in this kind of environment.You want to add to that Lutz and then Charlie on the free cash flow question. -- I can give some more numbers to it, Mike, if you want, and Michael. So the swing and RGUs as you can clearly see that it's 150,000 RGUs right. So we had a win 100,000 RGUs a year ago and now we have lost 50,000, half of that comes because we have put the price rise problem by a month. And so it's phasing -- half of it is phasing, 25,000 of that is we had a year ago, the launch of our voice over IP service was a one-off in telephony which doesn't come again.And then 25,000 is, we are continuing our high value video strategy. So we are not winning low end player customers anymore, which we have used to charge the same price, then dual customers out there. That was not a very good use of our capital and you see that in our high capex . So that is 25,000 a deliberate decision which will come again and only 25,000 is due to the market. Yes, so therefore make up your own mind, but I would say two-thirds are really just because of the phasing, one third is half of that is a conscious strategic decision of use of our capex in our video and 25,000 is just the market. -- And just on the free cash flow and I appreciate your numbers, if I just break it out into the key groups. I think your point is essentially, if you take out Switzerland and use the $600 million number and then you subtract Telenet you probably end up with only around $200 million and then you're saying that the $200 million, effectively equates to the dividend. I think what I would point out is when we do our shareholder distributions from Holland which is about EUR600 million, remember that $200 million that $100 million our shares, so EUR300 million is our share, EUR100 million of that comes in the form of a loan repayment that isn't hit into free cash flow. Next year, we will be making loan repayments. So that kind of repayment, will be cash available to fund the dividend. So that's one point, I think the second point is the point we've tried to emphasize in a number of occasions, the UK on the net basis is not generating a lot of free cash flow, but they are two very distinct businesses. You have the Lightning business which depending how you look at the allocation of debt is a negative $450 million free cash flow business, whereas you have a core business that is generating something like $600 million $800 million of free cash flow and that is why there is a distinction.So if we stand back and think about our assets, got a highly generative assets in Belgium, very generative asset with an upside in the Netherlands. Switzerland actually is a depressed level at 24% traditionally has been a lot higher, but behind the investment cycle and then you got this Virgin business the splits between a very generative business as usual but a highly investing Lighting business. And then the delta is Eastern Europe and corporate, Eastern Europe is slightly positive on an aggregate basis. And the corporate net number is this $200 million that we've been talking about which we tried to explain in the slides. I hope that's helpful. If you have any other questions. Maybe we can follow up offline with Matt and the guys.Thank you. We'll move next to Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group. -- Good morning. It sounds like the price hike accounted for most of the UK RGU result. Thanks for those details. Do you feel comfortable, will you be able to return to maybe modest RGU growth in the fourth quarter or is that too high of a hurdle. And then how interesting is, it is a lot of competition at the low end how interesting is it to potentially launch of flanker brand targeted at lower spending users to boost RGU growth? -- Lutz, you want to address this? -- Yes. So, right. I said that 25% is due to our conscious decision on video strategy, you can expect that somehow to continue and then, I wouldn't say that the market will repair itself from one quarter to the other right, so competitiveness is still high. I mean we are not making a guidance for next quarter. But I think when you look at the numbers through the commentary you will come to the right conclusion. Your question on second brand. Well let's put it that way. Right. So the more we invest in our network, the more also we want obviously to leverage that network. Yes with Virgin Media is a high value brand. So I think everybody else in the market has also low value brands Plusnet now broadband, so you can be assured that we are working on it. Yes. But we want to have this (ph) surprise also. -- One thing Jeff, you will see in the fourth quarter. the ARPU itself should be better so ARPU and revenue should be better, because we'll have a full quarter of that price increase.Thank you. And we'll move next to Vijay Jayant with Evercore. -- James Ratcliffe for Vijay. Can you hear me? -- Yes, we got you James. -- Okay. Good morning. James on for Vijay. I just wanted to a couple of questions, one on the operation side and one on the -- on the strategy side, can you talk about what your thinking is around the Dutch JV. I know some of the put call options are starting to come up, and whether it makes sense that to be stand-alone or potentially become a closer or more distant part of Liberty Global. And secondly, just wanted to understand on the corporate costs and make sure I'm getting this right. Then, it looks like you're saying that once the existing TSAs fully roll off, you're looking at the net cost of around $500 million a year for corporate plus T&I, as allocate to the currently ongoing businesses. Thanks. -- Charlie you work up and I will answer to the second one, look at those numbers are right. But with respect to the Dutch JV, James we're happy where we are in the current situation, need both parties do have rights with respect to liftings and then down the road, other sorts of liquidity provisions. But I would say and I'm pretty sure about if I would say the same thing. We're very pleased with the performance and the progress that the joint venture is making.As I mentioned in my remarks it would return to growth on the top line in the OCF line, it's got great OSCF and free cash flow margins, and a business that's generating dividends to us. So we're pleased with the progress that the venture, we had the whole Board there just a month or so go, and I think Jeroen and the team done a terrific job and they're proving out yet again and get another market the benefits of fixed mobile convergence. Synergies are on track, there are some outstanding strategic matters around spectrum and mobile -- and also access. Fundamentals of the business look terrific. At this point, I would assume, we are going to own our 50% stake, there doesn't appear to be any huge momentum either direction to drive a change in that.Charlie, you want to address the corporate costs? -- Yeah. Just on page James. I mean you have it right. So just to summarize the T&I costs, we do -- cost on behalf of the companies we've either sold or ventured. And then for the retained operations and as you correctly point out, the retained operations was $69 million of T&I cost, $70 in Q2 and $75 in Q3. We are saying to you that, we think that number should be flat to down over the next 4 or 5 years. And the reason is, because we're able to flex the cost of the other TSAs roll off, because a large amount of that spend is actually not internal labor, its third-party contractors, and it's a sort of a variable cost model.And then you are also correct that the net spend, which is the classic corporate overhead, which is, HR, finance, strategy. development, etc. etc. That was 55 in Q1, 53 in Q2 and it's 44 in Q3 and we're telling you that's going to be around 200 million in 2020, when it would probably stay flattish thereafter, but certainly we wouldn't expect that to increase and maybe there are opportunities for savings.We'll hear next from Nick Lyall. -- Yes, good morning guys. Is Nick from SocGen. Just 2 please on the UK, please. Mike. It's, you mentioned again the UK plans on fiber maybe for the next 7 to 10 million. So it looks like BT is probably going to have to wait about 12 to 18 months before it launches its onshore plans, if at all. So how quickly could you launch for these -- for the 7 to 10 million. Is it something where you prefer to wait to see what BT does what the regulator says or is it something that you think is maybe a bit more imminent.And then secondly, that means the UK, it's already quite complicated business with Lightning and non-Lightning, anyway becomes more complicated. So do you think you'd have to think of different structures, different disclosures, so that the market could value properly. Thank you. -- Good questions. In terms of what BT will or won't do. I think it's when Phil speak to the market, he is quite determined that he needs to invest in fiber. I think his challenge is the amount of time and capital It's going to take it doesn't sync up particularly well with this financial position today, whether it's EBITDA, free cash flow or dividends or pension plan. So I think you've got a bit of a of a challenge in front of him to accelerate and rapidly roll out fibers. I think you're right it is going to take time for them to get any kind of momentum.But we do assume for what it's worth, we do assume that BT will build fiber over some period of time. If you're looking at a 5 to 10-year time frame, we do assume that they will reach some measure of critical mass, certainly not the entire market. Well, south of that. But they will pick up speed and they will build fiber. They will need some regulatory relief to do it and they'll need some financial relief on some basis to do it, but we assume just to be clear that BT will build some fiber in some portions of the markets.As you point out, there are 7 to 10 million homes that we could possibly go out and build more quickly, and potentially more efficiently and while we're pleased with Lightning at the for 400,000 to 500,000 home-year click, we are unlikely to do that through Lightning on balance sheet and impacting our free cash flow and taking a fair amount of capital to do so. So I don't anticipate that you'll see Lightning on steroids, where we take -- at least not in its current structure. We take the current a team and ask them to double or triple the amount of activity they are undertaking.We are exploring, as I've said a few times now, how to do that perhaps in an off-balance sheet manner, potentially with partners that would have -- 2 or 3 benefits. Number one, outside capital, number 2, a two teams working if you will, if it makes sense and three, the ability to potentially keep it off balance sheet and the finance and value it separately. Now those were a lot of request and asks on our part. And I'm not suggesting here that they're all going to happen or any of them are going to happen. But when you read press reports that we might be looking at this, or we might be looking at that it shouldn't surprise you. Nobody is achieving or achieving in that marketplace, when it comes to gigabit speed, networks and rollout of new network. So for us to not be part of that conversation, when fully 95% of the country is on copper, 95% of the country's on copper, is the same. There is no reason why we should be looking at it, because we've proven we could build faster, build more efficiently and penetrate markets with new build better than anyone else in the footprint.But we have to balance that ambition with our desire to ensure that we're generating profitable growth in our core business that we're delivering as we promised greater operating free cash flow and free cash flow. So we're trying to juggle those objectives, but I think they're achievable and we want you to stay tuned. It might be complex, but I think in the end, we should be able to make it clear. If it's something which we used to do, if we don't do it, remember there is no reason why the Virgin brand couldn't be marketed elsewhere in the country, where we don't have network.And we've obviously looked at that, if we can assemble the rights, certainly we have a nationwide mobile, a platform certainly everybody in the country knows Virgin, whether you can get it or not. So expect us to try to drive scale in that market. I'm not saying we are subscale, but our objective should be the drive scale with our brand and with networks owned or leased. -- Great. Thank you.We'll move now to Ulrich Rathe with Jefferies. -- Thanks for the question, one short. Thank you. I have one question and maybe just very short clarification. The question is, what is the -- what are the decisions that are need to be made or what the evidence you're waiting for to move forward on the shareholder return decisions at this stage? You sort of repeating for quite some time now that's all the question of sort of generating value and I think that's fair. But in terms of trying to understand what the timeline is and what it depends on would be interesting, if you had anything in mind that you can point to, what need to happen or what you're waiting for? What you still have to decide? And then a question over for Charlie for clarification. In Central and Corporate, there was a bit of a revenue pop -- you highlighted the costs were more or less flat quarter-on-quarter, there was a revenue pop in the report, it said there were high CPE sales to the Netherlands. Is that -- all that is the step-up and that it looks a bit like a one-off, could you just confirm. Thank you. -- Thank you. On the buyback, I believe and Rick will check this with the $3.2 billion in shares, we've repurchased this year. This is the largest amount of stock we've ever purchased in a 12-month period. And not an insignificant amount of stock. So I think, anybody who is looking at their own shares and trying to manage a buyback program wants to be measured and thoughtful about that. We did just complete a $2.7 billion Dutch auction tender at $27. We were fine pursuing that price. And today, we're $24, $25. So you want to be thoughtful about the timing of these sorts of things that's point one. And generally, if you own the shares while you have and follow them for a while, we provide some measure of guidance around buyback activity on our year-end call, and that's coming up of course as we finish the year and so I think there is no particular science behind it. And then thirdly, I suppose the last thing would be, we're always evaluating opportunities to create value for the our company on both sides of the spectrum buybacks and investment. And we're looking at those in relation to one another with a fair amount of discipline, so that as we evaluate opportunities to put money to work in an industrial way we want to be sure that we're able to demonstrate returns that would exceed what we could do just by buying our shares. So I don't -- I wouldn't take our lack of a buyback program at this point in time or in the fact that we haven't announced another Dutch auction as an indication of anything really just that we're pacing ourselves as we should. And as we take measure of the year we are quite a bit back into the stock , $3.2 billion is not small number and I think we're taking a longer view of this and perhaps maybe a bit more patient and then other shareholder. -- Just on the corporate side, you're quite right. Yes, so we do buy set-top boxes on behalf of Vodafone Ziggo, the reason why we very specifically on our central update focus you on opex and capex that is not in those numbers. So it's a cost of goods sold line is the way. And then the second thing to say is that is essentially a zero margin slight positive, zero margin type activity and it's a hard number to predict because it's quite volatile, because we need to do set top boxes, there are two things, one is you can refurbish existing set-top boxes and one is you can buy new. The reason that buying a lot of new set-top boxes is they rolling out the new EOS platform, which by the way, has been a terrific success. Generally, we see a lot of our boxes being refurbished because they good average life and they work pretty well, and in fact, that's one of the factors in the slight decline in OCF in some of the market because we've shifted less from new box sales to refurbish boxes as refurbishment counts as opex under the magic of US GAAP, whereas new box as a capex, which is one of the reasons why OFCF is probably a more accurate metric of what the underlying cash flow is doing than the old OCF. In terms of predicting how will go. I can't really predict, if they continue to sell like hot cakes, you might see an acceleration, we might not but just -- it may slightly distort the revenue, but on a cash flow basis it's basically a breakeven number. -- Right. Thanks, much appreciated.Our next question comes from Carl Murdock-Smith with Berenberg. -- Hi, thanks very much. Just one question from me, -- I tracked very carefully the churn and I don't think you reported UK churn this quarter. So I was just wondering if it was possible for you to provide an update, I think the 12 month trailing was 15% last quarter. Thanks very much. -- Yeah, I mean historically we realized it. None of our peers report that churn figure either. And so I don't believe that the lack of reporting and Charlie, you have to jump in here and Lutz I don't believe we're not reporting it because it's not a good number. I think we probably made a determination that the amount of detail we're reporting in our markets was consistent and not consistent across the industry, but Charlie or Lutz want to get that? -- Yeah. I said, right, when we are referring to the RGUs that 75,000 due to the pull forward of the price rise, right. So we are predominantly selling triple. So I think you cannot make up the number ourself. On the other hand side, right. I try to get the intelligence from the competitors and I get less and less and why would we disclose more and more. -- Okay. I suppose, I'll just start on that the BT does provide fixed churn every quarter. And I suppose, just as a follow-up. It's interesting that you've lost TV RGUs. But at the same time Sky this quarter is also tend to declining RGUs this quarter as well. So where do you think those TV customers are going and do you think it's evidence of more cord cutting in the UK TV market? -- I think -- We know that these TV customers are the low-end customers, what do I mean with that, these are predominantly customers who have used to buy our triple play entry product, right. They're paying roughly with time limit discounts 30 pounds and then after 12 months when they get off the time limit discount. It's a very high jump. And then they simply value the pure video product not as much than to pay more for it and then you see high churn. and therefore, I can only speak for us, so therefore you see that the bit -- these 25,000 on a quarterly basis are pretty much that.High level, the high-end packages actually are very stable. So, and they provide also obviously higher margin. So therefore, I would not really see the world turning very much to an App World, pick and choose world. So I don't see that accelerating but obviously we have to watch that carefully over a longer time period, we will see that trend, but these numbers are not really referring to that. -- That's brilliant. Thanks very much guys.Robert Grindle with Deutsche Bank has our next question. -- Yeah, hi there . My question is about the UK deal you've just done with Vodafone. Congratulations on that, you had another 2 years to run though on your existing MVNO with EE. So it seems very premeditated to strike a new deal so soon. So I wondered what drove the timeline on that and what was the swing factor, was it 5G access, having Vodafone as a customer for Virgin business or was it the financial terms or something else. Thanks so much. -- Well, I'll let Lutz dig into it, from my point of view, it was all the above. There was no other strategic purpose to it, but to switch providers is not a simple thing even though we have a core network that allows us to do it relatively seamlessly. From the consumers' point of view, you need to get prepared for these. So I think it was smart for the team to determine well in advance which direction we're going, to put that out to bid if you will. And as a result, derive fantastic contract that as you pointed out guaranteed 5G access, which we were not getting in any other deal , has much better economics. But I wouldn't read anything strategic into it. That would be my observation. Go ahead Lutz, if you want to add anything more. -- Exactly. We've done an (ph) RP in the market and we wanted the best technology at the lowest price. And this is what we found, and we have the opportunity now to launch 5G as we are able to implement it. And so we are not a stick to the end of the contract in the 5G world. -- Thank you.We'll move now to David Wright with Bank of America. -- Hello, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. A couple from me. First, the first one follows on from Robert and the answer you've given. My understanding is that 5G services you can migrate instantly away from the BT MVNO onto the Vodafone contract. I think you have like a clause that allows you to exit. So is it possible we could see customers coming before that year end '20, '21 expiry and then beyond that, I think you mentioned Mike a little earlier on that we got info what we wanted on perhaps this Swiss deal. It's obviously something that I think the Sunrise shareholders maybe saw strategic value and bought necessarily like the means to raise capital or the price paid. Is this possibly something where you could even migrate to some kind of earnings -- earn-out clause or you potentially take less capital upfront, you are not exactly desperate for cash right now of course and maybe sort of lever into the strategic synergies of the merger and some kind of optionality further down the line is that potential. Thank you. -- I'll take the Swiss deal question first. Lutz and you can prepare on the first one. It is reasonable people can disagree on value and financing structures in any transaction. But I don't see many folks disagree on the industrial logic of putting those two businesses together. It's almost a no-brainer. The synergies are substantial and real, and as I mentioned in my remarks the ISS report was not anticipated and a bit of an embarrassment to them in my view . And just to, you know shareholders were still voting for the deal 2-1 in favor but we need a slightly larger margin in order to get the one shareholder whoever address their concerns or not, across the line. So we felt it would be right due to play that out, I'm not going to get into what we may or may not do now I think we are obviously willing to engage in any discussion that appears to be accretive and smart for us, either with Sunrise or other operators in that market and it's only one. So you should assume that we're not sitting still. You should assume that the industrial logic of fixed mobile convergence in Switzerland is compelling. And that, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are the most important fulcrum asset in that equation. Whether the -- the shareholder or Sunrise think so or not, this is where it's going.So I think it's going to be an interesting period of time here and the good news for us is, the turnaround plan is working. We are able to do the things we need to do in the fixed mobile space with our Swisscom, which is terrific. I think the team is executing on all of the things we asked them to execute on. Whether it's one-gig, rolling out new set-top boxes, driving fixed mobile convergence. And if we have to own this business, we're happy to own it, because we're on our way as they say.On the other hand, one of the most accretive aspects of fixed mobile combinations are the synergies. They are real -- in Sunrise's opinion, upwards of $3 billion of NPV -- of synergies. That's something worth talking about, and they would be substantial synergies with the other mobile operator in the market. You can do that math as well, so I would -- you should expect that we're obviously opportunistic here and evaluating opportunities to look at alternative outcomes that drive value for all of us, in particular shareholder. Sure, I would stay tuned.Lutz, you want to address the -- -- On the mobile MVNO deal, so obviously now contractually for new customers and for existing customers migrating to 5G, we could do that tomorrow. So therefore, obviously, now we have to put the technology in place and then I think, right the take-up of 5G phones usage will take some time. But you can expect that we get all interested 5G customers new and migrated from the day we have launch it and this is a technical question.And you can also right -- for us, it's very important, we offer the highest-speed in fixed. Now we are in the position to bundle that with the higher speed in mobile and therefore we have extracted the customer base for that. Look at our net add number this quarter, more than 100,000 postpaid record quarter in the quarter. So we are going to take off in FMC and therefore we do everything to have 5G as soon as possible. -- If you don't mind me just following up. I wonder whether, there's a reciprocal agreement on some network usage backhaul, etc. Is this something you guys could have or even extend to reciprocal wholesale access to Vodafone customers or even any wider wholesale access to the VMED network. Thank you. -- Go ahead and address the first point, but not the second, OK. -- Yeah, exactly. Obviously, right. We have now really engaged in a close up partnership with Vodafone. And as we have said right, Vodafone very fastly deploys 5G base stations and they need backhaul opportunity. So therefore, we have also closed a huge deal on dark fiber and mobile backhaul. At the same time when we have closed MVNO deal. And we are very pleased with that. And in general, so dark fiber, IRU, mobile backhaul deals, this is an area that we -- which has huge growth opportunity in the future. And therefore we focus more-and-more on this kind of business. -- I think with respect to your -- the second part of your question, which is wholesale access, the end-to-end network, for me a fixed retail point of view. That is not something we've discussed with Vodafone. That's obviously a very different conversation and I think one that we would have to take a longer view of. And at this point, nothing to add. I mean we don't think that's necessary in this market, is certainly not legally regulatory or required. And I don't see us jumping into discussions of that without broader considerations. -- Thank you very much guys.We'll hear next from James Ratzer with New Street Research. -- Yes, thank you very much -- Yes, thank you very much indeed. I had a question and a very quick clarification. Just regarding your UK customer growth on your BAU footprint. I wonder, if you could kind of talk us through what your strategy is to try to return that customer base to growth? And actually it is indeed your strategy to return it to growth or are you going to be much more focused on trying to extract revenue growth there just through price rises alone?And then just a clarification on the churn point. Lutz, I think you gave a 75,000 from that, want to check my math is around 1.4 percentage point impact from churn in the quarter, which would be about kind of 5 points annualized -- implying annualized rate of churn step up to about 20%. Is that a fair assessment based just on the Q3 churn levels? Thank you. -- Lutz you want to answer those questions. -- Yeah. So I think on the churn number, right. I told you the RGU number. So you have to turn that into customers. But on an annualized churn, you get a bit like 0.5 percentage -- percent on it, then you're right, right. And in the quarterly churn obviously, the increase was higher. -- But it was the quarter of the price increase. -- Yeah, it was the quarter of the price increase [Speech Overlap] and we are getting back to that. Exactly. -- I think if you were to disclose [Speech Overlap] it as you've calculated it. It would be -- would not be an aberration. Go ahead please. -- What was the first question again, sorry for that. -- Yes. Thank you very much. The first question was about what the strategy. [Speech Overlap] BAU or whether it's more going to be focused about price on an ongoing basis? Thank you. -- Yeah, OK. So right, this is where our consumer strategy kicks in. So we started that a year ago and we have 4 growth levers. One is fixed mobile convergence, right. So we started that, we now that fixed-mobile converged customers have a substantially lower churn in a 2 or 3 percentage points, so therefore we drive that. And when you see our mobile net add numbers or the accelerated number of fixed-mobile converged customers you see that we will get an improvement from that over time. And so we have started at 19.6% year ago and now we are 20.7 or something that area and that is the second quarter after we launched, so you can be assured we will push for much more and then take the MVNO deal with Vodafone into account. So that is a very strong weapon. That's number one.And number 2 is, the SOHO business, right. So we have put now this small office -- home office business into the consumer machine. So we can leverage all sales channels, all marketing online and it's a huge to much less penetrated areas. Our market share in SOHO was substantially lower, so therefore we ramp up that. Number 3 is do more regional sales, so we are getting more-and-more -- and data analytics in place. MDU as a segment, we want to target more and we are doing more-and-more on that.Get to higher market share in several regions, Greater London, our market share is 36%, Scotland our market share is 60%. So we are focusing on that. So therefore, I'm not -- we are not giving a forward-looking guidance, but you can be assured that we have put a strategy in place to get substantially better in the GIU business. But these things take time. -- And you think that can be done without price discounting? -- I mean price discounting, I mean that is in general, right. I think discounting has increased in that market. So I think that's a factor of market situation and also more customers are within the minimum contract length. So that means, everybody is discounting more to get a higher share of grossest. And so therefore, simply we need to offer value for money, right. And that means, while we are -- we are in the position that we need to offer discounts as well. If you want to get a certain number of grossest. I mean, obviously we will see a game changer at end of contract notification coming from February onwards. And let's see how the market is evolving there then in terms of discounting. So if the market is then right because what is happening is you give a high discount within the minimum contract length after that the customer is then asked to pay more what the customer does is, calls in and asks for a retention discounts to stay on that discount , right. So with the end of contract notification, obviously we talk about that even more so I think it's more customer-friendly and more market-friendly when we are getting a bit more rational here. -- Great, thank you. Lutz thank you. -- Okay, go ahead.We'll take our final question from Maurice Patrick with Barclays. -- Yeah, thanks guys. Maurice here. So quick question on Switzerland, I can see how you're clearly if I disappointed about the deal filing, but you do sort of highlighted in the release that you do see early signs of recovery they have you point to improving NPS trends and subscriber trends, OCF remains pretty negative. I wonder when we'll start seeing the impact on the financials and the improving operational trends that clearly you can see already coming. Thanks. -- Sure. And Severina is online here. She is offering to chime in. We're tracking a whole series of operational metrics there. RGU movement of course ARPU, which is growing every quarter the rollout of EOS boxes so that we can get our base to about 50% advanced in set-tops by the end of this year. 1 gig homes, 1-gig penetration and the impact of this faster speeds in the marketplace. Now we're investing quite a bit of money to achieve that. So on one hand you've got some really positive metrics on customer -- on the customer front in terms of NPS and net add performance in ARPU . On the other hand, we're putting capital into products, into technology, and also into digitizing the operations themselves. So this year, I think we were clear that this is a year of investment, but we would want to see metrics improve that I've just described and they have and they are and that through the course of next year we'll start to see the pendulum swinging the other direction. We're not providing guidance as we sit here. But I think we've always said, the 2020 is important year, important inflection point for the business if we keep hitting on all cylinders, so far we have. Severina, would you like to add anything to that. -- No. Yeah, Mike, you basically pointed in the right direction as you said this year was the year of investment and we actually worked on multiple areas rolling out EOS, doing the 1 gig, investing in Simply Digital and as the organization also mature, we expect to do all these activities faster and better as well as seeing that the efficiencies coming -- paying off from the investments we don't simply digital. So next year, we should see, yeah, the organization, getting more mature and benefits coming through to a greater extent than this year. -- Thank you. -- Yeah. So ill wrap it quickly I think is three points. One, you can tell from the conversation today and from our remarks that we are focused first and foremost on pushing our operations forward with two primary goals. One is profitable subscriber growth. And secondly, free cash flow margins and yield, all of these operations even Switzerland, still very profitable on the free cash flow line. And our view is that each of the businesses when you aggregate them together, are free cash flow machine really, and that's exchanging the narrative a bit for you and something we will continue to do a better job of is getting you to rethink the narrative of our operations. And I think you should expect more of that from us.Strategically, we're always looking at ways of recognizing and crystallizing value both in our operations and then maybe new operation. So you should expect that we are very busy and looking at ways to both crystalized and realized value in our existing markets and possibly others but always doing that with an eye toward returns and value creation, nothing else. And then lastly, we continue to look at our capital structure and of course, I think our credibility on buybacks and the commitment to buying stock is one question. So it's just -- I can appreciate the need or the request for more disclosure on that but just be patient we're always looking at those things in parallel and so we'll have probably a much more to say about that, through the course of this year and the early part of next year and we appreciate your support.

Thank you operator and welcome everyone to our Q2 results call. And we always appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about our business, of course, and our broader strategic plans. And today we're sticking to the two-man show. So, Charlie, and I will handle the prepared remarks and then we'll engage the other key leaders as needed in Q&A.And I'll kick it off on Slide 3, which is entitled delivering 2019 priorities. We thought that, since we're halfway through the year it would be a good idea to revisit the key goals we laid out for you, nearly six months ago. These were the big needle movers in our minds and by all accounts, we're making or have made substantial progress. Number one of course, was completing the announced M&A transactions with Vodafone and Sunrise. As expected, the deal with Vodafone closed eight days ago with net proceeds of $11.3 billion and the Swiss deals in the midst of a Phase II regulatory review and we think is on track to close in the fourth quarter. Might be worth reminding everyone that these deals are a result of purposeful rebalancing, which saw a capitalize on the strategic and financial value of our fixed broadband and video networks in what is a converging marketplace in Europe and in each case generating double-digit OCF transaction multiples.Now secondly, earlier this year, we also talked about resetting our operating model and cost structure and that was in an attempt to reflect the reduced the size of our European platform and to unleash the efficiencies, which resulted in flat OpEx for three straight years.Charlie has a slide on this in his section but we are right on track if not a bit ahead of plan here on reducing our corporate costs and radically restructuring our technology services delivery platform, both of which will benefit OCF growth as we confirm our OCF guidance for the full year.The third major priority was reducing our capital intensity. As we look to optimize our recent investments in networks and products. Here, we are ahead of plan with P&E Additions through June down 25% year-over-year. And reflecting a number of factors including more efficient Lightning build cost in the U.K., the completion of Fixed & Mobile upgrades in Belgium. And more focused product development and the decision to slowdown CB swaps in the UK. While, we didn't provide guidance on operating free cash flow. I did mention on the call that we were looking at about 50% growth for the year excluding Switzerland and through six months, operating free cash flow was up nearly 75%. And as Charlie will show all of our opcos are generating significant operating free cash flow margins and growth and we are reconfirming our free cash flow guidance for the year.And then lastly, we highlighted of the importance of developing plans for allocating our excess capital. And our [Phonetic] realized that we've been relatively quiet about that. Mostly in anticipation of these transactions closing. As you would have seen yesterday we announced our first step with the $2.5 billion modified Dutch auction tender. This represents about 24% of our cash before completion of the Swiss transaction and roughly 30% of our outstanding shares. It would also bring total buyback to $3 billion for 2019 when you include the $500 million purchase during the first six months.Now the next slide on capital allocation tries to put this decision into context, a bit. Starting with the cash walk that illustrates how we get from the total transaction value for the Vodafone and Sunrise deals to our pro forma cash balance. I'll leave it to you to review if needed, but it shows pro forma cash of $14.4 billion or around $12 billion today before completion of the Swiss transaction. On the right hand side of the slide we lay out our capital allocation strategy for that cash with five areas of focus and beginning not surprisingly with buybacks. Now it should be clear that we fundamentally believe in the strategy having now bought back $21 billion of our shares over the last 15 years. But we will continue to be prudent and opportunistic and how and when we repurchased stock. And as we have done in the past, we'll continue to balance that against investments that create long-term value.Now we've used Dutch auction tenders effectively on several occasions in the past, some of you may remember. We like this approach. It gives us significant flexibility in how we size and price repurchases and it's easy and efficient to execute. The plan is a launch formally on Monday next week and to close in 20 business days thereafter. The current expected price range we set off of yesterday's close and is expected to be $25.25 to $29 for up to $625 million of Class A shares and $24.75 to $28.50 for up to $1.87 billion worth of Class C shares.And of course, we may consider additional tender offers down the road. We may return open market purchases, we may do neither we. We will make those decisions based on a number of factors, both internal and external at that time. And moving down the slide, it won't be a surprise to you that we continue to believe 4 times to 5 times leverage is the right capital structure for us. Of course, our net leverage today is something like 3 times, adjusting for the Vodafone proceeds. But on a gross basis, we expect to be at or below 5 times in all of our credit groups by the end of the year. Going forward, we may consider using cash to maintain these target leverage levels, but again we'll make those decisions at the time based upon financial performance, market conditions and things of that sort.Now, when it comes to deploying capital externally, we are first and foremost focused on our core operating markets. Remember, we still have considerable operating assets in Europe, totaling $31 million fixed and mobile subscribers and nearly $5 billion of operating cash flow and an additional $15 million Fixed & Mobile Subs and nearly $2 billion of operating cash flow coming out of our 50-50 JV in Holland. We are invested in these markets, we have confidence in their prospects and we will look to fortify or capitalize on our positions. If and only if, attractive and compelling opportunities arise. This is in our wheelhouse as they say, it shouldn't be a surprise to you.Now beyond our existing operations, we will be highly selective. I'll just say a few words here because this topic seems to generate quite a bit of commentary. One, we are more interested in buying, building and operating scale businesses in geographies and sectors we understand than spreading capital around. You know looking at the deals we've done over the last 15 years, they all had a few things in common, typically they represented long term scale-driven investments that leverage our deep technical and operational expertise, in most instances create synergies with existing businesses we own. They also allowed us to optimize the use of leverage, tax strategies and free cash flow. We can't find anything meet these -- have meet these criteria. We are likely to go back to the top of the page. It shouldn't be surprising and look at our stock and in our core markets, but again we're going to be disciplined and patient here.And then finally, we have a pretty successful ventures platform with investments that we conservatively value at about $1 billion today. These are generally smaller typically, minority interest or financial positions that we believe benefit our core operations will provide strategic value or insight or can lead to outsize financial returns. You may see us add to or subtract from that portfolio using relatively modest amounts of capital. I just want to be sure you understand that. And we will call out these investments should they ever happen as deals for the Ventures portfolio.Now moving to some operational updates. Beginning on Slide 5. We had a disappointing quarter on the subscriber front, there is no other way to describe it. But that's not the entire story, especially at Virgin and where the team has been focused on so many new strategies, mostly intended to drive ARPU and profitable growth. In the top left you'll see quarterly net adds for our base of 23 million fixed Broadband, Voice and Video RGUs excluding Switzerland. We've been averaging around 60,000 [Phonetic] net adds, per quarter over this period, reflecting good growth in Broadband and Voice and net losses in Video.In the second quarter of this year we saw steady Video losses but slower growth in Broadband and Voice, driven primarily by competitive market dynamics in the U.K. We're going to dig into Virgin results on the next slide and Lutz will comment during Q&A. But there are a few factors at work here. The U.K. market has definitely slowed down a bit with sales volumes off from prior period. At the same time competition has ratcheted up especially at the lower end of both Broadband and TV. In the midst of that Virgin is maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to customer acquisition and the capital expenditure, focused on higher value customers and not chasing after growth at the aggressive priced entry level of the market.Meanwhile, on the bottom left of the slide, you can see that we continue to grow our 5.9 million mobile subs in Europe with a strong postpaid quarter driven by new FMC bundles in the U.K., which is where we'd actually doubled the mobile attach rate and our new WIGO bundles in Belgium which doubled postpay adds compared to a year ago. The mobile business doing well.So the next few slides, provide a more detailed update on Virgin Media. Just a couple of key points here on Slide 6. The first is that we returned to modest ARPU growth in the second quarter despite continued headwinds in pay-per-view and phone usage revenues. In fact rental ARPU, a better indicator of our subscription business was up 1.2% in the quarter. We have reason to be encouraged about ARPU growth in the second half of the year. With the announcement of a 4.9% average consumer price increase effective in September and October. We've nearly -- 75% of customers who've been notified of the price rise and so far reaction has been consistent with expectations. In fact call volumes discounts have been lower than they were last year at this stage.And this year, the price rise is underpinned by substantial product innovation, like the launch of Intelligent WiFi and the new Virgin TV Go app. And we continue to push our speed leadership with 500 megabits available across our footprint and faster download and upload speeds offered to millions of customers without charge. Just as importantly, yeah, we remain committed to offering a best-in-class video experience and we were the first to launch Netflix on our box in the U.K. You know that. We've now added Amazon Prime, BT's 4K ultra high-def channel and a whole lot more content from Sky following the new multi-year agreement we signed last month. And absolutely all of the football available in the marketplace. Virgin is still the only super aggregator of content and sports in the U.K.And I've already addressed the lower volume figures at Virgin shown on the right hand side here. And while the broadband market share of net adds was steady and churn was in-line, gross adds were disappointing. Again a combination of a slower market and more promotional activity at the low end. And in Video, the focus was on higher value pay TV subscriptions versus a year ago, when Virgin triple-play price was nearly at parity with the double play product. Lutz and his team have their work cut out for them. There is no question about that, but there is good reason to be confident in their plans and the new product bundle called Oomph has seen sales accelerate modestly month-on-month since launch in early June and the majority of these sales were at the higher end ultimate package of 500 megabits, which includes Premium TV with sports and movies, unlimited data on a SIM card, priced at GBP99 per month. And this will be good for ARPU obviously.And as I mentioned the FMC strategy has doubled the mobile attachment rates and resulted in more postpaid net adds. And Virgin remains the broadband speed leader in a market where all any we can talk about these days from politicians to pundits is superfast broadband, which is a good segue to the next slide on Project Lightning.And I have three key points here. First, while it's an increasingly noisy marketplace when it comes to next generation networks and broadband rollouts. The Virgin is miles ahead of everyone else. We already have 15 million homes capable of 100 megabit speeds, while the rest of the market relies on a copper network that delivers top speeds of around 70 megabits per second. And we've already built out more new homes, then all of the competition combined. The second Lightning is absolutely working on an operational, consumer and financial level. We've built over 1.8 million premises as part of our U.K. network extension, including 232,000 in the first half of this year and with build costs coming down.Importantly with nearly 400,000 customers and almost 1 million RGUs have been added so far on the Lightning network with our earliest cohorts achieving penetrations of 35% after just four years. And ARPUs of over GBP45 are right in line with the rest of the business after discounts. Together this means that Lightning has delivered strong growth in revenue and operating cash flow both up something like 50% year-over-year and Charlie will break these numbers down even further in just a moment to show you how we're progressing.And lastly, there is no operator better positioned than Virgin to determine how this next wave of fixed infrastructure investment unfolds in the U.K. Listen, we absolutely applaud the government's ambitious broadband plans and which call for superfast broadband access for every U.K. home and business by 2025. On the flip side, we also agree with BT and others that this will be increasingly difficult and expensive for Openreach and under-capitalized fiber openness to achieve at least without substantial regulatory relief, which puts Virgin in an enviable position. We'll be at 1 gig across 15 million homes in about 24 months. That's four years ahead of Boris Johnson's schedule and we will be by far be the most important partner or platform for the remaining 10 million homes. You should expect us to be exploring every alternative to creatively finance and participate in this expansion of broadband connectivity in the U.K while preserving capital and optimizing free cash flow, so stay tuned.Now finally I'll close to the couple of quick slides in our Swiss business, which as you all know is in the midst of a turnaround plan that's hitting on all cylinders. Just to remind you, there are four key drivers of the plan beginning with transforming our TV proposition with our EOS and Horizon 4 video platform by far the markets most sophisticated cutting-edge service, which includes 4K, a voice remote, a Sleek user interface and cloud-based storage. This rollout is right on track for 50% penetration by year-end with 190,000 boxes already deployed and the product is working as well that's the most important thing and with NPS higher and churn and calls in truck rolls lower. That's what we want to see. The second driver of the turnaround plan is to continue to push the convergence agenda. So we know from Belgium and Holland that a good fixed mobile converged proposition improves NPS and reduce its churn and that's happening in Switzerland too. The mobile base already at 170,000 represents represents about 15% of broadband subs. And that's a good outcome.The third driver is all about broadband in future-proofing the network. The UPC customers already average 250 megabits per second, average speed delivered by far the highest in the marketplace, but the plan is to rollout one gig capabilities here in the fourth quarter of this year to further cement our position.And then finally, we are investing real OpEx and real CapEx into our simply digital initiative and this will be a multi-year process, but we're already well advanced in the journey, which by the way is very similar to how Sunrise has attacked these challenges and opportunities. So those are the drivers. And on Slide 9, we show some results. I know we talk about being right on plan and right on track. But we think it's important for our shareholders and Sunrise shareholders to see what that plan is and has been. So we've actually provided here our quarterly forecast on several metrics both historical and the remaining part of this year. So, let the numbers speak for themselves. And feel free review this at your leisure. But I'm guessing they'll get some attention in Switzerland, which is great. The punch line is that fixed RGU losses were better than plan in Q2. Mobile postpaid adds have been consistently higher than planned, underpinned by our unlimited offerings. We've exceeded absolute revenue forecast, supported by continued ARPU growth, BCS price increases in positive tier mixed results. And finally, we're ahead of plan on operating cash flow, which is a reminder includes our investment in simplification and digitalization and looks a little lumpy in Q1 and Q4 due to the timing of our investment in sports content.So all in all the Swiss plan is tracking to our internal forecast. The same numbers we shared with Sunrise and we couldn't be prouder -- I couldn't be prouder of the jobs, Severina and her team have done in Switzerland, it's a lot of information. I'll turn it over to Charlie now to go through the financial update and then we'll get right to your questions. Charlie? -- Thank you Mike. I'm on the slide entitled Revenue & OCF Growth. This is a summary of our key financial results and the group as a whole recorded negative revenue growth in the quarter of 0.9% and then OCF decline of 4.3%. Now, there were a number of one-offs impacting the OCF figures including around $12 million of severance from one-off retention payments. Some of these impacts of the U.K and Ireland, which reported negative OCF growth of 2.5%, a positive revenue growth of 0.4%. Belgium was also impacted with the loss of the media land contract, which resulted in a negative revenue and OCF growth of 1.5% and 3.6% respectively. Without this impact Belgium OCF growth would be broadly stable. Mike has discussed Switzerland in the Q2 performance remains in line with our financial expectations for the year despite reporting negative revenue growth of 3.9%, a negative OCF growth of 8.7% in the quarter.CEE had good revenue growth of 2.9% supported by new builds and B2B efforts in Poland with a slight decline in OCF due to programing cost increases. Central & Other reported TSA revenues of $60 million for the quarter and the net OCF cost of $90 million, which I will now address in more detail in the following slide, which we called Descaling Central. We think of central spend in two separate buckets, the first is more classical corporate spend, including the group functions for finance, legal, HR and development.We spent $260 million on these functions in 2018 and are on track to reduce this by 20% by 2020 as we support a smaller group post the disposals. The second category is our centralized spend in technology and innovation and probably this is the spend that we've taken out of our country operations and centralized in order to realize scale efficiencies.In 2018, this was around $800 million and we expect that to reduce to around $700 million this year and then around $600 million in 2020. A large amount of this spend is recharge to the companies we have sold including VodafoneZiggo and a formal [Phonetic] Austrian business, and we estimate that in 2019 if the disposals, to Vodafone and Sunrise that occurred on January 1st, this would have resulted in a net allocation to [Technical Issues] and our CEE businesses of around $250 million. Global revenues from the TSAs and projected to fall over the next four to five years. We intend to keep the net allocation to Virgin and CEE broadly flat during that period, as we're able to flex down the costs of the centralized activities.Moving to the next slide titled P&E Additions. For Q2, we reported P&E Additions excluding Switzerland at around $600 million or 24% of revenue, representing a 25% year-on-year reduction. Including Switzerland we still reduced our CapEx spend by 21% year-over-year and continue to target a reduction of approximately 20% for the full year. The decrease was largely driven by the U.K. as the prior-year run into the V6 set-top box has now been largely concluded, and there has been a reduced cost per Lightning premise.In Belgium, we completed the Fixed & Mobile Network upgrades as well as some significant IT project spend. So the only operation to report an increase with Switzerland, which relates to the growth investments into the UPC TV rollout, the one-gig upgrade and the digitization program.On Slide 14, we said at the OCF in CapEx for our key divisions and how this translates into OFCF, operating free cash flow for the first half. Now we split Virgin into lightening and our core cable businesses as they are very different OFCF characteristics. And we will also allocate at the central T&I cost through our retained assets, using the same methodology as we use for the TSA agreements. Now as the revenue growth in the call cable business is slow. We are seeing significant OFCF generation and in the first half of this year. It's up nearly 40% to $993 million. Now if you are up at the investment in Lightning, the figure for the first half of the year would be $1.15 billion . Lightening continues to be a major investment for us and we spent $235 million of CapEx year-to-date, resulting in an OFCF cash outflow of $157 million.However, OCF growth is very strong with half one estimated OCF up over 50%, $78 million. Now as you can see from the slide, Belgium is converting $0.29 and every dollar into OFCF and if you include the recharges the U.K ex-lightning and Holland have slightly lower margins and come about $0.23 and $0.25 of a dollar respectively. Now, the lower margin in the U.K. is largely because they rent a mobile network so the MVNO rather than one.First, in Holland, we expect the margin to rise as they continue to realize the synergies after they merged with Vodafone which has largely been achieved in the comparable merger and in Telenet. Now remember because of the tax attributes in both the U.K. and Holland unlike Belgium, there is no cash tax payment in other market making them very efficient free cash flow generating assets.Finally, despite the investment in the turnaround plan Switzerland remains a very cash generative asset with an OFCF margin of 24% including recharges despite increased CapEx spend. Turning to the next slide, we summarize the result in free cash flow conversion. We've broken down the free cash flow to show before and after working capital and operational finance. In Q2, the free cash flow before these items was $511 million for the quarter. In contrast to Q1, there were no cash interest payments and you'll see a similar picture in the second half with significant interest payments in Q3 and then in Q4. Tax paid in the quarter was the payment of our 2018 accruals for Poland and the United States, which are only current taxpayers other than Telenet. In terms of preference [Phonetic] the company has reconfirmed its guidance for shareholder distributions of EUR400 million to EUR600 million for the full year. However, year-to-date, the JV is only disbursed $25 billion and we expect the balance during the second half of the year. You should note that our share of the EUR400 million to EUR600 million include shareholder loan repayments to us of around EUR100 million, which we do not include within our adjusted free cash flow definition.Our working capital and operational finance line was positive in Q2 at $35 million, resulting in adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $546 million. For the full year, we expect this category to be slightly positive and a source of cash flow. We remain on track for our full-year free cash flow guidance of $550 million to $600 million and that includes our estimated $400 million to $500 million negative free cash flow from the Project Lightning.On the next slide entitled Balance Sheet. We set out our current leverage debts. Pro forma for the Vodafone transaction Q2 gross leverage is 5.2 times. But net of the deal proceeds, it' is 3 times. We remain committed to the 4 times to 5 times leverage ratio for the group. And we'll continue our policy of long tenure-debt maturities and fully hedging FX and interest rate exposures. As of Q2, our average life is around seven years and a weighted average cost of debt is around 4.1%.As a result of the disposal of certain CEE countries, as part of the Vodafone transaction, we repaid the $1.6 billion UPC term loan resulting in a leverage ratio at UPC of 4.6 times. Upon the sale of UPC Switzerland, we will transfer the remaining UPC bonds to Sunrise and we pay the rest of the facility marking the end of a 20-year history of borrowing under the UPC Group. We proposed to relever the Eastern European assets of Poland and Slovakia to around 4 times. Following the completion of the Swiss disposal, representing additional debt of approximately $900 million.So moving to the conclusion slide. The sale of UPC Switzerland remains on track and the business fundamentals continue to improve. In the U.K, the annual price rise has been announced and our Sky content negotiation has been completed in line with our budget is assumptions. We continue to see strong OFCF and free cash flow generation in our core cable assets and we are reconfirming our 2019 guidance target.With that, over to you operator for questions.The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Maurice Patrick with Barclays. -- Good morning, guys. I'm with Maurice [Phonetic], [Indecipherable]. Just a couple of questions, please on the U.K. And it's really might touch in your comments about pushing on investments in some of the comments and Johnson around investments in next generation access. There has been some press reports about you are looking at investing beyond project lightning and I'll let hear your thoughts around sort of long-term investment once Lightning is done? And the answer could also touched upon -- entertain the idea of offering wholesale access to your network all thoughts on wholesale access in that you can have changed. Thank you so much. -- Hi, Maurice, this is not -- but there's a lot of questions there. On wholesale access our position has been pretty consistent across Europe, which is we don't think it's a particularly good idea and it discourages investment in infrastructure by cable, which is the only competitive platform out there to the phone operators. On the other hand, we have had to utilize it in Belgium where was acquired. And in some instances we have in the past, looked at a voluntary or I would say private negotiation, so we're opportunistic. And I think we're creative in how we approach it. But I was certainly our position has always been from a regulatory point of view, it should not be mandated. And in some instances we have in the past, looked at whether we would partner with companies who might be interested in utilizing the network, but that is a private transaction not one determined or priced by the government, big differences there. That's what I'd say.In terms of building beyond Lightning, we think the Lightning footprint that we originally estimated a 4 million homes, and we talked about half of those or most is is still attractive to us and we're evaluating certainly market-by-market and city-by-city, how to do that in the most effective and efficient manner. On the other hand, as I mentioned in my remarks. There is quite a bit of activity occurring across the marketplace and there is at least another 10 million homes that somebody is going to build. I don't see us doing that on balance sheet as a lightening like project, where we're funding it out of our operating free cash flow. But Virgin is by far the best partner, if somebody is looking to build those homes, because we have bring obviously a great brand ability to penetrate quickly and potentially outside capital to do something off balance sheet.So let's just say that we are in the mix as we should be in any discussions about building the next wave of networks outside of where we already have built superfast broadband. We feel like our 50 million homes at 1 gig ready going to 10-Gig is it for that footprint, but beyond that footprint, we're going to be opportunistic, to see if we can put capital to work off balance sheet, without consolidating losses and activities potentially with partners just to get Virgin possibly in the Virgin brand to a national scale, wouldn't that be great if Virgin was a national brand, not a regional brands in half the marketplace. We know on footprint, we generate 50% market share. We beat BT, we beat Sky on footprint and in Video and Broadband, we know that.If we could extend our footprint potentially using other people's networks who are participating in our balance sheet -- type network construction that can be pretty interesting. So it's all very preliminary and it's work, you would expect us to do. But abiding by the points I made in my remarks, which we're looking at opportunities that are capital efficient, optimize free cash flow and largely off balance sheet. That's a longer answer than you probably wanted, but hopefully that's clear. -- No, it's great, thanks so much indeed.We'll move now to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. -- Good morning, guys. Hello, hey, good morning. Can you hear me? -- Hi, Ben. Yeah, we got you. -- Okay. Hey, Mike. I know you made some comments earlier Mike about sort of the rationale behind the tender, but I just want to come back and ask my sense of maybe I just misinterpreted, I sense over the last couple of calls as you guys were sort of suggesting that the cash was not going to burn a hole in your pocket. You're going to take your time etc. etc. And obviously you still have a lot of capacity, so I'm not. I get the numbers, but I just was wondering if anything change between May and now to lead you to launch the tender for $2.5 billion . And if there is any sort of change in how you're thinking about allocating that capital that we should be aware of?And then secondly on the subscriber trends in the U.K, you mentioned competitive environment, I'm just wondering as you look out through the back half of this year, do you see that getting any better? Any initiatives you guys have on either churn management is probably for Lutz? Or new bundles to help try to drive that? Or maybe you're just focus more on EBITDA and ARPU and you're not going to chase subs. So I just love an update there? -- Sure. Lutz, why don't you work up and answer to the U.K. question. On the tender, I don't think our position has changed materially, I mean if we had announced this morning, a $2.5 billion buyback program that would have taken us based as you know on rules and restrictions pretty long time to get that money put that money to work. So, it's our view that these Dutch auction tenders are efficient. You can launch them and be done in 20 business days. We're not suggesting, this is the only one. We'll see what happens to the market or our alternative uses of capital. What I meant to say on patients was really about and discipline was really related to transactions outside our core markets and let's say in new markets or new opportunities. There seems to be a fair amount of concern at least I hear it and our IR guys here it that we're going to turnaround and buy something nonsensical -- in a sector or a market where we have no expertise or no capabilities and that's not what we're going to do and the patients in the discipline comment was really related to opportunities outside of our core markets where our core capital structure.And I'm not, --- I'm certain we have those capabilities to do interesting things. We're just going to be very, very selective about those. In the meantime, we will look at where the stock trades and we'll look at what other opportunities we have to be to solidify and grow the businesses that we already own and operate, which we think are substantial great free cash flow generators and have the ability to be revalued in this environment. So no, question that our stock today has zero value, Virgin Media, which is incredible to me. So we know there is huge opportunity to create value and demonstrate value in the U.K. based on our cash flow characteristics. On our market position, our strategic opportunities and you don't have to be heroic in your assumptions about what that value might be on any metric to know this stock is undervalued. So we're going to look at that, I would say quarter to quarter. Every six months, we are going to be thoughtful about what the best allocation of capital is, but the patience and the discipline comment [Phonetic] was really more geared toward doing things outside of our core business today. -- Got it. -- Lutz, you want to address the U.K. point? -- Yeah. Yeah. Hi, Ben. And so before I give you a bit of an outlook. Just maybe one number to compare a bit the market size right. Broadband market Q2 2018, 171,000 net adds on openreach in our network. I neglect the ordinance, this year 14,000 right. So the market is materially down and our churn like-for-like, has been stay the 50%. So this about gross adds in that market. And I think we, if you compare our number. We've got almost close to 50% of the entire market or 80% onto our coverage. Right. What we are not doing is changing for the low end of the market and right, I mean, there is Vodafone, there is now broadband from Sky, GBP17-GBP20 [Phonetic], we are not fishing in that segment. So therefore you won't see us changing our strategy in that direction. What will help us in the future I think is four things. So we have launched Fix Mobile convergence, and mid of June with our campaign that has already helped you see that in the mobile subscriber although it's only, less than one month of mass market launch in Q2 and that is you see a steady growth that leads to a lower churn and higher ARPU. So this is really a momentum. We will be using going forward more and more. Number two and as Mike has said earlier on right we have all soccer available, we've very strong sport package, so Q3 is about that. In general, Q3 and Q4 are the strongest quarters in terms of sales, so therefore we are prepared for that and we are leveraging more and more digital in that, so our digital share of channel is increasing.So therefore, already in July, we've seen materially higher sales numbers. But however, having said that, don't forget that we have put our price rise forward by two months. -- Yeah. -- So compared to last year. So therefore, you will, we will eat up some of these additional sales, we are already generating by some churn; however, that was planned. And as Mike said earlier on 75% of letters and emails have been sent out and reaction is better than last year, but last year we had also a bit the UKTV struggle going on. So that's why it is as expected. -- Okay, that's great color. Thank you.And we'll move now to Christian Fangmann with HSBC. -- Yeah, good morning. I was just following up on the buybacks, I think the plan is a bit below what the Street was expecting. I mean for H2 definitely a big number, but beyond that, so I was curious, are you updating us then on a quarterly basis or it can also be in between quarters? If you think you may do more tenders because you just mentioned. It may not be the last one you do so and interested in your view on that one. And then, so maybe on the U.K. I mean, you signed a new deal with Sky, a content deal and I think for the full year, you had to content cost going up to GBP60 million to GBP80 million, I think. What's the guidance for the year? And can you maybe give some color if you are more toward the higher end, the mid-end or the lower end? So that would be -- interested in that one and yeah, [Speech Overlap]. -- I think the Sky deal, Lutz, you correct me. I think the Sky deal is where we thought it would be. So, but you can provide some color on that later, if I missed it, but a pretty shared we're right on where we thought we would be in terms of what we might have forecast you on the guidance in terms of the buybacks, I think what I said in my remarks, I'll repeat which is could do more of these. We could launch the tender buyback programs, as we've done in the best or we could do neither. It doesn't, it's not a good idea for me to signal to you. Well, we're going to do these every quarter and people will be interested in selling shares and won't be tendering and we're interested in owning more share.So my goal here for shareholders who are going to be long-term shareholders is to acquire shares at the most efficient price that we can acquire them. At this point this is all we've got going on. And so I don't anticipate quarterly updates on our \"tender offer\" activities, but if we are to launch additional tenders down the road, you're likely not to know about that until we do it, I mean that's kind of how it works.So, I don't believe this is something that we are going to discuss on a quarterly basis. I think we're going to look at how this particular transaction performs and our ability to efficiently acquire more of a company we believe in and then we'll make decisions and we will be looking at it of course quarterly and making decisions about how best to utilize capital on a quarterly basis, but I don't know that we will be signaling to you in our earnings call, every quarter exactly what we may or may not do. Just as we didn't signal to you, up until this particular tender what we were going to do, because we're still evaluating those options real time.Lutz on the Sky deal, you want to just confirm what I said, pretty sure that's [Speech Overlap]? -- Yeah, put it, of course, we cannot really disclose any details. I think what I can say is the general idea was between Sky and us to create win-win potential when we close the deals of future growth of revenue jointly and I can say we have managed to do so. Right. So we can now jointly monetize UHD together, we got much more boxes. So we are able to monetize that, sell that our customers we are able now to really integrate Sky movie into our Liberty Go apps to increase usage here and we've got a lot of additional benefits. So therefore, right. It's both. Is it in the range we have expected as Mike said, it is -- but I think more importantly, we found a way to make up for the cost in increased business both on price increases, but also simply saying selling higher value packages to the customers and this is exactly what we are doing. -- Okay. And maybe one follow-up if I may. And also on Virgin, I think there was some news yesterday from Virgin and the Virgin is addressing of comes -- ongoing review of the broadband pricing and related efforts to protect customers running out of the minimum contract period. So it looks like Virgin may address 100,000 customers that are vulnerable. I would call is kind of disable pensioners, unemployed people. So can you maybe quantify the effect or the cost embedded to that kind of approach that Virgin is taking for 2020 maybe? [Speech Overlap]. -- I think it's very small, Christian. So it's a smaller attempt and at the end -- right. If you do that and you are customer-centric, you come to much lower churn and with these customers. Right. So therefore, I think the impact on 2020 is neglectable. -- Okay, great Thank you.We'll move now to James Ratzer with New Street Research. -- Yes, good morning. Thank you very much indeed. I had two questions please. The first one, just going back to the topic of use of proceeds please. Here what you said so far, but it was just wondering if you could talk us through how you see some of the relative merits of some of the deals that are kind of being discussed. I mean mobile in the U.K. is one area, but I think in the past you've been nervous about mobile performance. I mean you now feeling more comfortable with that. There's also been some speculation, you might look in Latin America, I mean given your comments about geographical focus. Are you able to rule out categorically doing any deal in Latin America with the capital you have, I mean, thoughts around kind of deals in the Benelux area as well, interesting that you're kind of preference, order and thinking around those kind of options and then follow-up question I had is just going back to the price rise in the U.K. I mean how do you weigh that up against what your market share tolerance is? I mean I'm looking at BT, who has been taking price for a while, and it seems like they've now had to reverse engines a bit and say, they are no longer willing to cede share because their pricing approach led to customer losses. How do you think about that computational trade off going forward? Thank you. -- James, on the use of proceeds. I'm not going to get into that here on this call. I can just repeat what I said, which is, we'll look at things in our core markets first, as we should. And then possibly consider things outside our core markets if they make sense and fit pretty -- a pretty tight group of criteria for us. So I hear what you're asking. And I'm sure it would be, great info, but it's not prudent of me to get into the relative merits. So any one transaction or any one opportunity as things unfold and become real we'll certainly comment on them. You want to talk about the price increase? -- Yeah. -- I mean, Yes, I do. Thanks, Mike. So we are growing still market share. Right. I mean, although it was not the strongest quarter in general. This quarter we have flat, but in general we are growing market share. According to our information, our churn is substantially lower than from the competitor you mentioned. And so far customer reaction is in line, I mean, don't forget we are targeting the high-value segment of the market. And we spend a lot of money for increased speed, now intelligent WiFi, better content, higher upload speed, step-top boxes, and also a lot of money in better service.So, and I think we are not in the position to say, do we really shrink as a business or not. And I think when you look at the U.K. market you see higher competition on sales. Gross debt market, but you see still a pretty rational approach in the customer base. Right. Sky has taken price rise, Netflix has taken price rise, TalkTalk has taken price rise, even BT has taking price rise on the BT Sports packages. So I think we have not a reason to change our approach here. -- Yeah, I mean, Sky took a 5% price rise in April, as you guys would have seen. Which by the way, we did not pass through to our customers. So our price rise will, to some extent compensate us for not having pass through this Sky price rise to our customers. So I think that's noteworthy. That helps James. -- Got it. Mike just thank you for that, just -- yeah and that's great. Thank you. Just going back to the point out, I mean what outside your core markets might look more attractive than doing a deal within your existing core markets today? -- But I mean, again, I'm not going to get into that with you. I think that would be smart for us to start -- either divulging or if we have things pre-empting those kinds of opportunities. It's just not a good idea. It would be a generic conversation and I don't think it would be particularly useful for you. I did describe that we like businesses and have always benefited. I think from owning and operating businesses that have scale capability that are in our wheelhouse around technology and in subscription and businesses that we understand well. We know who we are, we know who were not. So you can look backwards perhaps to look forward.And at one point, we were operating at 40 different countries around the world. So there's very few places we haven't done business. It doesn't mean we're interested in doing business in most places today, I'm simply saying that we have a pretty long history of I think in investing in the types of opportunities that we think fit our profile. But to be specific about a territory or market or an opportunity would be good at this point. -- All right. Thank you, Mike. -- You got it.And Evercore's, Vijay Jayant has our next question. -- James Ratcliffe. -- Hi, Vijay, sorry. -- Hi, it's James Ratcliffe. Just on the -- now that you the Vodafone check is cleared and you've got the cash on the balance sheet. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trade-offs between having a lot of liquidity available for opportunities and I think Liberty had generally done well by having liquidity when others didn't historically versus the negative arbitrage associated with account. Because it would -- back-of-the-envelope be $100 million bucks a quarter or so. And do you have flexibility to essentially reduce that negative arbitrage, while still keeping a lot of liquidity readily available, should opportunities arise? Thanks. -- You mean the negative arbitrage on our debt basically? -- Yeah. Not just having cash versus having [Speech Overlap]. -- Yeah, I got you, I got you. So I think it's -- I -- just a couple of answers to that. One, I think having the liquidity as you point out, is a huge advantage. One thing, John and I have seen, and many of you have seen is market volatility comes and goes. And there are many -- there's, it is always good to be in a cash position when you don't know what the future brings. And that's more opportunistic than anything. And so there isn't, while there is a cost of carry, there is certainly an opportunity cost, and I'm not having liquidity. So, as you say right rightly we balance that off and we balance it off dynamically. I'm actually generating cash Charlie and the team are charged with one of the reasons we put all the money into dollars is we believe we can generate a better return on that capital than we could in euros or any other currency.And so Charlie and the treasury team are going to do their best to generate a maximum amount of return that can be prudently achieve on that capital. And so that will certainly help a little bit. And then if necessary and on occasion, as we talked about around leverage -- we'll trim here or there, so if needed. So I think it's going to be a combination of things as you rightly say, a little tension between liquidity and opportunity and cost of carry. But if we can get the treasury guys to work their magic, hopefully we can shrink that a little bit. Charlie, you want to add anything? -- Yeah, the one -- just, I don't think is 100 in a quarter. I think it's the cost of debts for if in U.S. dollars, you're getting something north of 2. So it's roughly a 2% negative carry and pro forma for the buyback. We got about $12 billion . So it's more like $240 million is the bid offer in terms of the cost of the option. And as Mike said, you know, we'll continue to evaluate the best way to run that negative carry, but it's no -- it's not a $100 million a quarter that thing. -- Great, thank you. -- Yeah, few clarification. Okay. James.. We'll move now to Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark. -- Thank you. You have to feel fairly vindicated on VodafoneZiggo given the turnaround there, the fastest growth business in Q2. How do you feel about the fixed mobile convergence benefits? I mean, did they come in line with what you expected where that you've been higher? Is there anything, any runway still on getting that? And then clearly, if you get a little more expansive on the VodafoneZiggo valuation your stock gets even more ridiculously inexpensive. And when you look. -- I know you're not going to comment too specifically on any search transaction on unwinding the JV, but it logically traded at somewhat lower multiple and those those synergies are pretty much been realized at this point. I think it's an asset that maybe the Street maybe including myself is neglecting a little bit. Thanks. -- Yeah, good question. First of all the synergies, haven't all been realized. I believe we're only about halfway through the synergies. They may or may not of address that. So that new American probably [Phonetic], but my understanding is that we're only about halfway through the synergies originally projecting $210 million. And I think as we've indicated likely to exceed that just because we always do in these types of businesses. And I do agree with you. It's been terrific to see the business return to revenue growth and good OCF growth and raise their expectations around that. And it is a function of both the natural synergies that occurred fixed mobile and mergers, there is a reason why we repaid 12 times for Germany, because the synergies are massive and they are real and they work for a mobile and fixed platforms. And we have proven this out now and how many transactions, I can even keep count in Europe so far.And as you striving all positive indicators there and we're pretty excited about how they are performing as a team. What is worth is you can come up come to that value math in a bunch of different ways. Whether it's a levered free cash flow yield or operating free cash flow multiple even an EBITDA multiple. I would suggest we would think there's very little value against if I stop [Phonetic] for that business today, but we continue to be supportive of it. We think the team has done a great job. We think it's been a terrific partnership with Vodafone and we're both really pleased with the business as it sits today. -- Thanks, Mike. -- Anybody want to add to that? Charlie on the board anyone add to that? -- I think it's going very well. In fact, I think in some respects, it could be even more successful in Telenet, which is obviously one comparable, you could look at the free cash flow conversion, as they are growing all the synergies should drive toward the similar type of margins that Telenet's get. So I think I agree with Mike. It's a very attractive asset but the larger it has performed [Phonetic]. -- Thank you.We'll go next to Pivotal Research Group's, Jeff Wlodarczak. -- Hi, guys. Hey, guys. One of the U.K. and one on Belgium. U.K. you've had a number of one-offs, hitting EBITDA mainly of higher network taxes but as far as I know, are not going higher after 2020 and you've obviously got a large program price increase this year. Do you feel comfortable that the core U.K. business is going to be able to sustainably grow EBITDA, once you get past these overhangs? And then on Telenet, Mike, I wanted to get your thoughts on this wholesale situation. It just seems like a regulator just wants the wholesale price to go down and is continually trying to push it down and trying to force you guys to do a single play. How do you push back against that? -- Well, let Lutz cook up his views on the U.K. question. I think the Belgium wholesale question remains a thorn in our side and as I've said many times, and John Porter has said many times, it's a highly political marketplace and we do the best we can to address those politics and to point out the absurdity in some cases of what they're proposing. We fight them in court, we appeal in the EU. We do all the things were supposed to do. We're askable and opinion there but at the end of the day, we know that the way in which they're trying to regulate this market is wrong -- fundamentally wrong.Now the flip side of that is we're doing pretty well either way. If you look at Orange Belgium, their subscriber base on our platform is not that material. I think it's roughly 130,000 subs-140,000 subs. So the amount of revenue \"at risk\" in a wholesale change of pricing is not that material either. So I don't want to overstate the impact of what may or may not occur in the regulatory side. On the other hand, I do want to, -- I don't want to understate and I want to be sure, it's clear that we don't agree with the way in which they are approaching this market. And in Holland where we have similar conversations, it's much more reasonable and rational. We also don't agree with what they -- how they're approaching it, but on the other hand it looks to be they're coming at it from a certainly more healthier point of view.So we fight the good fight. I mean I think the good news is it's not a material impact, at least based on current wholesale revenues. We can't be certain how it will unfold. All I can tell you is we keep fighting the good fight and we're as focused on this as anything. And it is -- it does really feel to us to the extent you're concerned about contagion or anything else, it does really feel focused in the Benelux, partially because of the success cable has had in those markets for decades, not just recently Telenet's market share is quite substantial relative to Proximus and others and -- and VodafoneZiggo is a market leader. So I think it's partly a reaction to that and partly reaction to politics, part of which we control and obviously the rest of it, we just, we can't. So I hope that's helpful. Was there another question, Jeff? -- Yeah, that's the on U.K. -- Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead, Lutz. -- Yeah. So I mean we have -- we did a consumer strategy right, which is 80% of the business in Virgin Media, last autumn and we came up with four growth drivers. Right. One is fixed mobile convergence. This is launched now. Early signs are positive, but that takes a while. We have 20% fixed mobile converged customers, when you look at VodafoneZiggo or a Telenet, they have more than double of that. Right. So huge opportunity for lower churn and higher ARPU. And for us here. Early stage, but positive signs. Second one is base management. I mean we have higher speed. We have now intelligent WiFi leads to higher customer satisfaction. We are going to launch Horizon 4, our new video platform, which has been launched in Belgium and Switzerland so far. So the idea is simply to leverage that and to get to a lower churn.Then, we run a digital transformation program. The impact this huge. It's a big change for the company, but others have done that successfully. Why wouldn't we do it and then more segmented sales. And the more the market is mature, the more the go-to-market has been segmented so MDUs, the so SOHO machine leveraged closer, as the consumer machine. So therefore, we believe that when all these growth drivers are in place, of course, we will come to grow again. I'm not in a position to give any guidance, also headwinds from network taxes and also content costs are getting down a bit in the future. So both should help to get back to growth. -- But we do have headwinds. I mean just to your point, Jeff. Next year there are, we do still have increases in both year-over-year in network taxes and program. So we'll provide more visibility on that as we get obviously into our guidance for the following year. But there still is some, there are headwinds there. Having said that I think Lutz is on, is actually absolutely right. We're doing all the things that we think we need to do in that market to grow the base and to grow profitably, and to drive cash flow in particular, free cash flow. I think that brings us to the top of the hour, so I'll just close it out.First of all, appreciate everyone joining, second, I'll just repeat that we feel like we're doing what we told you we would do at the beginning of the year. Number one, we get these deals closed like people didn't think we would, we always felt we would and we got them closed on original terms and that's important to us. We're driving cost down in the corporate, in T&I space in our company. That's critical, as we descale, we need to descale of what we do and how we do it and a lot of good work happening there, which I think will benefit both the operating cash flow and operating free cash flow. We're driving CapEx down actually not 20% to 25% through the first half of the year and that hasn't been difficult and it hasn't had an impact material impact at all on our abilities to create growth. And we're delivering on the promise to put capital to work. We didn't waste any time -- it's only been a few days since we closed that deal, and we're out and about. We're excited about getting the tender launched formerly on Monday, stay tuned for for that paperwork and those details.Thanks for joining us and well, we'll speak to you soon.

Thanks, operator, and welcome, everyone. We're glad you joined us this morning or this afternoon wherever you maybe. The plan is to jump right into prepared remarks, so there's plenty of time for questions and I'm joined by most of my senior executive team who I'll try to get involved in the Q&A, so you can hear from them as well.Now as usual, we are speaking off of slides. So, hopefully you've got those in front of you or you can grab them later. There's some good information in there. And then what I'll do, I'll kick off on slide four with the key highlights from the first quarter. I think it goes without saying that this is an incredibly exciting and strategic inflection point for this company.As you all know, we're on the verge of completing a series of transactions that will leave us with a more concentrated operating platform in Western Europe that serves an aggregate of 33 million RGUs and generates $4.8 billion of consolidated operating cash flow at the opco level and another $2 billion through our 50-50 JV in Holland and over $15 billion of cash and liquidity realized through asset sales at prices that are nearly twice our current implied trading multiple.John and I were talking the other day and we can't remember a time actually when a business was so well positioned to create value for shareholders. Not surprisingly then, the first few bullets on this slide address the status of those transactions beginning with the Vodafone deal, and for anyone watching it closely, which I'm guessing a few of you are you know that consistent and material progress has been made with the European Commission and as a result we remain confident of a summer closing. I'm happy to take questions on any of that.The sale of UPC Switzerland is also winding its way through the regulatory process. The transaction was officially notified to the Swiss Competition Authority on the 1st of May, which starts the process of review. The timing here looks more like Q4 to us and of course we'll be updating you as we move along the way.And as almost a footnote we also completed the sale of our DTH business in Central and Eastern Europe for EUR180 million. On the right hand side of the slide, you'll see some headline operating results for the first quarter shown on a reported basis and on a guidance basis with the key difference being that the guidance figures exclude Switzerland. So, I'll just focus on the second set of numbers in the white box that correspond to our guidance.During the quarter we added 68,000 new RGUs about twice the prior year growth and up significantly from 16,000 in the fourth quarter. Revenue growth was largely flat year-over-year and OCF grew about 1% which is consistent with our guidance for the full year of flat to down OCF growth and reflects headwinds in the U.K. that we foreshadowed a couple of months ago. Three other key takeaways from our Q1 operating results are highlighted here.First Virgin Media had a strong RGU quarter with higher net adds sequentially and year-over-year. UPC Switzerland is starting to show emerging green-shoots from the core elements of our turnaround plan, and I'll speak about that. And as expected, we saw a significant reduction in CapEx spend of almost 30% in the quarter, which drove operating free cash flow up 2.5 times from the year earlier period. That is of course one of the big story lines this year and I'll dig into all three of these headlines in the next few slides as will Charlie in his remarks.The slide five shows a bit more detail on net add growth by quarter and by product. Now, if you just focus on the orange section of the bar you'll see that broadband growth has been steady and about 35,000 to 40,000 each quarter for this continuing set of operations and was up meaningfully in Q1 this year to 57,000. Two key drivers here.First, we continue to push our speed leadership with 500 megabits rolled out nationwide at the end of last month in the U.K. and gigabit launches across our markets. And second we're committed to a better WiFi experience for all. With our Connect boxes now installed in two-thirds of our base and the launch of Intelligent WiFi and our cutting-edge Connect app.Video losses were roughly evenly split between Virgin and Belgium in the quarter. Churn on the SFR footprint impacted Telenet's QM result, but with subscriber migration now complete and improved operational performance is expected from Q2 onwards and Virgin continues to target high-value TV customers as we seek to monetize our investments in content and functionality, and this approach has led to some softness in the Q1 intake, but should ultimately yield ARPU and churn benefits.You'd have also seen that we announced a multiyear partnership with Amazon Prime Video in the U.K. starting this summer 2019. So, we'll put the prime video app on our Ultra HD TV set-top box and similar to earlier agreements with like Netflix. This enhances our strategy of combining the very best OTT apps and offerings with our own world-class content and TV functionality to create a seamlessly integrated experience. That's where it's heading. EOS and Horizon4 are doing exactly what we hoped.Together, they're a one-two punch, a faster 4K box and the best UI in Europe and everywhere we've rolled out one or both NPS is up and consumers are loving it. And then lastly we're well positioned on fixed-mobile convergence. Belgium and Holland are of course fully converged today and reaping the benefits of lower churn and higher NPS while the U.K. and Switzerland which I'll talk about in a second are MVNO-based and just really getting started.All-in total postpaid mobile add including Switzerland were over 70,000 in the quarter. And the next couple of slides beginning on page six provide a bit more detail on our largest operation, Virgin Media. And you can see on the left-hand side customer net adds or new homes connected were up sequentially and year-over-year at 25,000.It helped deliver nearly 60,000 RGU net adds. It's important to point out that growth was a result of the improved performance in lightning and non-lightning areas and supported by market-leading broadband bundles that really helped drive a 10 basis point improvement in 12-month rolling churn.Now I'll talk more about the plans in place to drive continued growth in the consumer business in a second. You'd also see that Q1 ARPU is modestly lower year-over-year after four quarters of positive growth and there are a few factors at play here most of which were not part of our ongoing subscription revenue. First of all Virgin had lower install revenue in Q1 2019 versus 2018 as we ramp down the number of CPE upgrades and saw a related reduction in activation fees.As in prior quarters, we saw lower telephony usage, but we also experienced lower pay-per-view revenue largely due to fewer boxing events in the first quarter. And then finally the team did increase the depth of promotional discounts on certain bundles in response to market dynamics particularly in January and February.It's important to note that the pay-per-view revenue had been the same as last year. ARPU growth would have been positive. It's also important to note that we continue to target an improvement in ARPU throughout the balance of the year on the back of new consumer bundles, which launched at the end of April and a series of product innovations that Lutz and his team had been working on that I'll highlight on the next slide.On the right-hand side of this slide though we provide an update on Project Lightning, which continues to drive financial operating and strategic value for Virgin. Everyone's talking about building out the U.K.'s next great network and we're the only ones actually doing it today with 500 megabits available nationally on our footprint a 1-gig cities rolling out and 400,000 to 500,000 new homes added to our network every year.Today, we've built and released 1.7 million new homes across the U.K. and Ireland more than the entire market combined and we've added 370,000 new customers and 900,000 RGUs on those networks. ARPUs and penetration rates are in line with expectation. The cost per premise continues to decline as we get smarter and the revenue in OCF on a project level were up 50% year-over-year. With unlevered IRRs in the mid-20s we are as committed as ever to this build-out and as you might expect are exploring creative ways to expand or partner or finance expansion beyond our current plans.I'm sure you've all seen the announcement that Lutz Schuler will be assuming the CEO role at Virgin Media starting June 11th. I am extremely thankful to Tom Mockridge, who over the last six years really transformed Virgin Media into a dynamic market share leader in broadband and video delivering a 5% annual growth in OCF through his tenure and positioning the company for continued leadership in video with V6 launch and Horizon4 around the corner.In broadband with 500 megabits speeds everywhere 1-gig cities popping up and in convergence with the best MVNO deal we have in Europe. Now having said that, I'm thrilled that Lutz is here to take the reins. He has been a star performer in Germany and since September of last year has set the stage for a revamp of our consumer business at Virgin.This slide seven highlights a few of those strategies. Most of which are incubating, but some of which have already rolled out like Virgin's new FMC bundles which launched April 29th and have already delivered encouraging results with mobile attachment rates.For example our new V.VIP bundle offers it all. 500 megabit broadband speeds at seven times faster than the competition, a mobile SIM with unlimited data, full house TV with Sky premiums, two V6 set-top boxes and inclusive any time landline calls all for around GBP100 per month on a 12-month contract. Customers can also add a mobile SIM with a broad choice of data bundles to all our standard packages, which comes with additional speed boost.Our research shows that people want convergence. They're craving the increased simplicity that FMC brings with a single bill and access the information about their fixed to mobile services along with a dedicated service team and of course the speed boost.Now it's still early days. Above-the-line activity will start in mid-June, but this product should also drive improved churn and underpin ARPU growth that it has in another markets. Lutz and his team have also been working hard to keep improving customer experience and engagement with products like Personal Picks which offers customers attractively priced video bolt-ons that they can add onto their entry-level player TV service.As I mentioned, we've also launched Intelligent WiFi to improve the in-home experience to our broadband customers using the Connect2 app. Additional upgrades for the product portfolio include the Amazon Prime video product I just mentioned in Horizon4. All of those things should drive NPS up as it has in other cities and markets. Now the goal of all these improvements is to optimize the lifetime value of customers by reducing churn, maximizing cross-sell and upsell, and supporting ARPU growth.Then lastly, on the sales side Lutz and the team have been rationalizing high-cost sales channels by closing stores and pivoting to more online sales, which now make up around 35% of total sales, and they're investing as you would expect in a seamless digital experience across touch points for potential and existing customers. That includes sales, payments, help, service all things that will drive NPS up and reduce costs.So, finally switching gears to Switzerland. The next couple of slides provide an update on the really good work Severina and her team had been doing on the ground there. Even though we don't include Switzerland in our guidance we know that both Liberty and Sunrise shareholders would benefit from some additional transparency here and the punchline is that the turnaround plan is working.As the charts on the left indicate RGU losses were marginally better than Q4, but don't yet show the benefit of a strong sales month in March and new products and bundles. ARPU on the other hand has returned to growth. It was up 3.6% in Q1 driven in part by an improved entertainment bundle and tier mix. And the new MVNO with Swisscom has delivered on the promise of unlimited product offers and led to 13,000 net postpay mobile adds in the quarter.Financially, at the bottom of the slide on the left, you can see steady improvement in the revenue and operating cash flow losses. But I think it's important to remind everyone this is a transition year and we are investing both OpEx and CapEx into this program and the initiatives are really highlighted on the right-hand side. All of these things are working. The 1-gig rollout is ahead of time and we'll launch this year along with major benefits of the digitization plan, but two of these initiatives are already showing significant result and are summarized on the next slide, slide nine.Switzerland is the first market where we've launched both the EOS box and the new Horizon4 user interface together and the results are fantastic. We now have 130,000 boxes rolled out at the end of April. That alone is a great sign of success and we're looking to be in roughly half of video homes by the end of the year, but much more importantly consumers love it as evidenced by a 30-point improvement in product NPS record sales in March up 30% and a reduction in truck rolls, customer calls.Similarly that team is seeing great results in fixed-mobile convergence with over 160,000 mobile subs now on the Swisscom network, which we switched over to at the beginning of the year. We have record Q1 sales of 19,000 on the back of our unlimited offers. We have record product NPS and a 15% cross-sell rate on the fixed pace. And we've started to see the same churn benefits as Holland and Belgium.So I'm extremely happy with Severina and the team and the work they're doing on this plan and we're all excited to get this deal across the line.With that, I'll turn it over to you Charlie. -- Thanks, Mike. I am now on the slide entitled revenue and OCF growth. Now, if you look at the figures for the continued operations, we had a revenue decline of minus 0.6%, an OCF decline of minus 0.5%.Excluding Switzerland that's the basis of our 2019 guidance, revenue was broadly flat and OCF grew by around 1%. Mike talked about what's been driving the numbers in the U.K. & Ireland and Switzerland. So, I'm going to briefly address the other segments. In the top right, you can see that Belgium recorded 2.2% of OCF growth, with a slight decline in revenue.As you probably heard on the results call last week, the loss of the media contract and certain regulatory headwinds will have a more pronounced impact in Q2 and that's factored into our full year expectations.CEE delivered revenue and OCF growth of 2% which was driven by top line growth from B2B and new build predominantly in Poland. And for our central and other segment revenues were $61 million. Now to remind you these are largely to do with the TSAs that we have with our Dutch joint venture and our former business in Austria, and the net OCF costs were minus $86 million versus minus $107 million in Q1 of 2018. This year-on-year reduction represents our continued initiatives to resize central costs in line with the smaller groups scope.Now, to emphasize that the central cost trajectory that we laid out in our full results call is going to continue. Namely that the $260 million of OpEx for corporate functions will be reduced by approximately 20% by 2020 and approximately $900 million of Central T&I or technology and innovation OpEx and CapEx will decline at the time in part due to the decline in services under the multiyear TSA agreements.We'll turn now to the slide titled cash, leverage and liquidity. Q1 reported free cash flow for our continued operations was negative $625 million which was an improvement year-on-year versus the negative $999 million of Q1 2018. We've also laid out the various adjustments to bridge from our reported free cash flow of $625 million to the pro forma free cash flow number of $622 million, which is the basis of our guidance that excludes Switzerland.Now I'm going to cover the underlying driver numbers shortly. So, I'll come back to that then. Our Q1 leverage was 5.4 times growth and 5.3 times net debt to quarterly EBITDA, and this is in line with our budgeted expectations and we expect the full year even without the proceeds from many plan disposals to be within our four times to five times range. Liquidity remains strong at $3.4 billion including around $900 million of cash and we still plan to spend around $500 million in the first half of the year on stock purchases.Turning to the next slide, which breaks down our Q1 property and equipment additions and operating free cash flow. Excluding Switzerland we saw a year-on-year reduction of 31% in property and equipment additions resulting in a spend of $640 million or 25% of sales. Including Switzerland the figure was $659 million represented 24% of sales and showed a decline of 29% and that was in the quarter where we connected over 100,000 new premises in the U.K. & Ireland. Now, we remain on track to deliver a 20% reduction in CapEx for the full year.Of the significant upgrade of our set-top boxes state in the U.K. in 2018 we saw a significant reduction in CPE spend in the U.K. Following the peak investments in product and enablers including our MVNO and voice-over-IP platforms we also saw a reduction in spend in that category of 39%. Belgium is on track to achieve the more normalized CapEx to sales ratio of around 20% following the completion of its fixed and mobile network upgrades in 2018. And having said all of this, we continue to invest in Switzerland and as Mike noted this increased spend is focused on the roll out of EOS boxes in that market for 1-gig upgrade and also the investment in digitization.If you look to the top right of the slide you'll see the impact by declining CapEx has had on the operating free cash flow which grew by 74% including Switzerland and more than double that number if you exclude Switzerland. Turning to next slide, which details Q1 pro forma free cash flow for our continuing operations excluding Switzerland.We presented the numbers in the format that we used for our year-end results, which isolates working capital flows. And as you can see pro forma operating free cash flow was $442 million, which included a $75 million investments in Project Lightning. Q1 and Q3 are where we make virtually all our semiannual interest payments, which had a cash interest spend of $561 million for the quarter.Our Q1 tax payment of $181 million was virtually all accounted for by Belgium's annual payment. The working capital flows in Q1 are typically negative as we unwind our higher Q4 paddles resulting from the seasonally higher CapEx in that quarter and that contributed to a negative working capital flow of $322 million resulting in a total negative outflow for the quarter of $622 million.Q1 free cash flow is in line with our expectations and we continue to expect the full year free cash flow for the continuing operations excluding Switzerland to be in line with our guidance of $550 million to $600 million. Now remember also that this number includes our estimated $400 million to $500 million negative free cash flow from Project Lightning.So, moving to the final slide, in conclusion the transactions with Vodafone and Sunrise remain on track. We think Virgin Media had a pretty strong Q1 subscriber result particularly considering the negative sentiments around in Brexit. And despite the flat ARPU results we believe that our product innovation and speed leadership will continue to underpin pricing power. Switzerland is beginning to show green-shoots with its turnaround plan which remains firmly on track and we're confirming all of our 2019 guidance targets.So, with that, operator can we open up to questions?The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Robert Grindle with Deutsche Bank. -- Yes, hi. It's Robert from Deutsche Bank. Mike, can I take you back to your comment you referred in your speech to innovative and creative ways to expand, I think, it was the network. Please could you expand on that? Are you using kind of using BT's ducts and poles comps to reduce the cost? I note your cost per build is lower this quarter than prior year. Is that a new thing and to address press commentary are you thinking of wholesaling to other suppliers? Thank you. -- Yes. Thanks, Robert. Look, I think, the reference there was really just to point out that why wouldn't we be looking at creative and innovative ways to continue expanding the network. The results so far for lightening in our minds have been exactly what we wanted them to be successful productive operationally, strategically and we think the capital that we're allocating to that project is really good capital. But as you know the market is moving quickly. There are lots of start-ups, I guess, I would call them.Hoping to build fiber in various places and of course BT open reach deciding that at some point they will also get more serious in our fiber. So, it's smart for us to be creative and flexible and opportunistic. I have nothing specific to say about that other than to assure you, we're doing what we should be doing which is looking at all options to be sure that the Virgin network and the Virgin product is available as widely as possible.If we were to do something I don't see it hitting our balance sheet as such or our cash flows. I think there are ways to possibly look at network expansion and in more creative fashions. So, that was really the only point there. What was the second question, Robert? -- It was about that you might be considering wholesaling your network in the U.K? -- Yes. No comment there, I mean, yes, I have no comment on that. -- Sure. Thank you.We'll move now to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. -- Good morning. Maybe just to dig into the Virgin ARPU trends a little bit more, Mike, you gave us some good detail. If you look at from here what are the drivers of ARPU improving? Did the discount headwinds you talked about will go away? I know you mentioned pay-per-view. And could you maybe talk about how the mix of subs in the Lightning versus the BAU markets impact ARPU if at all, I don't know if those are a short-term depression on ARPU because they're coming on discounts. Is there any more color there because that's obviously a huge lever for you guys? And then just on sort of use of proceeds and capital structure rates have come in a lot. I'm just curious if you guys see kind of post close in some of these major asset sales and opportunity to maybe reprice to some of your debt facilities downward? I don't know Charlie has any thoughts on that once you look out beyond particularly the Vodafone sale? Thank you guys. -- Yes. Thanks, Ben. I'll let Lutz walk up and answer on the ARPU question. On the use of proceeds, I mean, there won't be a satisfactory answer to this question that will make everybody happy. We're still three months away from the Vodafone deal closing and of course we're like six months probably for Switzerland. So, no large or even small transactions in the pipeline. I wish I could be more specific about capital structure. We are looking at as you would imagine all of the various buttons on the foot machine to be sure that we are optimizing capital structure whether that's on the balance sheet or through buybacks and probably not prudent for us to be any more specific about that as we sit here today. Lutz, do you want to address the ARPU question? -- Yes, I mean, on ARPU, right, we distinguish between subscription ARPU and non-subscription ARPU and the underlying subscription ARPU is still growing 0.9% right? I mean it used to grow 1.6% the previous quarter. So, it was -- it's a bit lighter. This is because of two things. We had less installation revenue because we had a huge box swap with V6 boxes a year ago and the other things is we had some higher promotional activities. Q1 according to our knowledge, Q1 2019 in terms of growth adds compared to a year ago is 11% down, so 11% less profit. So therefore there was a little bit higher promotional activity.However, this is the biggest part by far the biggest part of the ARPU and it's growing and it will continue to grow. While the non-subscription ARPU where you see the huge shrinkage around 15% down to GBP2.50 now and this was driven by two things less pay-per views. This is more a saving thing because there was simply in our big boxing event. And the other thing is declining voice usage.I think the good news on the non-subscription revenue is that it came down during the last six years from GBP8 to GBP2.50, but we have been able to increase the subscription revenue at the same time frame of around GBP11. So, therefore there is not so much to go down anymore, right. So therefore only from that comparison, you see the ARPU growing in the future.But also and this is what Mike mentioned when I joined U.K. eight months ago. We created a growth strategy for the consumer and now we have launched the first items. And the biggest one is for me fixed-mobile convergence, right. And you see that from other markets. So customers will have really cross-platform us. They have our higher ARPU and lower churn. I mean the V.VIP for EUR99 you get the best of the best from us and the attachment rate of mobile only after the first week of launching is incredibly high.So, very encouraging here. Personal Picks, I mean, that is simply we want -- we are focusing more on higher value TV subscribers and therefore, right, we have snag of the content now and that will also lead to higher ARPU. We have -- we are going to launch targeted advertising together with Sky in a couple of weeks from now and this also will help us to generate revenue.And we have launched Intelligent WiFi end of March, which leads to better in-home coverage on WiFi higher customer satisfaction. So, a lot of innovation has kicked in now the last month and that will help us to increase ARPU and also which gives us pricing power for the future. -- Thanks for all the color. -- How about you, Mike? -- Thanks, Ben. That's it.Next we have Goldman Sachs, Michael Bishop. -- Thank you and good morning. Just following up on the U.K. I just like to change the direction a little bit to the regulation in the recent update from Ofcom because it feels like clearly there is a lot of pressure in the market in terms of discounting from the volume discounts that have been passed through by open reach to the resellers. But if you read the latest Ofcom documents it talks quite explicitly about reinjecting margin into the infrastructure there potential with some more detail later in this year. So, it will be really interested in your thoughts on that please. And then just maybe as a very quick follow-up you mentioned that you have seen encouraging results albeit from a soft launch on FMC. Could you give us a little bit more color about sort of the strategy on FMC and how big you think the initial market would be for people really looking to move to those converged products? Thanks. -- Sure. Lutz you can address the FMC question more specifically. I think on the Ofcom point you're right. One of the market pressures that Virgin Media experienced in Q1 although difficult to say how large an impact it was in the overall scheme of things was probably related to the discounting that might be resulting from volume discounts from BT open reach.Again those are generally on lower-end customers, a market that were typically not attacking or even marketing to. But I think in the end that has had a minor impact in the first quarter and we'll see if that continues in the second and third quarter. I think the one main point here, Michael, is that the market is heading toward superfast broadband.And volume discounts on 36-meg or low-end speeds are temporary moments because it's our opinion and it certainly there's plenty of capital and activity in this space that U.K. will be a superfast market. We're already 500-meg across our footprint going to a gig and that's the space where we play.So, while that might create some flux in the market quarter-to-quarter, I think, over the long-term we don't believe it's going to have a large impact and that everybody is leaning into faster networks and hoping as you point out for a greater margin which means more price stability over the long haul. Lutz, do you want to talk about FMC in more detail? -- Yes, I think, first of all when you talk about FMC proper FMC hasn't been launched in U.K. so far. So, you see only mobile bolt-ons. I mean we are leading with them, right, 20% of our customers, our cable customers use mobile on top, but it is more on bolt-on.So, if you look at other market such as Netherlands, Belgium, Germany you don't have really proper FMC product. So, we have now launched a proper FMC product, right. You have higher speeds. You have unlimited data. You have higher service level as a customer and you get a mobile phone at a best price. So, really a bundle one problem issue.And I mean we have launched that as a soft launch because we want to make sure that all processes are working right, I mean, within six months from the idea to launch we have been very fast. And now the importance is the more the attach rate to it. And I don't want to disclose so much here because we don't want to wake competition up, but I think it's very encouraging. And at the end, right, when you talk numbers, I think, in other markets you see a mobile penetration and a cable base of 40% or even more. And why shouldn't that be also the case in the U.K. -- Thank you so much.We'll move now to Vijay Jayant with Evercore. -- Good morning, Mike. Can you sort of talk about your broad views on vertical integration, obviously, the company is all in on converged network, but is there an opportunity there on sort of convergence with content? Just very philosophically. Second, you guys called out in your press release about mobile handset sales moderating. Can you just give us some perspective on what's the underlying profitability impact of a decline in those sales? Is this a competitive impact or is this more customers bringing their own devices in the market? Thank you. -- Sure. On the handset question maybe Lutz can provide some color, but it's not a profitability issue. There's very little margin on the handset sale itself. So, it's really creating more volatility in revenue than it does in OCF for us. On the vertical integration question, I think, we've done it the right way to-date, Vijay.If you take Holland for example or even Belgium and more recently Switzerland. We're focused on content that's really moving the needle for consumers. So, that's sports, local sports generally whether Ziggo Sport or MySports in Switzerland or Telenet sports package. These are things that we know consumers will pay for and we can isolate and acquire those rights at relatively inexpensive prices without changing materially the dynamics or economics of the business model.And that strategy where you can sort of find critical content not necessarily all the content and provide a bit more exclusivity and power to your package usually works for us, and you're not necessarily gambling. In the case of Ireland, we've taken a slightly different approach where we acquired two very small broadcast networks and that has worked very well for us. We rebranded the Virgin. We've been able to cross-promote and cross-sell and we've done it really cost effectively and economically.So, I think, we believe in some instances vertical integration in European markets make sense. We're not, I think, there's a limit to where that makes sense. And at this point at Virgin we don't see any immediate need or reason to go beyond what we've done. Remember Virgin has all the content. It has all the Sky content, it has all the movie content, it has all the sports content.We've launched Netflix. Now we'll have Amazon on the box, voice control, I mean, it doesn't really, there's very little you can't get if anything on Virgin. And so you have to ask yourself what were the real advantage for the vertical integration be in that market at this point we don't see it. Lutz, do you want to address the handset question any further? -- Yes. On the mobile question, I think, 15 months ago, the team has launched mobile offering, mobile handset offering called freestyle. So, it's installment for 36 months and that has helped to sell a lot into the mobile customer base, and now each proportion of the mobile customer base has performed already. And therefore the future sales are not so strong anymore.Having said that, if you compare also here the market U.K. market with other markets 85% of the U.K. market is sitting on a subsidized model. So, you pay your mobile contract together with your mobile phone and you get a subsidized phone, but then you pay for the phone even longer than your minimum contract length.Other markets for instance like Germany you have 50% on a SIM free model and I think this is a huge opportunity for us. So, therefore we will be offering in the future the complete range of mobile devices including tablet. And we will offer that for with installments six months and we use that to simply drive traffic into our store. So, therefore and I think it is great lever not so much a margin lever, more a traffic lever. -- Got it. Thank you both.We'll move now to Ulrich Rathe with Jefferies. -- Yes, thanks very much. I just was wondering in particular on the U.K. ARPU, the management discounting. I'm interested if you have a bit more color in terms of where that discounting is going into the existing base in order to sort of manage churn whether what you're seeing here is sorts of the discounting on the front book on your intake. This is my first question please. -- Yes, I can take that now. -- Go ahead, Lutz. -- We have done less discounting in the customer base compared to the previous quarters and we have done more promotions for the new sales compared with previous quarters. -- Got it. That's very helpful indeed. And if I could follow up with another question. That's for you, Mike, please. Vodafone sort of announced a remedy package to the European Commission. Obviously, you're not directly involved as opposed in this process, but I was wondering whether the package at Vodafone has now designed and then offered would affect the purchase pricing in anyway shape or form. In other words whether anything is in the agreement is contingent upon the remedies and whether that is all sort of happening at the side of the (inaudible) insulator from it? Thank you. -- Yes. So, I mean, for those who may not have seen this morning Vodafone announced a long-term cable wholesale agreement with Telefonica in Germany. That covers 100% of the footprint of Unity Media and Vodafone about 24 million homes. The terms are confidential, but they will provide availability of up to 300 megabit speeds to Telefonica.And they also announced today that they're going to upgrade the entire footprint to one gig by 2022. And then lastly they put in the press release that they believe the deal will be approved in July. Obviously, we're supportive in all sorts of ways of this particular agreement, but remedy is clear and comprehensive and it addresses definitive any concerns that may have existed around broadband competition, and this is a huge win for German consumers.And I'm not just saying that to have Vodafone squarely focused on upgrading the entire footprint providing access to a third-party who can also take advantage of that seems like a really positive win-win. And we don't believe that has any impact on our transaction other than speeding up closing and providing far more certainty than we had yesterday of that closing. -- Thanks very much for your time.And our next question comes from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research. -- Good morning, guys. I had one for Lutz and one for Mike. I guess for Lutz you've been CEO of Virgin Media since September of '18. You're about to be elevated to COO, I mean, excuse me CEO. What do you see as the biggest opportunity and the biggest challenge for Virgin? And then for Mike a bigger picture question on the U.K. and a follow-up on data. From a data penetrations perspective in the U.K. you're about six years behind your U.K. cable peers. How much of that would you say is related to the fact that DSL historically has been much robust product in the U.K. versus sort of the competitive environment? And now that you've taken your speeds to 500 megabits or eight times your peers you have a cost efficient path to 10-gig. And assuming consumer data continues to go up is it fair to say medium or long-term you expect to close the gap with data household penetration with your U.S. peers? Thanks -- Sure. Well, Lutz, do you want to start? -- Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yes, I think, the big opportunities we are having here is first of the brands. I think Virgin Media is such a strong brand and I mean I was part of the team who came up with a brand or two . I have to say I did a lot of work on the brand Unity Media, but we never had such an opportunity in Germany what we don't have with Virgin Media as a brand.I think we can do huge growth with that brand. And then to use that brand we came up with four levers and I think Mike has mentioned them. One is fixed-mobile convergence. One is digitalization. Huge opportunity both for growth and cost savings. One is sales simply to have a very efficient go-to market model sell more to lightning customers and then the most important one is base management, I mean, we have close to 50% market share.So, it's all about share of wallet and to manage the customer base in a way that we have more satisfied customers you can upsell more and you do everything online and you have lower churn is a big value for us. So therefore, I think, clearly in the consumer machine because the consumer machine is the biggest machine of Virgin Media that's huge for us.In terms of challenge, well, I think it's a big company right? And it was also founded out of couple of smaller independent cable companies right? And if you want to shift gears and grow more then you need to manage the complexity. So, therefore I would say the challenge is a bit to get the balance right between growth, but also the remaining complexity of maybe proper integration of system side everything. Some has started, but we just not finished yet. -- Yes. On the data question, Jeff, the key point is on footprint we're generally 40% to 50% market share. So, the balance is split between three or four different resellers. You don't have that in the market U.S. marketplace. It's really a two-horse race. And so Sky is an effective marketing machine. BT of course has a nationwide reach of DSL. It's an effective marketing machine with sports and all sorts of things that they're selling.So, the fact that we're on footprint outperform them two to one when it comes to penetration of broadband says it all. And that has a lot of to do with the fact that our products are five, eight times faster than theirs and we'll likely are likely to be faster than theirs for a very long time because it will take the fiber in the market today is 3% or 4% of the homes. And we're going to one gig as quickly as we can as you say ultimately the 10-gig.So, I don't want to say the race is over, but Virgin is running a different race than the rest of the U.K. broadband providers, but it is a bundled market. And we know that people aren't going to generally buy broadband if they don't have a video product and solution as well and we make lots of margin on our video products still despite what's happening let's say in the U.S. video for us is still a profitable product and with a high rate of return and that has to be a part of our bundle.And so it's competitive in broadband and I think ultimately you'll see speeds continue to accelerate in this marketplace as they have in the U.S. maybe faster than they have in the U.S. And our goal is to be leading the way and not just with fast broadband, but as Lutz said with fixed-mobile convergence bundles with video products that are best-in-class with the new box, the V6 box plus the new Horizon UI coming very shortly here.And remember that's got, it basically attach one in this market and there won't be anybody who can touch Virgin. But once all those pieces of the puzzle come together, the fastest broadband networks, a fixed-mobile product by far the most sophisticated video platform with pretty much all of the content that can be available integrating OTT apps.And so the magic here is as Lutz identified is to make sure the machine is running properly and there is complexity in a big company like Virgin, and I feel he's got the right talent, and certainly the right focus to get that sorted out and keep the marketing engine humming as fast as possible and be keep innovating.There's no substitute for being first or being best in all of these particular products and services. And we're excited about Virgin. It's, as I said, many times as we sit here and look at it today strategically complete. We have a great MVNO deal. We've got long-term relationships with our core content providers like Sky will also get renegotiated.We have the fastest network and we're building 400,000 to 500,000 new homes every year. We have creative opportunities to accelerate that off-balance sheet if we choose. I think it's Virgin's in a really good spot. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Nick Lyall with SocGen. -- Hello there? Hope you can hear me? This is Nick at SocGen. Hope you're aware. A couple of questions please. You mentioned on the VodafoneZiggo release the final tariffs for cable access, wholesale cable access, sorry, have been in the market since the end of March. Could you give us an update at all on any talks or responses you may have had from other operators from the Dutch regulator please? And then secondly you also mentioned the VodafoneZiggo remedies today with the cable wholesale again. Just in general do you see increased pressure for cable wholesale organically from regulators? And do you think this is going to be a future part of any remedies that anybody would need to offer in a fixed-mobile deal in Europe now do you think? Thank you. -- Yes, good question. I'll let Manuel or Charlie or maybe Manuel hook up and answer on certainly what we can say about the Dutch, hang on a minute, about what we can say in the Dutch market specifically about that cable wholesale offer. I'll just speak more generally that I think cable wholesale is, obviously, if you look today versus five years ago a much more prominent part of our business and the market environment more generally, but I think it's very situational.I think it has three or four factors that gets built into the decision. It's very much a political decision to begin with. So, that we will be -- it will be determined by what, hey, could you put us on mute until you are ready Manuel, it will be determined to what the local politics are in that particular marketplace and how cable is perceived. It will be a competitive decision just how dynamic is the market for broadband and other products. And it may be a transactional element.As you point out in the case of Belgium or Holland if you remember the VodafoneZiggo deal cable access was not required in that transaction. It was only subsequently introduced on a political basis, which we continue to argue with and fighting the courts and certainly commission itself doesn't necessarily see that as necessary, but has been not willing to stop it for other reasons. And then the German transaction this was a voluntary commercial arrangement between two operators.It is a cable wholesale access deal, but it's not available to all parties. It's a transaction between two very specific parties. And in that instance, I would say, it's very different than Belgium, which is regulated wholesale access. So, I think, it's going to be market by market situation by situation determined by politics and the transaction itself.And in some instances for example in Germany it was a voluntary decision by two commercial parties that they believe will benefit each other and we don't see a big problem with that as a general matter. In terms of the Dutch market specifically, Manuel, why don't you offer what we can say about that? -- Yes, not very much, but the Dutch regulator has created conditions for negotiations between VodafoneZiggo and interested parties. What we can say is there has been expressions a number of expressions of interest, but no actual discussions that are going on as we speak.It's worth to mention that it's different from the regulated system in Belgium where in Holland the regulator asks the parties first and negotiate and only later intervened. The other thing to mention is that the Dutch case, the Dutch regulatory situation is still pending litigation in before the Dutch courts where we expect the decision in the second half of this year. -- That's great. Thank you.Christian Fangmann with HSBC has our next question. -- Yes. Hi, guys. It's Christian. I have a couple of questions back on the U.K. We already talked about the ARPU in great detail, but just looking at Q2 and the following quarters. Is Q1 really the exception, I mean, we discussed the reasoning, but do you see already a better traction for Q2, I mean, for example the VOD sales and stuff like that really impacting Q1? And then also regarding the TV losses, I think, Q1 was definitely lighter than what we've seen over the quarters in 2018. Is there a new strategy when it comes to TV? So, not really pushing the entity TV product anymore, I mean, a bit of color on that one will also be interesting to hear? Thanks. -- Sure. I think you got it right on the TV side. It was definitely a purpose on higher end, higher return more profitable TV packages. But do you want to address the March and April results more generally, Lutz? -- Yes, I mean, Christian as you know former colleague, we are not allowed to make any forward-looking statements. But right, I mean, we share a bit the levers for ARPU growth which you guys right? And so for the underlying subscription revenue is still growing right, I think, that's important.And then right we have three levers to play now before we talk about any price increase right? One is FMC, one is Personal Picks and one is Intelligent WiFi right? And of course we don't do that because we want to avoid further shrinkage. We want to increase it and I think on the video side, Christian, yes.I mean we are focusing a bit more on operating free cash flow and we are looking therefore to have the right balance between volume and value in video customers. And so therefore we were after more VIP customers in Q1 more full house customers.And also therefore we have now launched Personal Picks because here you can bundle GBP8 to GBP10 significant content for a dedicated target group with the V6 boxes and triple-play. So, therefore, it is a balanced walk toward more value in the video strategy. -- Thanks.We'll move now to James Ratzer with New Street Research. -- Yes, good morning. Thank you very much. I had two questions please. First one is regarding the topic of going back to cash return please. It's probably one of the biggest decisions you'll have to make over the next few months. I mean when you look across the investment landscape, I mean, you've been selling your cable businesses at 10 to 12 times OCF, I mean, Telenet itself traded near eight times. Do you see anything more attractive to do with the capital than to buy back your own stock versus the ramp valuation is nearer four to five times OCF? And then as a second follow-up is, I mean, is it still your intention post deal to be keeping leverage at the upper end of your current four to five times range? Thank you. -- I think on the leverage question I'll let Charlie chime in. We're comfortable where we are today. You can always trim, but you'd have to measure or evaluate that decision to use capital against what you just described which was a return either on your own stock or on other opportunities.Listen at this point we don't have any transactions in the pipeline large or small that would be an immediate use of proceeds upon closing the transaction this summer. So, we're waiting and holding our cards to determine what the right way to address all of those issues you've defined there, capital structure and opportunities, and we'll do it in a patient appropriate way as we had in the past.So, that's all I can say. I mean clearly as we pointed out on our last call and as you can see today the stock is highly undervalued given it's assuming the closing of the deals which are only more certain than they were 24 hours ago, and the performance of our underlying business over the long haul which we still believe is materially better than people are giving it credit for. So, we see what you're describing. I'll just leave it at that. -- Could I just -- thank you, Mike, I mean, quick follow-up and one of the other potential use of capital that's been talked about is maybe a combination of Telenet with VodafoneZiggo. I mean could you talk us through what operational synergies you might see in such a cross-border tie-up if that's possible? Thank you. -- Yes, I prefer not to address that. The VodafoneZiggo partnership is a strong one. We're very happy with that relationship with Vodafone and home. There will be a natural point in the coming months or years for both parties to determine what the right outcome is for the partnership and the joint venture, it's premature to determine that today, and I don't want to create any speculation around it.And providing synergies or things of that nature would only fuel that speculation. Telenet on the other hand is a business, we are happy to be a 60% shareholder in, as you say, undervalued in the marketplace and we're pleased with your own performance. And there are organic opportunities to grow Telenet as well as end market opportunities to grow Telenet. So, I think, both businesses today are doing just fine on their own and it's premature to discuss anything different. -- Okay. Thank you. -- You got it. Okay, we have time for one more, operator.Yes, and we'll take that final question from Matthew Harrigan with Buckingham Research Group. -- Thank you. I think everyone agrees you've got more speed -- any of your peers on broadband, but at the same time if you look at the global take rates for full gig, I mean, they are pretty much in the low single-digit percentages and a lot of the new geographies. In some of the apps I'm not sure everybody is going to want a light field (inaudible) rex in their living room at some point. Does that give you some pass that you could have ultimately have like 200 or 300-meg sort of keep into your four competitors like in 5G much further out not the fixed wireless access right now? And I know Europe is behind, but is that something you think ultimately affects your pricing power because you have a much better product? And then the second question is, I know, Vodafone has continued enthusiasm obviously for the German transaction. But what happened, I know, it's a discontinued operation, but what happened if the German numbers in Q1 because the revenue in the OCF looked extremely late? Thank you. -- Yes, I think, on Germany Matt the budget we're a feeling good about performance they are more generally we don't have any concerns around the business quarter-by-quarter variances. But I think all things considered they're hitting the targets that we set for them and the buyer expects us to be hitting. So, no material variability that we're pointing out. On the 5G point listen 5G will roll out. It won't be fixed wireless in Europe.It will probably begin a fixed wireless in the U.S. with questionable capability and execution we understand and believe. But as a mobile product we're all going to be have a 5G phone at some point down the road. But remember this, the average customer, our average customers downloading 150 gigabytes to 250 gigabytes a month that's 20 times more than they are doing on their mobile phone, yet, ARPUs are not that far off right?So, the value of fixed line broadband access is phenomenal in comparison to what you're paying for a mobile fixed line mobile product. And as that 200 gigs goes to 700 gigabytes, 800 gigabytes, 900 gigabytes mobile will also grow, but will never reach the kind of levels that we believe people will require in the home for video for other products and services. So both data streams will grow.Consumption will grow in both ecosystems and network configurations, but the fixed product is so cost-efficient for consumers and for the delivery of data. It's got nowhere to go but up. But I think it's going to be just as we cohabitate very well with 4G today and LTE one-gig and 10-gig will cohabitate extremely well with 5G. And when people are in the homes or in their businesses they're going to rely on one-gig or 10-gig or whatever they think they need because it's most cost efficient and certainly most productive and useful.And when they are out of their homes they will rely on their mobile phones. So, I think, the ecosystem will evolve much more harmoniously and look a lot like it does today with just everybody consuming a lot more. And that's a good place to be for us and for mobile operators in the long run. So, we see nothing, but positive to be honest with you. But thanks for the question, Matt.Anyway that we're excited, yes, you got it. Thanks for joining us, I mean, the punchline here is that the Vodafone deal absolutely on track for summer close. That should be a positive. The Swiss market is doing exactly what we wanted it to do and providing some nice, we think performance for the Sunrise transaction.And Virgin Media and our remaining operation we think are stable and have great prospects going forward. So look forward to talking to you about Q2 and thanks for joining us this morning. Speak to you soon. Take care.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Liberty Global's first quarter 2019 results investor call.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYK options chain for the new June 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $25.00 strike price has a current bid of 70 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $25.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $24.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $26.34/share today.\n\nBecause the $25.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.80% return on the cash commitment, or 19.28% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc, and highlighting in green where the $25.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of 25 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYK stock at the current price level of $26.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $30.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 14.84% if the stock gets called away at the June 21st expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing LBTYK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $30.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 14% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 84%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.95% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.54% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 38%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 35%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $26.34) to be 32%.

Here are a few details of the deal.The  is the most notable change for Liberty Global long-term and management spent a lot of time justifying the move. CEO Mike Fries said:Liberty Global was in a tough position in some of these countries with a small market share and very little pricing power or ability to invest in building out a better network.

We have a lot to cover today and we always enjoy these opportunities to share with you what we've achieved, but I think more importantly, give you a sense of what we're up to today and where we're headed. I'm joined on the call by Charlie Bracken, our Chief Financial Officer, who's going to review our financial results, as he always does, along with a host of other senior execs from around the world who all asked to chime in on issues during the Q and A, as needed.We are going to speak from slides today. I hope you can grab a copy of those now or later. There's a lot of good data on there. I'm going to start on Slide 4 where we lay out a handful of operating and financial highlights for 2017, a year where we not only delivered some solid growth, but perhaps even more importantly from our perspective, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term operating success and value-creation for shareholders.Now, I'm going to run through some stats on the left-hand side. As we do every year, we expanded our fixed subscriber base, ending with 45.8 million video broadbanded voice RGUs, and that excludes mobile. It increased to 760,000 net RGUs year-over-year. And I'll break that number down by country in a moment, but the big takeaway for me and hopefully for you is continued improvement in video losses, which were 30% better in 2017 than 2016 and represented an almost two-fold improvement over two years ago. So it's clear that our ability to retain 99.5% of our video subs every year, whatever the number is, is directly correlated to the evolution of our video platform, our go-apps, our user interface, our footprint expansion. It's all working, from our point of view.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Liberty Global wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!On the financial front, rebased revenue growth was 2.3% for the full year, or $15 billion. That's up 3% in the fourth quarter alone, and that was our best revenue growth quarter in two years, driven in large part by the 4.5% revenue growth we experienced at Virgin Media.Rebased OCF growth was 4.5% for the full year, or $7.1 billion. And as we indicated the last time, the fourth quarter and the full year were impacted by Switzerland negatively and if you exclude that one market, our fourth quarter and full-year OCF growth would have been 6% in each period. And Charlie and I will dig into Switzerland in a couple slides here.Our capex or PP and E for the full year was $4.8 billion, or 31.7% of revenue. Again, you'll see how that breaks down in a few slides, but hopefully, it's clear to you that we are purposely investing capital into long-term, sustainable growth. This level of spend is not the new normal for us. Many of you have asked that question. And we are choosing to lean into our customers for all the right reasons, and we're been offensive and smart about our capital spend.So how are we doing that? I think, first, we're driving broadband capacity and quality of service across the platform. That's the most important thing we can do. We're opportunistically expanding the reach of our networks through high-return, new build projects. We've talked a lot about that. The new build projects alone represent about a quarter of our capex, so that's clearly a discretionary spend. We're making discretionary investments in new products like Horizon, and we're rolling out next-gen digital boxes and one-gig wifi routers at a record pace.And every quarter, we get deeper into fixed-mobile convergence, which we know drives turn down and drives NPS up. And then, perhaps most importantly, we're investing in the digital tools like advanced analytics, AI-based applications, better call center processes -- the things that we know will ensure we're retaining customers and growing ARPU.And then finally on this slide, on the right-hand side, you'll see that we continue to demonstrate what we believe is an unwavering commitment to value-creation for shareholders. Now, this might be what sets us apart the most. We promised to create a pure-play European platform. And with the spin-off of Latin America, we've now done that. We talked all year about rebalancing our business to focus on national scale. So trying to be an inch wide and a mile deep in our core markets. And the sale of Austria, obviously, is evidence of that strategy.We've talked about the disconnect between public and  values. Clearly, the multiple of 11 times in Austria helps make that point. And then lastly, our prudent approach to balance sheet management. The $5 billion of liquidity we have all support our levered equity growth model. The biggest piece of which, of course, is commitment to owning more of our stock. With $3 billion of buybacks completed last year, and another $2 billion already announced this year.So we remain focused on three key strategic goals. They should sound familiar to you. First, driving national scale through both smart rebalancing and footprint expansion. Second, investing in profitable customer growth through network and product innovation. And then third, optimizing our levered equity returns for the benefit of shareholders. That's a pretty strong combination, in our view.Now, on Slide 5, we start digging into our 2017 results in a bit more detail, beginning with subscriber growth. In the top left, you'll see it again that we've added 760,000 RGUs for the group, split almost equally between the first half and the second half with the primary difference being slightly higher video losses in Switzerland and Germany in the second half, and I'll address that. Virgin Media generated 336,000 net adds. That's up 34% over last year with pretty modest growth in the fourth quarter. The good news is that we were much more disciplined in the fourth quarter and strategic about discounting in order to retain ARPU, which clearly worked for us.Churn in the fourth quarter was also the lowest of the year. And rental ARPU is up sequentially as a result of the price increase and our discounting activities. That sets us up really well for continued growth in 2018.You'll see on the top right that we added 229,000 RGUs in Germany, which was slightly weighted to the second half of the year. We saw 40% sequential uptake in the second half for data voice adds, and that is not abnormal for us. That's pretty typical. But total net adds were impacted by increased video churn in the third and fourth quarter from the loss of an MBU contract, but also from the Analog Switch-off Initiative, which impacted churn. And we've got both of those things under control, as a matter of fact.On the bottom left, Central and Eastern Europe generated 266,000 new RGUs for the year, 70% of those in the second half as we added video subs, we turned things around in Poland, and we penetrated our new-build footprint. Telenet in Belgium lost 54,000 RGUs in the year, about the same in each period. And all of that -- almost all of that's related to open access. But as a reminder, there's a silver lining. Telenet largely breaks even economically on the access regime in Belgium, provided that for every Telenet sub we lose, Orange also adds a Proximus sub to their wholesale deal with us, and that's basically what's happening.Lastly, you'll see that the Swiss and Austrian business went from a positive 8000 net adds in the first half to a loss of 26,000 in the second half of the year. And as we've signaled and have been signaling for the last 6 to 12 months, the Swiss market has experienced some pretty intense competition in both fixed video and broadband. And like we did in the Netherlands, we're in the midst of transitioning and investing in our business with new sports services, smarter bundles, and a popular fixed mobile product.But I want to point out that Switzerland is really not Holland, from our perspective. There's some big differences. For starters, there's only three mobile operators there today, not four. And the challenger has an inferior network. And I think Swisscom is largely a rational competitor and has been for some time. We're in a strong position here across the footprint. We have a super-fast broadband network that reaches two-thirds of the market. By the way, we just doubled speeds this week for half our broadband sub-base in Switzerland. And on top of that, we have very high OCF and free cash flow margins, which presents some interesting strategic options for us, as we've discussed.Turning to Slide 6, as you know, we're in Year 3 of our Liberty Go Plan. And as we've done from time-to-time, we've highlighted here on this slide progress on a handful of those key drivers. We haven't included our new build initiative on this slide, which is arguably our largest source of future growth because I'll talk about Project Lightning in a minute. But we do talk about four other big drivers.I'll start with pricing, on the top left and the good news here is that we have been able to successfully take price increases across our footprint pretty much without exception. And in 2018 we've already announced price increases in most markets, including Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, and certain of our CEE countries. But on the other hand, as we've also communicated throughout the year, both competition and discounting have been impacting ARPU growth, especially in the UK and Switzerland. So while ARPU is up around 1% for the company as a whole, year-over-year, we were flat at Virgin Media for the year and down nearly 2% in Switzerland.Of course, the UK has turned the corner, as I've kind of indicated, and is back to ARPU growth, and I'll cover that in a minute. And Germany and Belgium were both up 3%. So it's a mixed story there, but one we continue to work on.Certainly, a bright spot for us has been B2B. On the top right, you can see some numbers there. We have completely hit the mark here, we believe, and continue to generate double-digit, topline growth with 13% growth in the fourth quarter. What's driving this? First of all, SOHO and SME, which now represent together just under 50% of our B2B revenue. They each grew 27% and 10%, respectively, last year. And there is still significant upside in market share across Europe.Two other quick observations. German B2B revenue growth was up 50% for the year, and that's mainly on the back of SOHO and SME. And Belgium, one of our most mature B2B businesses was up 21% in the year, as Telenet added an MVNO customer to the mobile business.Now, turning to mobile, there are, as usual, some headwinds that we're battling, but also some really encouraging trends. And I'll go back and forth on both. For the full year, revenue was down 1%. But the top line improved every quarter. So from a negative 8% in the first quarter to a positive 5% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Mobile revenue in Germany, in Switzerland, in Central and Eastern Europe, where we have just launched, really, MVNOs, we're up 30 and 60%. And that's really, of course, from a low base and is organic.Virgin and Telenet, which account for 90% of our consolidated mobile revenue, were down around 1% and 7%, respectively last year. While they both added post-page subs, ARPU is impacted by competition and continued regulatory headwinds, as we've discussed. But Virgin had a strong fourth quarter with revenue up 17% on the back of higher handset sales and out of bundle usage. And both markets have some really positive drivers in 2018. Virgin in the UK will benefit from the transition to a new full MVNO with EE, which provides 4G, greater control over pricing and bundling and better economics, while Telenet will complete the migration of all mobile subs to the base platform and is going to generate the lion-share of synergies in that period. So good news in both cases.Finally, on the bottom right, we highlight the fact that we've executed very well on the efficiency plans that we set out for ourselves. I'm particularly proud of the fact that we finished another year with flat indirect costs, steady at $4.5 billion. And that's despite all of our new-build product and commercial activity through the year. Now, these are largely scale-based efficiencies around support function, central cost, and our T and I operating model. And as an example, you can see in the call-out box that most, or if not all, of those savings in central support functions were invested back into customers in terms of both products and marketing.So to recap, new build, cost efficiencies, and B2B are all contributing to growth. Mobile is showing some positive signs as we continue to migrate to truly converge services and better MVNO deals. And we're committed, perhaps more committed than ever, to ARPU growth, especially in the UK.Which is a great transition to the next slide, where we talk about some operating updates for Virgin Media, which is our largest, and as you know, our most valuable operating business. And it ended 2017 on a very strong note. First, let me address the announcement about Dana -- Dana Strong, who will be joining Comcast at the end of March. Listen, I can't say enough good things about Dana, who I've worked with for nearly two decades. And while we're certainly disappointed to see her leave, we all understand the motivation. Comcast is a great company, and after 18 years outside the US, I think Dana and her family are excited to get back to her home state.Over the last year -- I think this is most important -- she's done everything we've asked of her at Virgin Media. She's built a fantastic team of marketing and product executives. They've implemented the tools and processes we need to grow the base and the ARPU. And they've overseen an aggressive rollout of new products. You can see some of the teams good work on the top left of Slide 7, which shows the step-up in revenue from the 1 to 2% range through the first nine months of the year, to 4.4% in the fourth quarter and OCF growth increasing from 1% in Q1 to over 5% in Q4.At the same time, the mobile team on the ground has done some terrific work adding postpaid subs at a record clipping Q4. In fact, we doubled our market share of Apple products in that quarter. And also driving mobile churn down with 4G and SIMO offers. They're also, by the way, preparing Virgin for a full-on rollout of converged FMC products later this year. So when you add in continued improvement in Virgin's network and product quality, where broadband congestion has been addressed, where we've just rolled out a 350-MG product nationwide, you add to that V6 boxes being rolled out and 1-Gig wifi routers being rolled out at a record pace, and we think Virgin is in a really strong market position.And I'll end my remarks with a quick update on Project Lightning, our fiber-based new-build program in the UK. First of all, I'm really proud of the progress that we made through the course of 2017, especially on the construction front. It's night and day from where we were 12 to 15 months ago. We have a first-rate leadership team. We have much greater control over the pace and cost of the build at every level, from planning to working with contractors, to managing local authorities. And you can see that on the chart on the top-right. It really tells the story the best. We have now built and released 1 million homes from marketing, including 536,000 in 2017. That's up 70% from the prior year, and it was ramping in each quarter, as you can see. And we're not providing guidance for 2018, but I think it's fair to say that we like this general pace as we go into this year. And we're still targeting 4 million homes through the overall project timeframe.Now, our confidence in Project Lightning is due in no small part to the fact that we continue to perform well on the key KPIs that matter most. And you can see on the bottom-right that customer penetration rates are trending toward our longer-term goal 39%, and we're generally hitting 24% after one year, and 34% after 33 months. Also, ARPU is in line with our overall base ARPU after discounts, currently around 50 Pounds per month. And build cost -- importantly, build costs to date have been steady around the 650 Pound per premise mark, with some variance depending on whether we're doing infill or green field. And of course, that number will also vary going forward, depending on the start-up capex, but also depending on the timing of wayleaves. Remember that in the denominator of that 650 Pound per premise mark, we don't include another 10% of homes that we've built, but yet haven't yet released for marketing because of wayleaves. So that number, arguably, is a bit overstated, looking backwards.Now, many of you have asked for an example of project returns from Lighting. Now, on the bottom-left, we give you some data -- some high-level data, which should look familiar to you. Now, this assumes we never build another home in the UK and simply market to the 1 million premises already constructed and already released for marketing. Now, assuming we hit the 39% penetration number and the ARPU aligns with the existing base at 50 Pounds, those million homes would generate about 230 million Pounds of revenue. If we use a conservative range for an OCF contribution margin of 50 to 60%, we ought to generate annual OCF of between 115 to 140 million Pounds on that cohort. And then when you do the math, this should generate unlevered IRRs in the 25 to 30% range.So I think it's important to note that while in the short-term, as we build out new communities with this fiber-based infrastructure, our capex spending is rising, but over time, we expect to return to normalized capex levels, just as we start to really see the OCF growth profile increase. That's the nature of this project. Spending today for a reservoir of growth tomorrow. And so far that's what we're seeing, and you'll see that kick in in 2018.Now, I'll make one last point before handing it over to Charlie. There has been, as you've probably seen, some press speculation and even some announcements, about what we may or may not do going forward in Europe. And I'm not going to comment specifically on any of that. But I want to make one thing clear. We are not, quote/unquote, \"dismantling our European business,\" as one paper noted. Quite the contrary. In today's competitive world, scale matters more than ever. And we are committed to the core markets we're in, where we see a pathway to becoming a national champion.Now, consistent with this strategy, we have a pretty good track record of accretively rebalancing our business from time to time. Those who have been investors would know that. And that allows us to focus on what we do best, innovate, invest, compete, and build scale and grow. And the sale of Austria, UPC Austria, is really just the latest example of that.So Charlie, over to you. -- Thanks, Mike, and hi everyone. I will walk you through our full-year financial results and then provide some color on our segment performance and property and equipment additions. And then, finally, I will conclude with a high-level recap on our 2018 guidance targets.So I'm on Slide 10 now where we present our full-year financials. Now, in terms of our top line performance, which you can see on the upper left, we grew our rebased revenue by 2.3% to $15 billion last year. This included 3% growth in Q4, which was our best quarterly result in two years. And I will get into some of the key growth drivers on my next slide.On the OCF front, we regenerated rebased growth to 4.5% to $7 billion with our cost discipline continuing to be a key driver. And that's a point I will elaborate on later. Our 2017 P and E additions increased to $4.8 billion, or 31.7% of revenue as compared to $4 billion last year. And more on that in a minute, too.However, our increased new-build activity and our commitment to next-generation CPE were the main drivers for the year-over-year increases in both absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue. Moving to the bottom left of the slide, adjusted free cash flow was $1.6 billion in 2017. From a leveraged perspective, our consolidated adjusted gross and net debt ratios stood at 5.1 times and 4.9 times, respectively, at December 31st.We made great progress during 2017 with $24 billion of refinancings that extended our average tenant to nearly 8 years, while our blended, fully swapped borrowing cost was reduced to 4.2%. Finally, we repurchased $400 million of our stock in Q4, bringing our full-year total to $3 billion of buybacks.Turning to Slide 11 in our Segment Reporting, on the far left, we show our rebased growth for the overall company, including both our fourth quarter and full-year results. Moving to the right, to Virgin Media, our operations in the UK and Ireland posted rebased revenue growth of 4.4% and 2.1 in the Q4 and full-year periods, respectively. The Q4 result was our strongest quarterly performance in two years, supported by an improvement in our mobile business in large part driven by handset sales, as well as solid growth in B2B.As expected, in Q4, Virgin Media's ARPU grew 1% sequentially from Q3 as the November 2017 price increase took effect. Unity Media delivered 4.3% rebased revenue growth for the full-year, while rebased OCF grew 4.9%. Now, bear in mind that we switched off our analog signal in June and lost around $7 million of carriage fees in each of the third and fourth quarters, and we will have a similar headwind during the first half of 2018.In Belgium, Telenet posted 1% rebased revenue growth in post-Q4 and full-year 2017, mainly driven by strong results in B2B, in large part offset by mobile headwinds. Telenet's rebased OCF increased 6.1% in 2017, benefiting from the continued migration of legacy MVNO customers to our own mobile network.Moving to Switzerland and Austria, we reported relatively flat rebased revenue results in each of the fourth quarter and full-year periods. The 8% rebased OCF contraction that CHAT in Q4 was largely explained by increased content costs related to the launch of MySports in September last year, as well as competitive pressures. After considering the distribution fees that we receive from other cable operators, our MySports programming costs were approximately Swiss Francs 10 million in A4 and Swiss Francs 14 million in the second-half of 2017.And as we mentioned in our last earnings call, we expect the net expenses associated with MySports to be around 30 million Swiss Francs in 2018. And it's also worth noting that the Q1 and A4 impacts will be higher than the Q2 and Q3 periods, primarily due to the timing of the Swiss Ice Hockey schedule.Our Central and Eastern European segment posted 5% rebased revenue and OCF growth for the full-year, supported in part by new-build activities across the region. Rounding out our segments, we continue to streamline our cost base, reducing our central and corporate expenses by approximately 11% over the full-year period.And then finally, on this slide, taking a step back, the vast majority of our operations have been executing at a high level, with the outlier clearly being our business in Switzerland. And when we look at our results without the tracking system, we're pretty pleased with our performance.On Slide 12, we provide a bit more color on our P and E additions, which we categorize into five main buckets, CPE, rebuild and upgrade, capacity, product and enablers, and baseline expenditures. The key point that I will address is the level of our capital intensity, which stood at 31.7% for the full year of 2017. Prior to 2015, when our new build efforts began ramping, we were able to execute on our levered equity strategy by growing OCF with a lower capital intensity. More recently, and into 2018, the operational dynamic has shifted somewhat, as we have been increasingly investing in the customer experience while pursuing an expansive network expansion program. And this has been reflected in our increased capital intensity.As you can see from the tables, spend on new-build and upgrades increased by 24% in 2017 and represented nearly 8% of revenue. And as Mike illustrated earlier, we do believe that our new-build program is establishing a reservoir of future growth with meaningful contributions to OCF expected to begin this year.In the first line of the table, we detail our customer premise equipment category, or CPE. Growth in CPE of 27% was partly related to new-build volumes, but also reflects our decision to proactively increase penetration of next-generation platforms. Today, over 40% of our video and broadband basis have an advanced TV set, top-set, top-box, or a wifi-connect box, and we will continue to aggressively upgrade our customers in 2018.Similarly, we will continue to invest in our networks to ensure that our customers' experience first-class connectivity. We spent over $600 million on capacity investments to improve reliability and meet the ever-increasing demand for broadband data consumption.The next category is products and enablers, which increased 28% year-over-year. This spend allows us to develop enhanced functionality and a more robust product suite for both our residential and B2B customers. And then finally, we had a modest increase in our baseline capital spend, where we've been proactively choosing to accelerate certain investments in core areas of our infrastructure.So in conclusion, we continue to invest heavily across all P and E, or property and equipment classifications. But once our new-build program subsides, we would expect to see our capital intensity to fall back into the low 20% of sales.Slide 13 wraps things up. And to summarize, we are focused on continued subscriber, ARPU growth, and topline growth. We remain committed to new build and expect to see a much more meaningful OCF contribution this year and beyond. B2B continues to achieve double-digit revenue growth and we expect strong growth to continue in 2018. And from a cost perspective, we have delivered on our promise of keeping our indirect costs base flat.Our balance sheet, we will continue to term-out the average tenor of our debt, hedge both currency and interest rate risks, and maintain ample liquidity. And as Mike mentioned, we will analyze all scenarios where we can create shareholder value, most recently evidenced by the sale of UPC Austria at a very attractive multiple.So finally, moving toward 2018 guidance, we expect to generate around 5% rebased OCF growth this year, spend $5.1 billion on property and equipment additions, including $1.2 billion on a new-build and upgrade projects, deliver $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow, and repurchase another $2 billion of our equity in 2018.And with that, operator, we would like to turn it over for questions.The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the * or asterisk key followed by the digit 1 on your phone. In order to accommodate everyone, we request that you ask only question with one follow-up if needed. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We'll pause for just a moment to give everyone an opportunity to ready for questions.And we'll take our first question from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. -- Morgan Stanley Thank you, good morning, guys. Mike, you talked about wanting to build to be a national champion in the markets you're in, and that's consistent with what you've said in the past. Can you talk about both Germany and Switzerland in that context, and what those paths look like in those markets? And related to just the asset sale idea, in general, maybe for Charlie, can you just talk a little bit about your tax assets and how you can or cannot tax efficiently, sell assets for cash. I don't know if you've talked about any tax leakage with Austria, for example, but just maybe remind us of your ability to, sort of, tax efficient on asset sales, particularly for cash, as you guys think through your portfolio. -- Sure, thanks, Ben. Look at, I have to be cautious here because we're not specifically addressing any particular market in what we may or may not be doing. But I think if you look at Austria as an example, we had roughly 35% reach in that market. We had a business that was, for quite some time, ex growth or low growth, but it's been doing slightly better recently. We had an MVNO deal that was pretty good, but a competitive mobile marketplace. And we felt that in that particular instance was going to be a tough path to becoming a national champion. And I'm not suggesting you go through every market, comb through the stats and then draw a conclusion.Germany, there's optionality there. We have a great business. It's been, for us, a home run investment just on any economic basis. And we have, we think, a company that continues to grow steadily and with a broadband market that's extremely exciting, and continues to be, and a great, great management team. So I don't want to be specific about any particular market, Ben. It's a bit awkward for us. But I think that for whatever we do in that particular instance, it's a market we ought to grow with or look at options.In Switzerland, I've said before, we have greater reach there, almost two-thirds, coming up on 70% of the market. I think it's a market that is probably screaming for rationalization on some level. Certainly, there are some options there for us to consolidate and/or become a larger player in that particular marketplace.We've got challenges. I mean, Charlie mentioned them. I mentioned them in my remarks. It's a market that will continue to have some issues in the next year. I want people to know that. We don't expect a rapid turnaround in the Swiss market, just as we didn't get a rapid turnaround in Holland. It took us a couple, three years, to really get the fixed business in Holland back on track, which it is today, as you look at the VodafoneZiggo results. So I think we're being opportunistic and thoughtful about that, and I'm trying to dance around your question as I should in this context.Charlie, you want to hit the taxes? Charlie, you might be on mute. -- Yeah, I think we have, as you know -- oh, sorry. Can you hear me now? -- Morgan Stanley Yeah. -- Yep. -- I think we have a very substantial tax asset. -- Morgan Stanley Okay. That cut out clear enough. -- Yeah. No, sorry. I'll be more specific than that. I think he may have cut off. Clearly, as you would imagine, Ben, we are all the time evaluating our tax posture with respect to all of our businesses. And we plan for many eventualities and we plan for the long-term. And I would say that we have a very efficient tax structure. I'd leave it at that. I think you can -- -- Morgan Stanley Okay. Yeah. -- -- you'll see through what we mean by that. -- Morgan Stanley Yeah, sure. Helpful. Thank you both. -- You got it. Yep.We'll take our next question from Nick Lyall with Societe Generale.Hello to everybody. Just, now, a couple please, if possible. Just the first one on the UK ARPU, please. I'm still a little bit confused why it was down 0.6% year-on-year. Is there anything I've missed in there in terms of discounts or maybe a shift in mix of the people you're bringing on into the business? And then secondly, just very quickly, the overall question on fixed and mobile. You sound very convinced on fixed-mobile convergence. But just looking at the Telenet business so far, and also VodafoneZiggo, the result is, like, a little mixed with tone nature being up, and also the OCF being really quite sharply down at VodafoneZiggo. So why are you so convinced given the performance of the businesses so far? Again, is there something I'm maybe missing? Thank you. -- Sure, sure. Tom, I think you're on. You might want to address the ARPU question. In principle, however though, as you'll remember, in the first quarter of last year is when we really started managing through some heavy churn related to the price increase toward the end of the year. And so the results at year-end, which is what this is measuring year-over-year, wouldn't have reflected the first quarter's experience around churn and discounting in that business. And as you may know, we've talked about, our average discount rate in the fourth quarter of this year -- last year -- was about 22%, whereas a year ago, it was 29%.So I think we've just been mostly focused on being particularly disciplined about the front book and how we actually -- and the back book -- and how we actually maintain ARPU. And that's probably what you saw in the fourth quarter around net adds. And churn was better in the fourth quarter, but sales were also a little bit down as we became more disciplined around the ARPU line. So I think Charlie mentioned that we had sequential ARPU growth. I think you'll continue to see that. But year-over-year, it's just a matter of when you're measuring those two numbers. Do you want to add to that at all, Tom?Yeah. Just thank you. I'd just add that maybe the estimate there of the year-on-year decline was a bit overstated. Remember, a year ago, we actually had two concentrated price rises, so we were coming off a particular high. In this period, as Mike's mentioned, we feel we've managed it significantly better. We were always going to see that difference in Q1 of this year rather than Q4 of last year because as we said on the deck, there's only a half a quarter's price rise, and it's pretty much a nominal increase in that first period. So it's really an issue about how we're performing through this Q1 period and through that whole range of actions that Mike's mentioned about a more structured approach to discounting, about the V6 EOS boxes being deployed, about better routers, about better base management overall. We are in significantly better shape than we were 12 months ago. -- To your mobile question, it depends on what you're measuring. Right? In both Telenet and particularly in VodafoneZiggo, we have seen the sort of improvement that gives us confidence, and in particular, I'm referring to NPS and churn. If your NPS spikes, which it has in the case of Holland, for example, then your churn declines, which it has there, as well, as you combine and bundle customers across fixed and mobile, that is a really encouraging trend for the long-term. And remember, fixed and mobile for us in Europe, it's partly offensive because we know customers want more and more products from us. And in the case of markets where we have MVNO services, we're a challenger, and we're growing revenues 20, 30, 40% as we enter markets with mobile.There's also some defense involved, as there should be because our competitors, mostly the incumbent telcos are also converging. And so we have to be responsive to the market, and in knowing that fixed-mobile convergence is inevitable on some level. It varies by market. Some are far more converged than others, of course. But in the end, we want to be in that business and we want to be in it profitably. And I think we have the ability to do that in just about every market we're in.There are headwinds in the mobile business. We've talked about them endlessly. And there are some tailwinds, as we've seen. Both with synergies and with things like Wego in Belgium, which is clearly improving all sorts of metrics across that relatively small, today, mobile base. So I've described it as being quote/unquote, \"in transition.\" As we look out over the long-term, we know that being in the fixed-mobile space makes a lot of sense for us, either through an MVNO or and MNO relationship, the latter coming with massive synergies, the former coming with reasonably good economics and the opportunity to be a challenger. So that's how we'd describe it.Great. Thank you. -- You got it.We'll take our next question from Michael Bishop with Goldman Sachs.Yes, hi there. Just two quick questions for me. Firstly, just picking up on the capex points that you usefully pointed out and spit out in the presentation. If I, sort of, look at it another way and I take out the new-build from the $5.1 billion, it implies about 24% capex to sales. So I was wondering, is there anything else that's, sort of, exceptional one-off in that, and whether we could see the underlying rate fall further toward 20%. We actually had a pretty similar debate on the Telenet call about the future level, as well.And then secondly, given your 5% OCF growth guidance for the full-year, accordingly the UK is going to be a driver of that. So I was just wondering if you could help us better understand where you're thinking the contribution from Project Lighting will shake-out in '18 given your comments that that didn't really contribute at all in '17. Thanks very much. -- Yeah, on the capex point, I think Charlie should be back on. I'll just add one thing and then let him address it more specifically.He's not back on. -- Yeah, great. So, I mean, and one thing I would add that is happening both last year and should happen this year and contribute to incremental capex beyond what we would consider normalized capex, are things like what we're doing in the UK with the V6 box rollout. So we had a million toward the end of last year. I think we're budgeting a million-and-a-half or more this year. So we are proactively, both with our EOS box, or our upgraded 4K, super-fast video platform, as well as with our Connect Box, so the new routers that provide a Gig of speed in the home. Both those sorts of CPE, for us, are really powerful tools to retain customers and grow customers. So we are, I would say, leaning into that CPE business a little bit more than we might otherwise.My view long-term is we do trend back down to the low 20s if you were to exclude all of that. And that's, kind of, where we were before we started new-build. But the one thing beyond new-build that we are leaning into, as I kind of indicated, was to get these devices in the home, we know NPS is up, like, 20 points when we put a V6 box in somebody's house. That's good capital spend. Any other color on that, Charlie? -- Yeah. The two other things I would say, I think Telenet taught us that project dial-in to investments and customer experience, IT, which is a front-loaded investment, as well as their investment in the mobile phone network of base, which I'm sure they explained to you that that is a front-loaded investment. The other big numbers is, as you saw, is in product. We're investing a lot of money in products. And that's good capital. We're putting a lot of money to B2B, to conserve  is frontloaded. And quite a bit again to what we call enablers, which is global digitalization of the customer experience, which we think will pay back very richly.So I do think this year has got a lot of, as you said, one-offs in it. The last comment, Mike, [00:43:40] you threw out a number of 24%. I wouldn't go about that the CPE growth is also, as Mike said, to do with the V6 boxes. But it's actually also to do with new-build volumes, which it definitely -- I mean, that's part of the new-build spend, if you like. So it's not quite so clear that the new-build we're talking about on the slide is pure to the access network investment. -- Yeah, great point. Great point. Yeah. And on the Lightning question in the UK, we're really not providing any detailed guidance around either Lightning or the UK, except to say, sort of, anecdotally that the contribution in '18 will be materially higher than it was in '17, as you would expect because we're scaling through some of those start-up costs. We have now a million homes to market aggressively. And I think we're much better and more efficient at that process. So it should be a meaningfully larger contribution in '18 than '17. But we're not going to give you any specifics. -- Just to give you some color on that, as Mike brought up, the faster we can grow that start-up base, ironically, the more EBITDA we lose because obviously, we'd need to start acquisition costs. So in some respects, one of the reasons we don't have any guidance is because it will take -- we want to grow as fast as we can, but that obviously will have a big impact to the profitability. But just exactly what he's saying, is genuinely accelerating in terms of new asset and profitability.Great. Thanks so much.And we'll take our next question from Robert Grindle with Deutsche Bank.Yeah, hi there. Thank you. In terms of the Project Lightning question, you're obviously gaining traction in the market and in the UK, and you have retreated to 4 million homes target. I wonder how you feel about the new entrance to fiber rollout in the UK. Obviously, you guys are well ahead of the game, and they'll be slow to get going. But is there either an opportunity to help on the costs of Project Lightning by sharing? Or is there an incremental opportunity beyond your original plan by leveraging off some of the other operator's build programs. Thank you. -- That's a really good question. I'll let Tom address what's happening, really, on the ground. I'll simply say that you're correct. We do have a head start. We've been building for over two-and-a-half years, now coming on three years. We have been through the challenges, as we all know on the call, but also responded very, very aggressively and positively to those challenges, and feel today that we've, kind of, nailed it. You know, we know exactly what it costs, how to build efficiently, how to get it done, and how to market in the wake of that build. So we do feel like we have a big head start. And I think that a lot of the activity you see today in the fiber announcements, I would describe them as -- not necessarily projects since most of them haven't really begun much -- is partially tactical, partially politically, partially also strategic.So you correctly point out that some of these announcements might create cooperation of collaboration for us or others who are looking to reduce costs and be more efficient. We'll see. It's a lot of capital. We know we've got the capital. We know we've got the rate of return. We're showing it to you. We know we've got both the inclination and the conviction around it. I don't know whether the rest of them will have the capital, the conviction when push comes to shove. So it does feel like we are way out in front. And it does feel to me like there could very well be opportunities to make our project even that much better.Tom, do you want to add some color to that?The only thing I'd add is that today, this moment, we've got over 500 crews out there averaging six people on a pretty wet and drizzly day actually making it happen. And as Mike alluded to, we've learned some lessons, maybe the hard way. But under  and with the cooperation of the core technology and innovation group across Liberty Global, we've really reorganized ourselves and we are much, much more confident about our ability to execute. And if other people see the opportunity to compete with BT, net-net, that probably helps us. -- Next question, operator.Next question comes from Daniel Morris with Barclays.Yes, morning. Thanks for taking the question. I've got one with a follow-up. I just wondered if you could talk more top-down on your ability to take price in the market. I mean, obviously, specifically looking at Germany. That's the market where '18 is going to be quite substantially smaller in terms of price increases versus '17, and that versus '16, as well. And maybe also you can also talk a bit more conversely in the UK, I think maybe the direction of travel is a bit different, that we could actually see year-on-year ARPU growth again in '18. So how do you think about your ability to take price in the market, generally? And then I've got a bit of a follow-up. Thanks. -- Well, I mean, as I mentioned in my remarks, we did execute price increases in 2017 pretty much across every market. It wasn't necessarily across every sub in every market but it was across every market, and generally, they range from 2 to 4%, 2 to 5%. In 2018, we've either already announced price increases or intend to in, again, pretty much every market, most of those kicking in, I would say, in the April to March timeframe. And really, the UK is the only one that, sort of, we're benefiting from in the first and certainly all of the second quarter because it was a Q4 price increase. And so we're, like our peers in these markets, we are, where we can, being I would say, optimizing the price-value relationship for customers. And I don't see that changing materially.What we have to do a better job of, and what I think we have been doing a much better job of is retaining as much of that price increase as possible because, clearly, as we learned a year ago -- and it was over a year ago now -- the price increases we do take ultimately have an impact on both churn and discounting, and you've got to have the tools, the right processes, the right people, the right incentives to both retain and manage that base once you take those price increases, especially in large markets like the UK. I feel really good about our ability to do that today. And that's a good segue to the ARPU question, Tom. You want to hit that -- in '18?Yeah. I've got, clearly, all the issues you have alluded to are going to play out. And as I said earlier, we think we are in a much better position, and we are operating in a much better position than we were 12 months ago with a new team in there and a new structure.Another thing I would point out going forward is the PL rights deal, which has come through. I know it's not complete yet, but potentially overall lower, certainly no higher than it was beforehand. That's going to give us a cycle of three years where we don't have the cost pressures from football rights driving a nominal price rise is just a pass-through from our point of view. So that should give us an opportunity to take price rise where we actually can retain a share of that outcome.That's helpful color. Thanks. I think you've, kind of, partially answered the second half of the question, which was very much that if we look mechanically, the price tailwind in Germany and the UK, your two key markets, looks like it's smaller in '18 versus '17, but your OCF growth guidance is stablish and Charlie already mentioned that there's a possibility that actually Lightning isn't a big tailwind if you're successful, ironically. So I was trying to just understand how you get to a stable OCF growth. But I think you've partly answered that. I don't know if there's anything to add. -- Well, I think there's a -- I'll give you a bit more color on the guidance. Clearly, if we're staying around 5%, that would include a range. You can decide what the range is. Our full-year results in '17 would have been closer to the lower end of that range. So obviously, we believe there's a very good chance we're at or above the mid-point of that range. And so I would suggest to you that the trend we see for our business in '18 is up. But we are also being cautious because there are headwinds.And one headwind, in particular, is our Swiss market. As I indicated just moments ago, we don't anticipate a massive turnaround in Switzerland. We have sports cost, and we're in the investment phase in a number of areas of that business, and so we're being conservative there. If you took Switzerland out of our results in '17, we would have been at 6% or higher in the fourth quarter.So clearly, we understand the moving parts of our business, but as we aggregate everything, there are always going to be headwinds. And we want to be transparent about those headwinds, but they might impact the overall results, it's not necessarily something that is reflective of our aggregate business, but as we've had in the past, whether it was Holland or some of you may remember Romania, sometimes with 12 countries, somebody catches a cold. So we want to be transparent about that.Very helpful. Thank you.I'll take our next question from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.First, the UK RG result this quarter, how much of that's related to price-hike churn versus backing off aggressive promotional activity? And then assuming you continue with these strategies, is it fair to assume, despite the benefit of Project Lightning, that your UK and net new RG use are probably going to be lower in '08 than '07, although, obviously, you'll have a higher quality customer and better ARPU trends? And then I've got a follow-up. -- Well, I would say, and again, I'll let Tom provide some color here -- the fourth quarter was a function of a number of things. But as I, kind of, indicated earlier, Jeff, it was really discipline around discounting. And our average discount was meaningfully below the discount a year ago. So year-over-year, that explains quite a bit of it. The other thing I would suggest to you is churn was down in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. But also sales were down a little bit as we were careful and disciplined about marketing and sales expenditures, as well.So I don't personally believe, and Tom I'm sure will agree, that fourth quarter is necessarily an indication of how we're trending. And consistent with what I just said a moment ago about the overall business and how we see it trending in '18, and I would suggest to you that that applies to the UK as well almost across all metrics.Alright, fair enough. And then Mike, can you comment on press speculation in the UK, you may have been on 5G? And if that's something that might be interesting, how are things different today than, say, compared to your experience in Chile with building out your own network? Thanks. -- Well, there have been some rumors around that. I would simply say that to the extent we were looking at that, it would be really optionality, Jeff, as opposed to something more strategic where we would be, as we did in Chile, looking to spend all of the capital to build a competitive network. I don't see us doing that in the UK. I wouldn't consider -- I wouldn't look at it in that light.Great. Thank you very much.And we'll take our next question from BJ Giant.Thanks. Mike, obviously, you guys are making a lot of investments with high-end boxes, faster broadband speeds, and you keep talking about you're really focused on driving ARPU. Can you give us some sort of sense on how the ROIs are sort of developing on these advanced advantages that you have? Because when you look at aggregate numbers, we see more capex, and we don't see the ARPU rising the way you would think.So at the unit level, any color? Because there's obviously a question about will customers pay up for these advanced services broadly? And any experiences you could share would be great. -- Yeah, well, I'll say that the largest part of our increased capital profile is, of course, new build and upgrade. And we do know, as we showed you in the case, in the slides, that that is a very high return on an unlevered basis. So it may be the highest return investment we're making. It is the highest return investment we're making today. So the vast majority of this incremental capital that we're describing here and talking about is rigorously examined, and constantly evaluated, and must come through a gauntlet of Charlie's team to ensure there's a rate of return on it that's acceptable to us. So hopefully you take some comfort in that.The smaller piece of the incremental capital that might be related to V6 boxes or connect boxes, I'll simply say that we're careful about how we roll those out. It's not indiscriminate. We generally are focused on customers that generate high ARPU for us. And we know that when NPS spikes and churn goes down, a happy customer is a profitable customer. So that's more anecdotal than detailed, and I'm not going to share any specific product economics with you around that. But if we weren't seeing an NPS spike, if we weren't seeing a churn reduction, that would suggest to you that maybe we aren't -- maybe we should be backing off that. But we are seeing the opposite. And just intuitively, if not financially, that's smart capital.And just on DOCSIS 3.1 rollout across the footprint, any update on faster speeds? Is that also generating excess returns? -- Well, you mean the return on our capacity spend.Yeah. -- Historically, if you look at the pace, or the rate at which consumption has been increasing 20 to 30%, and the rate at which broadband speeds that we deliver have been increasing, say, 20 to 30%, there is a correlation between speed and consumption. And generally speaking, whenever possible, our higher-end customers are paying us more. And if you look at the game -- the business that we're in, which is competing with incumbents and staying superior to incumbents in most instances, that model has worked for us historically.In terms of breaking down exact capacity spend to return, I mean, I'm not going to do that for you on the call here, except to say that we look at that spend very rigorously, too. And we're always optimizing the capacity in relation to usage and speeds and consumption. On DOCSIS 3.1, we are darn near all the way there in terms of having our entire footprint gigabit ready with 3.1. I think we reported last year, we were about 75 -- 80% ready. I think that'll grow to 90-some-odd% this year. And the expenditure to bring that network up to 3.1-ready has not been material. The only cost we'll really incur down the road, BJ, is for new 3.1 modems. And of course, we'll do that when we're ready. And we'll do that in the most economic way possible.And to your point, we won't just roll out a 3.1 modem indiscriminately. We'll roll it out to customers that pay us more for the higher speeds and the better services.Great. Thanks so much.And we'll take our next question from Matthew Harrigan with Buckingham Research.Oh, thank you. I was curious, you didn't talk really about the emerging European telecoms' framework. Aetna has really come out and said that so much of the profits in the new digital economy are basically being allocated to Facebook, Google, etc., and at the same time, you had that interesting consultancy study a few months ago from Arthur D. Little, really talking about numbers that were just large in a macroeconomic context, even for Europe. How do you see the field moving over there so that your growth could even accelerate as you capture more of your fair share of the innovation in the digital economy? -- Well, I think the framework in Europe is evolving. As we've said many times over the last decade, it's really been very favorable to us, the challenger, allowing for consolidation and stimulating investment, and I would say benefiting and rewarding those who invest and innovate quickly in markets. And the consumer's been the beneficiary, I think. So the last ten years have been very favorable. We're in an interesting moment here. We've talked about this publicly. It's an interesting inflection point. You have the commission that, I would argue, is looking to advance the framework exactly as it was, for the most part, which is incenting investment, encouraging investment, and ensuring that there's a rate of return for all players in the ecosystem.There are some political winds that are brewing around national regulators, in particular, who'd like to get more control over how you define market dominance, significant market power. And we're all scrambling a bit to ensure that the right outcome occurs. It will be some time, Matt. It'll be probably this summer before any resolution, and maybe even summer '19 before there's any real implementation of a new plan. My instinct is, it's not going to discourage investment. It's not going to discourage competition. It's not going to be something that we have to be too concerned about.The European Union, as you have already, kind of, highlighted, is much more, in my opinion, rational and balanced about the actors in this business. And in particular, it has a healthy view of digital platforms and wants to ensure that there's fairness in terms of both their contribution to taxes and employment, as well as what they're doing to disrupt existing businesses. I'm not suggesting they're swayed one way or the other, I'm simply saying that they have a healthy view of how that should evolve, and I feel good about in principle. We have to do our work. We've got to keep making the case, as do our peers. But I think in principle, the European market has historically been reasonable and rational and I suspect it will continue to be so.Do you have a personal reaction to the IOT numbers and aspects like that from that Arthur D. Little report? Because, I mean, they were just absolutely blue sky numbers. I mean, if you got even a small percentage of it, it would be integral to your business. And I know that we're talking  . -- Well, that's another -- yeah. It's a very good point. I think that the IOT business, as it evolves, and it'll take some time, is going to benefit all players in the market. If you're in the mobile business, clearly, a lot of the applications will be applications that are low bandwidth, that don't require a lot of capacity but require ubiquitous coverage. So that's a positive for us. But also if you're in the fixed business, those applications that require more bandwidth, having fiber as we do throughout these markets is going to be a huge advantage for us as 5G becomes more prevalent and as these applications develop.It's early days. I think if you ask anybody, even Vittorio, to Randall Stephenson, to Brian Roberts, it's early days for everybody in the IOT space, and it's largely application-driven. So it doesn't mean it won't be interesting, and it doesn't mean we won't benefit from it. I just think it's too early to say, you know, here's how we're budgeting revenue and here's how we're spending capital. I think over the next 24 to 36 months, some of that might be clear to folks.Not in the '18 budget. Thanks, Mike. -- You got it. Okay, I think, is that our last question?And the last question -- -- Okay, go ahead operator.We have one final question from James Ratzer with New Street Research.Yes, thank you very much, indeed. So this is kind of a last question. I was wondering if I could just come back to the issue around UK ARPU, please. I know we have the price rise in for six weeks of the quarter. You've also talked, Mike, about doing less discounting in the quarter, but yet the year-on-year ARPU trends actually didn't really seem to improve. It's still down, I think, about 0.4% year-on-year. So just interested in digging in a bit more on what's happening here. Is there something more, maybe, fundamental that UK consumers are just getting more price savvy and sensitive and it's just going to be tougher to push through ARPU due to mixed effect of spin-down? And secondly, just a -- sorry, Mike. Go ahead. -- No, you go ahead and ask the second question. It's fine.Yeah. And it segues also to how the UK, but on a slightly different topic, coming the Vodafone press release made it clear you're in discussions on the continental European assets only. So if you can comment at all, I'd just be interested in why the UK assets aren't part of your negotiations with Vodafone at this time. -- Well, I can't comment on the second question. Maybe they will, but we're not going to. On the first question, the main point here -- and Tom, I'll ask you to jump in -- the main point is, when you're looking at year-over-year, so let's say December 31 to December 31, that's ignoring the path of travel throughout the year. So as you may recall, we had some ARPU erosion last year, sequential. And the important point I think in ARPU is to look at sequential ARPU, James. And between Q4 and Q3 and between, certainly, Q1 and Q4, you want to be looking for sequential ARPU growth, which we didn't have. We had some challenges last year, as we went through and talked about quite a bit, the year-over-year number isn't the most important one. It's way are we coming from in the last two quarters, as I would say.Tom, you want to add to that?Yeah, no. I'd reinforce the point -- I think it's about Q1 '18. The issue is where we had the particular pressure last year. We're just going to have to prove ourselves to you in three months' time when we come to this earnings call that we have a much better team, effectiveness, systems, and organization, and discipline around that.You'd be hopeful of more -- further sequential ARPU growth going into Q1 next year, or this year, I should say.I don't think I meant to say that. I'll just say that we are -- we certainly feel that we are much better organized around the price increase. As we've mentioned, if anything, we took some pain on volume in Q4 in order to defend the ARPU. And in combination, we have better systems, frankly, better people, a better commitment around that.And you're not seeing, then, just to kind of follow-up here from the last question, any kind of general pressure around discounted having more, kind of, favor with consumers as the economic climate in the UK bites at all?I think in the broad, that's less of an issue for Virgin Media than it is for some of the other operators. We're clearly the highest ARPU operator in this market. And if anything, that position is widening. We avoid the heavily discounted piece of the market there on the bottom, essentially because that's not our product. That's a BT open-range product that other people sell. So I think in our position in the market about primarily being a triple-play operator, about being the fastest, most effective provider, having the best router, frankly, we think now the best Tivo V6 box to support that -- we sustain the highest ARPU. So we really, we continue to focus on ARPU accretion as a positive thing for the business.Great. Tom and Mike, thank you. Very clear. -- Sure. Thanks, guys. Alright, we appreciate everybody joining the call. Sorry we went over just a little bit. Look forward to talking to you on our first quarter results in a few months, as Tom said. We remain focused on the few things that I talked about up front. Right? Driving national scale wherever we can, investing in profitable customer growth, and that really means putting money into our networks and our products, or smart money. And then optimizing levered equity turns for you guys. So we think that's a strong combination, and we'll speak to you in a few months.

Data and mobile subscriptions were up and cable subscriptions fell, which shouldn't shock anyone. Here's a look at the details of the business last quarter.CEO Mike Fries said price increases implemented in November improved cash flow and new products for Wi-Fi and video are helping drive growth. He sees a strong 2018, too:Guidance includes adjusted  of $1.6 billion for 2018 and management also expects rebased operating cash flow to grow about 5% from $7.09 billion in 2017. New products and higher prices are driving better economics and long-term sustainability.Slow and steady growth is the name of the game in telecommunications today and Liberty Global is executing well. The fact that data and voice activations are much higher than lost video customers is a positive sign and I think new video products will stem the losses as well.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I'm talking, of course, about Lou Simpson, the long-time Geico portfolio manager, who  after 31 years at the company, more than a third of them spent under  (NYSE:  , NYSE:  ) ownership.It's hard to believe that the legendary investment manager, who outperformed the  in 18 out of 25 years between 1980 and 2004, has been retired for more than seven years. Boy does time fly.Simpson grew bored of retirement very quickly, so the veteran money set up SQ Advisors, an investment advisory firm with  in assets under management that would handle money for friends, family and some charities.Charging 1% annually with no performance fees, Simpson was just happy to have something to do every day that he enjoyed and could help people. Fast forward to the end of 2017 and Simpson's managing  in assets invested in  stocks.Although all 14 companies in SQ Advisors' portfolio are good investments, here are what I think are the seven stocks to buy from Lou Simpson's portfolio:This alternative asset manager is  anywhere in the world. Up until mid-2017, long-time  (NYSE:  ) CEO Bruce Flatt flew under the radar of most investors.However, it decided it needed to tell its story to more people, and so the company went on a bit of a PR tour that culminated in Flatt appearing on the cover of  magazine's May issue.Most people probably couldn't pick Flatt out of a police lineup but Simpson could.Brookfield is SQ Advisors' largest holding at  , or 10.9% of its multi-billion portfolio. He knows that delivering a cumulative return of 1,350% over the last 15 years, as Flatt and company have done - more than seven times the S&P 500 - is no easy feat.Lou Simpson investing in Brookfield, especially in such a focused portfolio, is the ultimate form of flattery. If you can only own one of these stocks, I'd make it Brookfield. (NASDAQ:  ) is one of John Malone's many interests. Malone holds  of Liberty Global, the world's largest international TV and broadband company with $15.5 billion in annual revenue operating in 12 European countries under brands such as Virgin Media and Unitymedia.In case you're wondering, Warren Buffett's company controls 5.4% of Liberty Global's votes; SQ Advisors about half that amount. Simpson acquired his position in the second half of 2014 at prices between  and $43. Today, it trades around $32.But before you question my sanity, it's important to remember that Liberty Global  its Latin American business - operations in Chile, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and other parts of Latin America - in early January.Shareholders got one share in the newly independent business for each Liberty Global share. Together, they're worth $55.Simpson holds his businesses for the long haul, so unless the story drastically changes I'd expect him to continue to make Liberty Global one of his biggest positions.It would be darn near impossible not to include the stock of Simpson's former boss on my list of seven stocks to buy.Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway is not one of SQ Advisors' top five holdings. In fact, Simpson only owns a little over one million Class B shares, which represent  of the $3.1-billion portfolio.Although Buffett and Simpson have a similar investing style, the former Geico money manager is far more likely to invest in smaller companies than Buffett, making a more significant position in Berkshire Hathaway an unlikely occurrence.\"What we do is run a long-time-horizon portfolio comprised of ten to fifteen stocks. Most of them are U.S.-based, and they all have similar characteristics. Basically, they're good businesses,\"  Simpson in a rare 2017 interview. \"They have a high return on capital, consistently good returns, and they're run by leaders who want to create long-term value for shareholders while also treating their stakeholders right.\"That sounds an awful lot like Berkshire Hathaway, doesn't it?Simpson bought a big chunk of BRK stock back in early 2012 at prices between $76 and $82, an annualized return of 17.1% over six years.While this is one of Simpson's smaller holdings representing just 5.2% of SQ Advisors' portfolio, I just love the niche aspect of its business.  (NYSE:  )  exclusively on the public sector providing a wide range of software and solutions to local governments and schools.It might not be glamorous, but providing the tools needed by public sector operations pays the bills; more importantly, it keeps America moving. A storied history that dates back to 1938, Tyler committed to serving the public sector in  ; it's been uphill ever since.The company finished 1997 with a profit of  on $76.4 million in revenue. Nineteen years later, in its most recent fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016, it generated net income of  on $756.0 million in revenue.A $100 investment at the end of 2011 was worth $474.16 five years later, more than double the performance of the S&P 500 in the same period.It's not a fast-growing business but it sure is consistent, increasing revenues in  out of the last ten years. No wonder Simpson likes it.One of the portfolio's smallest holdings by market cap, Simpson added  shares of  (NYSE:  ) in Q4 2017, boosting it from the tenth-largest position in the previous quarter, to the fifth largest by the end of the year.Representing 8.2% of the portfolio, Cable One is one of the ten largest cable companies in the U.S. with more than  residential and business customers across 21 states.Why Cable One?It's got a simple business plan that  on higher-growth, higher-margin products that generate positive cash flow while keeping a lid on costs. It doesn't want the most customers; it wants the most profitable ones.Looking to find more profitable customers, Cable One acquired NewWave Communications in 2017 for  . NewWave was the  cable company in the U.S. with customers in seven states. Still, in growth mode, Cable One's focus on the profit and loss statement will deliver higher returns from NewWave under its management.Simpson likes owning good businesses. Cable One fits that to a tee.Except for the recent return of volatility, the nine-year bull market has been good news for  (NYSE:  ), who've seen operating profits grow from  at the end of 2009 to  this past year while operating margins increased 16 percentage points to 43%.The wealth management industry's been good to Schwab and Schwab shareholders. Over the past five years, SCHW stock's delivered an annualized total return of 26.3% to shareholders.Now Simpson's third-largest holding, it's clear he's not afraid to buy and sell Schwab stock, as the number of shares held has ebbed and flowed since first buying in 2011.Currently trading near $53, Schwab had a very healthy 2017, with revenues and income up 15% and 25%, respectively. An amazing stat  in its Q4 2017 press release gives you an idea of the runway it has heading into 2018 and beyond:\" Schwab's Retail business rose by 49% versus 2016; 54% of these households were age 40 or younger.\"Need I say more? (NYSE :  ) might be the ultimate Warren Buffett stock if it were only a little bigger.Simpson's fourth-largest holding at  of the portfolio. While the money manager trimmed SQ Advisors' holdings slightly in Q4 2017, the manufacturer of heavy-duty commercial vehicle transmissions and hybrid-propulsion systems for city buses is a relatively new purchase for Simpson; he first acquired shares in 2016.As long as the U.S. economy continues to chug along, investors can expect Allison Transmission to continue to do well. In Q4 2017, the company increased its North America On-Highway revenue by  to $270 million. Outside North America, Allison's On-Highway business increased sales by 18% year over year to $98 million.In fiscal 2017, revenues and operating profits increased by 22.9% and 44.3%, respectively. The company expects 2018 net sales to increase by as much as 7% on strong On-Highway results.Unless something happens to the economy, this guidance seems conservative. I see good things in store for Allison in 2018.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoIn early trading on Friday, shares of Idexx Laboratories (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 3.3%.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Tuesday, shares of Liberty Global plc (Symbol: LBTYK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.5, after changing hands as low as $28.22 per share.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYK options chain for the new September 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of 55 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $29.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $31.78/share today.Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 72%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYK stock at the current price level of $31.78/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $35.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.08% if the stock gets called away at the September 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing LBTYK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $35.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 10% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 80%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of Liberty Global plc (Symbol: LBTYK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 26.9, after changing hands as low as $30.951 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 64.8. A bullish investor could look at LBTYK's 26.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of LBTYK shares:    Looking at the chart above, LBTYK's low point in its 52 week range is $25.86 per share, with $37.00 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $30.96.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ: LBTYK) was expecting 2017 to be a big growth year as it consolidated its power in European telecommunications and brought new products to market. And that vision may still take place, it's just taking a little longer than planned.First-quarter results released this week showed there are some signs of improvement, and 2017 should still be a growth year. But not every market was growing as quickly as planned, highlighted by the U.K.'s tepid growth in the quarter.Image source: Getty images.Data source: Liberty Global earnings release. Includes only European operations.The results above look bad on the surface, but they're due more to accounting changes than to a deterioration in the business. Here's a look at some of the highlights to keep in mind from the quarter:Management said conditions in the U.K. and Belgium were weaker than expected, causing the reduction in operating cash flow guidance from 6% to 7% to a new expectation of 5% for 2017. While this is a surprise reduction, management did say they expect second-half performance to improve as new products -- like a 4K set-top box and 4G quad-play offering -- hit the market.A steady increase in the customer base is helping drive Liberty Global's results, and with 4K TV and more bundled offerings coming, there will be more opportunities for growth. Short-term, the reduction in operating cash flow guidance is a bit worrisome, but it sounds like it's more of a delay in expected growth than a fundamental flaw in the business model.Liberty Global has the right set of products for the modern economy; with its customer base expanding, 2017 should be another solid year for shareholders, despite the small reduction in expected growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company has been leveraging up its balance sheet in order to buy back its stock, retiring nearly $700 million worth of its stock in the second quarter alone. The company has also announced plans to repurchase another $3.0 billion worth of its shares by the end of next year. Down the road, the company's expanded service area and product offering could help to keep its top-line in growth mode, so perhaps it wouldn't be all that surprising to see shares start to rebound in 2017.While Buffett has had a handful of clunkers in 2016, it is worth remembering that these losing stocks only represents a tiny fraction of Berkshire's total holdings. Thus, these faltering stocks have barely put a dent in the company's overall performance. In fact, Berkshire overall has done  in 2016, which is why shares have risen more than 26% since January.

Here are the highlights investors should know from the quarter.Source: Liberty Global Group Q3 2016 earnings report.The results above encompass the entire business, including Latin America, but the business is generating most of its cash from Europe. And it's in that mature market that growth is strongest.Europe isn't a high-growth market, but management is focused on generating cash from the business right now, and the strategy is working. Revenue from Europe was up just 2% in the quarter, but operating cash flow excluding Ziggo was up 5%, and operating income jumped 60% to $764 million.The Latin American business, though, has been a drag on results; the company has struggled with competitive pressure and mixed economic performance in the region. Revenue there fell 1% in the quarter to $894 million, and the company had negative adjusted free cash flow of $39 million. Management is hoping to turn the business around with cost cuts in coming years, so investors will want to keep an eye on the progress.A few years ago, it would have seemed crazy to think that Europe is where the operational growth and stability is for Liberty Global, not Latin America. But that's definitely the case, and management has been able to expand offerings for individual consumers, and grow the business slowly but surely.For the company to take the next step, it needs to achieve growth in Latin America, but that's uncertain right now.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYK options chain for the new November 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $29.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $30.71/share today.Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYK stock at the current price level of $30.71/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $35.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 14.46% if the stock gets called away at the November 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 242 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYK options chain for the new April 2017 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $22.50 strike price has a current bid of 40 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $22.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $22.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $30.76/share today.Because the $22.50 strike represents an approximate 27% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYK stock at the current price level of $30.76/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 30.20% if the stock gets called away at the April 2017 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

For companies like  , that presents both a threat and an opportunity in its home bases in Europe and Latin America.On Thursday, the company reported third quarter results, and while the revenue growth won't knock your socks off, the company's transition to a new era of media should keep it generating cash flow for many years to come.\n  \nSource: Company earnings releaseGiven Liberty Global's complex structure, it's important to look at some of the highlights that drove the quarter's numbers.Liberty Global's key European market continues to slowly improve. This won't be a high growth region, but given the entrenched nature of the infrastructure the company offers, it will be a consistent cash generator for years.Surprisingly, Latin America and the Caribbean continue to be strong as well, despite some turbulent economic times. Rebased revenue was up 7%, and operating cash flow grew 10% in the quarter with LiLAC in Chile and Puerto Rico.LiLAC Group is still a small business for Liberty Global, but it's the company's biggest growth opportunity with just 3.5 million subscriptions compared to 53.2 million in Europe. Businesses like mobile are also highly competitive, with a number of regional players in the market, so owning the space may not be as easy as it is in Europe.For the full year, management is expecting mid-single digit growth on a rebased basis for Liberty Global Group and LiLAC Group. The slow growth in Latin America can primarily be explained by a strong dollar, overshadowing subscriber growth. Investors will want to keep an eye on how an unstable economy in the region affects results, however, because macro conditions may play a bigger role than they do in more established economies.In Europe, the strong subscriber additions in broadband should continue with blazing Internet speeds of up to 500 Mbps across Europe. What will be worth watching is the Horizon TV offering, allowing customers to watch TV online. Unlike U.S. offerings, this could replace cable and keep customers in the Liberty Global family. New subscribers of nearly 250,000 shows some solid traction there, and if that continues the future could be bright -- even for the TV side of the business.Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models. And when cable falters, you don't want to miss out on these 3 companies that are positioned to benefit.  for their names.

Operations in Europe are also improving as the economy slowly picks up there and customers begin demanding faster broadband connections.The 50/50 merger of Vodafone's mobile operations in the Netherlands with Ziggo's broadband network will also help drive the company's broader adoption in the country. This will make the \"triple play\" more compelling for consumers and repeats a strategy Liberty Global has been using across Europe and Latin America.The Dutch transaction likely won't close until the end of 2016, but look for it to be a potentially lucrative growth market for Liberty Global with 280 million euros of cost synergies already identified by the two companies.In many ways, the fourth quarter was the strongest of the year for Liberty Global, despite currency headwinds from a strong dollar. The strategy of investing in faster broadband and more \"triple play\" options for customers is paying off and that should continue in 2016.The continued momentum in share repurchases should also help shareholders over the next couple of years.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

At  , we have reviewed 4,163 13F filings for the 12/31/2015 reporting period, and noticed that Liberty Global plc (Symbol: LBTYK) was held by 9 of the particular managers we have flagged as \"titans\" most widely followed by investors. It is not every day we see this many notable hedge fund managers thinking alike, so we wanted to take a closer look.Before we continue, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their  positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their  positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story  .Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at  of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in LBTYK positions for each of the titans that reported holding some amount of LBTYK at 12/31/2015:\n  \nIn terms of shares owned, we count 1 of the identified titans above having increased existing LBTYK positions from 09/30/2015 to 12/31/2015, with 2 having decreased their positions and 3 new positions. Worth noting is that  (  ) - also deemed to have \"titan\" status - exited LBTYK common stock as of 12/31/2015.Looking beyond these particular hedge funds of interest, we tallied up the LBTYK share count in the aggregate among  of the funds which held LBTYK at the 12/31/2015 reporting period (out of the 4,163 we looked at). We then compared that number to the sum total of LBTYK shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2015 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for LBTYK. We found that between these two periods, hedge funds reduced their holdings by 14,053,329 shares in the aggregate, from 482,588,160 down to 468,534,831 for a share count decline of approximately -2.91%.

When it reported second-quarter earnings, analysts were surprised to learn that Disney's highly popular sport channel, ESPN, actually lost subscribers during the period. Source: TCLThe losses were a shocker because ESPN had a very solid track record of subscriber growth and profits for Disney. It also stoked fears across the entire entertainment industry that the shift from traditional television viewing channels, such as cable and satellite TV, was really starting to accelerate to the Internet.The funny thing is, in 2015 cable television actually reported some of its strongest subscriber growth in the past decade. Cable giant Comcast reported  for its television services during the last quarter in 2015, and Time Warner Cable added 32,000 subscribers. These trends were modest at best, but still the best growth these companies reported in nearly a decade.The media firms that focus on content, such as television programming, will benefit from this recent stability, and also have ample opportunity as content does shift online.

It created the Fox television network more or less out of thin air, and also owns the namesake movie studio business.Media titan Rupert Murdoch remains executive chairman, and his son, James Rupert Murdoch, now runs Fox on a daily basis.Fox is no longer growing briskly, but the forward P/E (for the year ending June 2017) is quite reasonable at just over 12.

One thing that has been hitting the stock, in addition to the general industry concerns mentioned above, is that a lot of revenue comes from overseas. A strong dollar has been hurting the international results as they are translated back to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.Discovery's forward P/E is just below 16, which is a great deal given its strong historical growth trends. Given the steadier-than-expected trends in cable, it makes sense to recommend a traditional operator in the space.  provides broadband cable and internet in far flung locations including Europe, Chile, Puerto Rico, and other international locations.Like Discovery, Liberty Global is getting hurt by the strong dollar. But reported revenue has grown 21% annually over the last three years, and the firm just announced it is purchasing Cable and Wireless Communications. Profitability trends are admittedly murkier, and the company is acquisitive with lots of debt. But this is a firm heavily influenced by cable titan John Malone, who has among the best reputations in the business for compounding capital for shareholders.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYK options chain for the new February 2015 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $49.28/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 78%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.11% return on the cash commitment, or 0.72% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 55 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYK stock at the current price level of $49.28/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 2.58% if the stock gets called away at the February 2015 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing LBTYK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).
