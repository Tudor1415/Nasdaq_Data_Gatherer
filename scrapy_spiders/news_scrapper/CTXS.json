Probably not, but the new normal for businesses today is certainly remote work. (NASDAQ:) is helping businesses and workers to adapt, and CTXS stockholders have profited during these challenging times.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\tDon\u2019t get me wrong. Like most other tech assets, CTXS stock took a hit in late February when the news of the  first impacted the markets. But since then, the company\u2019s resilience and the stock\u2019s recovery have been impressive.Even after all the coronavirus-induced fear subsides, a compelling argument can be made that Citrix will remain poised for growth. In anticipation of this, taking a position in CTXS stock today could be a smart and forward-thinking move.Some media pundits have been behaving as if working remotely is a brand-new phenomenon. If you listen to them, you might get the impression that people didn\u2019t start to work from home until the pandemic started.That\u2019s far from the truth. Remote work has been around for decades, though not all businesses really considered it until recently. Now they\u2019re seeing that remote work is not only possible for their business model, but is actually more efficient and convenient in many respects.Therefore, investors should expect businesses to continue to avail themselves of remote-working options well into the future. Besides, the practice of social distancing won\u2019t vanish immediately after the coronavirus crisis subsides.Citrix has been  for a very long time. As Citrix CMO Tim Minahan observes, the company has been \u201cenabling remote work for more than 30 years.\u201dMoreover, as Minahan concisely but cogently explains, savvy businesses won\u2019t just abandon the remote-work paradigm after the pandemic:\u201cRemote work is top of mind for companies around the world. And while some see it as a short-term fix to the COVID-19 problem, smart companies recognize it may be a long-term solution as they plan for what promises to be a radically different future.\u201dIndeed, it will be a \u201cradically different future\u201d where face-to-face interactions won\u2019t be the norm for a while, and possibly indefinitely. Yet Citrix was already providing solutions for this problem long before it existed.The company\u2019s solutions are already being used by over 400,000 organizations. That includes 98% of the world\u2019s Fortune 500 companies. It\u2019s safe to say that big companies will continue to use Citrix as their go-to source of remote-work technologies.But the company certainly isn\u2019t sitting on its laurels, as Citrix continues to innovate in the remote-work niche. Consider  as an example. With this, it\u2019s possible to secure endpoints for multiple workstations (desktops, laptops, tablets, internet of things devices and even smartphones) from a single source.That source can roll out updates, for instance, to many devices all at once without traveling or touching a single screen. This innovation goes far beyond social distancing. It\u2019s a way to potentially reduce data breaches in a time when corporate data protection is of paramount importance.And of course there\u2019s , the company\u2019s crown jewel in the remote-work world. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a more flexible solution for a remote-work environment.Businesses can use Citrix Workspace to facilitate a secure remote-work network both on the company\u2019s premises and in the cloud. Multiple users, devices, apps and networks can work together in a secure and centrally controlled manner.Long before the pandemic rattled the global economy and markets, CTXS stock was an excellent investment. Today, Citrix\u2019s value proposition remains stronger than ever.You could even say that the company has been preparing for the remote-work revolution for 30 years. Now the revolution is here, and Citrix is right at the forefront.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system \u2014 with .

The coronavirus pandemic has sent many stocks into freefall, and for good reason -- many companies have had to cut back their operations and lay off workers due to restrictions and lockdowns.But not all businesses are struggling. The three stocks listed below are still in good shape and are actually up by more than 30% in 2020. Investors should consider buying these stocks that are poised for even bigger gains this year. stock is up 42% this year, largely thanks to its cloud business. The  offers cloud-based products and services geared toward biopharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers. Its two key products are Veeva Vault and Veeva Commercial Cloud. The former helps companies manage and integrate their content and information safely, and the latter includes a suite of customer relationship management (CRM) applications.With the healthcare industry running at high capacity amid the pandemic, demand for Veeva's products and services is likely to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Investors will get a better idea of the effect that COVID-19 has on Veeva's business when the company releases its first-quarter earnings later this month. But even a modest boost in activity could lead to a much stronger bottom line; in each of the past eight quarters, Veeva's profit margin has been over 21% of revenue. Image source: Getty Images.What may turn some investors away is that Veeva's stock is trading near its 52-week highs and a hefty 100 times earnings. However, when things are going well, it's not uncommon for a stock to be reaching new highs, and that's something investors may expect from Veeva this year as demand for quality healthcare information and secure digital infrastructure is soaring amid the pandemic. has seen a surge in demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic, making 2020 an exceptional year for the company with its stock up by 35%. The consumer goods company sells a variety of cleaning and household products that drive most of its sales. In particular, the company said its disinfecting products are seeing \"extraordinary growth\" as consumers look to keep themselves and their homes clean to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The company released its third-quarter results on May 1 and sales were up 15% from the prior-year period. That's remarkable  considering that for the previous three quarters, Clorox's sales were declining. And in the company's most recent fiscal year, total revenue increased by a modest 1.5%. The pandemic has turned Clorox into a growth stock, and it's little surprise that its shares are up over 35% this year. Clorox's net income in Q3 totaled $241 million and was also up by 29% from the prior-year period. As an added bonus, Clorox pays investors a quarterly dividend of $1.06 that yields around 2% per year -- which is in line with what investors can earn with the average  stock. But Clorox is also a , having increased its dividend payments for 42 years in a row. And given how well it's doing this year, it's likely we'll see that streak continue in 2020. The stock currently trades at around 30 times its earnings. is a tech stock that helps people stay connected and working even while they're away from the office. And as more people are working from home, it's another stock that's seen demand for its services rise. The tech company reported its first-quarter earnings on April 23, which showed both sales and profits were above analyst expectations. Like Clorox, Citrix's most recent quarter was a clear anomaly from previous periods, which showed little to no growth. In Q1, Citrix's top line rose by 20% from the prior-year quarter, while profits were up an impressive 64%. During 2019, the company's sales were also up a very modest 1.2% from the previous year, while profits improved by 18%. While the effect of the pandemic may appear to be a short-term influx of sales for Citrix, social distancing measures could remain in place long after COVID-19 is over. And with companies looking to be leaner and more efficient, using technology to minimize the need for office space could resonate with managers looking to maximize profits. For now, Citrix remains cautiously optimistic. It has raised its guidance for the year, but it's wary of being too bullish as well given the uncertainty that lies ahead for countries and businesses around the world due to the pandemic. In addition to the stock being up over 37% this year, Citrix began paying investors a modest dividend in 2018. Quarterly payouts of $0.35 are yielding a return of a little less than 1% per year. The stock currently trades at around 27 times earnings.Here's a quick snapshot of how these three stocks have done so far this year:Image Source: YChartsAll three stocks are performing well so far in 2020, but not all of them offer the same long-term potential. Once the pandemic's over, Clorox will likely see sales start to taper off. And while Veeva's been growing well before the pandemic hit, its high price tag makes Citrix the better buy today. Citrix could see longer-term sales growth even after the pandemic as companies look to be more versatile and flexible in offering their employees more opportunities to work remotely and cut down on overhead in the process.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTXS options chain for the new June 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $147.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.80.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $147.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $142.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $148.79/share today.\n\nBecause the $147.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.27% return on the cash commitment, or 23.84% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $147.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTXS stock at the current price level of $148.79/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.84% if the stock gets called away at the June 26th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTXS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTXS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%.

Cops are on the beat. Couriers deliver food and packages. Insurance agents work from home.The coronavirus crisis would appear to have put the entire U.S. economy on ice. Twenty-six million people have filed for unemployment in just a month, with millions more likely waiting in electronic queues at overtaxed state unemployment systems.Still the U.S. job count stood at more than 152 million as of February. Paychecks are arriving for tens of millions of government workers, hospital, sanitation, utility and other employees deemed to be doing essential jobs; an army of employees working from home; and even chefs cooking for carry-out. For roughly 42 million retirees, and millions more with disabilities, monthly Social Security payments continue.When the first gross domestic product reports of the pandemic era are issued Wednesday, the numbers will show a large hit from the virus-fighting efforts that began in mid-March. Forecasters expect anywhere from $2 trillion to $5 trillion of output to be wiped out by year's end.But in a nearly $22-trillion economy, that leaves a lot on the table, the foundation for the gradual reopening being announced by state governments to build upon.While described as a \"lockdown,\" the restrictions recommended or put in place around the country have just as often amounted to a rearrangement. For tens of millions of Americans, work has shifted from office to home and moved online. Other businesses may have been ordered to close, but have hunted for ways to cope and maintain some revenue.For some companies, the pandemic could even bring a bumper year.Wickliffe, Ohio-based Lubrizol Corp, the specialty chemicals maker owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Corp , has avoided layoffs among its 4,700 U.S. employees. And it continues to churn out products like the gelling agent used to make hand sanitizer.\"We've tripled our production of that material,\" Chief Executive Officer Eric Schnur told Reuters, \"and we still can't get enough of that to our customers.\"Procter & Gamble Co  and Kimberly-Clark Corp  both recently posted their best sales growth in years on demand for cleaning and personal hygiene products, as evidenced by shelves stripped bare of toilet paper at grocery stores nationwide. Citrix Systems Inc , the software maker enabling millions of people to work from home, posted record sales in the first quarter. None of this is to downplay the staggering blow the pandemic has dealt to the U.S. economy. The United States won't thrive on teleconferencing and toilet paper, of course, and the scope of the downturn is unprecedented. It could get worse if the virus isn't controlled or a vaccine developed. In the meantime, small entrepreneurs and those thrown out of work are depending on trillions of dollars in approved government aid to keep them afloat.Even if the health crisis passes soon and the economic rebound is sharp, there may be lasting structural change -- whether in the type of jobs available, the travel and dining habits of consumers, or the look of Main Street if small businesses collapse.BIG GOVERNMENT, ESSENTIALS AND THE HOME OFFICEStill, parts of the economy have been buffered.Start with government, accounting for a steady 17.5% of U.S. gross domestic product at the combined federal, state and local levels over the past three years, or $3.7 trillion of GDP in 2019.That includes administrators, clerical workers and technology staff running the benefits programs that other Americans now rely upon, as well as firefighters and others who maintain basic services, including teachers leading online classrooms.Much of that employment is likely to continue, at least for now. But difficult choices loom for state and local governments as costs for their pandemic responses rise, while key revenue sources like sales and income taxes tumble. That could force layoffs.Calls for a broad package of federal help for local governments have so far been resisted by leading congressional Republicans. However the Federal Reserve this week expanded the scope of a $500-billion lending program for state, county and local governments. That will allow the Fed to buy short-term bonds from hundreds of local government entities to help them raise money needed to pay staff wages and other bills.The federal government, meanwhile, will borrow massively to fund nearly $3 trillion in emergency programs. A large share of that is in the form of direct payments to households and expanded unemployment benefits. Jobless families will spend much of that on food, housing and perhaps medical care. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. output.In contrast to government, the private sector has absorbed a massive blow: Roughly one of every six workers was laid off in the space of a month. Airlines have been grounded, the industry so stricken it was singled out for direct government loans. Hotels and restaurants were also among the direct casualties of social distancing edicts.But the dramatic headlines mask what's still going on among two large categories of workers: those working remotely and those whose occupations are deemed \"essential.\" The latter category encompasses an enormous swath of workers, including front-line medical personnel, public safety officers, people laboring to keep the food supply intact, those distributing goods around the country and utility workers keeping the lights on and the water flowing.A Brookings Institution study using the Department of Homeland Security's guidance on \"essential industries\" estimated  that up to 62 million employees might qualify, as much as 40% of total employment before the crisis.Searches for \"telehealth nurse\" increased more than 10-fold from March to mid-April on Indeed.com, the job site's Chief Economist Jed Kolko said in a recent presentation. Online sellers and food retailers, notably Amazon.com Inc  and Walmart Inc , have added tens of thousands of employees to ship goods to homebound Americans instructed not to venture out if possible.Many of those people bunkered in their houses are still earning income. Up to 37% of U.S. jobs \"can plausibly be performed from home,\" according to a recent study by Jonathan I. Dingel and Brent Neiman, researchers at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. They estimated those jobs account for an outsized 46% of U.S. wages, and include perhaps 80% of workers in the finance and insurance industries, and in scientific and professional fields.Many of those jobs could still prove vulnerable. Architects and civil engineers, for example, could be laid off alongside bricklayers and carpenters if construction slumps. The longer a downturn lasts, the more troubles will mount for the nation's white-collar workforce.But even in the hardest-hit industries and states, some activity continues.Michigan, for example, has been hammered by the coronavirus, with more than 38,000 COVID-19 cases. It ranks in the Top 10 nationally both by the total number of cases and in the infection rate, estimated at roughly 3,400 infections per 100,000 people. Michigan's automotive sector closed down early, and other industries followed under Governor Gretchen Whitmer's March 23 stay-at-home order, considered among the strictest in the country.(For a state-by-state breakdown of U.S. coronavirus cases, see: )The unemployment rate in Michigan, among people covered by unemployment insurance, hit 17.4%, the highest in the country.But even Michigan's tough rules deemed 14 industries to have at least some essential workers, including financial services, communications and \"critical manufacturing,\" along with health and public safety.Restaurants, bars and many retail outlets had to close to the public. But restaurants could still offer carry out, hotels could stay open if they chose, and construction on many types of projects could continue under social distancing rules.All businesses were allowed to keep some employees on site for \"minimum basic operations\" such as maintaining equipment and inventory, guarding property, processing payroll or transactions, or supporting those working remotely.An analysis of Michigan's unemployment claims by Michael Horrigan, president of the Upjohn Institute, a labor think tank, showed the differential spread of the crisis across industries and gave some sense of the workforce still on the job.As of mid-April, as many as 54% of workers in Michigan's construction sector were still employed, according to Horrigan's analysis. He compared unemployment claims filed in the industry with employment levels as of the first quarter of 2019, the most recent data from the federal government's comprehensive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. For agriculture, finance and utilities the share of workers still employed could be above 90%, he said.The numbers will no doubt change as more unemployment claims are processed and as restrictions are lifted, a process Whitmer has already begun.Based on 2019 output levels for the state by industry, if current levels of joblessness held for a year it would cut Michigan's GDP by perhaps 23%, knocking the state back to where it was in 2013. Nonetheless, that would still mean Michigan workers and factories would generate $422 billion in goods and services this year.    SOME ADAPT, SOME THRIVEAcross the country, firms are coping in different ways. Some are finding small bits of revenue to sustain themselves, while others are adjusting to an unexpected surge in demand.Utah greenhouse owners Scott and Karin Pynes had built a solid events business alongside selling plants, but those gatherings vanished overnight under social distancing orders. The Pynes don't expect to be hosting weddings or corporate events anytime soon, they said in a recent webcast seminar on business survival sponsored by the David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah.Their business, Cactus and Tropicals, is still taking online orders for plants and offering outdoor displays and pickups. The Pynes are holding video landscaping consultations by Skype and Zoom, and hunting for a new business model that will work as the economy reopens, perhaps under new rules to keep people more distant from each other.Scott Pynes said the company has scaled back seasonal hiring, but kept around 85 permanent staff on the payroll with the help of a Small Business Administration loan. With the peak season starting on Mother's Day, he has his fingers crossed.\"We feel confident we will make it through,\" he said in an interview with Reuters. \"We will be a bit scarred.\"Richard Schwartz, chief executive of Austin, Texas-based Pensa, faces the opposite challenge -- keeping up with a burgeoning workload.Schwartz's firm offers automated inventory tracking to retailers so they can plan orders, detect shortages and let manufacturers know to ramp production up or down accordingly. It does that with the help of artificial intelligence software and drones that prowl the aisles of stores to count items on shelves.Pensa's flying checkers, he said, were a \"sleepy\" part of the wholesale-to-retail supply chain before coronavirus hit. Many stores were content to use human workers to jot down inventory on clipboards.With virus-panicked shoppers emptying shelves and manufacturers struggling to keep pace, robots offer a fast way to keep track of inventory and ordering needs.

The coronavirus has created a global tragedy with the total number of cases crossing 3 million, and the number of deaths surpassing 208,000 at the time of writing.Over the past four weeks, some stocks have seen a partial recovery, but many continue to trade significantly lower than record highs set earlier this year. Several economists are predicting a recession far worse than the one experienced in 2008-09, which suggests equities are likely to remain volatile for the remainder of 2020.With interest rates nearing record lows, the stock markets still seem to be the best place to park your funds to generate decent returns on investment. While most industries are grappling with lower consumer spending, three tech companies have seen a surge in demand for their products and services, driving stock prices higher this year. Let's take a closer look at them and see if these three companies are worth investing in. data by The coronavirus has led to lockdowns and business shutdowns globally, and especially in the U.S. With most retail closed, people are turning to buying products online. E-commerce giant  recently hired  to keep up with this increase in demand and says it is focused on prioritizing essential products such as groceries and cleaning supplies among the orders it receives.This rise in demand has led to supply chain constraints. According to one  report, Amazon canceled  to reduce bottlenecks and discourage customers from purchasing non-essential products.With a majority of the population staying at home, people are also seeking out new forms of entertainment. Online streaming platforms including Amazon Prime Video are expected to see a significant uptick in subscriber growth. Amazon was one of the companies that  of its videos to reduce internet bandwidths constraints in European Union countries.Another Amazon-owned entertainment outlet is Twitch, an online game streaming platform. Twitch is one of the most popular streaming platforms for gaming enthusiasts. According to TwitchTracker, the number of average concurrent viewers  1.3 million in January to 2.5 million in April.\u00a0As people are working from home and educational institutions are conducting online classes, cloud services are expected to get a serious demand boost. This suggests Amazon Web Services, a leader in cloud technology is poised to benefit from this trend.All of this suggests that Amazon stock is set to be one of the top-performing companies at a time when most industries are experiencing massive sales decline due to lower consumer demand, making it a top-buy in an uncertain market.\u00a0Shares of Amazon have gained close to 26% in 2020, at the time of writing. Despite its recent upward spiral and lofty valuation, the stock is well positioned to continue moving higher in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The world's leading streaming platform,\u00a0 , has crushed market returns in 2020. The EU also requested Netflix\u00a0 and conserve bandwidth due to higher demand for online streaming services.In the first quarter of 2020, Netflix added close to 16 million users, more than double management's estimates of 7 million. Netflix's management noted however that this growth is unsustainable in the future and it expects membership growth to decelerate once some normalcy is restored. Netflix\u00a0reported sales of $5.76 billion compared to its forecast of $5.73 billion in the first quarter. Netflix also reported adjusted  of $1.57 which was below the forecast of $1.66.Image source: Getty Images.While Netflix gained a substantial number of subscribers in Q1, it had to halt original content production. That might negatively impact future growth if the lockdown extends for a few more months. For now, though, Netflix management says it has plenty of fresh content in the near-term pipeline for longtime subscribers to remain interested.Given its leadership position among streaming services and , Netflix remains a safe bet in these uncertain times.\u00a0Netflix stock is up close to 34% in 2020 as of this writing.\u00a0The ongoing lockdown in several countries has accelerated the work-from-home trend. Businesses have adapted to remote work, and  is a key player in this space. Its virtual private network (VPN) software lets users access computers and central network servers remotely in a secure environment and is popular tool among enterprises.Similar to several other IT companies, Citrix is looking to transition toward a\u00a0software-as-a-service () business model. Citrix ended 2019 with $3 billion in annual sales and a 41% growth in subscription annual recurring revenue. In the fourth quarter, around 69% of total bookings were subscription-based, which will help Citrix in an economic downturn and ensure a stable stream of recurring sales.The work-from-home trend is likely to be here long after the COVID-19 threat subsides, making Citrix a solid long-term bet for .

The standard deviation is $24.539.\n\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average CTXS price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with CTXS crossing above that average target price of $148.75/share, investors in CTXS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $148.75 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTXS options chain for the new December 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.80.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $123.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $140.75/share today.\n\nBecause the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.74% return on the cash commitment, or 13.35% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTXS stock at the current price level of $140.75/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 14.60% if the stock gets called away at the December 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTXS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTXS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.03% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.26% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 43%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 38%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $140.75) to be 32%.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Traci Tsuchiguchi, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am. -- Thanks, Gigi and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's first quarter 2020 . Participating on the call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Arlen Shenkman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note that we have posted our first quarter earnings letter to our Investor Relations website.I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's earnings letter and in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on our Investor Relations website.Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of our earnings letter on the Investor Relations website -- page of our website.Now, I'd like to turn it over to David, our President and Chief Executive Officer. David? -- Good morning and thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe during this time. So, as you can tell, we've moved our  to occur before the market opens to decrease the scheduling conflicts that have been due to the concentration of companies that typically report after market close this week. So, as you saw in our earnings letter that we released earlier this morning, we had a very strong first quarter, reflecting the importance of Citrix to our customers' business continuity efforts. There's really no doubt that our business benefited from the near-term pickup in demand as a result of this unprecedented pandemic, as remote work, in general, changed from a nice to have to being truly mission critical for all businesses. More importantly, longer term, we believe that employees and employers will view the way in which we all work through a very different light. Over the long run, we believe that these secular trends will be a tailwind to our business, as organizations around the world are really recognizing the benefits to employee productivity, cost reduction, and operational flexibility.That said, as we consider our guidance for the balance of 2020, we certainly remain cautious due to the unknown financial impact that COVID-19 is going to have on economic output all around the world. However, based on the strength of our first quarter, as well as visibility into the near-term pipeline, we are raising the top-end of our full-year outlook for both revenue and EPS. So, of course, we're going to continue to assess our outlook for the second half of the year as more information on the scope of economic disruption comes to life.So with that, we're now happy to open it up for questions and talk through the first quarter.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thanks guys for taking my question. I'm glad to hear that you all are healthy and best wishes to your families and your team. David, just a question for you, obviously, strong first quarter results. I wonder if you can give some color and just sort of what you're seeing in the current month. You mentioned some of the visibility you have in Q2. Just maybe compare sort of March to April for us, and then just one quick follow-up. -- Sure, Phil. I'd say that if you step back and look at Q1, obviously, March when everybody realized that they were going to have to put business continuity at the top of the list, there was a surge in demand. So, we did a few things. So we actually did these looking back into the latter part of January and February to prepare for this. So, in anticipation, we created a number of unique offerings for SMB customers to simplify access, security, etc., offerings for our installed base customers to just ramp burst capacity very quickly with, we'll call them, limited use non-renewable licenses, and a number of other things. And so, a lot of uptick clearly throughout March and some continuing into April as well.It depends a little bit by geography in terms of the rate and pace. If you look at our results based on the geos, you'll see that very strong results across EMEA and the U.S. APAC was a bit more of a general and I see that one continuing over the course of this quarter as well.And so, overall, I'd say, when we look at the coming quarter, clearly, business continuity and related activities continue to be incredibly important to businesses. Medium term, I think a lot of companies are going to step back and realize that the triage, if you will, that they put in place in Q1, not just Citrix customers, but companies in general, is really limited. I mean, the ability to just give somebody a video chat app or connection email is really the basics, and so, we are having conversations now about people stepping back and realizing that their business runs on hundreds and hundreds of applications. So the need for a more complete infrastructure is going to continue to be important. Network bottlenecks, connectivity, those types of things are also raised. So, the -- I'd say the focus will change modestly in Q2 and beyond. But overall, just reinforces the critical position that Citrix plays in our customers' infrastructure. -- Great. Thanks, David. And then just a follow-up on that, if you think about deployment types, obviously, one of the things that you've been talking about is, over the past several years, the shift to the cloud, some of your partnerships with Microsoft. With sort of the crisis taking place and maybe some of the strain on on-premise data centers, do you see an acceleration in shift to the cloud and how do you think that is and will play out? -- Two things, Phil. I mean, if you look at our business specifically in Q1, we have such a large base that is still on-premises and we have over 7 million licenses in the cloud today, but you balance that against roughly 100 million licenses to on-prem. So, for our business, we saw a lot more expansion across that on-prem, just sheer volume. But in general, I think that this current crisis is really going to accelerate the overall trends that we've seen in the industry, whether that is the adoption of public cloud, SaaS, remote and flexible working. These are trends that were already in place before this crisis hit. I think this will just serve as an accelerant to continue to move those forward, because businesses realized that this isn't a one-time event. This is really a -- an example of just the overall trends and the reasons they were adopting many of these new technologies and business models. -- Great. Thanks, David.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Thank you, David, and congrats on the quarter and for the collective Company efforts to help so many customers through this crisis. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions, maybe one for you, one for Arlen. Dave, for you, maybe you could describe mechanically how 2Q plays out as you phase out these limited use or burst capacity licenses. I presume that a portion of customers taking advantage of those programs will have to come back to Citrix assuming they're going to continue operating at elevated capacity levels to negotiate new deals, I presume, at more normalized price point. So, maybe you could describe how that will work. Obviously, your 2Q revs guidance implies a decel back down to a more normalized 3% growth rate, but maybe you could talk through mechanically how this end-of-the-burst capacity will play out. -- Sure, Karl. I mean, against the backdrop of a very, very uncertain economic environment is how I think everyone should view our forward guidance. When you talk specifically about the mechanics, you're right, a lot of companies around the world went into this crisis assuming that the shelter-in-place orders were going to be a matter of weeks. I think many people are stepping back now and realizing that we are not going to get back to a more normalized environment until vaccines are widely distributed around the globe. So that becomes quarters or even years.And with that as a backdrop, we certainly believe that part of our operational execution over the next few quarters is about helping take some of these burst capacity licenses and really work to transition them into more permanent long-term cloud licenses. That's going to be the right decision for customers. So, we'll put programs in place to do that as well. -- Okay, great. And then maybe for Arlen, Arlen, despite the massive upside to reported revenues, a few of the other metrics didn't get quite the same lift. Operating cash flow was solid, but up only 6% reported, deferred revs was actually flat year-over-year. I suspect that that there is some cash collection payment term issues that might be causing this dynamic of huge revenue lift, but some of the other metrics not getting a lift. Do you mind describing those and if in your response, you could confirm whether you still feel comfortable with the free cash flow target of $7 per share to $8 per share this year? Thank you. -- Yes, thanks for the question, Karl. As you said, there is obviously a number of moving factors in the free cash flow and in some of the revenue there. There is subscription mix and then there's the mix within subscription, and as you highlight, if you look at this quarter, we had -- on-prem was up essentially, perpetual license were up 28%. And as you also saw, we had a pretty significant increase in on term flex licenses, which obviously also come up upfront. So, that leaves us a great opportunity to go renew those as you highlight, but you're right, those things do move within that. And again, there is a number of factors involved, but we feel comfortable with where we are in terms of our performance and obviously in terms of how we're thinking about our free cash flow for the year. -- Okay, terrific. Thank you, both.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Great, thank you, and thank you, David and Arlen for taking the questions and hosting the call in the morning. Quick -- couple of quick questions. Just on the line of what Karl was saying, just about kind of what you're seeing in terms of payment terms, is there anything you could tell us about from your existing customers what you're seeing about their ability to pay bills on time or they asking for longer terms. Also, are -- people who just happened to have renewals up in the quarter, even so far this quarter, are you seeing them ask for discounts like we're hearing from other vendors?And then David, I just wanted to follow up on the limited use licenses you're mentioning. Is the -- what is the term of those? Is it variable? Is it no more than three months? So that -- is it -- was it a month license as you suggested people thought we wouldn't have been in this situation for as long as we've been in? But can you share with us some specifics on how long those limited use licenses, what the duration of those are before we start to see whether or not people can convert? And then I just have a follow-up. -- Sure, Heather. Let me take the first part of that -- the second part of that question. And then, Arlen, why don't you jump in on the first part? So overall, the license structure was somewhat customized based on what the customers needed at that point in time. And I'd say that, overall, it was a year or less. And so, it certainly didn't -- none of them extended beyond one year. They are non-renewable licenses that really just intended as burst capacity.The context, again, similar to what I said earlier is that once we come out of this, regardless of how long that takes, the expectation is that we'll land in a place that is somewhere between where we are and where we were when it comes to remote work. Most of the customers that I talk to are realizing a level of productivity benefits, cost savings, and employee engagement that they hadn't expected. And so, they're going back and questioning some of their original assumptions, whether that is real estate footprint, travel, attendance at major conferences.And so, longer term, I expect that these will -- this environment will continue to be a secular change that's very good for our business. In fact, Gartner just released a survey a few days ago, pointing out that 74% of companies believe that they're going to expand remote work once the crisis has passed. I think it's a combination of both conversion of our short-term licenses that we put in place to help customers through the pandemic, as well as broad secular changes that will occur over the course of many quarters or years. -- And then Arlen on the payment terms? -- Yeah, on payment terms, Heather, we obviously kept our finger really on the pulse of that as we entered through the quarter. And I look back at a number of deals and frankly, it was pretty limited. Certainly, we're sensitive to customers' needs and we are responsive, but it was nothing really honestly out of the ordinary in terms of what we saw in terms of discounting or request for extended payment terms or collections. -- And then David, my only other question for you is just long-term deferred revenue. Just in this environment, given people are trying to conserve cash, should we expect this to just start ticking down from here? Do you have any color you can give us about that line item, given people might not want to be paying multiple years upfront for quite some time? -- Yeah. Look, it's hard to forecast at this point in time. I mean, if you look at our duration, it obviously came down because of all the shorter-term capacity that we put in place. But, in general, you step back and look at our future committed revenue and it was up 19% year-over-year first -- versus 13%, 15% growth in the back half of last year. So, we did see a broad acceleration. I think it'll depend over the next couple of quarters in terms of how companies -- individual businesses are impacted. But in general, the importance of infrastructure to keep their roles that are effective remotely, to keep those people engaged is going to continue to be very strategic and very high on the list of what customers are prioritizing. So, we'll come back and report on that when we have better visibility into what some of those dynamics are. -- Thank you, again.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. -- Thank you and congratulations on the quarter and hope everyone on the call stays safe and healthy. I've got two questions. David, the strong Workspace beat, was this predominantly due to existing customers buying more capacity or were you seeing an uptick in new clients buying Workspace and implementing it? And then a follow-up question. -- Sure, Karl [Phonetic]. I'd say the context for the answer is that Citrix has a footprint in just about every medium and large business in the world. I mean, we have hundreds of thousands of accounts right now. So by definition, most of our business does come from existing customers. And however, as you've seen in some of our earlier presentations, we're generally penetrated about 30% into the available knowledge workers in those businesses. So, we have a lot of room to continue to expand penetration. So that's where the bulk would come from. We did add well over 1,000 net new customers in the quarter, but those tend to be more on the small, medium-size business as we have such broad distribution across large companies. -- Excellent. And then on Networking, can you give us some more color on the Networking beat? Which products were clients' purchasing? Were they buying term licenses, a hardware/software with a special discounting? Any color would be appreciated. Thanks. -- Sure. Networking is continuing the similar trends that we have talked about in prior calls. The ability to deliver a pooled capacity license, which allows customers to share -- effectively share capacity across a whole bunch of different deployment models, whether that is on-prem and the cloud hybrid, etc., is a story that resonates. And so, that's been the primary driver of the business overall. If you look at our earnings letter, we will point out that software accounted for 44% of total Networking revenue. That's continued to move up pretty dramatically.So, we've seen good results there. We also pointed out that Networking subscription in the first quarter increased over 130% year-over-year. So it's a continuation of the trends that we have seen before. -- Excellent. Thanks. I appreciate and stay safe. -- All right. Thanks, Mark.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is now open. -- Hey, David. A couple of questions for you on the products side just on plans. As it relates to your phase out of perpetual, how are you thinking about that this year, given what's been sort of a change in the landscape? And then interested just on the strategic projects that you've highlighted, things like trade-up and so forth that could weaken in the second half. How did you see that type of business fare in the first quarter? -- Sure. On trade-up, trade-up was deprioritized certainly in the first quarter. I mean, our teams were working around the clock just to help customers focus on getting their infrastructure up, ramp, debugged, etc. So, we didn't have a whole lot of time to focus on that. I mean, we'll start to pivot back to that over the next couple of quarters. And could you repeat the first part of your question, please? -- Just on the -- yeah, on the perpetual licenses and how you're thinking about. I mean, you were in a position, I think, for the year where you were looking at ultimately phasing those out. How does that -- does that change at all given the environment we're in now? -- Walter, I think that really -- no real change. I mean, as we've stated, we expect to do so by the end of this year. We haven't set an exact end-of-life date, but we've already started to make the changes in terms of sales compensation and others to de-prioritize that and really continue driving our subscription transaction. We will, of course, be sensitive to customers in this unique environment, but I'd say that our plans really haven't changed. -- Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a really impressive Q1. Had a couple of questions. Maybe to start with Arlen, a number of your peers have frankly taken the tact of withdrawing their full-year guidance. So my first question is, what sort of gives you the confidence? Obviously, you had a really strong Q1, but as sort of David mentioned, we are going to a more uncertain second half. So, what are some of the underlying assumptions you guys made that gave you the confidence to guide to the full year and how does that taken into account people returning to work earlier versus later? Just if you sort of walk through some of the fundamental assumptions around giving guidance. -- Thanks. I think we feel good about the trend that we're in and I think you see that in terms of how we're thinking about the second quarter, and as David said, in terms of the relevance and the strategy we've been executing upon. So, we see ourselves continuing to be part of an incredibly important conversation with our customers around remote work and enablement, and we think that will continue.That being said, the amount of uncertainty in the back half of the year is pretty significant. So, we are -- I think we remain confident in terms of our near-term execution. We understand our customers' needs and we understand where we are economically. In the back half of the year, I think, we frankly feel as if there's just a lot more uncertainty in terms of the overall economic picture and where it will end in the back half. -- Got it. And then, maybe David, to follow up on Heather's question around the longer-term opportunity, you just recently stated that about -- you have 30% penetration coming into this crisis of information workers. What has the sort of near-term surge of demand -- what sort of insight has that given you in terms of where that penetration could go ultimately? What is the sort of low-hanging fruit in terms of what verticals are the most under-penetrated coming in that could see the potential to really adopt this technology in a much more meaningful way going forward after we get past these short-term limited use licenses? -- I think it's similar answer to what Arlen just articulated is that the conversation that we're having with customers is really important. I mean, we've been able to prove a lot of roles around the world can be performed remotely without a loss of productivity, security engagement, etc. And so, while remote access had been seen as a tool for a limited group of employees, in some cases even a perk, it becomes much more mainstream long term as companies step back and rethink their real estate footprints, their ability to access talent around the world in places where they don't have offices and many other real operational drivers that go well beyond realities of business continuity. I think the situation we're in right now has also increased the visibility of business continuity when it comes to people, well beyond what it was historically, which tends to be more focused around systems and infrastructure. And so, this is now a board-level conversation to make sure that businesses can continue to operate to the best of their abilities regardless of situation.So, I think that the overall conversation continues to be much more strategic over time and for us, it probably means that Citrix as a vendor continues to increase and the strategic importance with all of our customers. Right now, obviously, we've been focused on short-term needs and helping the companies be productive. Longer term, what this will expose is that the needs, employee engagement, employee experience, employee productivity and a lot of the overall value proposition that we talk about with some of our new solutions around the digital workspace, I think will also really increase, because the need to make people as productive as possible is very pronounced and it's certainly impactful for the businesses. -- Appreciate the comments [Phonetic] given. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Majek from Raymond James. Your line is now open. -- Congrats on the strong quarter. You're benefiting from the shift to work from home, which is driving higher penetration rates, but the percentage unemployed in U.S. is in the mid- to high-teens right now. How should we think about these two drivers and how it balances out for your results this year? I have one follow-up question. -- Robert, when we look at the opportunity pool, we always subsegments the total employee base that is operated by our customers into those that are knowledge workers or utilize compute as a critical part of their job day-to-day. So, we really tend to look at those roles, which can be performed remote, not just total employment. And so, while it's really unfortunate, the segments of the economy that have been most impacted in the short term wouldn't have been a typical opportunity for Citrix seats. And so, there's a little bit of a balance there and it's an important one that we think through as well.That said, obviously, we're very sensitive to the overall economic environment and how that's going to play out over the balance of the year and how it's going to impact individual customers differently. -- That's helpful. And what's the price difference between the limited use and the full licenses? Have you started to see any customers upgrade from the limited use to the full license and what level of upgrades have you baked into the full-year guide? -- I'd say, it's -- there is no easy answer to the pricing question, because a lot of these are customer-specific and a little bit bespoke, but if you look at the overall programs that were out there, it was way less than half the price of a traditional license. In terms of people upgrading, it's too early to have that conversation yet. We'll talk about that once we have a couple of months under our belt. -- Thanks a lot.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. -- Thanks and I'll like to echo some of my peers' comments on the good work and keeping everybody safe. We appreciate that. Couple of questions from me. First on the -- on exposures. Arlen, maybe you could talk about how much of your businesses tied into SMB or perhaps to some of the more troubled verticals, like travel, hospitality, and the like? -- Yeah. We have obviously been through that analysis and look -- and I think as you've seen over the years, we have a very, very broad customer base and as David just articulated, we tend to have a very high focus on knowledge workers. So, what I would say is, obviously, we do have some exposure that baked in generally into how we're approaching the business and has been part of our analysis, but it's not been overweighed [Phonetic] or anything that you think it would have an impact on our business as diversified and as horizontal as ours is. -- Got it. And then as a follow-up, looking at your Networking business, I think everybody has been talking about how cloud should benefit substantially from what's going on here. Your SSP revenue didn't really move on a year-over-year basis. I know that visibility in this vertical is a little bit more complicated, but is there any view on whether that business should pick up as well, given everything that's going on? -- The SSP business, as you know, is a choppy business. As you mentioned, it was off a bit, but honestly, it represents about 2% of our revenue at this point. And so, we'll continue to see our SSPs also continue to buy product but it will continue to decrease as a percentage of our overall revenue. -- Very good. Good luck, guys. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, thank you. I've got two questions. First, I want to understand the $111 million you guys pointed out in your letter on the business continuity. What does actually that mean? And then second question, what do you see as a competitive threat from a Windows Virtual Desktop? -- So, in the first part of the question, what we wanted to do is just provide some incremental color in terms of the business drivers during the quarter. And while business continuity has always been one of the core value propositions that we deliver as part of our solution, it obviously increased. And while this is intended to be just a little bit more qualitative of a metric, it's just giving people insights into how much of our business was specifically tagged around business continuity. It doesn't mean that other parts of our quarter weren't influenced by that, but when we look at it, there was certainly a higher concentration than we've seen in prior periods. So, we just wanted to give more specific guidance around that.And then, if you look at further down in the letter, when we talk about ARR, we did exclude all of those temporary burst capacity licenses from our ARR calculation. They did not meet the traditional definition, and so, don't expect those to be in there as well. We look at it more, as number of people have said, if we here are successful in converting those to more permanent structures, those will be additive to ARR in future quarters. -- Can you give us a quantification of how much of the bookings came from those limited use licenses? -- It's in the letter, but it's over $40 million worth of revenue in the period. -- Okay, thanks. And then on the Windows Virtual Desktop? -- Yeah. So, we continue to work very closely with Microsoft. We continue to have a lot of joint engagement from a go-to-market standpoint around customers that are deploying everything from Azure as base capacity that are looking at Windows Virtual Desktop as a resource zone that can be managed with Citrix Cloud. We saw a pretty good uptick in Citrix Managed Desktops in Q1. I think of that as a turnkey DaaS offering that sits on top of Windows Virtual Desktop to really offer not just Azure capacity, but all of the capabilities around a fully functioning desktop.Continuing to have most conversations focused on customers that have a mixed-use environment, customers that have resource zones that include things like Citrix on-prem, Citrix Cloud, Citrix on WVD, or even WVD natively. I think that's going to continue to be the primary focus over the next few quarters. -- And WVD can service that sort of single pane of glass? -- Well, they're different capability sets, different scope of technology, and really a different focus. And so, up to this point, it's been additive for most of our customers. -- Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Yes, thanks very much, and hope everyone is doing well. David, you talked a little bit about sort of the broader shift of work from home becoming more of, I think, a board-level point of discussion as we get into broader digital transformation conversations. Obviously, right now, everybody is just trying to sort of level set and get their employees set up. I guess, how many of your conversations these days are really about sort of the longer-term versus just the near term?And within that conversation, I was just kind of curious, are people thinking about sort of the transition from licenses to subscription? Or is it really just about, look, I've got to rethink what's going on today and then call me in six months and we can talk about sort of the future then once things have settled that a little bit?I'm just trying to get a sense on how much of your discussion these days are focused more on just the here and now versus sort of the longer-term strategy of work from home. Thanks. -- It's a good question, Kirk. I think, obviously in the month of March, just about every conversation was focused on here and now and frankly, on a personal basis, I was spending more time with hospitals and those types of organizations and just try to get them ramped up as quickly as they possibly could. So we're very, very focused on customers.I'd say, over time though, I mean, discussions with my peers in other companies, it's really focused more on the longer-term benefits of work-from-home realization that people are as productive as they were in the office and in many cases more so. There's a lot of conversations going on about real estate, around travel, around large conferences, and those types of things. I think it's too early to say that we've got meta trends that are in place. But I think it's conversations that people are realizing that this is not just a set of capabilities that should be available to a limited subset of your employee base but can be looked at on a much more broad basis and thought of as just part of the overall infrastructure.So, I'd say, it's relatively early, but the trends that we talk about and the drivers long term, I think, are certainly in place. -- And somewhat related to that, just in terms of your expansion, I think of your relationships with some of the bigger GSIs, again, I think everybody was just trying to deal with, again, the here and now, but were there more inbound calls from those partners, not maybe trying to set up deals for tomorrow, but starting to put together more I think comprehensive solutions that you all could go to market with in a bigger way perhaps in three, six, nine months, whenever things normalize a little bit? -- Kirk, we are, of course, working through a number of opportunities with large partners, go-to-market and technology partners, but we're not in a position to kind of pre-announce anything. Let's wait till we get things completed and then we'll talk about it. -- Okay. That's fair. Thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Great, thanks for taking my questions. Glad you guys are all well and helping all of us out. David, I'm curious how long do you plan to sell some of these bespoke limited use seats? And when looking across your existing base at the end of the quarter, do you have a sense for how full or may be prepared your basis in terms of, I guess, these business continuity seats? -- Second part of the question, Matt, no, I mean, we have a subset of customers, obviously that we have talked to. I mean, we have a customer base that reaches into the hundreds of thousands. I will say that specifically to the limited use licenses, we've announced that we will be phasing them out by the end of April. So, that part of the program will phase out. Of course, we're going to be focused on other initiatives across go-to-market, things that have arisen in a lot of customer environments that have been recognized as a bottleneck. There is also a large set of customers out there, maybe not customers of Citrix, but just businesses in general that took very short-term focused solutions like a VPN or something that they stepped back and realized that delivering the entire infrastructure over a more protracted period of time takes a more complete solution. So, I think those are the kind of discussions that will transition into more of a complete digital workspace.And then longer term, it will be focused on employee engagement, employee productivity, benefits of cloud, flexibility, and the same types of conversations we would have been having three months ago. -- That's super helpful. And then I found your comment really, really interesting, noting that post-COVID you think CIOs will settle somewhere between where they were pre-COVID and where they are today in terms of remote workers. I guess, we'll see how that plays out. How do you think that impacts some of your other businesses like SD-WAN, you mentioned VPN, but maybe some of that -- those sorts of -- what are CIOs think about those sorts of businesses? -- Well, I'd say that, similar to my prior remarks, the secondary effect of some of these short-term solutions, those customers are going back and looking at overall performance, looking at network capacity and capabilities there. And so, we'll probably follow through with more opportunities long-term. -- Great. Thanks a lot, guys. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Good morning. On the go-to-market, are you going to accelerate your quota-carrying capacity this year based on what you're seeing or do you leave your plan unchanged going into this? -- Well, I think we're looking at a number of different plans. I mean, we as an organization in general are still hiring. We are still hiring quota-carrying capacity, we're still hiring engineering, customer success, and a number of other areas, and we'll just balance that based on what the opportunities are in front of us. Given the unique circumstances around the current environment, we're obviously replanning a few priorities and strategies and whatnot to just focus on what is most important for customers and what can help them over the balance of 2020. -- And just going forward on the deferred revenue line item, can you just talk to the importance of that? I think many have asked why we're not seeing faster growth. Do you anticipate that that will accelerate going forward? -- I think as you think about how we're going through this transition, I think it's much more important to focus on that future committed revenue number, which is up 19% year-over-year. So, we added about $400 million of unbilled, and I think that's a much more important indicator, particularly as we talked about, Brent, which is there is a lot of noise in our deferred number between prepayments and all the other things that happen. So we think that the real place to focus is on future committed revenue. -- Thanks, very helpful.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thank you, and I echo the comments from my earlier analyst colleagues. Two questions; first, on the emergency buying or the emergency situations that you saw in March, David, did that continue in April or is that -- you've mentioned the program for limited use got extended to April, but are we kind of pretty much done with that in March or are you still have more people coming there? That's question one. And question two is on SMB, like what are you hearing from the partners and what are you seeing in terms of SMB versus enterprise behavior at the moment? Is there more stress on the SMB side versus enterprise already or what are you seeing there? Thank you. -- Yeah. SMB has actually been very resilient throughout this period of time, but for us, it is a relatively small part of our overall business. So, we won't move the needle. In terms of the emergency buying, I'm not sure I would exactly qualify that same way, but there was certainly a huge step up in the middle of March that has come down from a level of intensity and then it becomes more of a sector-by-sector, geo-by-geo.As I mentioned at the early part of this call, you didn't see quite the spike in Asia-Pacific, Japan, it was more gradual over time. It just is a reflection of how quickly countries or regions went into a shelter-in-place, work-from-home type situation. And as you saw across Asia, that was at a much different pace than the United States, for example, that pretty much moved into that mode over the course of a week or two. So, I think we'll certainly not see that level of burst capacity purchasing, but it's still obviously a high priority item for our customers. -- Okay, thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is now open. -- Great, thanks very much. A couple of quick ones. David, on the M&A front, do you see this COVID situation is an opportunity to potentially get more aggressive as privates maybe have some financial stress? -- Hard to tell. I mean, it's hard to know exactly what individual companies are thinking from an intent point of view, but I will say when it comes to our internal plans, we continue to be very aggressive in looking at the landscape, looking at opportunities to accelerate our existing road map or very close adjacencies, and the backdrop there is, of course, we maintain a very disciplined filter, looking for the right transaction at the right price and making sure that the benefits that we can bring to that are demonstrable. -- Great. And then, you've mentioned a few times your expectation that COVID may impact on your customer base structurally sets themselves up going forward into the future. How does this impact Citrix's structure going forward? And how long do you think it would take to implement those types of changes? Thanks. -- Well, when it comes to our own business, I mean, we're in a very fortunate position. I mean, we have been delivering the future of work for 30 years. This is what we do. And so, we are way more prepared to be able to work remotely and so we've had a highly distributed workforce. That said, we have been 100% work from home for the better part of two months now and it raises visibility into certain practical challenges. There are a few roles that just can't be performed as efficiently remotely as they can in person and even though that's a very limited number for us, it is more pronounced than other industries.But we're going to take a step back and look at our own infrastructure, our own work-from-home practices and probably balance somewhere in the middle. I'd say that we had pretty good foresight into this. And so, in the January time frame, we had gone through stress testing of our systems, some large-scale drills and whatnot. So, as we moved into a 100% work-from-home, we did it without -- I mean, without a hiccup.We have already decided that we won't be traveling on an internal basis for the balance of 2020. As you would expect, we have canceled most of our large-scale events over the next few quarters. Those are just the practical realities of where we are from an environmental standpoint. We'll step back and look at the most efficient way to go forward. There is certainly in-person meetings with customers and other things that are going to need to happen, but I think building up the skill sets to be as efficient digitally as you are in person is something that Citrix as well as a lot of other companies are going to focus on going forward. -- Great, thanks very much.Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to David Henshall, CEO, for closing remarks. -- So, thank you again, everyone for joining the call this morning. As we look ahead to all this global economic uncertainty, we're, of course, going to make the decision to operate our business in the best interest of our customers, our employees, our communities, and our shareholders. We look forward to engaging with many of you virtually this quarter and talking to you again in three months. Have a great day, and please stay safe.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As a consequence, the total average contract duration of deals booked in the first quarter dropped to 1.3 years, down from 1.4 last year and 1.7 during the prior quarter.Image source: Getty Images.That boost may translate into long-term revenue growth as Citrix's customers may realize the extra flexibility such solutions offer.

Enterprises may choose to prioritize their business continuity over investments in computing infrastructures, which wouldn't bode well for Citrix.Citrix's solutions can easily scale with existing customers, and they can also accommodate the urgent and basic capabilities remote workers need.

The IPO was worth .Since then, ICE has been the worst-performing stock market stock. While ICE\u2019s value has doubled, (NASDAQ:) is up 169%.  (OTCMKTS:), the ICE spinoff, has been the star of the show, up a whopping 269%.But if you\u2019re thinking of getting into this relative bargain, there\u2019s more trouble ahead. Because the man who brought the exchange to Atlanta, Jeff Sprecher, has also bought himself huge political risk. That risk might yet force ICE to divest its prize asset.It\u2019s fitting that Atlanta now owns the NYSE. Atlanta is the primary back office of the credit card processing industry. Running a stock exchange today is a lot like processing credit card transactions.Sprecher understood this from the beginning. The low cost of processing real-time transactions, once the software is running, is behind the growth of ICE. When the exchange was forced to close its \u201ctrading floor\u201d early this year because of the , nothing happened. The floor had become nothing more than a TV stage set years before.

Economists widely expect a severe economic downturn as a result.Given the outbreak is expected to have hampered a broad swath of the economy in the first quarter, analysts are forecasting an 8.1% drop in earnings from the previous year, down from estimated profit growth of 6.3% at the start of the year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Moreover, a number of companies have pulled guidance for the quarter, raising worries that analysts' forecasts for the period may underestimate the extent of the fallout from the virus.The energy, consumer discretionary and industrials sectors have been cited for the biggest declines in forecasts since Jan. 1, and investors have been bracing for especially poor results from travel, entertainment, energy and discretionary companies in general.The S&P Composite 1500 airlines index , for instance, remains down Feb. 19, when the benchmark S&P 500  ended its nearly 11-year bull market and coronavirus fears sparked a deep sell-off on Wall Street. The S&P 500 is down since that date.Estimates for technology, communication services, health care, consumer staples and utilities have fallen as well, but all of those sectors still are expected to post some profit gains for the quarter, based on Refinitiv's data.Analysts see quarterly earnings in the technology sector   up 2.6% from 2019, communication services  up 7.8%, utilities  up 2.3%, health care up 1.6% and consumer staples  up 0.9%.Technology's relatively high cash balances and lower debt make it \"a rare cyclical safe-haven,\" said Daniel Morgan, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, Georgia.That is due in part to software spending, which has been resilient, said Morgan, who lists Microsoft , Nvidia  and Citrix Systems  among his top 10 picks of stocks likely to hold up better than others this earnings season.\"You're going to continue to see companies trying to streamline to become more productive. That trend to me is still intact,\" he said.Morgan also likes stocks in health care like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  and in staples, such as Clorox Co. .The rush to stock up on household items like toilet paper and cleaing materials has driven up shares of staples companies since the outbreak, which began in China late last year and then spread through Europe and the United States.\"Kimberly-Clark is the one that leaps to mind,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, referring to companies that have held up. Shares of Kimberly-Clark Corp  surged following the outbreak but are since Feb. 19.To be sure, some companies whose shares have outperformed may end up reporting lackluster reports. That is especially a hazard for grocery chains, according to Forrest. \"The stuff that people are snapping up is the low-margin stuff. Revenues will be higher, but Wall Street likes earnings,\" she said.Shares of Gilead Sciences  and Regeneron, which are developing potential treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, have performed particularly well. The S&P 500 health care index  is down since Feb. 19.Next week brings results from JPMorgan Chase  and other big banks, but also from some names in health care, including Johnson & Johnson  and Intuitive Surgical , while reports are due from International Business Machines  and Procter & Gamble  the following week.Goldman Sachs strategists, who are expecting a 15% year-over-year decline in first-quarter S&P 500 earnings and a 33% decline in 2020 earnings, wrote that they expect profits in defensive sectors such as consumer staples, health care and utilities to be insulated relative to most cyclical sectors.In addition, they said, \"we expect Info Tech EPS will fall by less than the broad index in 2020, given the high share of recurring revenues for some of the largest stocks.\"(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Alden Bentley and Dan Grebler)((; +1 646 223 6393; Reuters Messaging: ))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["In early trading on Thursday, shares of United Airlines Holdings topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 20.3%.

Citrix, known for\u00a0virtual private networking (VPN) software that lets users remotely access work computers and networks over an encrypted connection, became a go-to tool for home-based employees.The company already had wide acceptance. With 2019 annual revenue of $3.01 billion, Citrix solutions are in use by more than 400,000 organizations, including 99% of the Fortune 500.\u00a0But demand is exploding as it becomes apparent that employees all across the globe will be working from home for at least the next month, and probably longer.Image source: Getty Images.The COVID-19 crisis forced a lot of changes upon businesses. Operational fundamentals had to be reworked, and some changes will become permanent. Many companies will continue remote work as a way of doing business. Done well, it can save a company money and result in better situations for employees.Citrix comes with established integrations with , , and\u00a0, among others, and it has connectors with cloud providers such as \u00a0and Microsoft Azure. Established integrations mean IT administrators don't have to configure a third-party private network each time a user needs remote access.Security holes recently affected video conferencing company , causing a bit of a share price meltdown and consumer concern.\u00a0Citrix offers advanced levels of security, another thing IT administrators find comforting.I think Citrix is a promising investment as more businesses give Citrix a try during the coronavirus pandemic -- and potentially decide to make it permanent.Citrix has a long and reliable track record, and the fact that many more businesses have been exposed to its virtualization solutions since the coronavirus crisis began works in its favor. Employees and employers alike are realizing the benefits of securely working from home, and long-term demand will manifest itself.Although the stock has run up, I think there's still more upside left. Citrix has been around since 1989, and with 99% of the Fortune 500 as customers, it has a lot of credibility.\u00a0That will carry a lot of weight with smaller businesses who are now making purchase plans.Citrix has been moving to a more profitable subscription-based model for the past year. With the influx of demand comes more subscription revenue, creating more predictable cash flow and up-sell opportunities over the long run.\u00a0should do well by adding Citrix to their portfolios. A devastating health crisis exposed many more businesses to the advantages Citrix offers, and I think a lot of them will be customers for a very long time.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The index, however, remains up 19% from its March 23 low. Much of Wall Street's recent recovery has been thanks to a $2 trillion package aimed at stimulating the economy as much of the country hibernates to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Still, many investors remained skeptical that Wall Street's recent rise represents the start of a sustained recovery.The S&P 500 is still down more than 20% from its Feb. 19 record high. However, most of the index's constituents are worse off. The median change in the S&P 500 since Feb. 19 is a decline of 26%.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $129.70 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.03/share today.\n\nBecause the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.93% return on the cash commitment, or 31.15% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $143.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.20.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTXS stock at the current price level of $138.03/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $143.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.37% if the stock gets called away at the May 22nd expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTXS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTXS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $143.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $143.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.77% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.89% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 57%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 53%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $138.03) to be 30%.

Tune in to  of \u201cMoneyline\u201d with Matt McCall for everything you need to know on the bill.Source: InvestorPlace\n\tMany American adults are getting $1,200. Businesses \u2014 even large businesses \u2014 are receiving government support. So what\u2019s next? Are we really headed into a new bull market?Well, Matt McCall is excited about the stimulus package, and he\u2019s also excited about last week\u2019s three-day rally. But he\u2019s not ready to call it a bull market. Instead, he thinks we are looking at a bear market rally. As scary as \u201cbear market\u201d sounds, don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s still confident we are going to see a U-shaped recovery when coronavirus fears start to subside.There\u2019s something even scarier than the phrase \u201cbear market,\u201d though. Media organizations. Investors are facing unprecedented levels of panic over a global pandemic. Headlines focus on rising death tolls,  and financial losses. No one is talking about the positives, about those who have recovered from Covid-19 or promising treatments.So, turn off the news. Trust people like McCall with your money, and don\u2019t stress about it day to day. And remember to take a walk outside and get a breath of fresh air.

In just a few weeks, the market is set to experience a \u201chalvening\u201d \u2014 a day when the amount  is halved.Historically, the price of bitcoin has exploded after these halvening days, and the rallies have lasted for 12 to 18 months. But don\u2019t forget that bitcoin is a high-risk, high-reward investment. If you are risk averse, cryptocurrencies simply aren\u2019t an investment for you.Keeping your cool can be hard when you notice losses, but Matt McCall has a piece of important advice. Treat your bitcoin \u2014 or other investments \u2014 like a venture capitalist. You put the money in and watch it growth, and some volatility is inevitable.Need another example? Treat your long-term portfolio like you treat your house. Chances are you don\u2019t obsess over your home\u2019s price on a day-to-day basis. That\u2019s exactly how you should be treating your portfolio of stocks and other investments.What else is McCall watching besides bitcoin?

After all, \u00a0has caused the  to drop more than 20% year to date. It\u2019s tough for individual stocks to rise when the market is plunging.But, that\u2019s not the case.If you\u2019re looking for hot stocks for 2020, the best place to start is by looking at the top performing S&P 500 stocks so far this year. Perhaps somewhat shockingly, there are a lot of stocks on that list that are actually up year to date. Even more shockingly, the top five stocks on that list are all up more than 12%.Indeed, while the S&P 500 is down more than 20% year-to-date, the five hottest stocks in the index this year have averaged a year-to-date gain of almost 20%.With that in mind, if you\u2019re looking for hot stocks for 2020, consider these five top-performing stocks based on year-to-date gains:CTXS)\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\">At the top of this list of hot stocks for 2020, we have application virtualization software provider Citrix Systems, which has seen its shares rise a S&P 500 best 27% year-to-date.For perspective, the S&P 500 is down more than 20% year-to-date, and CTXS stock hasn\u2019t risen 27% or more in a year since 2010.In other words, this is truly a once-in-a-decade rally in Citrix stock. What\u2019s powering it?Increased demand for Citrix\u2019s application virtualization software solutions in a world where everyone is working from home. Long story short, it increasingly appears that employees all across the globe will be working from home for\u00a0at least\u00a0the next three to four weeks \u2026 and probably longer. Citrix\u2019s vitualization solutions enable these employees to work from home more efficiently. As such, the company is looking at supercharged demand over the next month or so.That makes sense. But does this red hot stock have more upside left? Or is all the good stuff priced in already?I think there\u2019s more upside left. The virtualization trend won\u2019t go away when the virus goes away. Instead, over the next three to four weeks, employees and employers alike will realize the benefits of virtualization solutions, meaning Citrix will turn this near-term demand boost into longer-running tailwinds. As the company\u2019s products are gradually more widely adopted, CTXS stock will maintain upward momentum.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\tThere are two big reasons why biotech giant Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is having its best year since 2015, despite broader financial market turbulence.First, the company is one of the leaders in the race to come up with a potential coronavirus treatment. Given how widespread this virus has become \u2014 and the significant damage it has inflicted on the global economy \u2014 a successful treatment should see huge commercial success.Second, the company\u2019s top-selling drug for macular degeneration \u2014 Beovu \u2014 is well positioned to meaningfully outperform over the next few quarters, because competitor\u00a0\u00a0(NYSE:) was recently hit with a significant safety setback at the hands of the American Society of Retina Specialists.But, up 22% year-to-date in a down market, is REGN stock fully priced for these two catalysts?I think so. Shares seem fully valued here, and the coronavirus upside is highly speculative and, therefore, very risky. I have my doubts about REGN stock sustaining its year-to-date strength over the next few months.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\tMuch like Regeneron, biotech peer Gilead has had a strong showing thus far in 2020 thanks to hope that the company can come up with a coronavirus treatment.Specifically, Gilead has been experimenting with an antiviral medicine called remdesivir for the past few years. When the coronavirus first emerged, Gilead naturally thought that remdesivir could help combat the virus. Early data suggests that is the case, and many experts around the globe have sounded an optimistic tone that remdesivir will indeed work at scale to treat coronavirus symptoms.On the back of that optimism, GILD stock has risen 16% year-to-date. But \u2026 nothing is confirmed yet.Confirmation will arrive over the next few weeks, when the company receives more robust trial data on how remdesivir is faring in combating the coronavirus. That data will make or break this stock. If the data is positive, Gilead stock will spike. If it\u2019s negative, shares will tumble.So, tread carefully with Gilead stock.Source: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\tShares of streaming service giant Netflix are up 13% year-to-date in a bad market for one very simple reason: with consumers stuck at home, one of their best options for entertainment is Netflix.In the first two and a half weeks of March, streaming viewership in the U.S. through connected TV sets , while viewership through streaming sticks like  (NASDAQ:) rose 16%. So, everyone in America is watching more streaming TV amid the lock-down. Perhaps more importantly, though, Netflix accounted for 37% of viewing hours, making it the No. 1 streaming service in America during the first two weeks of March \u2026 by a long shot.In other words, everyone is watching more Netflix, because they are stuck inside, and because Netflix makes the best content.It\u2019s unlikely this is just happening in the U.S. Consumers across Europe are probably doing the exact same thing: watching more Netflix.From this perspective, the coronavirus is actually a good thing for Netflix. And it provides more than a near-term boost. Consumers will sign-up for Netflix during the quarantine, fall in love with the content, and become long-term subscribers.Thus, I see NFLX stock as both a near- and long-term winner. Current strength in the stock should persist, and lead into long-term strength.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\tLast, but not least, on this list of hot stocks for 2020, is cleaning supplies maker Clorox.The bull thesis here is pretty straightforward. U.S. consumers are panic buying everything. The things they are panic buying the most are the things that Clorox sells \u2014 hand sanitizers, disinfectant wipes and other household cleaning products. Thus, Clorox has likely seen a huge spike in sales in March, the likes of which is reflected in CLX stock\u2019s 13% year-to-date rally.Can the rally keep going?I\u2019m not convinced. I do believe that, even if the coronavirus pandemic blows over by summer, consumer demand for cleaning products like hand sanitizers and disinfectant wipes will remain robust, as consumers continue to exercise caution in their day-to-day lives well after the outbreak passes. But, I also believe that most of that upside is fully priced into shares, with the stock trading at all-time-high valuation levels.Consequently, I don\u2019t see much more upside potential in CLX stock from its currently elevated levels.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

For instance, in early March in Italy, Netflix app downloads for iPhone and Android were up 57%, with Spain seeing a 34% increase.Netflix has been one of the best tech stocks of the bear market as investors anticipate a subscription spike thanks to the coronavirus - with some of those viewers sticking around after the pandemic has passed. NFLX shares have recorded a nearly 12% gain in 2020, while the S&P 500 has declined by 23%. SunTrust analysts, for instance, estimate that paid subscriber additions will total 9.5 million in Q1, which is much better than the consensus expectation for 7.5 million.Market value: $1.2 trillionMicrosoft (, $153.83) has several lines of business that could see an uptick as a result of self-isolation and people working from home.For one, Microsoft has an opportunity to take advantage of the increasing number of employees who are being asked to work from home. This is the perfect time to push adoption of Teams, the company's group chat and collaboration software. With adoption comes more subscriptions of Microsoft 365 - the company's rebrand of Office 365 rolling out later in April. Indeed, the company is really pressing the point, offering a six-month free trial of Teams that includes some of its more impressive paid features.Also, while Xbox One may have lost the current generation console war to rival Sony's () PlayStation 4, the company's Xbox Live subscription gaming network is seen as the online leader. Gamers use it not only for multiplayer competition, but for social interaction. Xbox Live has seen even heavier use than usual. At $9.99 per month for a Gold subscription, Microsoft could see a gaming division revenue uptick.Meanwhile, while the economy likely will hamper IT spending on Microsoft's products, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss says MSFT is among tech stocks that are still in an enviable position. \"While our (first quarter) AlphaWise CIO Survey indicates slower IT budget growth and potential for negative revisions, software is still an IT budget share gainer and Microsoft is exposed to many near-term remote work priorities,\" Weiss writes. \"Microsoft remains a top vendor for the key secular trends in tech.\"Market value: $13.5 billionSlack Technologies (, $24.26) is among other tech stocks banking on the increasingly popular group collaboration software category. It's also the primary competitor to Microsoft's Teams.Keeping teams organized and in communication is a critical tool - one that was projected to grow into an $18.3 billion market by 2026. Slack, while perhaps the first-to-mind name in the space, has been losing share to Teams, which has the advantage of being included with Microsoft's ubiquitous bundle.The sudden move by many companies to have employees work from home is a big opening for Slack. It has name recognition, companies desperate for a way to keep all those newly remote employees on track, and a free version available. So far, so good.William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri reiterated his Outperform rating (equivalent of Buy) on WORK shares after the company announced an acceleration in paid subscriber additions since mid-March that would indicate it's on its way to breaking its previous quarterly record for adds. \"This is a change from what we heard during the last  (which took place on March 12) when much of the increased activity was taking place in the free tier and was largely correlated with the countries at the center of the outbreak (Italy, Japan, South Korea),\" he writes.Slack also is throwing the kitchen sink at adoption, working one phone integration with RingCentral, Zoom ... and even Microsoft Teams. If the company can prove its worth, many of the firms that have started to sign up might continue using Slack's software once the world returns to \"normal.\"Market value: $35.8 billionZoom Video Communications (, $128.20) is a leading provider of enterprise-strength video conferencing solutions. Zoom's offerings include not just video conferencing for large groups, but accompanying chat, collaboration, reporting and recording features.That's perfect for the current coronavirus environment, in which remote employees need to be kept in the loop and productive, and in which many meetings simply need face-to-face contact.That's why CEO Eric Yuan was recently able to claim that usage \"has ballooned overnight,\" from 10 million daily users at the end of 2019 to more than 200 million by March.ZM stock isn't an easy play right now, however. The company is up 88% year-to-date, sure, but it's also on a significant decline after various reports revealing . For what it's worth, Yuan released an apology and has frozen product development for 30 days to work on the software's various bugs; indeed, the company already has fixed its macOS installer.If the company is able to quickly put out its technical fires - and the resulting PR fire - it might be positioned to enjoy a shift to video conferencing that lasts far longer than the coronavirus pandemic.\"We think Zoom's exceptionally easy to use meetings product has both enabled and benefited from a long-term secular shift towards working from home,\" writes Needham analyst Richard Valera, who rates shares at Buy.Market value: $165.6 billionCisco Systems (, $39.06) is another beneficiary of the push to have employees work from home. Its Webex platform is a popular enterprise option, and it has seen a big spike in usage as the coronavirus crisis has developed. Besides subscriptions for the application, Cisco also sells Webex devices, including connected whiteboards and video conferencing hardware.Dan Eye, head of asset allocation and equity research at Roof Advisory Group, a division of Fort Pitt Capital Group, makes the case for Cisco seeing coronavirus upside:\"The measures being taken to control the outbreak of the coronavirus have forced many professionals, students and educators to work remotely,\" he says. \"According to company reports, networking giant Cisco Systems is experiencing a massive spike in the usage of its Webex video conferencing platform. Estimates indicate that Webex traffic in some Asian countries has increased by 700% or more.\"While the Webex platform does not represent a large portion of Cisco's revenue stream, it should incrementally support its initiative of transitioning away from hardware with a greater emphasis on software solutions and recurring revenue streams.\"The analyst community largely agrees with Eye. Eleven analysts have sounded off on the tech stock over the past month, with eight issuing Buy ratings versus just three Holds.Market value: $949.1 billionAmazon.com (, $1,906.59) is finding itself in the spotlight during the coronavirus crisis. That can have negative aspects -- such as profiteers using the platform to gouge panicked consumers on products like hand sanitizer and protective masks.But in an environment when people are hunkering down and reluctant to venture into stores, Amazon's online shopping provides a valuable service. In fact, the demand by shoppers has been so massive, that Amazon announced it is trying to . That increased volume is going to result in higher revenue for the e-commerce division during the quarter, and might win Amazon some new customers.Amazon's various devices are also proving popular during the coronavirus outbreak, and could see boosted adoption if the current situation is extended. For example, Kindle re-readers and e-books are a way to spend time. Echo smart speakers can be programmed to turn on lights and trigger other hands-free actions -- ideal for reducing risk of contamination. And Ring video doorbells make it possible to interact with visitors at the front door without having to risk a personal, face-to-face encounter.AMZN, which gets lumped in with consumer stocks and tech stocks, has certainly traded like the former this year, up 3% in 2020 versus steep losses for the broader markets.Market value: $3.1 billionWith restaurants now shutting down their dining rooms in the U.S., and people increasingly reluctant to go to grocery stores, food delivery is poised to become a critical part of life under coronavirus in the U.S. That puts GrubHub (, $34.27) in an excellent position to grow its market share.\"We believe the impact from Covid-19 will provide a net tailwind,\" Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein recently wrote about GRUB shares, which he upgraded from Underperform (equivalent of Sell) to Perform (Hold).On March 10, GrubHub announced it would introduce  to the U.S. market. Already popular in urban centers (it has roughly two-thirds of the delivery market in NYC), the service is seen as a lifeline for residents who are tired of eating stockpiled beans and rice, while providing much-needed revenue for struggling restaurants.Competitors including Uber Technologies' () Uber Eats service should also see a burst in food orders during the pandemic. The risk in Uber's case is that uptick in business is more than offset by a drop in ride sharing.Market value: $11.4 billionThe push to keep distance between people has extended to the doctor's office. In-person visits put the patient at risk of potential coronavirus exposure in the waiting room. Medical staff are also at risk, and we can't afford to have them sidelined.So-called virtual care or \"telehealth\" can be the answer. Using this remote technology in place of an in-person visit to the doctor's office was already on the rise. It can cut the cost of a visit to the doctor by half, and it has become popular in rural regions where patients may live miles away from their doctor.Nina Deka, senior research analyst at ROBO Global, says virtual care providers including Teladoc Health (, $156.21) have \"laid the groundwork to enable remote doctor visits.\"\"This means when people aren't feeling well, they can video conference with a physician from their home, thus minimizing further spread of infectious disease to other patients or healthcare workers in an already crowded emergency room.\"Teladoc recently announced that \"the company is experiencing unprecedented daily visit volume in the United States as the novel coronavirus continues to spread globally.\" That amounted to 100,000 virtual visits for the week ending March 13, a 50% spike over regular volume.TDOC shares have jumped 87% in 2020, putting it among the best tech stocks on the market this year. Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill recently lowered his price target on Teladoc from $194 per share to $179, but he maintained his Buy hold, writing that a recent survey indicated \"sustained higher levels\" of telehealth utilization even after the coronavirus outbreak has subsided.Market value: $18.1 billionTwitter (, $23.09), as a platform, has always shown signs of excellence during times of crisis, when getting information to people in real time is critical. It's also a popular platform for social interaction.The coronavirus pandemic is tailor-made for Twitter. People are looking for information on a life-or-death situation that can change by the minute. They're looking for ways to vent about actions that have been taken -- or inaction. And they're bored and looking for ways to interact with other humans, without having to risk a face-to-face conversation. This heavy use is why Twitter is one of the social media platforms the World Health Organization is most active on, making it a key outlet for coronavirus updates and advice.Twitter user engagement almost certainly will be up this quarter, and it seems likely the social media platform is going to gain users as well. That said, so far, TWTR shares have been a disappointment among tech stocks, underperforming the S&P 500 40% to 27% since the bull-market peak.But Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry thinks TWTR has fallen too far, and that opportunity is brewing here.\"We believe as new/returning users see the value of the platform, many will stay as we've previously seen in more localized crises, creating future inventory that Twitter will be able to better monetize as the company invests in its ad technology through the crisis,\" he writes, upgrading the stock from Neutral to Buy.Market value: $17.3 billionCitrix Systems (, $141.33) is an American software company known for its desktop virtualization software. Citrix Workspace is especially popular in enterprise settings. Centralized servers store all the actual data, while users have their complete virtual desktop -- including applications and access to that data (although it is not stored locally). They can run Workspace on virtually any operating system and any device.This company's technology was already valued for data security, reduced IT costs, employee flexibility and business continuity.In a crisis like the coronavirus pandemic, customers who have deployed Citrix Workspace are able to continue operating as before, with employees working from home as easily as they could work from their desk in the office.Citrix might not see much additional uptake during the current crisis, as IT departments might be reluctant to undertake any new deployment projects. However, in the post-coronavirus environment, expect companies to take measures to ensure continuity going forward. And that could mean CTXS selling a lot more licenses.Analysts are certainly enthused, issuing six Buy ratings versus just two Holds over the past month.Market value: $7.5 billionWorkers who are suddenly forced to work from home are often faced with a technical challenge: how to exchange large files when their email client has size restrictions. Digital images, presentations, applications and especially anything with video in it can result in massive files that simply can't be emailed.So how do you get them to team members?Dropbox (, $17.96) has become the go-to in these situations. Using Dropbox, users can easily upload massive files for secure online storage, then invite others to download them. The free tier offers basic capabilities, but with paid subscriptions, users get more features including up to 2TB of storage, and automatic syncing of files between a device and the cloud during editing. In addition, Dropbox has been busy in recent years, adding integration with popular remote collaboration and work applications such as Zoom and Slack.Look for Dropbox to see increased usage of its free tier during this period of large-scale working from home. This mass \"trial\" might make DBX one of the best tech stocks to benefit from this shift, as it could pay off with a round of paid subscriptions to Dropbox once the crisis is over. That's likely why investors have only allowed DBX shares to drop by 2% so far during this bear market.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["\nThere are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Citrix Systems Inc, but the average is just that \u2014 a mathematical average.

But with Elliott Management and Silver Lake each getting a seat on the board and with Twitter needing to meet high thresholds, Dorsey's days appear to be numbered.Earlier this week, the microblogging website operator and the activist investor who is coming for Dorsey . Dorsey was given a chance to prove he's up to the task of running Twitter. It won't be easy. It means increasing daily users by 20%, quickening the pace of revenue growth, and gaining a bigger share of advertisers' budgets. Achieving those goals on a good day would be tough for Dorsey, but in the wake of coronavirus, it may prove impossible.\u00a0Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Image source: Twitter.If the world slips into a recession, advertising dollars may be cut, hurting Twitter's ability to boost revenue growth. Twitter could also lose ad dollars from canceled events like concerts, festivals, or sporting events. The cancellation of events such as March Madness or Coachella could hurt engagement and advertising revenue.\u00a0Even without the coronavirus, Elliott's targets may prove out of reach. Sure, more people should flock to Twitter during the run-up to the 2020 presidential election and the Summer Olympics, but it has already shut itself out of a big portion of those advertising dollars. Taking a stand on fake news and false information, Twitter recently banned all political ads on its platform. Instead of trying to police it, Dorsey decided to block it altogether.\u00a0The move has resonated with users,\u00a0but not with investors.With $1.34 billion projected to be spent on digital ads during the 2020 election season,\u00a0Twitter is walking away from a sizable revenue opportunity. To make things worse with investors, Dorsey, who is\u00a0also the CEO of payment-company  , recently announced plans to split his time between Africa and the U.S. as he immerses himself in the world of digital payments. In order for Twitter to reach Elliott's target of 20% year-over-year growth in daily users, Twitter will have to do more than rely on public events to get users tweeting. It will have to expand into new areas in a much bigger way. That may mean making acquisitions in addition to providing new ways for people to engage with the platform.That could be tough since Twitter is buying back $2 billion in shares, its first share repurchase ever, under the agreement. Silver Lake is making a $1 billion investment in Twitter, with Twitter using that money to fund the share buyback. Twitter will also have to draw from its own cash reserves, which means less money that can go to product innovation or acquisitions.\u00a0Innovating is something the  has been slow to do over the years. When Dorsey returned to the helm five years ago, investors expected Twitter to grow to   proportions. But it hasn't been able to take off in the same way as its rival, largely because of a lack of product innovation. Fleets, a new feature that allows users to post disappearing tweets, is a perfect example: It takes a page from 's  SnapChat Stories, but it took .\u00a0Twitter has brand name recognition but it doesn't have the numbers. Facebook's 2.5 billion users\u00a0dwarf Twitter's 152 million. It's a negligible player in the advertising market, bringing in under $3 billion in 2019 compared to Facebook's more than $67 billion.\u00a0Dorsey is credited with lifting the share price since\u00a0his return, but activist investors like Elliott want to see faster growth on the revenue front and more users instead. For all of 2019, Twitter grew revenue 14%. Not taking into account the coronavirus, Wall Street expects revenue to increase 15% in 2020, which isn't in the realm of Elliot's expectations.\u00a0That may be on purpose. If Elliott were to push for Dorsey's firing now, the backlash from employees would be fierce. They fully support their CEO and his out-of-the-box ways of running the social media platform. By setting unobtainable goals, Elliott can take comfort in knowing Dorsey will fail, and Elliott will be justified in showing him the door. It wouldn't be without precedent.  ,  , and Athenahealth CEOs all lost their jobs after Elliott won seats on their boards.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Yet at first sight, there's nothing to be excited about. Revenue increased to $810 million, up 1% year over year. And the near-term outlook doesn't look much brighter, since the midpoint of 2020 revenue guidance of $3.115 billion corresponds to 3.5% year-over-year growth.\u00a0Also, management expects  (adjusted) operating margin to decrease from 30% in 2019 to a range of 28% to 29%.For a tech company that is expanding its business into the growing  market, this performance looks weak. But in the long term, Citrix should profit from this transition.Citrix's legacy business consists of selling hardware and software that allows users to remotely access a virtual computer desktop hosted in a data center. Compared to a classic Windows 10 workstation, this solution offers the advantage of keeping the same desktop environment from any device, anywhere. Also, computer administrators benefit from the more efficient central management of employees' working environments.But with the emerging cloud-computing technology, enterprises have been moving a part of their on-premise applications and infrastructure to the cloud, which makes Citrix's legacy portfolio less relevant. In response, Citrix integrated its solutions with the ecosystems of public cloud providers such as 's\u00a0Azure and 's Google Cloud. As a result, Citrix Workspace, the company's new platform, has become an attractive solution for mobile users working in a hybrid multi-cloud environment.Image source: Getty Images.This transformation involves short-term headwinds, though. With its legacy offerings, Citrix received up-front payments for selling perpetual licenses and multi-year maintenance. But with the shift to cloud-based solutions, Citrix switched to a subscription model. Thus, the company receives smaller annual recurring fees instead of large upfront payments, which negatively impacts its revenue and free cash flow in the short term.As an illustration,\u00a0fourth-quarter revenue from the product and license division and the support and services division dropped to $616 million, down 21% and 5% year over year, respectively. In contrast, revenue from the subscription division increased to $194 million, up 49% year over year.\u00a0As a result, revenue from the subscription segment increased to 24% of the company's total revenue during the last quarter,\u00a0from 16.2% a year ago. And management expects revenue from subscriptions to represent 65% to 75% of the company's total revenue by 2024.\u00a0In the medium term, the headwinds resulting from this transition should wane, and revenue growth should accelerate. In fact, total deferred and unbilled revenue, an early indicator of revenue, jumped 15% year over year.Management forecasts revenue growth to progressively increase to a range of 8% to 10% by 2024 and exceed 10% over the long term. Also, it expects non-GAAP operating margin to reach at least 34%.However, even if you assume a flawless execution over the next several years, the company's valuation doesn't look cheap.5.2\u00a0\u00a036.5Data sources: Citrix Systems and Yahoo! FinanceThe difference between the company's GAAP and non-GAAP results is mostly due to share-based compensation (SBC) that management excludes from its calculation of non-GAAP earnings. SBC isn't a cash expense but it still represents a real cost to shareholders in terms of .\u00a0Thus, investors should value this  based on its GAAP results. And since Citrix's forward GAAP P/E ratio of 36.5 doesn't provide any , even when taking into account the forecasted revenue growth acceleration over the next several years, prudent investors should stay on the sidelines.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company just reported its annual fiscal earnings ending Jan. 31. It shows that VMware makes huge margins in its cloud software subscription, licensing and serving business.\tHowever, the company, 80.7% owned by  (NYSE:), which also controls 97.5% of its voting power, is facing competitive issues.Barron\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s  an interesting report on VMware\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s competition from a technology called Kubernetes.The gist of the article is that more companies are migrating their data and operations to the cloud faster than ever. This is bad news for much of VMWare\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s legacy software, other than its recent acquisition of Pivotal, a cloud company.VMware stock took a hit on Friday, Feb. 28, since the \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009ccompany\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s uncertain commentary over its core on-premise server software business may have spooked investors the most.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009dIn other words, the shift to the cloud is moving faster and VMware may be losing business. At least that is what the market is worried about.The company gave a forecast for its revenue and cash flow, which although below analysts\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 expectations, still is extremely profitable.  about the market\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s disappointment with the numbers and VMware\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s apparent shortfall.For example, the company reported Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 versus the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.17, according to FactSet.However, not everything was so bad. VMware posted revenue of $3.07 billion for the same quarter, up 11% year over year. But this was above the $2.95 billion average analyst estimate.But let\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s keep things in perspective. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $1.02 billion. This is a huge margin compared to its revenue. Free cash flow represented one-third of its quarterly revenue. That is huge.Moreover, free cash flow margins for the year ending Jan. 31 was even higher. VMware generated $3.59 billion in free cash flow. This represents a margin of 35.8% on its annual revenue of $10.81 billion.Very few businesses can convert this much of its revenue into free cash flow. Moreover, the forward outlook is not all that bad.The truth is VMware is going to be generating good profits for a good while, even if the cloud migration proceeds faster than its legacy revenue fades.For example, the company projected that its coming fiscal year should result in $3.76 billion in free cash flow. That still represents a margin of 31% on its expected revenue of $12.05 billion this year. And that revenue will be up at least 11%, according to the company.How can the company be so sure about its outlook? One reason is the huge amount of \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cunearned\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d revenue it has in its backlog.For example, VMware reported that it had $9.268 billion in unearned revenue. Companies used to call this \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cdeferred\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 revenue. In addition, it has $4.05 billion in long-term unearned revenue.This $13.3 billion in total unearned revenue represents contracts that its clients have signed but the revenue has not yet been earned or billed. In effect, it is a hidden asset.Yes, lots of software companies have these assets. Sometimes companies can switch out of these contracts. But VMware\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s purchases of Pivotal and , which both operate in the cloud migration space, will help the company keep these clients. that Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated his \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cbuy\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d rating for VMware stock on Friday, Feb. 28. This implication was that this was a sort of tepid promotion of VMware stock. to $165 from $190 after the earnings. Right now VMware stock is at $120.52, so this represents upside of just 37%, instead of 58%. But the point is the analyst thinks the stock is worth a good deal less now.By the way, if they are correct, this is not good news for Dell stock, since it represents a huge portion of its total value. Seeking Alpha analyst  in December about VMWare as part of its sum-of-the-parts valuation.Right now VMware stock trades with an implied free cash flow yield of 7.5%. That is derived by taking the expected $3.76 billion in free cash flow this year divided by its $50 billion market value today.Other tech stocks like  (NYSE:) are much more expensive. Its FCF yield is 1.6%. Another competitor \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NYSE:) has a more expensive 6.4% FCF yield on a last 12 months (LTM) basis.In addition,  (NASDAQ:) has a 5.7% FCF yield. In fact, another competitor N\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:) has a negative FCF yield.But larger peers are much cheaper on this basis.  (NASDAQ:) is cheaper than VMware with its 8.7% FCF yield.  (NYSE:) has a 10.8% FCF yield.So the bottom line is that VMware stock is cheap, but not as much as some of its peers. Given analysts\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 disappointment with the stock with its latest results, it is possible WMware stock might fall further.However, investors should keep in mind that this is still a very profitable $50 billion market value company. It produces a large amount of free cash flow each year. Moreover, it has a large inventory of unearned revenue. It is not going to fade away, despite what some authors and analysts might lead you to believe.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

My name is Erica, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Citrix Systems Fourth Quarter . All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]Thank you. I would now like to introduce, Traci Tsuchiguchi. You may begin your conference. -- Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 . Participating on the call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Arlen Shenkman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Please note that we have posted our fourth quarter earnings letter to our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the US securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's earnings letter and in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on our Investor Relations website. Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of our earnings letter found on the Investor Relations page of our website.Now I'd like to turn it over to David, our President and Chief Executive Officer for some introductory remarks. -- Thanks, Traci, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I hope everybody has had a chance to review the earnings letter that we posted a little while ago to our Investor Relations site. Similar to last quarter, let me provide just a quick summary here and then we'll jump right into Q&A, I would say, overall really happy with our performance for the fourth quarter.It's highlighted by 41% year-over-year growth in subscription ARR, 49% growth in SaaS ARR, and a 15% increase in deferred and unbilled revenue. I would say our model transition continues to progress really well across both Workspace and Networking businesses coming ahead of the accelerated plan that we outlined just last year.In the quarter, 69% of total product bookings came via subscription and this is up from just 51% a year ago. In fact, in this quarter, we signed a couple of the largest Networking contracts in our history and we signed those as multi-year subscriptions, really reflecting the customer confidence, our strategy roadmap, and our ability to execute on where that market is going.Also our new Workspace with intelligence platform is made generally available in December. Personally, I think, this is the most significant feature functionality release that we brought to market since the introduction of the Workspace. Good platform and we'll be driving and scaling over the coming years. So all in, really good quarter, solid progress against our multi-year goals.So with that let me open it up for questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. -- Hey, thanks guys for taking my question. And congrats on a great end of the year. Just want to actually focusing in on the Networking business. Obviously, David, you called out some pretty significant transactions there as well as a pretty big shift to the pooled-capacity licensing. Wondering if you could just walk us through that. And Arlen wondering if you could help us just think through sort of the net impact of that because obviously it was a big step-up in terms of the subscription bookings this quarter? -- Sure, Phil. Yeah, let me take the first part. So from a strategy standpoint, I think as everyone knows, what we've been trying to do is really leverage the fact that we're a software company. And we can deploy our networking services across just a myriad of different form factors, as appliance and software, virtual appliance as a service and a container etc. And we just have a lot of flexibility to do that and we've got a unique control plane that I mean we call it ADM that effectively allows customers to manage across all of those different deployment models. And that ties really nicely with the hybrid multi-cloud nature of most customer's infrastructure. With the transition that's going on in terms of application architectures that's just really, really nice bridge for a lot of customers. So we're pushing that as our primary model and that is what's driving pooled-capacity. It's just a strategic thing, but it's also a longer-term business model shift.As you saw, we had a really big pop in terms of the overall mix in the quarter going up to 63% from '18. That was influenced, as I mentioned, a minute ago by a couple of really large transactions. I wouldn't expect that to be the run rate. That percentage will come back down, but generally it continues to be and up into the right motion. -- Yeah, I mean, you know what I would add to that Phil, as David said, I mean, look if you look at the full year, you know for the full year for the networking business, we basically ended at 44% mix and that's compared to 13% come out of '18. I don't think we're going to hold that. But I think we do see our customers buying into our strategy, they do like our pooled-licensing arrangement. And I think honestly what I tell you is, I think, you'll see this start to show itself in ARR and that's probably the best place to focus as we go through this. -- Got it. Thanks guys. -- Thanks, Phil.Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. -- Great, thank you so much. David, I have a couple of questions, if you don't mind. I guess in no particular order, you guys signed I think it was a million Citrix Cloud seats in the quarter, if I'm reading your press release correctly, which is a pretty big uptick. I'm just wondering if you could walk people through what's driving that and there's always a lot of debate in the market, how much of this is being driven from Windows 7 End of Life? And then I've got two quick follow-ups, if you don't mind. Thank you. -- Sure, you're right. As far as paid subscriber count we ended Q4 with 7.1 million. That's up more than 60% year-over-year from just over 4 million. What's really driving that is just a continuation of the overall strategy that we've been talking about now for a couple of years. From a current customer standpoint, migrating to Citrix Cloud does a few things.One, it really simplifies their ability to maintain their infrastructure to have lots of tools and services to optimize that and drive that forward, and allow us to do the heavy lifting that we can scale across just really all of our customers. And so it's a huge benefit on just the pure like-for-like, but probably much more importantly, though is, it unlocks a lot of new capabilities that are really only available as a service, and whether that is something as simple as endpoint management and a unified basis across all of their infrastructure to some of our net new capabilities like Workspace with Intelligence, which will only be available as a service. So it's a combination of really optimizing what they have today for those set of customers, but it provides that foundation for them to grow going forward.And so we're just, I think we're doing a better and better job every quarter of articulating the value. Our sales teams are having conversations higher up in the -- in the executive ranks. And we're talking about things that are, I would describe it as really information type initiatives, much more so than a traditional IT delivery initiatives. So it's a combination of all of those different factors. -- Okay, great. And then the two quick follow-ups would be, if you could just remind us, obviously you've been going through the subscription transition. And as a result of that there is a headwind to revenue growth. Could you remind us on based on your current expectations about mix, whether you want to take the midpoint or not. What type of headwind to revenue growth is that for 2020? And then the other question would be just subscription ARR growth for 2020. I mean obviously I heard your comments about being up 41% in Q4. Any commentary on the type of growth, people might be able to expect out of that subscription ARR for this year? Thank you. -- Sure. Heather, we're not going to guide from a subscription ARR standpoint at least in 2020. And that's simply a function of -- it's a relatively new metric we want to make sure that it is one that we can have forecasting with really, really good accuracy. But more importantly, I would take a step back, and you look at it just over the last few quarters. That's where all of this business model transition is starting to unwind. I think, if I remember correctly, it was 33% growth in Q2, 40% in Q3, 41% in Q4. So we're actually seeing an acceleration of that as the numbers get bigger. And that's just a reflection of both net new, which is still the majority, as well as migrating more of the installed base going forward. Yeah and I'm sorry, could you repeat the first half of the --? -- Yeah, just the last question was the headwind to 2020 revenue growth from the transition, if you kind of take the midpoint of your expectations on where you will be subscription mix, how should we people be thinking about the headwind that you're experiencing to top line this year? -- Yeah, I mean, we didn't break it out in terms of guidance for 2020, but back when we started this transition, we were posting the headwind and it was in that 700 basis point, 800 basis point range. We stopped doing that just because we've got ARR out there and I think everybody is well aware of the transition metrics, but it was 7 percentage points or 8 percentage points the last time we reported it. -- Okay, great. Thank you. -- Yeah.Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. -- Thank you. Maybe I'll start with Arlen. In the earnings letter, you gave the 2020 guidance, but I didn't see a reiteration of the $7 to $8 per share in free cash flow. So maybe a two-parter for you, still feel comfortable with that. And then secondly, I know that as the installed base converts to ratable, there is the potential for billing or invoicing durations to compress a little bit, which would take a little bit of zip out of free cash flow. Have you seen any of that kind of duration compression over the last couple of months? Thank you. -- Yeah. So Karl, I start with yeah, look we remain comfortable with the $7 to $8 that's obviously included in our guidance in terms of what we delivered at Investor Day, and there is no change in that. And as you point out rightfully, obviously there are some complexities in terms of how the duration affects the cash to get in the door, when they get in the door, hence the range as well as how we think about the business.In terms of your question about compression, I haven't really seen compression. I think anything if you look at the length is a bit longer actually in terms of duration. We had 1.7 years. Obviously, we are generally entering into 36-month contracts. So we'd expect that duration to continue, but obviously in terms of how we think about cash flow, I mean, the biggest impact for us is the mix over the course of the year and how that results itself or reflects itself in the business. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, David. -- Yeah, Karl, I think you're not asking about the duration on the contract, which has been going out, I think it's more about prepayment and that... -- That's right. -- That absolutely has been a headwind because a year or two ago when we talked about the majority of our customers, not only we're buying perpetual license, but we're also buying multi-years of maintenance and paying for that upfront. As we've been unwinding that model to get to a much more pure, just a pure run rate, that's been a tremendous headwind to cash flow. And that's pretty much run its course. I mean we haven't broken it out in a couple of quarters, but it is -- it's a very low percentage now versus where it was. So I think that headwind is pretty much gone at this point. -- Okay, great. And then maybe my second question for you, David is just, this earnings call is really in the earnings letter and in your words really putting a little bit more focus on the 4Q launch of these intelligence analytics features you described is the most significant functionality at Workspace in your history. So I wouldn't mind given that pressing a little bit. So I know that they just went GA, probably a little over a month ago but David, any early anecdotes or numbers you can share that for instance when installed base contracts are up for renewal in December or so far in January, those that have acquired the new features, you tend to see revenue accretion of X. Anything interesting you can share that would kind of support the view that this could be a needle mover for Citrix? -- Yeah, Karl, I would say, at a high level it's different than the old days of perpetual license when a new release was a joint event. This is much more about evolving the platform. And so the way we've positioned this with customers really over the last year and we've been pretty, pretty transparent about this, is that, this is the direction that the Workspace is really moving. It's moving toward a platform approach that allows us to really provide a solution that's applicable to users of all type, whether those users have very simple needs like Office 365 and a couple of SaaS applications or whether that is the group of users that need all the power of virtualization VDI, etc.And so the platform allows us to really cover all of those on a wall-to-wall basis and then provide that level of segmentation from an end-user standpoint, the right tool to the right solution, but also a platform that we can continue to drive upsell opportunities, so that we can have an ongoing customer conversation about new things that we're bringing to the market. For example, security analytics, performance analytics and others that we haven't announced at this point in time. And so the big shift is just how we engage and think about the Workspace, and it's going to be moving much more from a organizing IT focus where I think we were over the course of the last couple of years to much more about modernizing applications, guiding and helping predict work.And so that's a big shift and that's an exciting conversation that we're having now with not just CIOs, but I mean more and more frequently people that carry titles like Chief Digital Transformation Officer, Chief Marketing Officer and others. So we're excited about it, but I think it's going to be just a gradual thing that we continue to ramp throughout the year. -- Got it, OK. Thank you, both.Your next question is from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. -- Thank you and congratulations on the quarter. Nice clean results. I got a couple of questions for you, but I'll keep it simple. Can you give us an update on where you are on the process of no longer selling the Citrix Burst Workspace licenses and how do you think, if any had made an impact on Q4 license sales? Did it create a larger than normal license sales in the quarter and then I have a follow up? -- So, Mark, let me just grab that. Look, we talked at Investor Day about end licensing perpetual plus maintenance. We are in the process of working that through our system. You see no impact of that in the fourth quarter. We have not implemented that. You'll continue to hear us talk about through the course of the year, but we have not taken any action and there is no reflection of that in our current year-end results. -- And we know for bookings mix, there was already three quarter subscription in the Workspace. So the impact will be relatively muted on a go-forward basis. -- Okay. And then can you give us any sort of an update on where you are on the, on the, what was existing installed base of Citrix Workspace in terms of how much is moving or are you seeing any bigger opportunity. Any color on where that on the installed base starting to move up to subscription and cloud? -- Yeah, let me take that one. We're early on still. I'd say that number is right around less than 10% of the installed base. The installed base continues to move even because we are still selling perpetual licenses. So the installed base is growing, while we transition. The amount of transition has moved up pretty materially over the last couple of quarters, probably most importantly that we're still yielding the level of uplift that we talked about at our Financial Analyst Meeting, while the numbers get bigger. So I think the opportunity is pretty significant and we'll be doing much more of that throughout 2020. -- Excellent. Really appreciate it. Thanks. -- You bet.Your next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. -- Yeah, thanks. This is Parthiv on for Brent. In terms of the outlook, I think, the letter indicates that guidance for 2020 assumes a subscription bookings mix of 65% to 75%. And if I'm looking at this right, you were expecting up to 80% at the Analyst Day. So I guess the question is, are your assumptions in the business is changing at the margin here or are they still within the band that you had expected back at the Analyst Day? -- Yeah, I don't think anything has changed here. I mean if you see there is obviously some seasonality. We've talked about the first quarter being much closer to the 55% to 60% range. You see us for the full year looking at 65% to 75% and that's consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day. Obviously, over time, we will go beyond that 75%, but when we think about 2020, we think that's the right way to approach it. And it's very consistent with what we went over in terms of our roadmap and our plans for the business. -- Okay, got it. And then for the CSP business, I think, the last data point that we got was in the second quarter of '19. I think you talked about a $100 million run rate. Maybe any update on that end in terms of run rate or growth rates and maybe talk about the mix between on-prem CSP versus the cloud? -- Yeah, Parthiv, it's not something that we really break out much anymore. I think now that we're into the complete subscription transition all of these things are just included in the overall number. And it would just confuse people to try and break out individual piece parts. Overall though, CSP is a channel program that allows channel partners to leverage our infrastructure to create as a service offerings for their end customer. It has been a great business like you highlighted, continues to be so. And it is in nine figures and growing. I don't really know where those customers are in terms of on-prem or cloud infrastructure.Obviously, over the long term they have a lot more flexibility as they move to Citrix Cloud, but it just depends on the size of the partner. -- Okay, fair enough. That's helpful. Thank you.Your next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi. -- Hey, David. A product question for you. Just as it relates to Windows Virtual Desktops, I think Microsoft launched in Q4, how have you found that that offering from Microsoft being out there impacting your business. Is it creating awareness? Is it causing some confusion, helping the transition to subscription? Just curious what if any impact you're seeing at this point? -- Well, I think, WVD at a high level really opens up the awareness for virtualization as a platform, and we look at it as a platform or in our language you know resource zone where we can allow customers to run parts of their infrastructure along with like on-prem or in another cloud or public cloud, etc. So it's a resource zone from that respect.When it was first announced, it created some market confusion, and so between Citrix and Microsoft, we've been spending a lot of time educating our field. We just had our sales kickoff a week ago. We had Microsoft and Citrix on stage really talking to all of our partners and our sellers about what the real separation is, how to position and how we work together because this is really a story about better together with Microsoft. And we spend a lot of time highlighting everything we're doing from a joint customer standpoint, joint field standpoint, all the product integrations and we're going to continue to do that. So no change on that front. -- Great. And then Arlen for you just on -- I want to make sure I was clear on the networking piece, the subscription mix went up substantially there. Is that a trend that you think is sustainable as we move forward or was there some element with a flexible licensing in Q4 that drove customers to choose that offering, that may not be sustainable here in the first half of 2020? -- So I think what you'll continue to see is growth. I think the magnitude and I think the data point I'd try to utilize that 13% to 44% for the year, I think that magnitude is driven by some of the larger deals we did. So I'm very confident that we'll continue to see customers move in that direction. I believe we're very confident in the fact that you'll continue to see an increase. I just -- one, we're just not confident is that that magnitude in terms of the moving parts in the business, the number of customers who will be that consistent in terms of driving that. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Your next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. -- Hi, Mark O'Neil [Phonetic] for Keith Weiss. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe two quick ones on converting that existing maintenance base that we've been talking about. One, I guess just how big is that maintenance base in terms of like licenses that could be transitioned. And then two, yield it's still less than like 10% of the way through like at Analyst Day on October. I guess looking into the next few years when you continue focusing on transitioning that base maybe just like level set expectations, how, like how much should we be thinking about per year maybe is like 10% or is that too high or too low kind of some way to think about that would be helpful in modeling? -- Yeah, I mean, we're not going to guide to a specific percentage basis. We're obviously looking to build the right programs to go as fast as customers want to go, and we're not planning on any type of a forced migration, it's simply going to be put the right programs in front of them, give them the sense of value, and allow customers to adopt this. That part has been growing from a internally we call it trade up and transition, it's growing very rapidly right now, it is still the minority focus. So I want to be clear about that. We are still more focused on selling net new licenses to both new and existing customers and then trade up becomes a secondary motion.But in terms of the overall magnitude, I mean, just look at -- look at the P&L and you see the support in services line, the bulk of that is related to ongoing maintenance contracts although both hardware and software. So it's well over $1 billion opportunity there from an ongoing maintenance standpoint. And we just want to make sure that we're converting that at the uplift that we've been seeing up to this point and we're doing it methodically. So the customers really drive the value that they see in the solutions.We're also starting to incent channel partners on things like active use to make sure that not only are we migrating customers, but we're driving the right level of use and providing that platform, so that as we get onto Workspace with Intelligence and some of these new capabilities, we have that pathway to sell new things, new updates, new add-ons, new capabilities and so that's the overall motion we're driving right now. -- Great, thanks so much.Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. -- Hey guys, it's Mohit Gogia on for Raimo. Thanks for taking my question. I'll also offer my congrats on the quarter, on a solid quarter. Two questions. So one, David, I was wondering if you can drill into just the SSP business performance. So obviously we saw a nice rebound this quarter just based on the easier, much easier comps from last year. But looking into 2020 like should we expect the same volatility just based on the seasonality and the comps for next year as well or is there anything else we should be aware off? And then I have a question for Arlen. -- Sure. Sure, I mean, it's just at a high level, I mean SSP will continue to break it out for a while because it is volatile. It's a small handful. It's now down to, I don't know, 3%, 4% of total revenue. So it's not material, but it does move around a little bit. It's going to continue to be volatile. Although, I will say that part of the strategy that we're driving right now is to work with these customers on the multi-year types of arrangements. So while there will always be a hardware element focus much more of the engagement on long-term software, containers, and those types of things to support where their businesses are going. So I would say that the volatility will become less and less pronounced over time, but it will still be there for a while, but just keep it in the context of it, it's 3% or 4% of total revenue. So it's not that big a deal. -- Understood. That's helpful. And Arlen just one question, just a modeling question on deferred. So I mean based on the commentary that we have heard around that you guys are facing away the multi-year maintenance contracts being billed upfront. We would have thought that there will be somewhat more of a headwind on deferred this quarter. Obviously, we saw some nice seasonal uptick, the sequential uptick, but if you can give us some more color as to how that sort of like phasing away from multi-year maintenance will show up in deferred, maybe it hasn't been rolled out yet, but just some more color on deferred for modeling will be helpful? -- Yeah, I mean, I think, look I would go back, if you take a step back and we talked a lot about this at Investor Day. But when you think about the business, I would say, the first way to kind of think about the normalization is look at ARR. After you move away from ARR, you're going to start to get an idea of where we're headed in terms of our future committed revenues and you'll see more and more of that buildup obviously in unbilled in terms of how that will react in the business.And then and one of the reasons I started with ARR is because one of the things that you'll have to deal with and that we'll deal with in terms of how we model and think about our business is the effect of 606. And as we do on-prem term licenses and how those kind of pull in how that have an effect on the business. And so even though we'll continue to move away from prepaid maintenance, you're going to continue to see movement around that deferred line and as you said we had an uptick in seasonality.We feel good particularly on a quarter-by-quarter basis when you look at that where we're headed. But obviously there's going to continue to be volatility depending on mix and some of that mix is not only the mix in terms of SaaS, but it's on-prem term licenses as well as the pooled-licenses we have for the Networking business, which is all going to have an impact and it's going to move across our short-term and long-term deferred. -- Sounds good. Thanks guys.Your next question is from Robert Majek with Raymond James. -- Great, thanks a lot. Can you give us an update on Citrix Managed Desktops and how the sell-through has been so far with your partners and customers? And then additionally, is this an offering we will see you put more emphasis on going forward? -- Yeah, CMD, just for everybody. That is our fully packaged DaaS offering that we're building with Microsoft on top of Windows Virtual Desktops. It's really a complete well, a complete way to give customers a turnkey service. Those things are just now -- just now going live. So there's not a whole lot of history yet, but we'll look at it and talk about it much more going forward. It's similar to the way I described the platform earlier, where the important part of the strategy is laid the foundation so that we've got a platform approach that covers all users regardless of their end, kind of their end-user requirements and then have those individual solutions that allow us to continue to segment users much more specifically based on their usage. So that could be a full VDI solution, it could be a Citrix Managed Desktop, it could be just simply analytics.I mean it's that level of flexibility that I think is most critical going forward. So stay tuned, in a couple of quarters, we'll provide an update just in terms of overall uptake. But I think the story that we talk about is going to be much more platform oriented. -- Thanks a lot.Your final question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. -- Yes, thanks. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. I guess, David, the question I have for you is coming away from the sales kickoff. And as you go through this transition the Workspace is being more of a platform. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about sort of the evolution of the partner ecosystem. As you guys are now starting to talk to decision makers outside just the IT universe. Traditionally that's been an area where the tradition, the global system integrators will come in and oftentimes help sort of grease the skids in terms of helping software companies along in terms of their platform strategy. I'm just trying to get a sense on where you guys stand on that and maybe if there is any points of validation we can take away from potential partnerships that help, I think, speak to the direction you guys are heading in? Thanks. -- Yeah, I can't talk about specific partnerships that aren't really announced publicly, but I can tell you that you're right it was a big focus of last week talking about the overall message selling into a different set of buyers and it's a journey that we've been on for a few years. So it hasn't been totally net new. However, the conversation that I had sitting down with a large group of our GSI partners was much more focused on. This is a platform, this is one that a lot of them have been engaged in, in terms of helping build out micro apps and things as beta customers and whatnot, because the long-term engagement with them comes from how they build unique and differentiated businesses around some of these capabilities not just using them as a tool as part of a larger engagement, but actually as a foundation to build a practice around it, that's the direction that we would be working with them on to help become real.So good engagement with GSIs, continue to work with our traditional set of partners both on new and installed base customers. So the message was pretty holistic last week. I think we've got good alignment across our sellers, lot of transition, as you would imagine, we're moving to much more of a continuous engagement model, which is typical for a cloud company versus one that sells individual point products. But that's a journey we've been on for a while. And so I think each and every quarter we're getting a little bit better at it, and we've got a pretty good, pretty good view of where we need to be over the course of the next couple of years. -- That's helpful, thanks very much. -- All right. It sounds like that was the last question. So again, I just want to wrap up and thank you everybody for joining us again this afternoon.

The drop provides a good buying opportunity for astute value investors.\tCisco reported great Q1 revenue and earnings . But the company said it expects its Q2 revenue to drop 3% to 5% year-over-year.Cisco provided Q2 earnings per share guidance\u00a0 of 75 cents to 77 cents, down from 84 cents in Q1.Cisco Systems stock reacted badly to those forecasts, despite its good Q1 results. This drop, however, provides a good buying opportunity for value investors.As of yesterday\u2019s close, Cisco stock trades for just 13.3 times its expected earnings. In addition, the company is generating positive\u00a0 free cash flow. CSCO produces about $10 billion of free cash flow annually. Since the market cap of CSCO stock is $191 billion, its FCF yield is an attractive 5.2%.Cisco\u2019s dividend will likely not be cut, since its free cash flow is positive. Cisco stock has a very attractive dividend yield of 3.10%.Moreover, Cisco is still buying back CSCO stock, although at a slower rate than before. In Q1, it spent $800 million on buying back Cisco stock.Another attractive development is that Cisco paid down its debt by $6 billion in fiscal Q1, reducing its debt outstanding by 25% to $18.5 billion. That will help boost CSCO\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stock price, since it will raise the company\u2019s pre-tax earnings by almost 5%.It\u2019s not like Cisco Systems hasn\u2019t provided conservative guidance before. It said it expected its revenue to decline this quarter due to\u00a0 weaker macroeconomic trends. that Cisco has forecast revenue declines in the past, only to exceed expectations when its results came out. Bringing down expectations so as to later beat them is a way to prevent CSCO stock price from completely collapsing when the company\u2019s results come in below expectations.Analysts, on average, are projecting revenue of $51 billion for the year ending July 2020, and $52.5 billion by July 2021. That puts Cisco Systems stock at an enterprise value-to-revenue ratio of just 3.55 times ($181.6 billion divided by 51 billion). That is very inexpensive for a technology stock.For example,  (NASDAQ:) stock trades at an EV-revenue ratio of five. Another competitor,  (NYSE:) trades at an EV-revenue ratio of 4.25. So Cisco Systems stock is quite cheap.It\u2019s not uncommon for a stock that disappoints investors, as Cisco recently has, to tread water for a while. I would expect that investors will have some good opportunities to buy Cisco stock at attractive\u00a0 prices over the next quarter or two.Cisco\u00a0 stock has a high 3.1% dividend yield and it its share buybacks continue at this pace ($800 million per quarter), its buyback yield will be 1.7% ($3.2 billion divided by $190 billion). So its total yield will be 4.8% (the 3.1% dividend yield plus the 1.7% buyback yield). That is an attractive return on capital for investors.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Earlier this morning, we reported our 3Q fiscal '19 results. You can see those on our earnings numbers that are posted on our Investor Relations website and have been furnished with the SEC. Also, all of today's Analyst Day materials are currently posted on our Investor Relations site as well on the front page. Please scroll to the bottom. You'll see view all of the slides that will be presented here today.We know it's a busy time right here in the heart of earnings season. So, we've tried to keep the content tight, while also addressing a lot of the fundamental questions you all have been asking over the last year. This meeting has been, as you know, in the works for quite some time. But we're pleased this morning you'll be able to hear from our most seasoned executives as well as the newest members of our executive leadership team.So following the presentations from David, PJ, Mark, and Arlen, we'll have everyone grab some lunch and that'll be set up in a buffet outside, come back, eat your lunch in here and we'll do a question-and-answer afterwards. And then we'll ask that you hold your questions until a mic gets to you so that we can hear it on the webcast.As you would expect, we'll be making a number of forward-looking comments. Let me switch to the forward-looking statements where we inherently have risks and uncertainties. For this and more information on the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the back of the presentation material that's on the website or with our most recently filed SEC documents. This event is being webcast and is available for replay.And with that, I will turn it over to David Henshall, our President and CEO. -- Thanks, Traci, and good morning everybody. It's great to see a packed house here and also welcome to everybody that's joining us live on the web around the world. So, as Traci said, we're going to give a formal update on the business and talk a little bit more about really just the -- about the operations, the products and the financial outcomes, not just of where we are right now, but a status on the transformation we've been driving across this organization over the last couple of years and then how to think about the rate and pace over the next, really over the next -- really over the next five years or so.Also, give me a chance to introduce a couple of new members to the leadership team. Really excited to have these folks joining the team in their new roles. Right after me you'll hear from PJ Hough. PJ has been with us for about three years now. Some of you actually know PJ. PJ is our Chief Product Officer, who runs all products across the Company.Mark Schmitz will come and talk about operations also with the organization for about three years now, but has stepped into a much broader capacity as our Chief Operating Officer, focused on really scaling people, product, systems, etc. that are going to be necessary for us to continue the transformation going forward and doing it in actually an accelerated pace from where we've been over the last couple of years. And then, Arlen Shenkman, just recently joined as our Chief Financial Officer, also running Corporate Development and Strategic Alliances across the Board.So, we'll dive into each one of those areas and try to keep this actually pretty tight and concise over the next hour and a half or so. And as Tracy said, we'll open it up to get into a more interactive dialogue across the topics that are covered today and also talk about Q3 where it makes sense.So, it's pretty interesting and as you step back and you think about this Company, I mean, we just celebrated our 30th anniversary earlier this year. So, we've been at this for a long period of time. Pictures of covers in annual reports over that period of time, what's fascinating is that we have really been focused on this fundamental value proposition of connecting people and information, doing that on demand and in a secure managed available way.It's just been a real maniacal focus for us -- for our customers around the globe, regardless of the shifts in the technology landscape and the types of pressures that all of our customers face across the Board. It's allowed us to really create and lead in some pretty important categories around virtualization, app delivery, VDI and how we're thinking about defining the broader workspace right now going into the future. All of our customers have really trusted us over the years to manage what's mission-critical for their business, whether that's applications, business processes, information access, etc, and that's allowed us to continue to leverage this position of strength into where we are today.So, let's focus to 2019 and I'm really proud of the fact that we're now servicing customers in over 100 countries around the world. In fact, we have hundreds of thousands of independent customers. Within that number, I'd say about 100,000 is what you'd consider to be enterprise class organizations. Just about all of the Fortune 100 are Citrix's customers.Probably an underappreciated asset that the company has is the fact that we have, ballpark 100 million people leveraging our technologies on a regular basis to access information, to drive their business forward. That means those tens of millions of clients that are out there on endpoint devices that are running Citrix today. Gives us a really unique Trojan horse to be able to deliver new technologies with a much lower level of friction and allowing people to consume that at the same time in a much easier way.We'll finish this year somewhere around $3 billion in total revenue. You've seen the shift in the P&L, which Arlen's going to talk much more about. Obviously, subscription ARR, the best way to measure the progress of our transition has been on fire lately. It's approaching $700 million in total revenue, growing at 40%. And that's just a clear reflection of what's going on across the financial side of the transformation of the business.We'll exit this year with, ballpark about two-thirds of new product bookings coming via subscriptions, means we're well over halfway through that part of the transition. So, all of these headwinds to growth that we have talked about for the next -- well, really for the last couple of years are abating at this point in time allowing us to inflect and start driving up into the right, from a growth rate standpoint. And at the end of that, you'll see a much cleaner P&L, faster growth, higher profitability, but much more predictable and easier for us to layer upon new incremental revenue streams from a customer point of view.So, we had a lot of progress and it's interesting. This is actually my 67th quarter end with the company. And so I've seen a lot of these transformations with the business and the one question I still get pretty constantly from investors is, I don't understand why Citrix is still growing. I thought apps were actually moving to the web. And so, if that's the case, what is the fundamental value proposition for Citrix? And so, thought I would just net it out. And you saw this if you looked at the slides earlier today, just netted out a really simple -- all those financial terms for you. This is why we are growing, pretty simply. And we'll talk about each one of these throughout the course of the morning, we'll drill down into that.But at the simplest level, we're addressing a much larger value prop than ever before. Customers have used us for virtualization historically, but as you look forward, it's really a broader story than that, focused on mobility, focused on analytics, focused on managing devices, and a whole host of other areas around productivity and engagement. So, it's a bigger opportunity. The customers that have been with us for a long time are spending more. We've done a progressively better job all the time, which Mark will cover around cross-selling products. So, consuming multiple independent point products at the same time. Penetration within those big customers is still growing. Virtualization is a growth market. It's growing. We created it, we lead it, and we're investing to maintain or even accelerate that lead going forward.Despite the size of the customer base, we're adding thousands of new customers every year, about 3,500 year-to-date. So, we'll exit this year with probably 5,000 or so net new customers that we haven't worked with in the past. And then of course, as customers start consuming some of these new services, most of these will fall under the banner of Citrus Cloud. We're going to add a lot of incremental value to them. Value in a way that could be everything from optimizing that existing virtual ops in desktop infrastructure they might have as a legacy customer to net new services around mobility, around analytics, around endpoint management, a number of other areas that we'll talk about more.So, at the end of the day, bigger opportunity, large and growing customer base, selling higher ASPs. That's pretty much the easy story. So, the second part of that is, well, if that's the case, who's actually buying? Simple answer is just about everybody. Largest companies in the world rely on Citrix. It's a critical part of their IT and security infrastructure. There's a lot of conversation that I've heard over the years that assumes that we are just focused around financial services and healthcare which are important verticals, but they actually don't represent the majority of our overall business. The other verticals of course where security and compliance is absolutely critical to their business and therefore, our solutions are a perfect fit. And that continue to be going forward. Also the ways that we're able to really bring together the infrastructure that simplifies it for IT environments. So they can remove cost, so they can make it easier for people to consume information, so not just security and cost-cutting.Left-hand side of the chart -- actually we can skip over here. Talking about the types of challenges, this is probably an easier way to look at it because frankly this is a summary of most customer conversations that we'll have on a regular basis. Security compliance, as I said cost efficiency, those are all super important. Left hand side of this chart though represents what I guess people have probably described today as business transformation. It's an overused term that really encompasses a number of different areas, but it's focused on how do I get closer to my end user? How do I provide incremental services to my customers? How do I turn business agility from a project? Imagine just onboarding and offboarding users, offshore development, M&A integration. These are projects, but they're becoming much more of a core critical competency for a lot of businesses because the cycles that we're in are moving faster and they have higher volatility than they have in the past. So, we no longer have the benefit of just thinking about these things as a one-off. It needs to be fundamental for the way a lot of our customers operate. And the workspace really supports all of these in a pretty pronounced fundamental way.So, we step back and then we think about our customers. Our largest customers are extremely loyal in the business. Our Top 10 customers as measured as those that generated the most total net bookings dollars in 2018, every one of them has been with us for over a decade at this point in time. And also, it's true for about 70% of the Top 100. So, our biggest customers are very sticky. They've been with us for a long time. They're spending more money. Yet at the same time as I said a minute ago, we're continuing to add more and more to grow the base of that pyramid and allow those to become tomorrow's largest customers. And over that period of time, it has allowed us to really step back and deliver a very sustainable, very predictable growth from the business, up into the rye and this is the picture, looking at just the financial outcome since we're a public company roughly 25 years ago. In fact, this holds true regardless of the various economic cycles that we've been in, the various changes in the technology landscape. Simple fact that, we just added value to a lot of customers and our products are sticky.The only two times that we've had a year that went down was due exclusively to a divestiture. Back in the 2001-2002 timeframe, we sold some products to Microsoft and of course those of you who have been close to the company recently, 2017 when we divested the GetGo business to really focus maniacally on the broader Citrix Workspace strategy. So, that's how we thought about delivering the business over the last many years.And I'd say, in the last two years, I would describe the company is focused on three big motions, three big transformations. These are the ones that I guess will usually be covered by PJ, Mark and by Arlen going forward. But the idea is moving from products to platform. Let me just give you a background and context. So about three years ago, we were organized across a number of different business units, product leaders, etc, and we're building products, which is great to drive incremental focus on those areas, but it's really hard to drive more of a horizontal approach, a suite, a bundle, a platform. And so, we reorganized the Company.We brought in PJ to run products wall-to-wall across the organization. We went from a product stand-alone to an integrated single business. And the outcome of that is we're able to operate with a much, much higher level of innovation than we ever have. Our rate of new patent filings is triple what it was at that period of time. At the same time, we're pushing out faster new product introductions at a much higher product quality index. So, very happy with the progress there.On-prem to cloud is really about meeting customers along that hybrid cloud journey. We'll talk about and what most people realize is that the pace of change inside of our customers is actually pretty slow. And this is really where the services inside of Citrus Cloud come together. Citrus Cloud today is a collection of roughly a dozen of services for those customers that are looking to move their existing infrastructure to the cloud. Those customers are looking to consume net new areas and even a set of solutions for those that just aren't ready to move yet, things that we can do to optimize your on-premises deployments because everybody wants to move, it's just the practical realities of doing that are somewhat challenging for a lot of customers. And giving them the tools to do that on their pace, while migrating them onto the platform gradually is a core part of the strategy.And then of course, over the last couple of years, really accelerating the perpetual to subscription motion, which Arlen will go into with a lot more depth. So, it's important I think to just spend a minute thinking about where customers are coming from and why all this matters so fundamentally to them, because in the industry, we talk a lot about these different areas of technology. We always talk about mainframe to client, server clients, serve to PC etc. And it was only about five years ago that just about every organization was entirely focused on that bottom era. I guess, we can call it the PC era, where data was on-prem and data centers were on-prem, core set of ERP systems, it really brought together, all of the transactional information in the business. Data repository was inside the corporate network, etc. That was about five years ago, and it's really only been about five years that we have started to move into what everybody in the industry talks about is the cloud mobile era, where now devices are truly ubiquitous and they're changing constantly all the time to be able to consume and pull information as well as sources of information that are feeding back into the infrastructure.Services are now obviously third-party, whether we're talking about just the latest SaaS services being acquired and deployed by the marketing department, as well as a replacement and disruption for a lot of the core systems that are out there. And then of course, infrastructure as it exists, in a public, private and hybrid mode. And all these things have created a tremendous amount of promise and opportunity, of course, but for most companies, they're still living down at the bottom. I mean, this is what a large majority of their infrastructure still looks like today and their pace to move forward is probably described more as glacial than anything else. It's just the realities of dealing with this.So while at the same time, the promise of where we are is pretty pronounced and the complexity that this causes is also a big problem. This new area takes security and distributes it from the core corporate network out to the endpoint. Data security is now distributed. You're relying on your third-party providers for services and all of these other things. Your attack surface is dramatically different than it was just a few years ago. And so, the industry has created a lot of point products to help manage this fundamental set of problems. You see these apps come up all the time, productivity apps, things whether they're just new mail clients, business file, sync and share, others. And then of course, tools to help manage and search across all this sprawl.It's a terrible stat that today people spend about one day a week looking for information. Entire day just trying to find the latest file, the email they were looking for because of all this distribution that's out there. Obviously, as people have moved outside of the office being able to understand who they are, what they have access to, what their rights are, created IM as a separate category. SSO is a way to abstract away some of that inherent complexity kind of put a skin on the top of it, so people can consume information with a little bit less overhead attached to it. With device for all of course comes the need to manage independent devices. So, a number of different strategies out there obviously to lock down the device itself, really, create a new corporate-owned device, manage the information that's on it, create multiple profiles, all the things that have happened around endpoint management, of course. App delivery, we know it well. Obviously, it's created a way to help simplify some of these challenges from an IT standpoint. VDI is a great example that falls into this category as a way to bring all these disparate applications together in a way that IT can manage more effectively, can secure, can optimize, can deliver it and drive that forward.Clearly, new threats across the security landscape, things that didn't exist a few years ago, but have really come up because of the availability of cloud services, the new work styles distribution, these are ever-changing and creating a fair bit of complexity because of all the promise that has existed within this mobile and cloud area. Then of course, delivering applications. App delivery networks and all of the associated services here. It's only been within the last couple of years that networking was something that we've fed kind of in and out of the data center in a traditional way. Today, as PJ will go through more than ever, you've got a horizontal approach. We're connecting across data centers, across applications, across services and the need to manage and maintain all of that is incredibly challenging, and it just makes it that much harder for all of our customers.And so, if you think about that customer that is living still a little bit in the PC or client/server era, managing all of this incrementally has caused a lot of complexity and it's slowing them down that much more. This idea of promise of all the power of the cloud in a lot of ways just forces more focus internally, trying to manage all of the piece parts, that exists here is an increasing challenge and this isn't just about on-boarding new technologies, but it's about the necessity to actually integrate them together, to hire people to maintain and manage these things and the ongoing challenges that come as they migrate at a different rate and pace going forward.So, the reality though is that the typical customer in the Citrix Universe has over 500 applications. Over 500 applications in their infrastructure operating today. Some of the largest financial services firms, folks that are represented here live in person, the number is 20 times that. I'll meet with a lot of the IT organizations for your companies and we talk about the thousands and thousands and thousands of different apps that are out there. And they're across all kinds of different architectures. It's not just consuming net new SaaS apps or mobile apps, it's across the gamut. And the reality is that, most of these applications are still going to be here years and years into the future. They're just hard to replace.Your IQ organization is spending on average about 90% of the budget maintaining what exists today. That just leaves a little small sliver to try and drive innovation, adopt net new, really move the business forward. The needs aren't going away, just the complexity is underneath all that. We work with customers. We had a customer conference just a few months ago. And so, whenever we're having the similar conversation, I always try to describe the data center. I use this archeological dig comparison and when we do that, the main point, the takeaway of that is, is that applications that you put in place years ago are still there. They're still in the infrastructure. They just get layered on top. So, all these great new applications you're adopting today, things that you think of as disruptive, are actually creating a lot more complexity in many cases, because they're layered on top of each other.Great example, I was with the financial services company down the street about three weeks ago. We are going through what their new initiatives are. They're talking about business transformation and they toured me around, how they've redone a lot of their real estate in an open seating plan and it's great. They're really trying to move forward, not only to drive their own business forward, but to actually attract and retain this new generation of employees. And as we finish the conversation, it segued into the fact that they still have mainframe applications that were built in the '60s that are running inside the data center, for a couple of reasons. One, there's nowhere to put that information. They don't know how to do the data migration in the first place. And it's not a huge priority. It's still operating providing a fundamental level of value to the company. And so, even though they want to adopt all this net new, they still struggle with that challenge of complexity that exists. It's a big, big problem. And when you put it together, all those piece parts that I showed you on that spidergram, the research shows it would cost a typical company about $1,000 per user per year. The promise of the cloud and all the cool stuff that comes with it, is actually pretty expensive. And of course that's just in addition to the cost that they already had of maintaining and running the existing business.So that's back to that whole run/grow equation that most IT organizations struggle with. Just too much money is spent maintaining the complexity that exists, not enough money to be able to simplify and move that forward. And so, that's the challenge from an IT standpoint. What PJ will talk more about is that there's a lot of challenges on the demographic side as well from the end user point of view. We've got huge shifts happening across organizations and I am sure everybody sees in your own company right now that traditional work models have really just evaporated pretty recently. Less than half people are working inside of an office tethered to a machine. Everybody is a little different than they used to be. They have to approach almost every individual inside of a large enterprise today as a mobile worker, because they're working in different places, different devices, different work styles. And some companies are actually employing this as a -- almost as a business strategy. I was at this customer conference, I was using eBay as an example, an example that they in-sourced some of their support as a way to just drive efficiencies and cut cost.And when they in-sourced that, what they did was they leveraged Citrix's infrastructure to tap a part-time stay-at-home work force. The group that would never be in the office in a traditional environment, they can now access in a way to cut cost, way to drive more efficiency and actually bring them back into the workforce where they might not have been able to do that in the past. That's about attracting and retaining people.And I'll tell you what I meant, spending time with not just CIOs, but a lot of CEOs, the reality is that we've got a global talent shortage right now. It's one of the reasons why unemployment is as low as it is. And when that happens, all that does is generate increasing costs at a pretty rapid basis and attrition keeps going up across the board. So we're looking for ways to just engage people more and more across the board. We fundamentally believe that enabling people to do their best work is a technology conversation. Its things that we can do to engage people better, giving them the tools to be productive on their terms. And a lot of that comes back to this idea of employee experience.And we use this team pretty loosely and you're going to hear that over the course in the next couple of hours. We're not just talking about look and feel, but really fundamentally stepping back and understanding what are the things that people are trying to get done? What are the business processes that can be automated? What are the systems that we can bring together to abstract away a whole bunch of complexity for IT to allow them to go faster, allow them to cut costs, allow them to be more secure? That's a big part of what we're doing right now, because fundamentally, it's a conversation much more about productivity and engagement. PJ will go into this in detail, but this idea of unengaged or disengaged employees is really a global epidemic right now.Gallup's done some work and they talk about this as a $7 trillion problem, because most of the people are just not working that hard. It's probably not fair to say working hard, it's probably more fair to say they just don't have the tools, the systems to be productive where they need to be. We're making it just harder than we have to. That's one of the things that you'll hear more about, how we think about it and what we're doing to help solve and fix this problem.It bears out when you call up some of the actual statistics about this. People will tell you, I got the right tools, I'm going to be very productive. I don't have the right tools, it's really going to hurt. More than half the people think that their tools are on the far right hand side of this chart.Stats will show you, the research that people are doing all the time into this idea of productivity, it's going to point out the fact that most people in a typical office environment are productive less than 10 hours a week. In some cases, it's less than three hours. So, it's a pretty big problem right now and we're looking for ways to really drive that forward.And so, part of what we're here to talk about today and for those of you that have followed the Company much more closely is that, we fundamentally believe there are opportunities to solve these problems. We think there's a better way. That's the real idea behind the Citrix Workspace, the things that we're doing as a company to really bring this together. And so, it started with this concept of this spidergram, where we've got market-leading capabilities in a number of these point products. And so we thought, there's an easy first step to start to aggregate this together, to allow a lot of our customers to pull out some of those point products and just consume the individual components that are part of the overall platform. I'd say this is our first step. This is what we had talked about as organizing IT. So internally, we'll say, organizing IT is the first step. Bring these apps and these disparate pieces together. It's easier to manage, it's more secure, we can cut costs, we can drive that level of benefit for the typical IT organization.Second phase, of course, is like, how do you organize work within that. And that's where the Citrix Workspace came together in its, really, it's current form couple of years ago where it's now focused on a single unified and secure way to manage all applications, whether those are virtualized apps, SaaS, mobile, native, you name it. Ways to connect into your information, your files, whether those reside in Citrus Cloud, Box, Dropbox or a number of on-prem repositories, but getting that single way to access that, solving some of that problem of searching for information, of course, making this ubiquitous across different device types so that devices can be transient, move in and out.We build security within a lot of this, whether that's just security as a way to access, to manage devices, to enforce policies, etc. And as we do that, we've been able to collect an incredible amount of valuable information. Our analytics touches information that's happening across the network, the device, the app, the user and many other different attributes and not just capturing that in a way where we can turn it into a report, but use it in a way to really close the loop and drive actions and PJ will go into much more detail about that.And then, of course, evolving our networking portfolio to really be focused on application delivery, application security and many of these things that really drive the workspace forward. So, that's where we were moving from organizing IT to organizing work. And then the last phase is what we've announced this year. And this is much more about how do we use that level of intelligence to really guide and automate work going forward and transform the workspace into this fundamental platform that is really targeted toward how do you add value across all employees, regardless of whether you're power users, you need all the power of virtualization, or frankly whether you're just an employee that needs a couple of SaaS apps and Office 365. I need to add value across the entire spectrum for all applications, of course, and then using analytics in a more profound way to really drive a lot of those outcomes and actions and be much more predictive on ways that'll influence immediately the productivity of individuals. And, of course, built entirely on the cloud, so that we can allow customers to leverage the infrastructure that makes sense, allow much more flexibility in terms of scaling up and scaling down as they look forward and manage that dynamically.And to understand where we're coming from, let me just take a second to talk about, I guess, you call it our world view, but the way we think about technology inherently, because it's different than a lot of our competitors. Do we -- assume that people are in the middle. I mean, this is a little bit more about human-based computing. Thinking about the empathy for, not just technology, but what are people actually trying to do? What are they trying to get done? How do we make them more productive and more engaged? And so, on the left it's -- I guess that's representative of different devices and sources of information.We believe that devices are going to continue to be ubiquitous. They're very, very transient. They're always going to be changing. And the scope of which you just can't try to lock down. This idea of locking down a device in a way that kind of recreates a corporate-owned device is just going to create the opportunity for people to work around it. It adds more security problems, more complexity. There's got to be a more flexible approach to that. Frankly, the same thing holds true on the infrastructure on app side, the idea that these things are transient. Applications that are hot today may or may not be here five years from now. We see this transition on a regular basis, because we need to create that platform that allows people to consume new things as they come along, but also migrate into new areas in a much less frictional way going forward.And of course, when it comes to the infrastructure and some of your other providers, the realization that your partners today you need that level of flexibility to continue to move and optimize where it makes more sense for your business. Because most of our customers are selecting Azure or GCP or AWS, they're utilizing services from all of the above, and they'll continue to do that for reasons that are important in their business. And those reasons may change over time and it's important to recognize that as we build up our platform from the ground up.And so, just -- to really summarize this and just put it in a very, very simple terms, we're adding value in a couple of different ways. This is -- think about this as value for shareholders, revenue growth, profit etc. Over the years, we've built a $3 billion business, largely based on virtualization. Unfortunate enough to attach networking is a form of virtualization or workspace delivery, but overall, we've only been able to touch about 30% of the seats inside of our existing base.Now, 30% of the available seats within our current customer base are Citrix customers. That number is growing each and every year. And we're doing things to continue to increase the average revenue per seat by adding in new capabilities around the workspace platform intelligence, optimizing SaaS, mobile analytics etc. That's one vector of growth and we're seeing a lot of what's driving our resurgence in the last couple of years, really based probably on this single vector moving up and driving a higher usage for customers.But the way to think about the platform as we describe it is much more about how we drive this wall-to-wall attach, really driving productivity across the board and that's creating that fundamental platform that I've talked about, and you'll hear much more about that services the needs of all users, all application types really across any industry. We're focused on building a vertical platform that can much easier add incremental services on top of the seats that are existing today. That's where the less friction comes in and we can continue to segment users in a way that provides the most value for those individual customers. Whether those need -- yesterday's virtualization solutions, whether those are consuming Citrix TAZ or Windows Virtual Desktops or partner solutions that help verticalize and drive this going forward. That's the inherent platform approach that we've been driving. So, we're looking to add value across both of these axis. And that's where the strategy is right now and that's how you should think about it as you listen to the next couple of presentations because as we execute against this, this just allows us to grow our TAM pretty significantly.As I mentioned today, internally we'll talk about virtualization as amazing technologies, but a bit of a specialized use case, targeted toward the most complex, the most secure, the most powerful solutions and as a category, not just Citrix, but everybody, that category touches about 20% of the available knowledge workers in the world. That number is slowly growing. As I've said a couple of times, virtualization is a growth market and it continues to expand, but when we think about this, this is the simplest way to articulate the Workspace platform. It's like how do we not only grow the virtualization part of the pie, but obviously continue to expand around that entire circle. That's the untapped opportunity that we look at today.And so, the categories we compete in as measured by Gartner, they're big. That's our traditional categories, virtual client computing, ADC, business file sync and share, et cetera. And whether these numbers are precise or directionally correct, the point is they're very big markets, they're growing and we've got plenty of headroom to be able to expand into that. But as we start to go through some of these areas we've been executing on over the last couple of years, you see this number continue to expand whether we're looking at more of a software-defined perimeter. It's a fancy term for networking being disaggregated away from hardware into -- moving more into software services and analytics. Bringing in capabilities to secure SaaS applications, more natively to connect people to cloud apps. It's the first click of the Workspace.And then really where we are today, targeting areas around productivity and integration and things that were just not possible when we were focused purely on virtualization, it further expands that overall pie. And so, as we continue to execute forward, we're just going to expand our addressable market by as much as a factor of three from where we were just a couple of years ago. And that's were we're focused on driving forward and that's what you'll hear more about today.These three big initiatives that have been really front and center across Citrix for the last couple of years. Products to platforms, which really extends our value in a number of different ways, the on-prem to cloud journey, which will support our customers across this hybrid approach, which will be dominant for the next several years, and then, of course, expanding our business model in a way that provides leverage, growth and predictability going forward.And then lastly, I mean, internally we talk about three primary business outcomes. These are the things that are inherent in a lot of our products right now with the focus on experience, experience for the end user and to a degree experience for the IT organization. Simplified complexity, make it easier to consume and that drives value productivity engagement. Choices about infrastructure, choice of device, choice of cloud providers and the recognition that those things will change over time, so it's critically important for us to maintain that, and then, of course, inherent security that is built into everything that we do right now, both from an individual security product standpoint and a secure architecture.So thank you very much. That's my quick introduction. Now I want to call up PJ Hough. PJ will do a more deep dive into the ecosystem and the product technologies. Thanks, man. -- Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to walk you through a little more detail on our product strategy and really position it in the context of what we see as the key trends in our industry, where the market forces are and what the big opportunities are for us, and thank you for our customers as we move through this transition.As David indicated, one of the things that we certainly see our customers dealing with is the move to the cloud. And this has actually caused customers in many cases to reevaluate not just how they get to the cloud, but what they do in preparation for getting there. And we recognize that for many customers, it's going to be a long journey and that there are things that we can help them do that really honor the environment that they're going to be in which is hybrid and multi-cloud and it recognizes the fact that they're going to maintain a significant footprint on-prem even as they continue on their cloud journey.A second key focus area for our customers today and one that comes up in every conversation that we have is around security, enterprise security. And how customers deal with the potential of the opportunity of the cloud of the potential of a mobile and flexible workforce and at the same time providing the governance and controls that they need to deliver their business securely. And then finally, one that has I think resonated deeply with us and a conversation that we are having with every customer who's undergoing some form of digital transformation is how they think about employee productivity.The numbers that David shared are stark with regards to how employees today are viewing the tools that they have to help them do their job, but maybe more importantly in a tight labor market, everything that you can do to attract the right talent, to retain the talent and then help them be productive, actually it flows directly to the bottom line in organizations. And we've seen market differences between organizations that have managed to capture that employee productivity and organizations that are not quite there.So. I think the cloud journey provides a substrate against which we can talk about much of the transitions that are occurring in our industry. And it's not specifically just about the move to the cloud. It's about the mindset shift that happens in organizations when they go on that journey that causes them to reevaluate the things that they've historically done, the constraints they've applied to their business and the way they've thought about how to operate their business and how the cloud has somewhat liberated thinking across a wide array of elements of their infrastructure.If you think about the world that our customers now live in with regard to moving to cloud, they have a lot of choice. You look at the cloud platforms, you look at things like the hypervisors or how they think about building out their data center infrastructure. And for each one of these, as the customers move on that journey to the cloud, you should not think about it as a like-for-like. The cloud is actually enabling new scenarios, opening up new opportunities for customers to rethink how they engage with their employees, how they deliver services to customers, and how they operate their business.A really good example of this is the work that we've done recently in partnership with Microsoft, around Windows Virtual Desktop on the Azure cloud. And it highlights that as you think about moving to cloud, there are new ways to think about delivering Windows as a service, ways that we are familiar with and the ways that Microsoft has invested in, that really demonstrate that both of us are taking a different approach to thinking about how that might appear to an enterprise customer in the future. So why don't we just take a moment and watch a quick video of Brad Anderson describing that partnership and the relationship between Microsoft and Windows and Citrix.[Video Presentation]So, I think Brad hit on a number of really key elements in here that I want to highlight for you. The first is that both Citrix and Microsoft are partnering together to leverage the cloud to do new things and really, really reshape the way the customers consume our combined technologies. So, I think that deep technical engagement is obviously foundational to our partnership. The second thing that he talked about was our field engagement, and how we go to customers together in a way that actually brings the best of Citrix and the best of that Microsoft platform to the market. And I use that as a great example, because I think that nourishes the depth of our partnership, and collaboration that's occurring across the various aspects of our business, but also how that transformation is not just a replay of what we had in on-prem software and solutions. The cloud is enabling us to really rethink ways to do that and it basically broaden the market for both of us.So, I want to talk a little bit about the quality of experience that David mentioned, employee, mobility and I don't just mean mobile devices. I actually mean the mobile workforce, the distributed workforce and then finally enterprise security. When we talk to enterprise customers today, there are these challenges that they face. We're in an interesting time with regard to the trends related to IT and enterprise in the world. We've actually hit a flat spot with regard to technology delivering productivity gains to organizations.You can go back and map productivity improvements in organizations and output over the last several decades and you can map the key inflection points to the transitions to new technologies. Well, we've sort of hit a flat spot. We've now introduced a lot of new technology and we're not seeing a correlated growth in productivity. Something has actually flipped. A second key factor here is the shortage of talent. McKinsey estimates that in US, we're going to be short 95 million medium to high-skilled employees next year, just in the US alone. And the C-suite customer's that we've talked to say that 61% of them believe that access to developer talent is going to be an impediment to growth for them and I use developer talent as a proxy for technical skilled workers as they sort of penetrate the workforce.And then finally, we have this issue with low employee engagement. The Gallup number is startling. The number could be as high as 85% of the employees in organizations are disengaged. That means that -- think about it, 15% of your employees are fully engaged on helping you deliver your business. Well, and somehow we have to take a look at the IT systems that we've put in place, because they do contribute. The third highest-ranked factor by employees for why they stay at a company or why they leave after their salary and their manager is the tools that they have to do their job.And when you think about the environments that we've given to users over the years, it's not fair to say that that's where we are. We've actually heavily invested. You look at these large new complex cloud-based applications, you look at the deep investments that organizations have made, we're just not seeing the return. It seems like we've substituted one set of issues for an equivalent set of challenges that users have as they move between old legacy applications and what I would even consider today, quite modern and SaaS applications inside the enterprise. At the same time and maybe this is at the heart of the challenge we face, in the consumer world, we've all seen the technology evolve on a different path and in fact enable us to do things that are completely different.Think about the apps that we have that are tailored to our personal experience that have a feed of information that comes to me, that matters to me, and that helps me understand what's going on. The number of apps that we now have in our personal lives that actually have notifications, that appear at the right time, that remind me to leave for the airport, to tell me to check in for my flight, that help me manage the stream of activities that I could possibly spend time on, but actually organize them in a way that helps me organize my personal life.Think about the number of apps that now have a one-click experience, book the hotel room, reserve the tickets, select my seat. Most of us don't have that for booking conference rooms or other resources within our organizations by contrast. And finally, we're now, in our personal lives, very used to interacting with services that actually are getting better the more we use them. They have recommendation engines. They help us find our next movie, our next book, our next album to download, and yet, at work we really struggle to provide those same tools to employees that help them guide themselves through their day at work.And so, this is really where we're focused on building the Citrix Workspace. We really have thought about the problem in a very different way with regard to helping deliver that consumer-like experience for our employees, across all of their devices. We think that's critical because, in fact we see more device diversity than ever before. We also see people working from multiple locations on multiple devices. So, how do you maintain context for an employee such that as they move from working on the train to their office, to working from home that they actually carry their work with them in a way that makes sense. We want to simplify access to all those applications through a very simple single sign-on experience. So, that I don't really think about the fact that, I'm switching apps or accessing multiple applications.David highlighted the problems of search and finding the right information. We believe that there's a better way to deliver the right content to employees that help them find the things they need to do their job more easily. And at the same time, we recognize that we have to underpin all of this experience with a security and performance investment that really provides that context for work.So, let me quickly show you what the key elements are in our Workspace experience. And by the way, this is a -- screenshots of our product that we will be delivering before the end of this year and that next wave of product delivery. So the first thing you'll see highlighted in the intelligent experience is integration of assistance and search as a first-class experience. We often know that people start their day by launching applications to look for work, but we also know that they often have a goal in mind. And how do you get that from goal to action as quickly as possible? How do you make it easy for them to express what they need to do?The second thing that you'll see here highlighted and actually given, I would say, private place in the center of the workspace experience is this contextual personalized feed of work that I need to complete within the organization. It's a balanced mixture of things that are pushed to me that I have to complete and do as part of my job and a set of feeds that are pulled to me by me based on things that I'm interested in understanding and knowing about the organization. And not only is this feed contextual, it's also actionable. Right here you'll see in blue the verbs where I can approve or process the work right here within the feed.You'll also see that we've elevated recommendations in the Workspace. We actually understand the types of actions that might be relevant for a particular employee. What's the next best thing I do at work? Think about that moment, while you're transitioning from completing a task to doing the next task. How do you choose what to do next?Of course, people still need access to their applications and virtual applications, SaaS, mobile applications are all fully integrated in here into that Workspace experience. There will be times when you will want to go into a deep application as the starting point, but we also recognized that it's quite possible that you can accomplish many tasks based on the activities that are delivered to you in the feed. And finally, we have embedded micro applications into that Workspace experience that allows me to get the next level of detail inside the Workspace, so that I really understand what's going on.Actually let's take a quick look at more interactive demo that shows exactly what's going on in the Workspace. Here you see that we've really highlighted the apps, the content, the files, and if I'm accessing a desktop that I have access to that here inside the Workspace. Remember, this experience works across all devices. But really our goal is to drive up engagement and productivity, not just have the Workspace to be a place that launches applications, but a place that I go during my day to actually get work done where I am presented with the actions that make sense for me, where I can get to see the information that's coming from the systems of record in my organization, but that's in a much more simplified and consumable way. Think about this particular example of an expense report coming from a large ERP expense management system. Typically today, you get the email that drives you into that application or you have to search for the right context in user interface. We're able to extract that in these micro applications and make it easier for you to complete that task in a much easier way.There's also information that often needs to be shared with employees about new employees, new training courses, etc. We believe we can deliver a bunch of that. And then finally actions in here where I can not only consume information, but I can interact with those systems of record. In this case, creating an incident that's going to go back into our complex system of record. And if you wanted to know what that complex system of record looks like, this is an example. This is what the IT person in ServiceNow deals with when they received that incident that allows them to process it. So this doesn't replace systems of record for deep use, but for the casual user, the person who just needs to create the incident or who just wants to approve the expense report, we believe we can mine and extract those interesting workflows out of those applications and deliver them as consumer-like experiences inside the Workspace.Of course, delivering that same experience on mobile is critical to this plan. When I think about my own day and move in between meetings that's often my opportunity to understand what's most pressing, what needs my attention and allowing on a mobile device for me to easily observe this type of information and move quickly between my tasks and move the workflow of the company forward. I think that's really crucial.Here you see that we've integrated a digital assistant into the Workspace that can answer questions that we all struggle with. You know, what's my vacation balance? How do I easily get access to training? What courses are available? And over time, this will become more refined based on usage.As David indicated, our world view is very much about putting the user at the center of the complexity and addressing the problem from the perspective of the individual user. And really when you think about that Workspace, think about it as a tailored experience that adapts to my usage over time much in the same way that we have social platforms and social tools that adapt to our usage. And so over time, my Workspace and David's Workspace will be quite different based on our usage, our patterns of activity and what matters to us in our roles. And the way we've encapsulated that is by in fact putting that Workspace that personalized Workspace at the center of that overall experience.Now what I've shown you looks a lot like an application. But in fact, the way that we have decided to build this is to build it as a platform. We recognized that as a platform we have the opportunity to build the next layer of tools that apply to all users inside organizations and that can be integrated into all of the applications and workflows that matter to them. And what you see here on the slide are a list of some of the other applications that we expect that will be integrated into this platform over time. They're just indicative of the fact that many organizations have many of these tools and need to provide a coherent and consistent experience that sits on top of all of them.So what does this mean from a business perspective? Well, I think the first thing it means is, you will see us accelerate the Workspace adoption across a wider set of users inside the organization. The workflows that I showed you and that simplified experience are not constrained by the 30% of VDI use cases inside the organization. They are generally applicable to all employees.And one [Phonetic] could argue that our biggest opportunity with Workspace in that context is to actually address some of these broad corporatewide workflows whether it's employee on-boarding or improving your interview process, or simplifying the way that you manage performance or other capabilities that could be delivered to basically every employee inside the organization. And so therefore, we see potential -- significant potential for seize expansion inside our existing customers as well as attracting net new customers that recognize this as a brand new opportunity for them to think about the Workspace that they deliver as the platform for work inside their organization.Except from a product perspective, when I think about the waves of adoption that we're going to see, the first wave is the one that we're experiencing right now and the one that's showing up in our financials which is that move to SaaS, the move to subscription and obviously, we're partway through that and it's well, well under way.The second wave is I anticipate, we will start to see customers broaden the use cases for the Workspace inside their organization and thinking more wall-to-wall about the usage and the benefits that they could get from Workspace. And of course this opens up huge opportunities for us to take that platform that we're building and integrate it to deliver that complete experience for the widest set of users.And third, is we're really opening up that platform and leveraging how we think about the kinds of solutions that not only we build, but that enterprises and third parties can also build on that platform. Recently about a month ago we held our first-ever Citrix Developer Conference, where we invited 100 developers to come to our campus in Santa Clara and sit with the Workspace platform and our core engineering team. You read about it in our investor letter. It was a very successful event and I think it pertains a whole new direction for the company with regard to engagements with a new set of partners who take this platform and take it deep into organizations where they as partners understand the workflows and business processes and what really matters in vertical industries and in other geographies. So really that's the -- that I think is the waves of adoption and the waves of potential growth that we see for Workspace in the coming years, a very exciting time for us.I'd like to switch gears now and talk about our Networking portfolio. And what we see happening in Networking which is actually a very exciting time. It's very clear that the Networking industry as a whole is moving from hardware and appliance to software. This is partly driven and accelerated by the move to cloud where frankly you don't get to deploy hardware, but you do get to put software services on top of cloud platforms.Our investments over many decades in networking have all been software based, even though we have delivered them as hardware appliances, our core intellectual property and investment has always been in software. And, therefore, this is a trend that we can participate in as customers move from an appliance on-prem based view of their network to a cloud and hybrid view of their network.We've, of course, have optimized the Workspace to run on our networking stack and we have optimized our networking tools to deliver the best value, the most optimal performance and the most visibility and control of that Workspace experience. And we also see customers on the networking business transitioning also to a subscription model. You see this show up in the context of pooled licensing for our networking business.So let's talk a minute about the technology shifts that are occurring and how they actually play to some of the strengths that we have with the assets we own in networking. The first shift that we see happening is these large centralized applications when they move to cloud in many cases they're getting reengineered. They're getting redesigned to take advantage of cloud. Again this is another great example of how the transition to cloud is not moving from a static platform to an equivalent platform. Customers are using this as an opportunity to transform their applications that they build and leverage new capabilities that exist only in those cloud platforms.I'm going to give a quick example here that I think we'll all be very familiar with. The example is a very simple one of taking a photo and uploading it to a cloud service. When you take that photo today, what really happens is it gets uploaded to the cloud service and we generally think, oh, it gets uploaded and it gets stored in the cloud. The reality there are new services that are getting built that process that photo in the cloud. An example is geotagging, so it's that I can come back later and search for photos of Paris or New York and find the photos that I want. Or maybe the photos are getting facially recognized, so that I can come back later and search for pictures of PJ and you'll find pictures that are all relevant.These are independent services. They're all part of this much larger application that's being built in the cloud. And the way that the app is being constructed is not as a monolith, it's actually being constructed as a set of these micro services, these little applications. And what that really means is if you think about the traffic from a networking perspective, the traffic is no longer just flowing from my mobile device to the cloud, it's between all of these micro services inside the cloud. And so this new networking paradigm has actually not just permeated the edge of the cloud, it's penetrated the architecture of how applications are getting built.And so when you think about an existing application that ran in a data center on-prem and now think about the places that people are building and running applications in the cloud, what you see is that that software element of networking now participates in many of these new environments. And this is the same technology. This is the same core Citrix ADC code base, the same core Citrix SD-WAN code base and that marks at the top is really where much of the magic is happening in cloud networking.It is the fact that you now require a common way to orchestrate, have visibility and have control over not just the applications that are running in your data center, but also the applications that are running in cloud. And our customers, as they move to pooled licensing, have the flexibility to now take those applications on-prem, we factor them as they move to cloud and leverage that same subscription to Citrix Networking as they move the applications forward. The policies that they enforce, the orchestration tool that they use to manage it, the visibility and control and security that they had from our networking products on-prem, all mapped directly into this architecture in the cloud.And to the extent that you subscribe to the model that we do, which is on-prem stays for a long time while customers move to one or more clouds, this model is going to be an enduring model for customers who consume Citrix Networking. So in the same way that we saw the phased transitions occurring in Workspace, we see similar phases of adoption occurring with Citrix Networking. That first phase is really about customers moving to our subscription and moving to hybrid and multi-cloud. The second phase is really about rewriting those applications in a dramatic way, taking advantage of the cloud platforms and building these cloud-native applications. I should comment that one of the things that has happened with the cloud native model, which is characterized by containers and technologies like Kubernetes is that those technologies have in fact in some cases flown back into the enterprise and back into on-prem.So cloud native networking is not just applications running in cloud, its applications written to the pattern that's been popularized by the cloud. And so again, we see even applications on-prem getting modernized using the same set of techniques and the investments that we've made are equally applicable to those on-prem applications as they are to the cloud applications.And finally, we see the emergence of this new orchestration capability for clouds and for networks, which is that ADC gets delivered as a service. And that means that I have an intent based way of describing how I want my applications to perform and the orchestration of these highly sophisticated networking deployments of maybe tens or dozens or hundreds of instances of network, all can be orchestrated in a consistent way across my cloud, across my multiple clouds and my on-prem deployment. So that's a snapshot of where we see the transition occurring in our networking business.Third, I'd like to talk a little bit about analytics and our investment in this area. Clearly this is a very exciting investment for us and one that underpins both the core of our workspace strategy and the core of our networking strategy moving forward. There've been several significant changes that have occurred in the capabilities of platforms over the last several years that really make the potential of a new analytics platform come to life for us. The first one is there is now a rich set of cloud-enabled AI and machine learning platforms that are available. And they really have changed the game with respect to the platform on which you can build AI and machine learning enabled analytics and applications.The second thing is, as our users have become even more connected, we actually have a deep understanding of the work graph. We know what device you use, we know what network you connect to, we understand what applications we use, we see the content that you share, we understand where you're based, we understand the patterns of work. And the more we understand about the people you interact with and the nature of work and combine all of that into an analytics platform, it gives us the ability to offer enhancements to the environment on top of it.And the final one is that we really do understand that context of work. When you think about the Workspace and offspringing context into the Workspace, this really allows us to service new experiences for users that are powered by analytics in the background. I want to give you a few examples of some of the -- I'll call them the services or applications that we are building on this rich, rich platform. So, on the left, what you see is the access to telemetry that we have that comes from our core products. And this is telemetry that we've been compiling and building up for many years, whether it's the 100 million end points or the billions of data points we get from our traffic management solution or the petabytes of data that we see flow through our networking products on a regular basis. We have an incredible visibility across the users' devices, content apps and the network to understand what's going on. We have actually combined all of that into a common analytics platform and we're now building solutions on top of it that address specific problems.The first one is how do we leverage that to make the environment more secure? Well, it turns out that user behavior analytics is -- pivots around the idea of understanding what's normal behavior for users and being able to recognize anomalies and deal with them. And so, what we have is actually built a system that not only recognizes when an user is doing something anomalous, but we actually have the points of control in the Workspace and in the network to intervene on the device. We can ask for a second factor of authentication. We can restrict access in some way. We can turn on recordings, so that we keep better track of what's going on. So, in the context of security, we were able to deliver a much more comprehensive picture back to IT because of the deeper understanding we have of the individuals in the organization.Next, I'll talk about performance. I mean, this has often been a challenge for our customers to understand in a physical deployed environment, what's the performance like for an individual user? Is everyone getting the same performance? Are people legitimately complaining about something that's changed in the environment or not? And how do you alarm IT with the tools that help them understand that? Well, take that problem and multiply it tenfold by distributing the users, distributing the applications, allowing people to bring their own devices and now try to get the same experience on top of that capability. And so we've really designed the performance analytic solution to address that incredibly wide and diverse set of infrastructure, application experience and give the IT organization a consistent and clear view of what they are actually delivering to their employees as an experience.When you think about employee engagement and retaining your best employees, not only you have to give them great tools, they have to work. They have to work all the time. They have to work when I'm in an airport. They have to work when I'm trying to get work done from home, when I'm trying to get access to content, when I'm on the road or presenting to a customer. And so how do you understand whether or not as an IT organization, your investments are actually delivering that correct set of capabilities.And finally, I want to talk for a moment about productivity analytics, because this is the promise of taking all of this capability and insight and using it not just to drive what I would call optimization from an IT point of view, but to really drive productivity for end users and use this to feed insights to individuals that actually help them do a better job with working with the tools that are available.We've already delivered security analytics and it's been adopted by many of our customers. We are on the cusp of delivering our performance analytics. And what you should expect to see is that productivity analytics is one of these investments that I think has a much longer tail in some ways, because we've just opened up a whole new way for thinking about how to leverage that analytics platform to deliver new capabilities to end users. And the more we engage with users inside the Workspace and the more we understand about what they're doing, the more you'll see us invest in creating capability that delights users inside that Workspace.So really on the left, you'll see the capabilities that we're delivering from the analytics platform that are targeted at IT. But on the right, I think the long-term objective here is to really unlock the potential of that analytics platform to really deliver new capabilities to individual users. How do I recommend the next best thing you work on? How do I anticipate the content that might be relevant to a project that you've been assigned to work on, so that I promote that content and make it more easily accessible to you? How do we suggest things that you might want to go look at people in the organization you might need to get in touch with? How do we begin to understand the opportunity for automation?I met with an enterprise customer last week who told me that 98.5% of all expense reports get approved in the organization. Yet every expense report gets multi-layered, multi-leveled approvals that go all the way up and down through the organization. Isn't the time that we thought about sort of reimagining how to make an approval process? Help us identify the anomalies? Not bog us down with the busy work of approval? How do you separate those things and sort of modernize the way that we think about that? One of those activities like approvals can we automate and still provide the same level of governance and control and visibility to organizations.We will understand more about how people use the framework and the applications we've built. We'll know which micro apps are the popular ones. We'll know where to invest more. We'll be able to guide IT to tell them, there's a set of activities that your users are working on that may not be as optimal as you could have them. We can guide ways to even guide the IT to help improve this overall experience.So I think this gives you a sense of the relevance and importance of this very powerful analytics platform in the way that we are thinking about delivering not just new value to IT, but also really game-changing experiences inside the Workspace that move very much away from application launch and much more to a guided work experience platform for guided work.Before concluding, I wanted to talk a little bit about ecosystems and our role in the ecosystems that exist in the IT landscape today. We started out by talking -- by hearing from Brad talk about our relationship to Microsoft. And in fact it's a very comprehensive picture of our participation in that overall Microsoft ecosystem, whether it's running our workloads on Azure, building together capabilities of Citrix Cloud integrations with Windows Virtual Desktop, our integration with OneDrive, the Office applications integrated into our Workspace experience or in fact our shared investments in device management, an end-to-end comprehensive picture of our sort of relationship and engagement model with Microsoft.It turns out though that we have other ecosystems, where that picture is just as comprehensive. And in fact with Google, we have the same relationship on Google Cloud, their G drive integration, their Google apps, and in fact that same device management posture for the devices in their environment. If only life were simpler enough for our customers that they could choose one of these ecosystems and run their business, the reality is that most of our customers for a variety of reasons end up choosing both of those ecosystems and then having to deal with the places where they're not identical. It just not bodes through ecosystems, it turns out that there are other key ecosystems that we see in the landscape here that make this world a little more complex for users, and in fact prevent them from picking a single vendor strategy that meets the needs of all of their users. And ultimately, I think this is where the power of the investments that we're making at Citrix in our Workspace and in our underpinning networking really provide that integration platform for all of these ecosystems and applications that exist in your landscape.Take a moment to look at this slide and look at the applications that are on this, and try to determine how many of them would have been on this slide five years ago. Or how many of them will be on this slide in five years' time or will have been replaced by something else. The application landscape is one of the most dynamic inside an enterprise organization. And having a partner that understands how to absorb new applications into the platform, deliver them in a consistent way with the existing applications you have, marry the mainframe from the 60s to the modern SaaS applications that you've just consumed, deliver that in a consistent experience across all devices, across all your networks for all your users that really is the mission and vision of Citrix and the Citrix Workspace.So when I think about bringing together all of our technologies, clearly the Workspace is the prominent user experience that everybody sees. And that really is the embodiment of the strategy of the company. It is underpinned in a very critical way by our investments in networking that really help provide the security, the performance, the visibility, and frankly, the confidence that IT needs to deliver that great Workspace experience.And then the insight that we get from analytics drives not only the IT experience to evolve and deliver that in a better way, but over time it will also drive the user experience inside the Workspace leveraging our visibility and understanding of the vast set of information and data that we have in our customer deployments.So with that, I want to thank you and I would like to invite to stage our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Schmitz. -- Thank you. So good almost afternoon everybody. I'd just like to give you a little bit of context for the role that I'm playing. As David mentioned, I've been with Citrix now for about three years and in this extended capacity for just a couple of months. I think there's a few items around my background that makes this fairly relevant to what it is that we're doing as a company in order to build on what PJ and Dave have already gone through.So I've started in the early 2000 with Ariba, and I was fortunate to go through several of the transformations that helped build that company into what it ultimately became. The first was around extending from a single product into a suite of applications and the solutions for our customers to consume. The second, obviously had to do with the movement of those from an on-premise business and a perpetual model into the subscription business that ultimately led to the acquisition of Ariba by SAP.In SAP, I had the good fortune of also spending a little bit of time helping drive the operation for building the subscription business into what was a very healthy and long-standing perpetual business. So, helping SAP through that motion of expanding their customers who were very heavily perpetual and maintenance based into consuming and driving subscription services.So today, I want to talk a lot about that. How we're actually transforming the Citrix business to help our customers realize the value that PJ just described. What are we doing internally to help build the cadence in operational performance to ensure that we're ready for our customers to move to the cloud. So, I'll talk about a few of our key internal focus areas, the opportunity for our customer base, I think David mentioned, we have an extremely loyal and powerful customer base. We need to extend that customer base to bring them into these new capabilities, so they can obviously grow with us as we expand.I want to talk a little bit about the benefits that our customers are receiving as well as the expansion opportunity for us as a business. So, to focus a little bit on what it is that we're focused on as a company, number one is our go-to market. This transformation started back in 2017 and we stand now today with internal processes in the sales force that has been enabled, trained and understands what it is we need to do to deliver subscription to our customers. Now, the sales force is only one element of our go-to-market motion.The second is around our channel. Our channel has also had to grow from their previous reseller type relationships into one of our ecosystems such that our channel partners are not only helping us position these solutions with our customers, but also helping our customers extend those capabilities and continue to drive them forward. So, we spent a lot of time making sure that both the channel and our sales force are working together. And as we focus on what's next for the channel, there's only two strategic areas in 2020 that we want to make sure it's firing on all cylinders. The first is about our systems' integrators.The SIs have a tremendous opportunity through this platform of digital transformation to work with our customers, to take their applications, to take their infrastructure, and begin to move and migrate it to the Citrix Cloud. Once that's done, the work is not over. They have a tremendous opportunity to continue to grow all that application landscape and move those to the cloud, while using Citrix as the front-end to really simplify the experience for those customers.Our platinum providers as well our platinum partners are specialists in Citrix. They have long-standing relationships with our customer base and we believe they'll be able to make a significant improvement in helping us take what has not traditionally been our focus to date, which is the installed base migration to the cloud, we've really been focused on selling new licenses to our existing customers and new customers as well, but really helping pull that installed base over into the Citrix Cloud and subscription world.And next is around customer success. As we move forward in our subscription transformation, we know that customers are no longer making one-time buys and going off in their devices to run. We're playing an integral part and actually running and executing those platforms on their behalf. In order for us to form a more strategic relationship with those customers, which is actually very important to emotion around expanding as that customer grows, we do invest in resources that are helping customers understand the change from just virtualization they've been doing for a long time to many of these expanded services that I think David and PJ have both touched on. So we're making a significant investment to really get in front of our customers, understand what they're doing, understand the value that they need to do in order to get the employees engaged, to get the solutions adopted and continue to grow their Citrix footprint.And then lastly, a key area of our focus is around pricing. We want to make sure that we're selling customers, what it is they need and leaving on a table room for incremental expansion. We want to sell them a platform. We want them to use and adopt that platform and as we see additional use cases that can help that customer grow, we want to make sure they're selling them that incremental capability as an add-on service, such as our overall footprint can begin to grow quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter.Moving on, I want to talk a little bit about what David mentioned earlier, which is our installed base. As you can see from this slide, we really are very diverse in terms of where our customers sit. This has a couple of pretty positive advantages. The first, really isolate some of the risk in any of these sectors having interesting economic event, it allows us to really broaden be quite diverse in terms of the used cases that we see with our customers who are driving this technology into execution.Our teams were able to look at each one of the customers that operate in these different sectors and actually build on those use cases, and through that customer success vehicle really go out and help customers adopt new use cases. When customers adopt new use cases, we see seat expansion, because we know that we can touch incremental users within the installed base.If we look at another view of our customer base, we can see that seat penetration is averaging about 30%. That's a tremendous opportunity for us to go into our customers who are already getting lots of benefits primarily from our virtualization services and extending well beyond virtualization. So our virtualization is excellent because it continues to grow. It's a growing market. Citrix has the ability and we're actually growing beyond what the market is doing today. We have the ability to add these incremental services on to that virtualization base and continue to grow those seats.Now in areas where we're even more heavily penetrated areas like healthcare, we still have plenty of opportunities. So a 50% penetration, we can still do lots of things. And a customer example here that I was involved in just a quarter ago was Springfield Clinics. They have been using electronic medical records to virtualize those and their physicians were using them. They had a CIO move out and their CIO -- or their CEO was looking to create a digital platform transformation and they relied on Citrix to do it.So not only did we expand the Workspace, give the customer much more capability than they had prior, we're actually able to extend that to every single employee within Springfield Clinics and go wall-to-wall, bringing the capabilities of Workspace for even those users that didn't necessarily rely on virtualization.In terms of increasing our average transaction size, these seat expansion cases are doing exactly that. So as we go into customers and sell the power of the workspace, we're seeing those customers actually expand the users that are now leveraging the Citrix platform. This is driving a 20% increase in average deal size from what we've seen over 2016.Workspace is helping drive this expansion and the added products around analytics, files, mobility provides easy growth opportunities for us on top of the growth platform. Traditional users also are gaining significant benefits. Those users who may have been using virtualized apps or desktops are constantly beginning incremental capability from the product organization that is increasing the value of the applications that they're using. And this has afforded us not only the opportunity to increase the average transaction size, but also in our largest transactions we've seen 30% growth in million-dollar transactions.Now the chart that you're looking at now is actually done in average contracts, our average annual contract dollars meaning that we're selling three and five-year transactions and as Arlen will explain a little bit later this is having a significant positive benefit in our unbilled bookings that you see -- that you don't necessarily only focus on when you look at our total growth.Now customers wouldn't be doing all of these things, if there wasn't significant value in it for them. And it's not the value that we just market or that we just show on slides, customers actually have to realize this. And if you look at the move from on-premise into the cloud, we're delivering on the first thing, which is to lower the total cost of running their Citrix environments. So by moving from an on-premise environment into the cloud, we're seeing over 70% reduction in cost.The employee experience we've heard so much about today, those employees that are actually making choices on where they're going to work we're seeing an 88% improvement in their engagements, driving productivity even higher. And I think David mentioned that there is over 500 applications that many of our customers are actually using and have available to their customers, and roughly 34 of those applications are being touched by any individual user. There is a significant loss of time in figuring out which application you use and win. The Workspace is helping deliver those applications to the employee at the right time, helping increase the overall productivity and obviously driving a significant positive return for those customers who are moving to Citrix Cloud.But I'd like to just share one customer story here from EBSCO that may put this into a little bit more context.[Video Presentation] So one of the really interesting things about this particular customer story is they share something that many of our customers we know are going through, that is a very complex multi-hybrid cloud universe by which they are using multiple cloud providers to actually run and digitize their business, but they're using Citrix now to place that in front of them. And what I'd like to show now is really the bookings profile from this customer. So, they've been a longtime customer, very good and loyal customer. You can see that they made consistent purchases over the last 10 years.Workspace helped us engage with this customer on a more strategic level. This allowed us to make a massive transaction that will actually partner with EBSCO to help them over the course of their future. And this one-time transaction doesn't necessarily mean this is the end of their subscription growth. They have not bought everything. So if we go back into seat penetration, we have the opportunity to continue to grow. They mentioned that they were a conglomerate of over 40 companies as they acquire additional companies, it allows us to go sell those incremental users.At the same time, we've simplified their ability to deliver applications to everyone of these companies by using Citrix Workspace. Now this is a bookings chart, but the most important thing to also understand here is that we've doubled the revenue on an annualized basis that this customer will deliver us -- to us versus the business as usual when they're merely buying as a tactical provider. And this expansion motion is really at the key to our subscription business.You can see there's a little bit of curvature to the blue line, which represents new landed accounts. This is primarily driven by our seasonality. But, on the green line, which represents the expansion, you'll see that it begins to be very smooth up into the right. But this is because as we land a customer account and we're able to display and deploy the capabilities, there's very rapid adoption of the solution. As this solution gets adopted, we continue to see customers expand on an as-needed basis, not necessarily driven by the original seasonality. And this expansion is a true indicator of the health of our customers that are actually driving within our Citrix Cloud. And expansion is also driving multi-product solutions.So, as we go out and drive into our customers, again they don't necessarily own all of our 12 services that are in our Cloud. If they are a customer, who is only a virtualization customer, we're able to carve out the capabilities that they need and sell those incremental capabilities to their users through the Citrix Cloud platform. This is really leading the way to allow us to go into a multi-product solution for each one of those customers.A great example here is Safelite. Safelite is a company that actually fixes broken windshields in automobiles. They have a tremendously large call center, whereby people are calling to get their windshields replaced. They then deploy a car out to the actual site, so they can fix their windshield on site. Prior to Citrix, their call center did in fact run on Citrix. But with Workspace, we're able to create the mobile experience for those vehicles that have been gone out and done the work to replace the windshield and bring everyone together into a single environment.We then extended actually further with Safelite back into their insurance transaction processing group, which allowed them to then take the windshield that had been replaced, and go further and extend the benefits to their insurance company. So, to further expand on this, let's look at one more customer example that shows what a deep relationship can do for us to expand that solution and user community.[Video Presentation] So, I think this story represents a couple of really great use cases that put Citrix Workspace at the forefront of what we're capable of delivering. They talked about mergers and acquisitions and using Citrix really as the front-end to simplify the end-user experience for either company that is part of Worldpay, such that the end-user's experience is relatively simple while the back-end IT organization maybe relatively complicated as they figure out how to merge and integrate those systems together.The second is this story really articulates how there's significant value beyond just virtualization and that the Workspace itself engages the employees and gives them a significant benefit when they come to work each day. They're truly using this to transform the way that they operate and ensure that their user experience is successful.Now similar to EBSCO, you'll notice that the bookings opportunity for this customer was relatively flat over the first three years of our experience. Upon delivering the Workspace solution to them, we were able to sell them a much larger commitment over a three-year period. And again, in this particular case, we've driven the recognized revenue on an annualized basis well over 200% from where it was in the prior year. And these cases really show a very strong ongoing relationship with our customer and that's leading us to improve renewal rates as a company overall. So, we've spent a lot of time making sure that with our customers that are going to stay on-premise that we're providing them significant value.So, we've done a couple of things. We've not only provided increased services with our standard support, but we're also building premium support options that range between 10% and 25% more on an annualized basis to give customers the same hands-on strategic relationship and experience that we're providing for our cloud customers. And over time, we'll begin to see the installed base reduce. As we accelerate our transition motion, which has not necessarily been the primary motion for our sales force and we actually go target existing customers begin to move them to our Citrix Cloud, we should see an acceleration that will decrease the number of total users in the on-premises world, but obviously increase in our cloud environments. As we do that, I need to double down on what we're doing from a customer success perspective.I mentioned this earlier that the key is actually enabling our customers to move to the cloud. Once they do that, we are spending a significant amount of time with those customers to ensure that they actively adopt the solution. Active adoption means that we not only secure that customer for the long-term, but we also see a significant opportunity to continue to sell them incremental value-based services and expand the overall seat licenses that they're using, such that from a renewal perspective, we actually end up not in a transaction event at the end of their contract, but instead in a discussion about how they will accelerate and expand their current user community.So with that, I'd like to invite Arlen Shenkman, our CFO, to come to finish the story. -- Thank you. For those of you who I haven't met, I'm Arlen Shenkman. I was with SAP for 15 years. I spent time as the CFO of North America as well as running corporate development and global partnerships. I was responsible for driving the inorganic parts of SAP's cloud transition, which included ensuring we had the right partnerships, relationships and investments in place to scale the business. When I was the CFO of North America, we were able to double our cloud revenue to over $2 billion.I'm excited to be joining Citrix at this stage in its journey to the cloud. As you heard from us today, we're focused on execution. We have work to do and like any transition to the cloud, there are always going to be periods that are marked by changes to our business model and changes to our financial performance. But that said, as many of you know, what emerges from the other side is often a faster-growing and ultimately more profitable company and one that adds significantly more value in its sustainable business.So why don't we flip to the third quarter? As you know, we released our numbers this morning. The headline numbers were strong relative to our guidance and consensus for revenue, margins and earnings, both subscription and SaaS revenue accelerated to 43% year-over-year growth. And importantly, we continued to see strong growth in our ARR with subscription up 40% and SaaS up 52%. We believe ARR is a key metric for measuring our transition and I'll talk about this more as we go. We did see a slight tick downward in our total subscription mix of product. This was entirely attributable to the improvement in our SSP business. Overall, we're pleased with our third quarter results.I want to remind you that Citrix has come a long way. The business has been executing on a significant transition for the past three years. Our mix of subscription, as a percentage of total product bookings, is 58% this year, which is more than four times where we were three years ago. Workspace is shifting even faster, hitting a 75% mix in the third quarter. Subscription is now more than 20% of our total revenue and we are seeing significant growth in ARR as I mentioned. As a result of the changes in the business model over the last three years, we're at a point where we see 2020 as a year in which we accelerate our revenue growth and hit an inflection point in our business transition.As we progress through the subscription transition, we know it's important to show you where we see the arc of the transition and how this transition will impact our financials. I want to highlight you where we are today and where you can expect us to continue going. We expect 2019 to be the bottom for a year-over-year revenue growth. We expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2020. We expect 2020 to be the bottom in terms of operating margins with margins beginning to accelerate in 2021 and really hitting stride in '22.The key driver for our operating margin guidance is the impact of gross margins as we scale our SaaS business and I'll drill into this in a moment. We have ranges here for 2022 through 2024 and we will finalize our 2020 guidance with our 2019 year-end results in January. Looking ahead, we expect to phase out new perpetual licensing for Workspace over the course of 2020, while providing customers the new on-premise licenses, a term subscription license.Overall, as you can see, our subscription acceleration will increase the long-term intrinsic value of the business by driving growth on the topline with operating leverage and scale falling to the bottom.Let's turn to gross margins. Gross margins are a significant lever in the model and the main driver of our 2020 operating margins. We thought it would be helpful for you to get a better sense as to how we're thinking about this, particularly since we have a couple of dynamics that affect our gross margins.First, we have an increasing mix of SaaS, which is a headwind to gross margins. However, as we continue to scale, we see those margins beginning to pick up. On the other hand, the networking business, our pooled subscription offering is sold with an appliance, making networking margins relatively constant over time. Longer term, we believe we have an opportunity to improve our gross margins as we scale the overall business.As you saw in the earlier video of Microsoft, our relevance in enterprises continues as the IT landscape becomes ever more complex. Citrix remains the undisputed market leader in virtualization, which is a growing market. Our heritage in virtualization is yielding an enviable footprint across a wide array of large enterprises.There is no doubt that this diversified footprint is a core reason behind the resilience of the business across economic cycles. This also provides us with an incredible opportunity to expand within our customer base as we layer in new features and functionality. Citrix has a solid foundation to increase our footprint with our existing customer base.Workspace will continue to be a stable driver of growth for Citrix. With the third quarter reported Workspace revenue, we are confident that mid-to-high single-digit growth is the right way to think about annual Workspace growth with acceleration in the outer years. As you saw from our third quarter, new product bookings in the Workspace grew double-digits and Workspace is now 75% subscription for new bookings. Citrix is uniquely positioned to tap into the potential of our customer base, while also solving significant productivity and security pain points for our customers.As our Workspace becomes more of a platform, it will be easier for us to layer over incremental revenue streams for customers segmenting users with technologies like VDI, Desktop-as-a-Service, analytics and more. Over the course -- of course, the Workspace is a major driver for our subscription growth and will continue to represent a significant part of our journey to the cloud. Yet, our overall transition to the cloud is accelerating as measured by SaaS bookings, revenue and paid subscribers.It's worth noting that there are considerable differences in the rate and pace of the migration of our Workspace business relative to our networking business. While both businesses are transitioning, Workspace subscription bookings were 75% of total Workspace product bookings, whereas network subscription bookings were 29% of total network product bookings this quarter. We expect to exit this year with 60% to 65% of new product bookings from subscriptions. And with the Workspace already at 75% and increasing, we expect the headwinds to revenue growth to lessen over the next year.Our subscription revenue continues to grow. We ended last year at $455 million of subscription revenue. This growth represents a three-year compound average rate of 33% and the SaaS portion of our subscription revenue continues to grow, ending last year at 60% of overall subscription revenue. The primary driver of our subscription revenue growth has been the consistent strength we've seen in our SaaS. Q3 subscription revenue grew 43% year-over-year. SaaS revenue as of the end of the third quarter represented 63% of our subscription revenue.Let me drill down a little deeper into our SaaS revenue growth. To date, SaaS growth has been largely driven by selling new seats to new customers as well as selling new seats to existing customers. In other words, our SaaS growth has not been driven by the migration of existing customers. The other point worth noting is that we're seeing very strong growth from our SaaS Workspace.The Workspace is growing considerably faster than our overall SaaS revenue, which includes the more modestly growing content collaboration offering. We expect the concentration of Workspace in SaaS to continue to increase. In 2017, the Workspace represented less than 20% of our total SaaS revenue. Today, exiting Q3 that number has climbed to over 50%, and is by far the fastest-growing portion of our portfolio.I want to spend a few minutes discussing the economics of our subscription transition. It's important to note that we are really going through two transitions, one in the Workspace business, and the other in networking. We are driving our business transactions and our long-range plan to these assumptions on pricing economics for new subscription deals.Let's look first at the pricing economics of a new Workspace deal. For Workspace, we believe, on average our breakeven point for a subscription transaction versus a perpetual transaction will be 2.7 years. On the networking side, the economics are different for a new customer. Here it's gone to 3.5 years into the subscription transaction we hit the breakeven point versus the perpetual transaction. The key is, in both scenarios, we exit with substantially higher revenue.Let's shift from the business economics of the subscription model to how this transaction is impacting our financial statements. Let's compare a three-year perpetual transaction with a three-year SaaS transaction and see how they impact our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow.Let's start with the cash flow impact, which is reflected by the blue bars. In the perpetual license model, Citrix has historically billed upfront for the entire value of the contract versus a SaaS transaction, which is billed annually over the life of the transaction.Now moving to the balance sheet. Short-term and long-term deferred are represented in the orange and red bars in the perpetual model. It's important to point out, that in the SaaS model, unbilled or pink bars are created, and these represent the value of the booking that has not been billed. Note that no long-term deferred or red bar is created in the SaaS transaction.Finally, from a revenue recognition perspective, the green bars are very different in the model. As you see, the short-term deferred rolls off the balance sheet and revenue was recognized. As the examples show, the impact of our bookings coming from subscription will cause total deferred to continue to decelerate, and unbilled subscription to grow.So now that we've seen the economics and an example of how the model impacts our financial statements, how should you think about measuring our business? One metric we've talked about is future committed revenue. It's important to understand that in perpetual deals, we were almost always successful in billing upfront for the entire value of the contract including initial maintenance, which could be purchased for up to five years at the time of the initial transaction.We benefited on the face of our financial statements from the short-term and the long-term deferred revenue reflected in the upfront billings of these contracts. Today, we are generally writing three-year SaaS contracts, billed annually which are not shown on our balance sheet. While it is useful to look at future committed revenue, it's important to note, this is impacted by contract duration. This is why we believe ARR is a more accurate measure of the success of our transition.The bookings mix shift and the deferred revenue recognition means subscription revenue is expected to cross 30% of total revenue next year. We expect more than half of our revenue to be subscription by 2022, and this will approach 75% of total revenue in 2024. We expect our product bookings after '24 to be subscription.As we progress through this transition, we know it's important to help you by anchoring around an important metric like free cash flow per share. Let's start with an important takeaway here. We're reconfirming our commitment to achieve $10 per share of free cash flow in 2022. We wanted to share with you the correlation we expect to see between the mix of subscription revenue and free cash flow per share.We believe the accelerated transition to subscription, jump-started by the phasing out of new perpetual licensing over the course of 2020 will allow us to achieve our 2022 targets. We will exit the transition with stronger revenue and free cash flow generation. We believe ARR is perhaps the single most useful metric to measure our performance in any given period. It normalizes the duration and it's forward looking. I want to point out that not everyone defines ARR in the same way. Our definition of ARR is a bottom-up metric, built from actual customer contract data, which we believe is a great forward-looking metric. ARR captures how well we serve new subscriptions as well as how successful we were in renewing existing subscriptions, while removing the impacts of duration and accounting, and the impact of other accounting measures.There are three components of subscription ARR, which are consistent with the components of our subscription revenue, SaaS, subscription term licenses and transaction-related activity or what we refer to as Citrix service providers. As you can see, we are seeing very consistent, robust growth in subscription ARR. And our growth is faster, when you look at SaaS ARR. We believe ARR is the most important metric in measuring our success in this business model transition.We want to give you a view as to how we see the business evolving over the next several years through the course of the subscription transition and how we envision the business post-transition. Subscription revenue, the phasing out of new perpetual Workspace licenses in 2020 will drive an acceleration of our subscription mix -- of our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue. We see this as a 50% to 60% mix in 2022 and 65% to 75% in '24, exceeding 90% post-transaction. We also see subscription bookings being in the 85% to 90% range after 2022.In revenue growth, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue growth from the bottom we hit this year to a moderate increase next year of 3% to 4%, accelerating to north of 10% per year after 2024.On operating margin, we expect 2020 to represent the low point of our margin profile with a long-term margin acceleration between 34% and 35% after 2024. As you can see, we expect what emerges on the other side to be a more predictable, faster growing and ultimately more valuable and sustainable business for us.We remain vigilant in focusing on deploying capital to drive long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We think of capital allocation in three primary categories, our dividend, returning capital with a target of 75% of free cash flow in the form of share repurchases; historically, we've done this in the form of regular programmatic purchases as well as accelerated share repurchases from time to time, and M&A, when it adds value to both our business and our portfolio. And as you will see, this has resulted in significant capital being returned to our shareholders. We've returned more than $5.5 billion of capital to our shareholders over the last five years and will continue to do so. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Our capital return programs have resulted in a significant decline in our shares outstanding. And as you saw in the third quarter with our announcement, our Board has increased our share buyback authorization to $1 billion.So in summary, we want to leave you here with three key takeaways. The first is that 2019 was a revenue low point. And in 2020, we expect to hit an inflection point and our revenue growth will accelerate. ARR and subscription mix are the key metrics we will use to measure our success and are the best indicators of where we are in our business model transition. We remain committed to $10 of free cash flow per share in 2022 and we will continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders.Thank you for your time. Let's take a break, grab lunch, and we can answer some questions. -- And start open Q&A here. Just -- we'll kind of make it interactive and there'll be handheld microphones that are moving around for anyone who has questions just raise your hand, we'll bring a microphone to you. We're going to do the mic just because we've got -- we're webcasting as well. We want to make sure that everybody online can hear the question at the same time. And I think it looks like we have about 30 to 45 minutes. So with that, why don't we just jump right in. -- Thank you for hosting us today. It was a really excellent presentation, a lot of detail and we really appreciate that. I had two questions on the same topic which is, sort of, long-term growth how to assess it and how to think about it over time? In terms of just assessing the growth of the business, I understand subscription ARR does all the right normalizations, I understand that. But assume like a big part of the story is actually moving the maintenance base to subscription over time. And so, I was wondering if we shouldn't have a view of what that maintenance base ARR looks like today and how that might influence the overall growth rate, if you put those two pieces together what does that growth rate look like? That's the first question.And then on the second piece, if I look at the, sort of, long-term guidance and I look at the impact of the subscription bookings made in the last two quarters, it suggests that you guys are growing in the high single digits today and that is going to continue for a prolonged period of time, which is great sustained growth. What are the drivers that are going to allow you to sustain it, because you're a $3 billion business? So sustaining growth at this scale is typically not many companies can do that. So is it pricing, is it seat expansion, is it the analytics story, what's going to give you that sustained growth over time? Those are my two questions. Thank you very much. -- Sure. Let me take the second question first, if my microphone is on. So if we think about the overall growth rate of the business, you just take a big step back and look at the underlying markets that we're operating in. I mean, the largest one and of course, the largest installed base is around virtualization. And that market is growing in the mid-to-high single-digit range. And so, the opportunity continues to expand.And then I would point you back to those -- that slide that I had at the very beginning of my section where I just called out the fact that our customer base is expanding, we're addressing net new opportunities outside of our core markets that allow us to tap into new sources of budget revenue etc. We're adding new customers. And then as we migrate folks to Citrix Cloud on the new customer side, you looked at Arlen's slides about how that customer lifetime value accretes over a multi-year period of time.And then on the installed base piece, I mean, we didn't talk too much about that today, but that's because we've been intentionally focused on net new versus installed base migration. That will start to pick up. It's been accelerating in the last couple of quarters and it will pick up going forward.The uplift that we see from what a customer is paying today versus where they're going, we've actually been yielding well over our target in the first few quarters. We're not talking about that as much simply because of the scale. And over time, we do expect that that uplift will come closer to our 30% uplift targets, but there's a huge opportunity there. And so as of today, we're well below this 10% threshold of what would have been the installed base a couple of years ago that has migrated. I don't think we're going to break out an additional ARR metric. I think the broader subscription and subset SaaS really brings that all together.But overall, the categories we're participating in are continuing to grow in that mid-to-high singles. And so if I even step back and look at net new product bookings year-to-date across the Workspace and networking in particular, they're growing double digits and that's the best indicator.And the first part of your question, I'm sorry, did I answer that as well? -- You did. -- Okay. -- Thanks for the presentation guys. It's really a lot you gave there. I so appreciate all the color. It's Mohit Gogia from Barclays. My question is for David and also PJ, if you can chime in. So initially, I think, you guys discussed that seat penetration, increasing that level of penetration is sort of like a core growth vector in the coming years obviously. And I was wondering if -- and the platforms are moving from a solution -- set to a platform or other point product set or platform set is sort of like going to allow you to increase that seat penetration.But I'm just wondering many other vendors your competitors, obviously, and many other vendors we cover talk about that platform sell motion, right? So what makes you confident from a customer conversation and from your sort of, like the access -- the data access you have right now with the solutions. What makes you confident that Citrix is uniquely positioned to be able to provide that platform set? -- Yes, let me start there and then PJ can add on. A couple of things make us confident. We've been talking about platform, it's not a new strategy. It's how we've described the business over the last couple of years. And really what that is thinking about virtualization as a component part of the ability to address the needs and users -- the needs of all users across the enterprise. So, it's more about this general purpose and special purpose, is the terminology you probably heard us use over the last few years.What gives us confidence is that for 30 years now, customers have entrusted us to deliver their most mission-critical applications. Those applications of all designs. And within that, those things are relatively transient. I mean, when you hear people use a platform today, most of those are frankly applications. And you look at the most prevalent, most popular apps from five years ago, half of those we don't even use anymore. So they -- our point of view is that we need to provide that level of infrastructure where those can come and go over time.We've got 100 million people right now plus or minus that are using Citrix infrastructure today to be able to connect them from their enterprises and people and do it in a secure managed way. That's -- and in many ways, that's almost a Trojan Horse that allows us to reduce the level of friction to be able to introduce new technologies to that base, but also making it easier for them to consume those at the same time. PJ? -- Yeah, let me just build on that. So I do think that thinking of our existing installed base and the virtualization footprint as a beachhead from which to build out the new set of capabilities is actually critical to us. And it's not just in terms of deployed technology. I think, it's also about our understanding of that market, understanding of applications, understanding of that delivery, and what it really takes to succeed on the dimensions that we talked about, which are actually quite diverse and continuing to expand whether it's networks devices, platforms users, etc. So, I think that's kind of key.And then, I think the second part is, we've taken a very specific and I would say unique perspective with regard to focusing on making the individual successful inside the organization. So, we're not really building a collaboration platform. We're not building something that is a shared experience for everybody. We really are trying to develop a point of view that says, having a tailored experience for the individual is the thing that's going to be a differentiated point of view over time. And that requires you to have a lot of insight about what makes my role in the organization different or special or how I behave relative to other users.And this is where you're correct. Analytics is actually kind of key. We don't think of this as an orchestrated experience built by IT for the users. We think it's a curated experience that they initiate, but then that that evolves over time based on my usage of the system just like all of the sort of modern platforms that we use today in our personal lives. So, I think it's a combination of -- I think leveraging the expertise and footprint we have with virtualization as a starting point, but then having made a set of deep investments, particularly around analytics and insight that I think really drives us in a very different direction to some of the other players in the market. -- Hi. Kirk Materne, Evercore. Thanks for the presentation today. I really enjoyed the platform overview. I think that's really helpful, in terms of where your vision is going. I was just kind of curious maybe David and Mark could take this. Just in terms of getting to that vision with customers and the go-to-market routes you have to have with them, I think are very different than where you were five years, 10 years ago, meaning this is a much more strategic discussion, it's maybe with the business owner, not just the IT part of the business. Where are you in that transition, is the partner side of the equation set up yet, meaning are the Deloittes, the Accenture is going to make you all the platform that helps customers stitch all this together.And then, maybe just one last one for Arlen. Just on the return of capital to shareholders, maybe what's the thought process on not taking the dividend up just to create a little bit maybe a broader investor base that would come in and look at Citrix, not only as a growth vehicle, but also maybe as an income vehicle, just maybe your thought process on that.So, two questions. Thanks. -- I can talk to the go-to-market. So, we started on this journey two years ago, when we started to talking to you about getting to the C-level executive having a more strategic relationship. And we have been transitioning the organization, not only from a capacity standpoint, but from a skill standpoint. And so, we've been on this journey for a while because we've known where we're going. Certain geographies aren't where we want them to be like maybe Indonesia is not -- with 200 million users is now where we want it to be, but our major geographies like Japan, Australia, the UK, those have clearly started to make that transition. And our sales force has complemented that right.With that said, our partner organization we've also been working on and again that is somewhat of a journey, but our partner organization, particularly our best partners have come along with us in a very rapid pace. And we are going to invest significantly on the systems' integrator side because building micro apps around a platform is hugely valuable to them and to us and to our customers. So, we're on that journey, but like you said, it does happen overnight, right.So, Arlen? -- I'm not sure we thought a ton about dividend in terms of our long-range plan and planning for years. So I mean, certainly open to a conversation, if you want to think about it. Honestly, I mean obviously, it's apparent once you have a dividend, it's forever. And so, there is a little flexibility financially. But frankly in terms of this presentation and how we're laying out, where we're taking the business, we didn't spend a lot of time thinking about the dividend. -- Maybe I'll add maybe one comment on the system integrators and on platform, because I think it's important. I think one of the things that we realized when we began exploring this space with customers was the pace at which they would want to go, to build solutions on the Workspace, was going to outpace what we could do, if we decided to build all of the integrations ourselves. And so, that's really the point at which we've basically flipped to thinking more about building as a platform, opening it up, and frankly creating market opportunity for industry specialists, and geographic specialists to go deliver complete Workspace solutions into corners of the market that frankly we couldn't reach any time soon. So, really that's a key part of our strategy is not just building that platform, but engaging with that community.The developer conference that we had, we had 100 attendees. And it was one-third corporate IT developers, who we want to ensure are capable of building solutions inside their own organizations, one-third ISVs who build solutions that are commercial, that we wanted them to build their solution on the Workspace platform, and integrate with us, and one-third global system integrators. So, very much a target for our platform, and I think one of the accelerants for growth, and taking this into some of the broader deployments. -- In the back. -- Hi. Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank way in the back. Maybe this question is for Arlen. Arlen, your stock increasingly trades on cash flow. And so, I'm sensitive to your outlook on that metric. And I'm frankly surprised by the acceleration you're modeling in free cash flow to $7 to $8 a share in 2020. That's way above what I was thinking. And my base assumption at least was that, the weight of this transition would much like it is on margins carry through and weigh on cash flow next year, but that doesn't seem to be the case. And you're suggesting that this year's a trough on free cash flow. And we get a fairly market acceleration next year. So do you mind just unpacking that a little bit and what gives you that confidence? Thanks. -- Yes. So I think -- look, there's a reason there's a range in there. And there are a lot of moving parts around the transition, right. So, we still have a subscription license. We have a SaaS license. We have customers who are continuing to come off of the network business. So there's a lot of moving parts in there. So I mean, I think, that that's one piece of it. We remain confident that as we go through the transition, those parts will continue to add value. And then as we accelerate into that subscription transition, the cash will become much more significant. So in the short-term, I think, there's a range in there because of that. And in the long-term, we feel confident we can get to the target of $10 in 2022 because of the ultimate transition. And this year, there's a little more room in that kind of swim lane, but we remain confident we can get there. -- Karl, let me just address that specifically. And so, one of the things that Arlen talked about in his presentation was, we ripped the band-aid off about three months ago to really drive a more rapid transition of -- especially the Workspace business and you saw that coming out of this quarter at 75% of the mix.And we've been trying to thread the needle for far too long on that and really holding back the pace of the transition. And we are actively going to migrate that to 100% of that business, plus or minus next year. So, accelerating the transition allows us to get through that trough much, much faster than the amount of cash that is effectively coming into the P&L versus being deployed hits that equilibrium point and starts to drive the acceleration going forward with the acceleration of revenue growth, etc. -- Got it. Thanks Arlen. -- Hi. Over here. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. And again, thanks for the presentation. It was very helpful, a lot of details. Clearly, you've made a great progress on Workspace, kind of driving down to SaaS and it's clearly translating and having a big impact -- positive impact now finally on your numbers.My question is on the networking side of the equation, where you're far earlier in your transition there, help me compare and contrast it, how I should think about your networking transition going forward versus Workspace? Where are you in the portfolio in getting that transition accelerated from this point going forward, that's going to have to carry a little bit more of the mix change going forward?And is there also sort of like a hard break-off that can happen over there in the same way that you intend to terminate perpetual licensing on the Workspace, could that happen on the networking side as well? -- PJ, why don't you about talk about -- remind everybody where we are from a product standpoint and I'll come back and talk about the licensing side? -- So, I think you're correct that we are early -- and not just we're earlier, I'd say the market is earlier in the transition to basically that software-defined cloud-based networking for enterprise customers. I think you really have to think about what's been happening with cloud in sort of two camps, one is either net new applications that have gotten built on cloud platforms are new entrants into the cloud platform market, but for existing enterprise customers and their largest state of applications, that isn't much earlier stage with regard to figuring out how to migrate.And frankly, that's the one where we participate the most, because it is really customers trying to protect the deep investments they've had in the delivery of those applications as they bring them into the cloud. So, from a road map perspective, I would say we're well on our way to delivering the capabilities. And we actually have customers, who in Q3 were further down my waterfall model, basically cloud-native networking customers, who have bet exclusively on our Citrix networking solution. But they are, I would say, leading indicators of that transition. It is much earlier in stage. And so, that's I think where we are from a product point of view.The part I feel good about is given that we have strong software assets that are highly deployable across all the form factors you need, whether it's appliance or it's a container or it's a virtual instance, or in fact bare metal, which we are now doing with some of the cloud platform partners. We believe that we can deploy the type of networking you need as you -- as the customers get there. They're just not there yet. And I think that's partly where we are.I'll make one comment before I turn it over to David on the licensing, just my perspective, which is, given that there's a hardware component, I think it's going to be -- the transition to full subscription is going to have a different pace based on that. And that hardware business, as we talked about in a hybrid world, actually had some endurance. So that's still something we have to keep in mind. -- Yes. I was going to reiterate that point as well. I mean, it's -- the underlying market is going to change at a much different rate and pace. So if you look at our disclosures, we've moved about 30% of new bookings toward subscription where we were roughly 10% or so a year ago. So it's moved up pretty quickly. I think net new product bookings last quarter, for example, grew mid-single digits, somewhere in that range, which is probably in line with the overall market growth for that part of networking. But over time, it's going to look more and more like software and subscription. And so, that is our expectation.So how quickly we can get it above 50% is still a bit of an open question. That's one that is -- it's harder for us to force, just given the hardware components and other things. And one of the reasons why we continue to pivot those businesses a little bit away from being an ADC solution much more toward Workspace security, Workspace delivery and optimization across really where people are going versus just changing the architecture of where they've been. So that's probably the way I would infer that out. -- And we put the commercials in place to make that very attractive for our customers, right, so -- -- Mark Moerdler, Bernstein Research. I want to thank you very much for giving all the data. That was a difficult process, explaining, building out all the data and everything else. And I think there's a lot here that can help people really understand what's happening in the transition and the fact that you're ripping the band-aid off on the process.Two questions if you don't mind. The first is, Arlen, I would agree with you that ARR is the key metric people need to look at. One of the questions we do get from clients is the question relating to deferred and the other metrics that people have historically looked. And that when you have an Adobe style move from license-only to cloud, you get this big lift in deferred. Can you give us a little color on why that's lagging a little bit in the process of how it's not growing or growing as fast as some people might expect?And then, there's another quick question beyond that. Where are you at this point in maintenance transition on Workspace? Is it 10% of the maintenance has started to move? Is it a smaller number? Any sense of where you are I think will help people realize how much still is ahead of you? Thank you. -- Let me take the deferred and then I'll hand it over to Mark on the maintenance. On the deferred, so it's this piece of the business which is the pre-billing on the deferred. So, it's the headwind in the deferred. And so what -- essentially, because of those five-year contracts, because there's so much was pre-billed, because there's a history of that, then that builds up a significant amount of current and long-term deferred. And so, it's that headwind in the business that we're trying to eliminate so that we can come through this.And that's really what's driving the change. And I totally get that it's different than Adobe and Autodesk and everyone else, because very few people have the ability. Most people, if they could prepay maintenance for five years, if you could get that cash in the door, you do it any day. It's just not a market practice anymore and we just have people continuing to do it, which is causing this kind of a lot of the two, which is confusing the story. -- That helps. -- Yes. Let me put a fine point on that because I think it's an important one. So, just to reiterate that, I mean customers historically not only have purchased a perpetual license, but on average, a couple of years of initial maintenance. And two-thirds of those would have paid for the entire thing upfront. Now, we're moving the entire business model to annual billings. That's why the growth in unbilled revenue has just accelerated so rapidly at the expense of deferred revenue. So, we talk about future committed revenue is kind of the combination of those $2 billion plus right now growing about 13% year-on-year. And those are -- that's really the one place that plus the impact on cash flows obviously in the short term are the areas that you see this pronounced change. -- Then to answer your first question, I make around the installed base, we're somewhere between 7% and 8% of the maintenance base has begun to transition. Part of that though if you go back to the go-to-market portion of my presentation, it's because we've really enabled the sales force and directed their incentives toward new business. Over the course of 2020, we'll be opening that up such that the acceleration of the transition, the maintenance base should transition at an accelerated pace to where you've seen it to date. -- Next questions. -- Mark Schilsky, UBS O'Connor. Arlen, I think you said earlier that you are going to end perpetual licensing next year. When is that going to happen? Or are you going to put out an announcement to your customers sometime before then get them ready for that? -- So, we're in a process now of ensuring that we have the right internal communications, which we've started to cascade. We're obviously working on our compensation plans to drive behavior. We're working with our partners to drive behavior. We're not going to give an exact date. I can tell you that, we're obviously incentivized to make it happen as early as we can from a financial standpoint. We'll obviously be considerate of what's happening in the channel and the marketplace.And to answer your question, we've already started a cascade. We've already started to communicate and we're already -- we already have plans around how we will help accelerate that, but we're not going to give a hard date. -- And just to be very clear on that point, we are not eliminating on-premise deployments. I think everyone knows that a lot of our customers are on a long cloud journey. And so, there is plenty of choice in terms of how they consume our products on-premise. Lot of those will probably utilize a term-based subscription as we go forward and we'll do the right thing for customers. But when we're talking specifically about the financial model, this is the acceleration that we started in the last two quarters, three quarters, and we want to drive that through next year. -- Wanted to ask a little bit about -- Heather Bellini at Goldman Sachs. ARR is obviously an important metric as you guys all cited. I'm wondering if you've given any thought to changing what you guide to and actually start maybe guiding to ARR as a metric that people can benchmark you off of?And then secondarily, we do get asked this all the time, Dan and I were just talking about this. You get questions from people where again going back to the deferred question, everyone understands they pay you less upfront and obviously that impacts long-term deferreds versus people who are paying you upfront before. But from a short-term billings perspective, I think that's one area if you could flush out a little bit more about the typical contract value or the dollars that you're taking in. I know you did that slide, but I'm just thinking about it from a short-term deferred perspective, so people can put that into perspective, when they're thinking about that and how it impacts cash flow? Thank you. -- I'll refer to you on the value of the contracts. I mean on the ARR guidance, look, it's a new metric for us. We're obviously -- we started it two quarters ago. It doesn't mean we wouldn't provide guidance, I don't think we have an intent right now. As you get more comfortable with it, we'll think about that. But right now, it's brand new metric for us and we'll continue to report it and we'll consider that. On the pricing piece, I'll give that to you. -- Well, I'll only add to his comment. As we go into next year, our incentives will line up with that whole thinking as well. So, as we go to our sales force, it will line up specifically where he is at today. -- And then, just on deferred, it's going to be a combination of long and short-term deferred will be impacted by seasonality, contract, what we're billing upfront, how much is consumption base that we're billing on a monthly basis, all those factors play in. And that's why we're going to continue to give all the pieces, so that you can see all of them together in the context of future committed revenue. -- Next question. Anymore questions?All right. It looks like we've actually reached the end of question. So, with that, let me just say on behalf of Citrix and all of us up here, a huge thank you for everyone for participating here today. I appreciate you being here in person and appreciate everyone who is joining us online. I think we're at a really interesting inflection point in the Company's history right now and we're very much focused on driving this transition over the next couple of years. Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.I would now like to introduce Ms. Tsuchiguchi, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. -- Thank you, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's second quarter and fiscal year 2019 . Participating on the call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jessica Soisson, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Please note that we have posted our second quarter earnings letter to our Investor Relations website.I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's earning letter and in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on our Investor Relations website.Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of our earnings letter found on the Investor Relations page of our website.Now, I'd like to turn it over to David, our President and Chief Executive Officer. David? -- Thanks, Traci, and good afternoon. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. I hope everybody had an opportunity to review the earnings letter that we posted to our IR site similar to last quarter. I'm going to keep my opening remarks really brief, so we can jump right into Q&A, but I thought it'd be important to provide a little bit of context on the business overall.So I'd say, all-in, I'm really happy with our performance in the second quarter. Demand across our products and our geos was remarkably consistent throughout the quarter. The only real difference was mix. We clearly underestimated the demand for subscription licensing in the quarter. The subscription transition for new licensing is really happening faster than we'd forecasted across both of our major businesses, which is strategically where we're driving the Company.We expected this accelerated pace to really continue for the full year. The obvious consequence here of the faster shift is that revenue, margins, earnings and cash flow are going to be impacted in the short-term with the offset represented in unbilled and deferred revenue in particular. Just to be really clear here, so the mix shift explains the entire difference between our reported second quarter results and our guidance.We had guided a midpoint mix of about 52% and the actual was 62%. Within this result, we also saw record subscription booking levels in both of our businesses. The Workspace product mix jumped up to 71% from 58% a year ago, while Networking moved from 11% last year up to 35% in Q2. And I can talk much more about the demand drivers once we get into Q&A.It's important to point out again that for all of our financial statements are going to be impacted by the business transition, including cash flow because we typically bill annually for subscription contracts rather than everything upfront like we typically do in perpetual license deal. So less cash is collected in the current period, more cash is going to be collected in future periods.So in other words, the strength that we're seeing in subscription bookings serve to improve our predictability and certainly accelerate our growth in future period. That's the primary reason why we've introduced future committed revenue as one of our new metrics. Hopefully, you saw that that balance is now up to $2.2 billion. It's up $290 million or 15% from last year. It's really the easiest way to think about the transition.But to make the full year transition math really simple for everybody, let me just give you a quick rule of thumb. That is for every 1 percentage point change in mix, it's equal to roughly $10 million to $12 million in recognized revenue for a full year basis. This offset to the decrease in recognized revenue in the period is generally the corresponding increase to unbilled or deferred revenue. So that when you look at our full year guidance, we now expect a subscription mix of new product bookings of at least 60% to 65% as compared to 50%, 55% earlier. This is a change from our prior guidance to our current guidance.Finally this quarter, we're introducing ARR, our annualized recurring revenue, as you know, probably the most important KPI for our business. The way we've calculated this is a bottoms up contract-based metrics, which we believe is really the most important way to measure the performance of this transition. You'll see a five-quarter history in our earnings letter and I'll point out for Q2, total subscription ARR was $614 million and that's up 33% year-on-year, while the SaaS-only ARR was $418 million and that's up nearly 50% year-over-year. As we continue to move through the business model transformation, we expect to see very strong continued growth in both of these metrics.So let me stop there, and with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator, so that we can open it up and take your questions. Ashley?Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hey. Thanks for taking -- and I know there's a lot of stuff to go through, David. Like, can you help us a little bit to understand, like, what do you see in terms of customers, in terms of term and Citrix Service Provider versus, like, doing this as a SaaS offering in terms of, like, what do you see there because if I look at the numbers on my side, it seem more CSP and term was driving it, but I'm just trying to understand the dynamic there? -- Yeah. I'd say all-in two things, Raimo. I mean, we're seeing strong growth across all three of those areas. You saw that SaaS-only ARR is the one that really ticked up. It's growing nearly 50% right now at a scale north of $400 million. So that is the probably the cleanest representation of thinking about Citrix Cloud. The other two businesses that show up in the other subscription, you pointed out CSP, which for everybody is the consumption-based subscription that we have mostly through our partners. That business is north of $100 million run rate now, continues to grow nicely. And then on-premise term, and I'd say on-premise term is a bridge for a lot of customers as they're moving from a perpetual license to a true subscription. A lot of those tend to be hybrid licenses, where they're working through the transition of their own infrastructure. Long-term, we actually want to highlight much more SaaS driven. And so on-prem term, as -- I look at that as a bit of a bridge in between the two, but the fastest growing part of the business is pure SaaS. -- Perfect. Thank you. Well done.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hey. Thanks guys for taking my question. I actually just have two of them. First, David, if I look at Workspace Services, obviously you highlighted the continued shift to subscription there. But even on a reported basis, you're still up by -- I think it was 7% year-over-year. Wondering, if you can just walk us through some of the demand drivers that you've been seeing in the first half because obviously this first half year has been acceleration like -- all like apples-to-apples growth? And then just one follow up to that. -- Sure, Phil. I'm actually really excited about the Workspace right now. Like you said, we've seen really solid growth in this business on a recognized basis, even though 71% of the mix last quarter came via subscription and that's -- when I like quote those numbers, those are new product mix. And so there's two things going on. I mean, we have been leading the market for years around desktop and app virtualization, just pure virtualization. And I think that part of the overall business is seeing a nice resurgence in the last couple of years because customers are really focused on mobility and security and those types of opportunities. But really what's most important for us and probably most exciting is the message that we're driving with customers right now about the intelligent Workspace and how we can move those capabilities, not just for those users that are focused on virtualization, but really add value to everybody inside the enterprise. And we introduced a number of those capabilities in -- at our Synergy Conference couple of months ago, we'll be shipping those in the back half of the year. So I think our message is resonating and it will allow us over a long period of time to really expand our available TAM, drive incremental penetration within our installed base and also look for net new customers that really are not using any form of virtualization. So that's where we're taking the product line. And that one is clearly leading the subscription transition. And I would expect it to be close to 80% by the end of the year. -- Got it. Thanks. And then just a follow up, as you mentioned, Synergy, obviously, there were some significant announcements with Microsoft out of Synergy and including Brad Anderson kind of unofficially announcing the renewal of that partnership. Can you give us an update on just the partnership with Microsoft, particularly the new products that are coming up? -- Yeah. I'd say, all in the partnerships is strong as it's been in 20 years. And that's for a couple of reasons. One, we have really good alignment in the field when we're working with customers. A lot of customers are going through major projects like O365, Azure transformations, lots of bigger projects. And we've -- we can joint sell with Microsoft and really help support a lot of those capabilities. And so that's been very positive. In the longer term, that's a huge opportunity for customers to continue to move their Citrix workloads on to Azure or one of the other major cloud properties, and that's why we work so well with them.Specific to your question about individual products, yes, Brad was with us at Synergy and we announced a number of new things. For example, the support of their new platform, which they call Windows Virtual Desktop. And now we've integrated that with Citrix Cloud, so that customers can look at that as one more place to run their workloads, giving them really unprecedented flexibility across Citrix Cloud. We also announced the Citrix Managed Desktops, which is really a DaaS service sitting on top of that platform and we're doing that with Microsoft and we'll be able to bundle Azure capacity and really create a clean turnkey. We also announced a number of other areas and I'm sure I'm going to forget all of them. But optimizations for Windows -- excuse me, for Office 365, for SD-WAN, we can do a lot of really cool things to accelerate the performance of Office. HDX optimizations for teams, SD-WAN more broadly for Windows Virtual Desktop, adding performance and resiliency, as well as a number of other areas. So I'd say the partnership is as broad as it's certainly been in any time in my 17 years. -- Great. Thanks, guys. -- You bet.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Hey, Dave. I just want to get to the question of, call it, normalized revenue growth. So you posted 1% growth, but you mentioned that there was 600 to 700 basis point headwind from the mix. So call it normalized 7%, 8% growth. I think when you gave guidance three months ago for roughly 3% to 4% growth in 2Q, you were calling for a 200 to 300 basis point hit from the bookings mix, which would equate to normalized growth of like 6%, 7%. So my simple math suggests that you were in line or slightly above your prior guide on a normalized basis. I just wanted to check that math and assess whether it's directionally accurate anyway. -- Karl, I think your math is exactly right. If you look at the mix shift, I mean it's basically just our prior expectations and the actuals, it's mixed, there's really nothing more to that. Just step back and think about normalized growth rates, I mean, what we've been executing on, if you normalize this whole push to subscription or if you normalize the growth in unbilled revenue, so you can really have apples-to-apples. You look at businesses or a company as a whole that's operating in that mid to high single-digit range and that's effectively where we'd be operating on a pure steady-state basis. I think as everybody knows, of course, we're driving this transition to create much more incremental value long-term for customers, more stickiness from a product value standpoint and obviously that translates into higher returns for investors. -- Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then maybe a second question just on 3Q, your expectation for the subscription bookings mix of 60% to 65% is pretty well in line with what you did in 2Q. And yet, the revenue guidance is for a 3% decline rather than 1% growth. So your revenue growth decels in 3Q, but your subscription bookings mix is quite similar. Maybe it's a complicated answer, I don't know. But why is that, Dave? -- Yeah. [Indecipherable] answer is there's always some seasonality in Q3. Not a whole lot more besides that. And then the mix of 60% to 65%, not sure exactly where it's going to fall in that range, but I think the rule of thumb that I laid out was a good way for everyone to think about it. If you remember when we went into Q2, we had guided the midpoint of at 52%, 52.5% mix, our revenue outlook would be X. We came in 10 points higher than that. And so that influenced revenue. And I think as we go forward, we -- if our mix is a little hotter, that's when we'll come in closer to the bottom of our range and vice versa. -- Okay. And if no one would get too upset if I ask a third and I promise I'll stop there. Without stealing the thunder from your September 9th Analyst Day, where I'm guessing you'll sort of lay out the transition -- the model transition impact on the financials over maybe 2020, 2021. Dave, is there any framework you can give us perhaps now on the call about sort of how long these pressures on revs, EPS, cash flow will last? Is it the kind of thing where things should begin to normalize, call it, second half 2020? Any any broad framework ahead of the Analyst Day? -- Yeah. Let me talk about it at a high level. You're right. We do need to talk about those things in the context of a longer discussion. So I think as everybody knows, each year we update long-term targets as we've been moving through this transition. And that's based on actual results, customer feedback and the outlook. And we're going to do that again this year at our Analyst Meeting in a couple of months. But let's take a bit of a step back for a minute. And so, we're two years into this transition. I think we've made really good progress all-in. But unlike other model transitions that we've seen across the industry, we've never really seen any material impact on the P&L up to this point.I think that's been for two reasons. First is that we've just had better internal execution and a really good product story. So we've sold more. We've sold more and we've just been trying to balance the impact up to that point. And so, Phase 1 has been focused really on net new, largely due to capacity and focus. And so, last year, we moved about 42% of the net new mix to subscription. This year, as I said, we're looking at 60%, 65%. So that's a big increase and the numbers are now large enough that it's creating this headwind that you're seeing over the course of Q2 and the balance of this year really into the reported P&L. Again, like I mentioned a minute ago, the offset is going to show up in deferred and unbilled, plus these new metrics, so everybody has complete visibility.The way I'm thinking about the next couple of years, though, is Phase 2 is going to bring much more focus on transitioning our really big installed base. So we've started that this year and we've seen a nice uplift in kind of the annualized dollars that those customers are paying, for those we've transitioned so far. And so this is a big incremental opportunity. In fact, hundreds of millions of dollars annually. That's going to start to become a priority in 2020. And that's why to help everybody understand this, we've delivered these new metrics, unbilled revenue, ARR in particular, so that everybody can really just see how that it impacts beyond the reported P&L. So we'll talk about all that in -- at our next Analyst Meeting to make sure you have complete perspective. And again, we're providing the metrics so you can measure us along the way, look much more like a traditional subscription transition and looking forward to having that in-depth conversation. -- Okay, great. Thanks very much.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Thank you, David. Just a couple of questions left here. Just on the point that you just mentioned in terms of Phase 2 of the transition of the installed base. Any comments you could mention about churn thus far as you've been seeing those big customers transition and kind of what the level of uplift is that you're getting on pricing for those that are staying and kind of what the price realization is? And then I just wanted to follow up, just I know Phil asked a question about Microsoft. My question is just more related to Windows 10. There's been some people wondering how much of a drive that's been to the whole Workspace Services business and how does that -- that going -- the migration from Windows 7 to Windows 10, which has to be done by mid-January, does that become a headwind when you start to think about calendar '20 top line? Thank you. -- Yeah. Let me talk about the second question first. I don't hear that much about Win 10 as a stand-alone driver. I think desktop OS isn't the driver that it would have been for a major project like it was a decade ago. I'd say it's one of the many projects that customers are looking at and it's one of the things that we can engage in, I'd say that more broadly speaking, when we're talking to customers today and every customer meeting that I had throughout Q2 was focus, I'd say, first on security on how they're looking at managing an increasingly complex infrastructure. Second, on mobility around just finally enabling devices to be used in the enterprise in a secure simple way across what is usually hundreds of applications in most enterprises. And then lastly, this idea that a little bit more about our roadmap and our vision about really embracing employee productivity and driving engagement and things that'll just make them -- their teams more productive. And so I'd say that's probably the bigger driver than any one-off like a Win 10 migration.Back to the other question about the installed base. Yeah. It's been -- we've actually seen really good success with those customers that we've updated so far. I'd say it's a limited set, so I wouldn't read too far into it, but the average uplift that we saw in Q2 was like 40% from what they had been paying on a typical maintenance contract. And again, that's because it's not just a like-for-like, but this whole migration opportunity is about moving them from what might have been a virtual app sale to a more broad Workspace sale. And so, we'll get that uplift as we do that, but it also provides that platform for us to start expanding more horizontally into untapped seats inside that customer. So it's really a dual strategy. So I'm really happy with what we've seen so far and we just have to scale that up. And it's one of the reasons why we've unified our renewals motions globally now. We have introduced a new COO into the Company, an existing employee and helped focus on really driving this Phase 2 in the next couple of years. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thanks, Heather.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. -- Thank you very much and I really appreciate the fact that you guys are giving more color and the ARR numbers and the breakdown of it is going to be helpful, as well as the additional color in the filing. Two questions for you, I apologize there are two. But the first question is, while subscription bookings as a percentage of total product bookings were 62% in the quarter, can you give us some color on the percentage of the installed bases that is through the subscription? You've given a little color. Is there a better sense of what percentage of the base really has moved or are we really in the point at which the subscription Citrix Cloud is really all from net new? And then I have a follow up. -- Yeah. Your first question Mark is -- I mean, it's largely net new. I mean, we've -- we were looking at less than -- I'd say less than 10% of the installed base has moved at this point in time. And one important point to point out is that we are still selling perpetual licenses. And so the installed base is, as you define it, is still moving. It's still growing. So it's not static necessarily. But that sad, I'd say it's less than 10% at this point, and that's been intentional. I mean, we wanted to make sure that we get this whole process moving around and focus around net new, and I think that's important. And once we have that going and you've seen this really driving the business over the last couple of years, this gives us a much better framework to go and drive installed base. And I also think it's also given us an opportunity to really mature the product sets across Citrix Cloud, across the intelligent Workspace and all these new initiatives. So that it's not just a migrate to cloud story, it's a much broader opportunity to talk about, employee productivity and ways that we can help really drive what, in marketing terms, we call the future of work, but a holistic strategy for customers. -- Excellent. I really appreciate it. And then as a follow up. While Citrix Cloud is cloud, how should we think about the impact on gross margin? Is this more like a subscription where the margin impact is very low? Or is this more like a SaaS? How should we think about it? -- Yeah. It's a good question, Mark. I mean, at a high level, our services are not necessarily compute or data intensive. And therefore, at scale, we can manage with pretty high gross margins. That said, as we -- before we get to scale and we're bringing on more and more customers, I think there is a little bit of upfronts there. There's probably a 50 basis point headwind in the first half of the year on gross margins, not big, but it's there. And we obviously have teams that are focused on not just cloud COGS and optimizing that, but all of the aspects of cloud operations. And so, there'll be some pressure on gross margins over the years, but we'll manage that. Our services are built out with full multi-tenancy and the things you would imagine. And so we'll be optimizing across the board. -- Perfect. I apologize, I never do this, but got one quick. Can you give a little more color on the NetScaler move to subscription and what the drivers are, what the lift is like? Any more data would be appreciated since no one is really focused at this point on that. -- No, that's OK, Mark. It's actually a really interesting dynamic that's happening right now. I'd say, I think as everybody would understand, there are secular changes going on in Networking in general, really driven by the adoption of cloud more than anything else. And so what we've seen over the last few quarters is a more pronounced move to software versus hardware. And that's simply because customers are looking for more flexibility, more choices in a way that they deploy their capabilities. And the good news for Citrix in particular is that we're a software company and we can deploy our Networking hardware on a physical appliance, in a virtual container, in a docker container, as a service and a number of other things. And that's what gives customers flexibility. So the dynamic we're seeing right now is that customers that maybe in the past would have thought about a hardware refresh cycle, now they're looking at it as why don't I do a software refresh cycle, where I can buy, in our licensing terms, a pool capacity license that could be shared across an on-premise infrastructure, any form of hybrid, in a cloud, in a container, etc. We've got this great control plane that allows you to help manage that in a reasonably seamless way. So it just gives customers a lot more flexibility. And that's something that we've got as pretty unique capabilities and we're pushing that in the market fairly aggressively and customers are responding. I think 35% of the mix in one quarter is a little higher than I would have expected. That's up from just over 10% a year ago, but that's a trend I expect to continue. -- Excellent. Really appreciate it. Thanks.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey, it's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking our question. So the acceleration of sub -- in subscriptions, very impressive. You pointed out some drivers, such as Hybrid Multi-Cloud, Citrix Cloud in the investor letter and prepared remarks here. But could you pinpoint further the change in pace here versus last quarter? It's really dramatic. -- Yeah, it is. It's -- we did -- Q1, we were at 50% of the mix, Q2 we're at 62% and I think in the second half of the year, we're going to be pushing 65% or higher to get to that full year of 60%, 65%. So, I mean, we're moving at pretty rapid pace right now. And as I pointed out, you can see in our letter. 71% of Workspace mix is now coming via subscription. That was up about 10 points from Q1 and 15 points or so year-on-year. That business will continue to move up. Obviously, the gains will start to slow down on an incremental mix basis because it's so rich. And then Networking, as you know, it's moved up much more materially from 10% a year ago to 35% now. That's the biggest change. We will still continue to sell a fair bit of hardware, so I do not expect that in the next 12 months, let's say, to get north of 50%, but I think the rate that we're at right now is probably a pretty good floor and it'll move up from here. And it's a function of two things. I think we have tried as a company to balance the transition, actively balance that over the last six, eight quarters, while giving customers the choice that they want. Now, we're just letting it -- embracing it and letting it happen at a bit more of a natural pace. And so, you'll see it continue the way it was in Q2 into the back half of the year. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Hi. This is Sanjit Singh in for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe to start off in terms of managing, let's say, Phase 2 of the transition. From an operating margin perspective, is the view that you would just sort of let the transition happen as rapidly as possible, take the headwinds on margins upfront and kind of move -- accelerate through the transition to get to a better margin profile down the road or is the view that you will continue to protect margins as you execute through Phase 2? -- Well, I think as you see the impact on the top line and certainly the overall growth, I mean that'll flow all the way through the P&L. I mean, we saw that in Q2 and in our guidance for the second half of the year. I think we've moved margins up a lot in the last couple of years. And so we're not going to do anything artificial. We're investing to drive and grow the business and drive the transition. We're, of course, always thoughtful in how we manage our expenses and our headcount growth and those types of things because we want to make sure we're investing in the right areas. But we absolutely have a view on how we're going to drive long-term sustainable growth. And so I wouldn't expect anything artificial from us in that regard. -- Got it. And for the follow up in terms of the new metrics that you released this quarter on paid subscriber account, it sounds like we're at 5.4 million today. If I understood you correctly, that's mostly net new. As we think about the maintenance base transitioning over to cloud, what do you think that number goes to? What do you think sort of the number of available subscriber count that you have to transition? Does that 5.4 million, does that increase significantly over the next couple of years? Any view on where that number could go. -- It could go much, much higher. We're certainly not going to guide that one yet because that's predicated on a few different movements. But if you think about our installed base right now, I mean it is tens and tens of millions of active users. And so, the opportunity pool is very material. I think it's premature for us to try and put a number on that right now, but I think we're at the very front end of the broader opportunity. -- Appreciate. Thank you for taking the questions. -- You bet.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Hi. This is actually Jacqueline on for Nikolay. So two questions. First, can you please give us some concrete examples of how Workspace will coexist with Windows Virtual Desktop in any areas of current or potential overlap? And my second question is, what needs to happen from a product pricing or go-to-market perspective for the installed base to begin to move to the cloud? -- Sure. There's couple of questions in there. I mean, if you're coming back to the Microsoft, specific question, think about Windows Virtual Desktop as a platform, very similar to the way people have thought about remote desktop services over the years, which was part of Windows Server. I think that's the easiest way to conceptualize it. And so as a platform, it's a multi-user version of Win 10. And so for a lot of our customers, they look at that as maybe a use case that makes sense in part of their business alongside everything else they're trying to accomplish. Our average customer is delivering over 500 applications across all different app types. And so for us to be able to open up Windows Virtual Desktop as another resource or another type of capability that could be managed inside of Citrix Cloud, very similar to the way you would be managing, for example, an on-premise application or maybe a published SaaS application. So for a lot of customers, it just provides more flexibility. From a platform standpoint, Citrix building a DaaS service on top of that really just embraces and extends a lot of the capabilities to be much more feature-rich on the enterprise side. So those are -- that's probably the easiest way to think about that. It's a component of a broader infrastructure from a typical Citrix customer standpoint.And can you repeat the question about go-to-market? -- Yeah. Just curious on what needs to happen from a product or pricing or go-to-market perspective for the installed base to begin to move to the cloud? -- Well, I'd say for the most part, it's the products there. It's just -- and the pricing is there. And it's just a matter of focus from our point of view. We have disincented that really from a compensation standpoint, we did that intentionally. I've talked about that each quarter because teams only have so much bandwidth and we want to have the focus on net new in order to really start building the base. There is a big opportunity around the installed base. And so we'll start expanding that and really leveraging the success we've had in some of the early areas. So I think it's just about making sure we have enough capacity to serve customers and that's why we've been investing in quota-carrying folks for the last couple of years, as well as customer success. And then we'll tweak compensation along the way to make sure we're incenting the right outcomes as we go into 2020 and beyond. -- Got it. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. David, I have seven questions. Actually, I'm only kidding. I only have one. I only have one. Listen, we understand the mix change and its effect on the financials. That all makes sense. But deferred revenue was also lower than expected. And I would have expected that that would have been much better, given the outsized ratable bookings. So can you explain that? -- Yeah. Two things on deferred. One, you have a -- we had a really big, if you look back, a really big seasonal comp because we did a mega deal in Q2 a year ago. And that was a large net eight-figure deal. That's one thing. So that's the seasonal point. The other is, most of your growth is coming in unbilled right now instead of deferred because the contracts are moving to SaaS. And SaaS are three-year deals on average, one-year billed upfront. And that's why we didn't have unbilled a year ago and now it's $380 million, I think, Jessica. And so that's the primary offset. -- But I would think that the one-year that you do bill upfront would be more than -- well, I guess it'd be more than the maintenance that you'd bill and that would go into deferred. I just -- it's still -- Okay, I'm sorry. You said there are two things. Did you say both of them? -- No. I'd point you back to ARR as well. And the reason we did that on a contractual basis, A, it's duration-adjusted, and B, it just gives you the best end of quarter visibility into what's really going on. And we're going to continue to deliver that on both a total subscription basis and a SaaS basis. And so I'd point you back there, but all-in deferred and unbilled were up 15% year-on-year and I'm happy with that. I think it'll continue to grow in the future. -- Okay. Okay. Thanks, David. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks very much. David, with the headwinds from the subscription going forward here, does it impact your ability to return capital to shareholders? And if it does, to what effect? Thanks. -- Not materially. I think that when we look at how we have thought about capital return over the years, we've been really consistent. I mean, we're always focused first and foremost on things that will grow the Company, great M&A at the right price and that's a priority. And when we find those, we execute on that. We also return excess capital via dividends, via share repurchase. And that's -- I'm not sure that that's going to change in the future. -- Great. Thanks very much. -- You bet.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Great, thanks. Peter Levine in for Kirk. Two quick ones. Sorry if I missed it earlier, but can you give an update on the CFO search? And then second just to piggyback off of the mix shift in the quarter. You talked about it, but just anything you would call out on the sales or maybe the partner side that accelerated this quarter that kind of made you change your guidance there? Thanks. -- Yeah. Let me take the second part first. I'd say that with the benefit of hindsight, we'd probably been holding it back a little bit in prior quarters what was the normal customer emotion. And so we're just letting it happen much more naturally. And I think that's representative of what you're seeing right now. And given the scale of the business, it's time to really lean in and embrace the transition and drive it more aggressively than we have been. So I'd say that that's the easiest way to think about that and why we want to drive this expectation over the balance of the year. Start looking a little bit more like a typical subscription transition that people are used to seeing across companies.On the CFO search, it's going well. We've met with a number of external candidates. We have some great internal candidates as well. And we're just going through the process very methodically. We've got such a solid team right now that I feel comfortable where we are, but I'm more focused on making the right decision than making a quick decision. That said, hopefully, we get -- we'll get this wrapped up fairly quickly. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. And it looks like our next question is a follow up from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hey. Thanks guys for taking my follow up -- actually just two follow ups. David, obviously, you mentioned some of the changes in just the market when it comes to the Networking business. With the subscription and some of those changes and just how NetScaler [Indecipherable] is being delivered. How should we think about the revenue breakeven from the old, call it, product/license model plus maintenance to subscription? And then also, how should we think about sort of just the gross margin differential? -- Yeah. Phil, gross margin is going to be higher because we're selling software that looks more like a typical software gross margin than a hardware gross margin. So, the change has probably got higher gross margin dollars from a revenue standpoint, you're not selling the box along with it. So you may have a little bit of revenue headwind in the short-term. But getting customers to bill this out from a software standpoint is part of their infrastructure, I think it's going to drive really good stickiness. So I'd have to go back and look at it on a -- it's probably a little bit more case-by-case than in the aggregate, but I'd say that they break even from gross margin and really the extension of gross margin dollars is relatively short-term. -- Great. Thanks, David.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions-and-answers. I'll now turn the call back over to David for any closing remarks. -- So thank everybody again. I appreciate all the multi-part questions along the way. I just want to reiterate a couple of things as we go through this. We're driving the business toward a subscription model, probably faster than we would've anticipated over the course of the last several quarters. I think Q2 is a great example of that performance shift relative to guidance and that's why we updated the back half of the year. We're delivering all these incremental metrics to make sure that you can look at the business holistically, whether that's ARR with subscription ARR up 33% and SaaS ARR up nearly 50%. So those will be the most important ways to view the business on a go forward basis. Hopefully, everybody can join us at our upcoming Analyst Meeting in the next couple of months. Look forward to seeing you there. And if not, talk to you again in three months. Thank you.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

My name is Chantelle, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Citrix Systems First Quarter 2019 . All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)Thank you. Traci Tsuchiguchi, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. -- Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's first quarter 2019 . Participating on this call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jessica Soisson, Interim Chief Financial Officer.This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems' Investor Relations website, and the webcast replay will be posted immediately following the call. Please note that we have posted our first quarter earnings memo to our Investor Relations website. This memo replaces the prepared verbal comments accompanying earnings slide deck and supplemental web information. Beginning next quarter, it will also replace our earnings press release.As a reminder, today's call may contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the U.S. securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.Additional information concerning these and other factors are highlighted in today's earnings memo and in the company's filings with the SEC.

A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of our earnings memo and press release.Now I'd like to turn it over to David, our President and Chief Executive Officer. -- Thanks Traci, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Hopefully, everybody has had a chance to read through our quarterly results summary and all the new disclosures that we are going to be breaking out going forward. The idea here, of course, is designed to really simplify the understanding of our business and the success across our subscription model transition.Before we get started though, I want to welcome Jessica Soisson to the call. She's my long-term colleague, our current Chief Accounting Officer, and as Traci said, Interim CFO, as Drew is leaving to pursue other opportunities.So, as you saw in the summary, we had a really good quarter. We exceeded forecast on both revenue and EPS, and frankly, you can boil it down into three key areas. First one is that the strength is coming from the Workspace. Workspace revenue in total was up 13% year-on-year, is the fastest growth we've seen in many, many years. Second, is that total SaaS revenue for the company was up 43% and this is due to the strength of our ongoing subscription bookings. In fact, the strength of subscription drove future committed revenue, which consists of deferred and unbilled up 21% from last year. In fact, the subscription mix is running ahead of plan and I expect that to be the case throughout the year.Third item is, as we've talked about a couple of times, the strategic service provider customers really those three historically largest hyperscale networking customers, just continue to be a headwind to revenue due to timing. We expect this to persist into the second quarter, as I have previously stated.However, when you exclude these three SSP customers, revenue for the rest of the company was just under $700 million, which is up 10% year-over-year. So, all in, just really happy with the performance of the quarter.And so, now let's open it up for Q&A.(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you so much, David. And we really appreciate, I think everybody really appreciates the new disclosure. So, thank you for -- thank you for giving us that.I wanted to take a look, you mentioned Workspace services revenue grew the fastest you've seen since 2012. How -- can you talk about kind of how you see the durability of that type of growth rate? What seems to be causing it? And if you had to give us a take for the year, how would you say you think that business evolves? And then I have a follow-up. -- Sure. I'd say, overall, the business is continuing the trends that we've seen over the last, probably the last six, eight quarters in a row now. I mean, more specifically we've been talking about the Workspace in broader terms than we ever had in the past. I mean, we created virtualization years and years ago and we still have an amazing business in that area. But what's really resonating with customers is the broader vision around providing a holistic workspace for all application types, whether those are virtualized, SaaS, mobile and really making that something that can help engage employees, drive productivity, simplify the infrastructure, et cetera. And so that's a lot of what we've been talking about. And we're getting a lot of great response from customers that's allowed us to sign more and more up for longer term subscription deals, generate a higher number of large enterprise deals. And so we feel good about it.Right now we've got -- I'd say the amount of revenue coming from subscription is significantly higher than that of perpetual license and that should continue. The growth rate will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter just based on mix, it's still whether it's perpetual license or on-premise term, they tend to have a little higher rev rec. So, directionally it's up in the right, but I would expect it to bounce around a little bit along that trend. -- Okay. And then just the follow-up question is just related to the revenue outlook, looked like it was a little bit better than the midpoint -- the midpoint was a little bit better than consensus. I noticed though, it looks like the earnings forecast that you're giving is a little bit below. And I apologize if you might have said this earlier, but like, is there anything that you could talk to us about that might be impacting the margin in the second quarter? -- No. We've reiterated the full year, still expecting full year guidance of about 4% top line growth, margin up to about 32 points and $6.00 of EPS. And I'd say the only thing that I'm thinking about in terms of the full year is that subscription mix is running hotter toward subscription, so that causes a little bit of a headwind.Specific to Q2, we've never given 2Q guidance before. Q2, if you look back over the last couple of years, tends to be our lowest margin quarter, because it's our highest expense quarter. And the reason that is, is Q2 is a lot of seasonal items like our Big Synergy conference that's when we do merit increases and correspondingly that's our highest marketing quarter historically, so it tends to pop and then come back down in Q3 and Q4. And I would expect that to be the case in this year as well. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. -- Thanks and good quarter, guys. I guess I wanted to dig into the SSP business and I understand the lumpiness of it. But I guess it's been under pressure for four quarters in a row now, and considering, who the customers are, you would think that they wouldn't hold up on large purchases for such a long time. So, help me get my hands around your visibility there and how do you get a sense that there isn't a bigger issue with those customers, have they moved elsewhere, developed their own, moved to another vendor? How do you get a sense and confidence that's not the reason for the weakness? -- Yeah. I want to put a couple of things in context as we're talking about, just so you understand. So, when we're talking about the SSP business, I'll remind everybody, it's about 3% of total revenue, it's not a big number. But it is a subject to both cyclical and secular pressures. Cyclically it's lumpy and it's always been that way.If you look at last year, there was about $100 million of business in the first half of the year and $50 million in the second half and the year prior it had similar lumpiness. And so, as I've stated many times over the years, we have pretty good visibility into the full year, but the quarterization is a little harder. And that's the primary reason why we're going to break it out going forward, and so that everybody can look past it with a lot of clarity to understand when it's hurting and where it's contributing to the quarter.So, on the broader secular trend, yeah, it's been declining at a rate of about 10% for several years now. And so it's very consistent with the way we've talked about it, and that's just the normal scaling that, you know, the three big hyperscales are going to have. -- Got it. And then, as a follow-up, you've talked about how early you are in the subscription position at a networking business and it's predominantly still hardware. Although I was surprised with the new disclosure and again thanks, like Heather, this is great to see that, already it's 25% of the product revenue within networking -- of our bookings, I'm sorry, subscription bookings.Help me think about the pace by which you think you can pivot networking business into subscription, should we look at the Workspace transition as a good proxy for the pace by which this would move, or given the hardware -- the high hardware mix here, it should take longer to get to the same levels? -- Yeah, two things. One, it's definitely going to go slower than Workspace. Workspace is a software product and it's a much more natural transition there. On networking, I think, it's important to take a little bit of a step back and think about strategically, what we're driving. I mean, we're a software company by nature that's what we do.And so our approach to networking has been to really disaggregate the functionality from the hardware appliance itself and that's always been the strategy, but giving customers that flexibility to consume networking hardware in a form factor of a hardware appliance, a virtual appliance as a container and in some instances as a service and sharing capacity in some instances across those different types of form factors.That's really our strategy to be able to address a number of, let's call it different secular trends that are going on in networking entirely. So, it will continue to move more toward software and I think that should be the expectation. But it will be more gradual than on the Workspace business. -- Very good. Good luck guys. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Hey, good evening. Hi, David and everybody else. Back at Workspace, David, how much of a boost have you been getting from the Windows 10 transition, which isn't really getting toward it end? And are you at all concerned about incremental competition, the Desktop-as-a-Service market from either Azure or AWS, and what's your strategy there? -- Yeah, two things. I mean, if you think about Windows 10, I mean, it's one of the drivers, I'd say that the platform drivers are less in these days than they would have been five years ago. And that's simply because most of the use cases that I talk to customers about tend to be around security or enabling mobility or enabling workforce productivity, it's those types of things. But it also includes platform evolution. So, I'd say that's one of many.In terms of DaaS, we actually don't compete in DaaS today. We've announced that we are building a DaaS product on top of Azure Virtual Desktop, which we'll talk about a little bit later in the year. But it's a different category than we've competed in historically. We do think it's important. That's one of the reasons, why we're doing this natively on top of Microsoft.We're actually becoming a cloud service provider, so that we can bundle certain capabilities in the infrastructure together with our solution. The idea to really focus on customer simplicity and simplification and that's going to be our strategy going forward. We've been embracing and extending the Microsoft platform for 30 years now. I think we'll continue to do that, especially in new categories like DaaS that are just new opportunities going forward. -- Okay. David, that's it from me. Thank you very much. -- Thanks, Michael.Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question and thanks again for the extra disclosure from me as well. And David, just more an accounting question. Can you talk a little bit about to the cash flow in Q1 and just talk us through the impact that the subscription transition has on the cash flow seasonality here and going forward? -- Yes. Cash flow is the area that you're going to have to look at in conjunction with future committed revenue because our billing -- kind of our billing cycles are changing as we go through this. And that's same as we've talked about for a long, long time. I mean, as we go to book SaaS contracts, the typical contract is three years of total contract value annualized billings and that's what's building this unbilled deferred that we're disclosing.In fact, unbilled increased by about $300 million year-over-year. In a historical model, we would have billed all that upfront. So, it's just a timing conversation more than anything else. Remind everybody that total future committed revenue that was up to about $2.1 billion now, grew 21% year-on-year. -- And then one follow-up. If you think about the CFO transition, obviously we wish Drew all the best back on the West Coast. What's the time frame that you're thinking about? -- He'll be leaving immediately. -- And then so you started searching already? -- Yeah. We'll start to search shortly, but Jessica has been my colleague for a long time. We're not going to miss a beat here as we go forward. -- Okay, perfect. Well done. Thank you. -- Thank you.(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is Jerry Diao filling in for Phil. Congratulations on the strong first quarter. Just want to build upon Heather's question and your comments on how Workspace has evolved. Could you give some specific color on kind of what's precisely driving this reacceleration in terms of whether its sales reengagement, or just customer better understand the new functionality, et cetera? Thank you so much. -- Sure, Jerry. I'd say it's very consistent with the strategy that we've been talking about now for you know, a year and a half, two years, it's about thinking about the Workspace much more broadly than simply virtualization. And that allows us to address really all customers in a way that we talk about as a kind of general purpose. And what that means is, it's the opportunity to expand beyond traditional virtualization in the installed base and think about providing customers with a platform upon which automation, security, analytics can reside that provides value even to the users that have really light application use, including those that don't need any virtualization or whatsoever.So, all applications, all potential seats inside of an account, really anywhere in the world, et cetera. And that overall core message is resonating with customers and I think that's allowed us to reengage and start accelerating that business over the past couple of years. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks. Dave, can you give us a sense of what the Americas growth rate look like ex the SSP business? Thanks. -- No, we haven't broken it out ex-SSP. We are going to trying and keep the level of breakouts at a pretty high level. I mean if you look at a memo, you will see that the international geos both grew double digits.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of Citrix Systems Inc (Symbol: CTXS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 26.1, after changing hands as low as $98.15 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 50.3. A bullish investor could look at CTXS's 26.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of CTXS shares:    Looking at the chart above, CTXS's low point in its 52 week range is $90.32 per share, with $116.815 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $99.98.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["It was touch and go for the better part of yesterday\u2019s action, as investors grappled with the prospect \u2014 but not the certainty \u2014 of an amicable end to the tariff war with China but the beginning of one with Mexico. The  managed to end the day up 0.21%, but it was an ugly win, with most of the intraday gain being given back and the shape of the bar suggesting it could have been a pivot back into a pullback. (NASDAQ:) led the way with more than an 8% gain following whispers that , though a broad rise in tech stocks stemming from encouraging trade news boosted that tailwind.At the other end of the spectrum,  (NYSE:) lost nearly 5% of its value after Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Curtis Nagle . The ongoing growth of cloud-based gaming is, Nagle believes, an ongoing threat to the brick-and-mortar game business.Neither name is a particularly great trading prospect today, however. Rather, the stock charts of less-volatile  (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:) and (NYSE:) are shaping up as your best, more predictable bets. Here\u2019s why.In mid-March Invesco , snapping out of a bearish funk thanks to a completed upside-down head-and-shoulders pattern that carried IVZ above a long-standing (and falling) resistance line.Shares started to peel back the very next day. But, over the course of the past week and a half the bigger-picture uptrend has been renewed, and is now even stronger and more convincing than it was before.\u2022 The convincing clue is the way IVZ found support at the intermediate-term support line, plotted in red, in late March. That reversal is highlighted on the daily chart.\u2022 We\u2019ve also now seen two higher highs and higher lows since Invesco worked its way above the long-term ceiling that had been guiding it lower since March of last year. That resistance is plotted with yellow dashed line on both stock charts.\u2022 Should this rebound effort continue to gain traction, the first real test is the $24.20 area, where the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line awaits. Those Fib lines are the horizontal lines marked on the weekly chart.Most oil names were down on Wednesday, in step with a pullback from crude oil prices. HollyFrontier was no exception to that weakness.But, unlike most of its oil and gas peers, HFC stock has been fighting a losing battle since February, and really, since May. The stock\u2019s one bad day away from sliding into an even more serious freefall, against a backdrop of multiple warnings.\u2022 The last line in the sand is currently at $48.60, plotted in red on both stock charts. That floor has tagged all the major lows going back to early 2018.\u2022 At the same time, HollyFrontier shares have been guided lower by falling resistance line plotted in yellow on both stock charts.\u2022 It\u2019s difficult to tell, until one sees the Chaikin line on the weekly chart. With its recent cross back under the zero level, it can be said there\u2019s more bearish volume than not behind the bearish leg now underway.In early March we pointed out . While they were just coming off a sizable loss, a familiar floor once again acted as support and suggested CTXS stock was still range-bound. That hint was on-target. Citrix stopped losing ground that day.That result may have only postponed an inevitable showdown between the bulls and the bears though. After yesterday\u2019s action, that battle may have just started, with the bulls winning the first round by default.\u2022 Citrix Systems may have logged a healthy 2.35% gain on Wednesday, but that close of $102.48 was well off the high after a brush of the white 200-day moving average line repelled the buying effort.\u2022 As the weekly chart indicates, a huge support line plotted in blue that touches all the key lows going back to early 2016 is still intact, but now under serious, sustained pressure.\u2022 Simultaneously, there\u2019s a horizontal floor at $98, plotted in green, that is still a factor.\u2022 Although yesterday\u2019s high-volume surge and partial pullback didn\u2019t shake the stock out of a trading range, it\u2019s a session that may force the bears and bulls to show their hands once and for all, and force a more prolonged move.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Before the closing bell rang, the bulls were back to testing the waters, whittling the day's loss down to only 0.21% for the  . The intraday rebound leaves stocks on unclear footing headed into Monday's trading.Here's how they did: (NYSE:  ) was a key laggard. After losing 10% on Thursday after reporting  and dishing out a lackluster full-year profit outlook, the sellers dug in again to leave of nearly 5% lower on Friday.  (NASDAQ:  ) lost even more ground, however, falling 15% in response to earnings and a  , but perhaps also in response to some strange comments from CEO Nick Caporella.There were a handful of winners.  (NASDAQ:  ) popped more than 11%, snapping a four-day losing streak,  . There just weren't enough Funko's to drag the broad market out of the red.As Monday's trading action gets going, stock charts of  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) are the names that should be on traders' radars. Here's why, and what to look for.The big bearish gap Coca-Cola shares left behind last month may be aching to be filled in, but there's no particular timeframe the market has in mind when it makes a point of filling in those gaps. It happens when it happens\\.And, with that as the backdrop, one more bearish day could drag Coca-Cola shares under a pivotal support level that could easily incite another wave of selling.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 The support line in question is around $44.40, where KO has made a low several times since August if last year. It's plotted in blue on the daily chart.\u2022 Zooming out to the weekly chart of KO, we can see much more basis for the current retreat. Though the stock tried to buck the trend in February, the parallel support and resistance lines that prodded last year's advance and the pullback since November have been in place since 2013.\u2022 If the floor around $44.40 fails to hold up, the pattern says Coca-Cola stock could slide all the way back to the longer-term floor around $42.20.With nothing more than a quick glance, Johnson Controls looks like a decent long bet. It pushed its way back above its 200-day moving average line last month, and though last week it looked like it might fall back under it, the bulls stepped up to the plate on Thursday and Friday when most other stocks were getting thumped.When one takes a step back, however, it becomes clear that JCI shares still have a massive hurdle to clear. Crawling above it could be a huge bullish catalysts, but doing so would have to break a long-standing pattern.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 The 200-day moving average line is plotted in white on both stock charts. That line served as a ceiling late last year, but failed to hold the rally back last month.\u2022 Although they're not perfect, Johnson Controls shares have been guided lower since early 2017 by a falling set of support and resistance lines, plotted in yellow.\u2022 Ironically, the worst thing that could happen here is a decisive one-day breakout thrust that only invites profit-taking thereafter. The more sustainable advance out of the channel would be slow and calculated.Near the middle of last month we  were stuck in a narrowing range, but struggling to move higher even within that range. Most of its moving average lines had started to keep rally efforts in check.Nothing really changed in the meantime. Though it took some time for the grandmother of all moving averages to get full bearish traction, that finally happened last week, in spades. Though we may see a bounce effort today, some major damage has been done. One more rough day could push CTXS over the edge.Click to Enlarge \u2022 With Friday's good-sized loss, Citrix has broken below the lower edge of a converging wedge pattern that has contained the stock since the middle of last year.\u2022 Bolstering the bearish case is repeated resistance at the white 200-day moving average line, most evident on the daily chart. After so many failed attempted to clear it, the bulls finally gave in.\u2022 The bounce from Friday's low is noteworthy, as it matched the low made in October. The bulls may have drawn a line in the sand there.

Here's why, and what to know.After Monday's action it would be easy to say Citrix Systems is stuck in a range, and not moving any particular direction.A closer look, however, reveals there's something of a method to the madness. Slowly but surely, the bears are chipping away, and a downtrend is already in development. A little more weakness could seal the deal, and drag shares below a huge - and relatively new - technical floor.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 On both stock charts, it's now clear that CTXS is moving into the end of a converging wedge pattern that will force traders to make a commitment.\u2022 The stage is already set, however, for downside. The purple 50-day moving average line has already fallen below the white 200-day moving average line, and as of Monday Citrix shares are back below off of their key moving average lines.\u2022 The lower boundary of the wedge pattern, currently just above $100, will possibly halt any downtrend. If it doesn't, though, there's little that could bring an end to a wave of profit-taking following last year's big runup.The better part of the past several months have looked and felt nothing more than choppy for Vulcan Materials Company. But, as was the case with Citrix Systems, there's been something going on beneath the surface. The brewing bullishness has become clearer within the past few days.There's just one more hurdle to clear before the budding rebound effort fully takes hold.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 Since November of last year, the gray 100-day moving average line had been holding Vulcan shares down. Last week, VMC moved above that line, and remained above that line when the sellers pushed back.\u2022 The last line in the sand is $105.40, plotted in yellow on both stock charts. The bears have capped all the rally efforts since early January at that level.\u2022 That's more likely to happen than not, however. There has been decidedly more (and above-average) buying volume than not over the course of the past couple of weeks. The Chaikin line move above zero in mid-January.Finally, a week ago we explored how Micron Technology shares were  , and had just cleared another key technical hurdle. Though impressive, and telling, we wanted to see the move survive a major test.That's happened in the meantime. The sellers took a shot the next day, and continued to dig on. As of yesterday, though, the buyers took back control right where they were supposed to.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 The big line in the sand is plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts, though the more detailed daily chart indicates there's a second, minor resistance line that's also been cleared.\u2022 Although down on Monday, the selling stopped at the blue 20-day moving average line and the buyers started to wade back in to leave shares above the gray 100-day moving average line.\u2022 The \"clincher\" here is now the next move higher, to confirm that Monday's bar was indeed a pivot back into an uptrend.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: The Motley Fool.

We think this will result in a more efficient use of your time in what we know is a very busy night for you.Now, let's turn the call over to David, our President and Chief Executive Officer. -- Thank you, Traci, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. All of our key performance metrics came in at or above the targets we provided. And importantly, our subscription model transition accelerated. It's a great way to end what was a truly transformational year for Citrix.Across the organization, we're aligning to drive acceleration of our subscription transition and sustain top-line growth. Our value proposition to customers is that our solutions subtract away complexity and simplify how work gets done. Similarly, we've eliminated complexities within our own organization to make it easier for our customers and our partners to do business with us. The foundational work that we've done and the changes that we continue to fine-tune support the exciting growth opportunities we see for Citrix in the years ahead.Our history and leadership in desktop and app virtualization provides Citrix with the unique cornerstone within large enterprise customers. Customers around the world employ our virtualization products, many of whom also leverage Citrix networking solutions as a natural extension of the workspace, a key component of application performance. That said, we believe our penetration in our existing customer base is only 25% or 30% of the available seats. We believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on our longer-term opportunity to both expand within our install base and also to attract new customers.The proliferation of applications, the top of mind criticality of security and the rapid expansion of mobile devices on cloud has set the stage for the need to adopt a unified and secure workspace. We believe Citrix is well positioned to help our customers maximize the productivity, the engagement and the satisfaction are their most valuable resources, their employees.Within our workspace business, we have an opportunity to dramatically expand our footprint within our current customer base. Beyond those, who require virtualization to really everyone within the organization. We believe this concept will enable us to serve a substantially higher portion of enterprise knowledge workers. Not everyone requires the highest level of performance, security and reliability that virtualization provides.The construct of a dynamic more general purpose workspace enables Citrix to become a ubiquitous utility, upon which even the lightest application users can benefit from the intelligence, automation and security that the workspace provides. For example, secure SaaS enables enterprises to support a growing number of SaaS applications, while ensuring there's no data leakage. With single sign on, enhanced security for SaaS apps, web filtering and analytics, Citrix workspace helps our customers provide a more seamless experience that underpins improved employee engagement and productivity.Longer-term, the general purpose workspace concept represents an opportunity for Citrix to reach a much broader customer base. It also provides a platform upon which our partners can deliver unique functionalities, specific to the needs of different vertical markets and enables us to provide a solution to every user on any platform anywhere in the world.Dentons, the largest law firm of the world is a great example of how Citrix helps customers simplify complexity and provide a great consistent user experience that helps drive productivity. Following a series of acquisitions, Dentons now has around 16,000 employees globally, all of whom have to operate under the various rules, customs and regulations applicable to their locations. Compounding this complexity is a need for flexibility in moving some of their offices entirely to the cloud, while other locations with more legacy infrastructure, we acquire the move to be in a more measured pace and others likely to remain in a hybrid environment for the foreseeable future. This long standing customer chose Citrix cloud services on Azure in partnership with Microsoft because we're the only ones that can provide a seamless, single and strategic solution to help alleviate this business complexity.Similarly, American furniture retailer Our House struggling with the fixed capacity and constraints of its on-premise infrastructure and needed to improve application performance without making big capital commitments. Citrix cloud is helping solve Our House's business and technical challenges by moving workloads between on-premise and cloud locations, enabling the scale up of cloud resources as their business requirements change and preserving their flexibility to mix and match cloud infrastructure in the future.In addition to the opportunity we have to increase Citrix's penetration within our customer base, the organizational changes we've made to accelerate the move to cloud and our subscription model increases our focus and improves our ability to attract new customers. In fact, in the fourth quarter, total bookings from new customers to Citrix cloud delivered strong growth both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. And the number of new customers added to Citrix cloud accelerated dramatically relative to Q3 and more than doubled from a year ago period.For the full year, the number of new customers added to Citrix cloud more than tripled. From a bookings perspective, the customers migrating to cloud continue to gain momentum. We're still in the relatively early stages of moving our current install base. In 2018, less than a third of our cloud bookings came from migrating install base with the majority of bookings coming from either new seats or net new customers.This success is a direct result of a number of initiatives we executed in 2018, all of which are aligned against our broader mission. First was accelerating to the cloud. From product development and innovation to sales, marketing and back-end supporting functions and infrastructure. We're now organized, we've made the transition, so the cloud is a priority. Second is unifying our portfolio. Not only did we unify our products roadmap, but we've also simplified our messaging and our naming conventions that enable us to up-level conversations with our customers to the C suite. We continue to pivot our selling motion toward emphasizing the value of our complete solutions rather than just selling point products.The third area is about expansion into new opportunities. In our workspace business, we're moving from organizing work to really guiding and automating work. In networking, we're expanding our analytics capabilities to address the challenges inherent in complex hybrid multi-cloud environments. We also executed a few technology tuck-in acquisitions. One for real-time internet traffic management and another for intelligent consolidated access to workspace activities and integrations with a number of business critical apps. These acquisitions accelerate our roadmap and demonstrate our commitment to making thoughtful strategic investments in innovation.Our overall growth in '18 was clearly driven by the workspace, which delivered the fastest bookings growth since 2012, with products and subscription bookings up in the teens. I expect work base to continue to lead Citrix's growth as we progress through 2019. Networking, of course, continues to be a cyclical industry with some secular trends that are worth noting. Today, a large majority of our networking revenue is being derived from hardware. While we continue to support our install base, we're clearly putting the investment and our focus on the subscription software piece of our networking business.As you know, the value of hardware revenue stream is very different from that of the higher margin revenue generated by subscription software. And, of course, at its heart, Citrix is a software company and increasingly a subscription based recurring revenue software company. Our networking strategy is to focus investments in the faster growing software business. The future of networking, of course, is software and we're working to position Citrix as the long-term beneficiary of this secular shift.Consistent with this hardware related volatility, our SSP segment tends to be the most variable part of the overall networking business. In Q4, SSP accounted for only about 15% of total networking bookings, down about 15% year-on-year. We continue to expect this to be the case in '19 due to the sporadic purchasing patterns of a handful of hyper-scale customers. That said, we're confident in the longer-term growth opportunities within networking software.We're positioning Citrix to benefit from the evolution of network architectures from monoliths to microservices and across platforms with hybrid multi cloud environments. This is an opportunity for Citrix to provide platform agnostic flexibility, performance and a consistent experience, regardless of where applications reside. These opportunities in both our workspace and networking businesses combined with our increased investments we're making in product development, marketing, demand generation and our growing number of quota-carrying reps and channel partners gives me the confidence in our outlook for the years ahead.Today, I believe we have the best product portfolio we've ever had. We're solving real complex customer challenges and we're focusing on customer experience and customer success in a holistic way to drive better outcomes for our customers and, of course, for Citrix. Our strategic partnership with Microsoft is stronger than ever and we continue to collaborate in development and go-to-market and benefit from a great symbiotic relationship. And we continue to deliver both strong financial results and innovation, while driving continued progress in our subscription model transition.With that, let me turn it over to Drew to review our financials and guidance in more detail. Drew? -- Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining our call this afternoon. As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan. Our subscription mix accelerated to over 50% of product bookings in the quarter, up from 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. For full year, subscription bookings accounted for 42% of total product bookings.As we enter the next phase of our subscription model transition, we know it would be helpful for you to better understand the components of our subscription revenue. So we'd like to provide more transparency into the SaaS portion of our subscription revenue. This will make it easier for you to track the progress of our Citrix cloud revenue stream over time.Internally, we continue to prioritize SaaS, which has grown to more than $270 million in 2018, which is approximately 60% of our subscription revenue and growing faster than total subscription revenue. In the fourth quarter, SaaS revenue grew to $78 million, nearly 10% of total revenue.Going forward, we believe SaaS revenue will be one of the most important measures of the evolution of our business model and the important KPI for the progression of our subscription transition. As such, we plan to provide the SaaS component within the subscription revenue on an ongoing basis, beginning in the first quarter of 2019. Importantly, this will also serve to isolate the variability that comes from the parts of the subscription revenue that are more susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. For example, the on-premise term and transaction elements within subscription revenue are subject to seasonally softer periods, like the first quarter.With more of our business migrating to the higher value recurring revenue stream associated with the subscription model, more of our business booked in the current period will be recognized in future periods. This can be monitored in the data provided on our future committed revenue or deferred and unbilled revenue as seen on our supplemental disclosures. Our future committed revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Please note that the adoption of revenue accounting standard ASC 606 creates an approximate 200 basis point headwind to our fourth quarter 2018 deferred and unbilled revenue compared to that of the fourth quarter of 2017.In the fourth quarter, revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, driven by subscription revenue growth of 45% from the year ago period, which accelerated from the third quarter. It's important to note -- to highlight that the subscription model transition had a dampening effect on the fourth quarter reported revenue of approximately 150 to 200 basis points.Workspace revenue of $557 million increased 6% from the year ago period and increased 6% for the full year. Workspace subscription revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter. In fact, year-over-year, workspace subscription revenue increased more than 30% in every quarter during 2018. We continue to be very pleased with the underlying strength of the workspace business. Our leadership and vision in workspace, as David described, is clearly resonating with customers. As Citrix cloud offering and ability to support hybrid cloud environments, it's helping us both expand within our existing customer base and attract new customers to the Citrix platform.In the fourth quarter, subscriptions accounted for over 60% of workspace product bookings versus 42% in the year ago period and 57% in the prior quarter. We are tracking well ahead of our original transition milestones in this business.Within workspace, content collaboration revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. Please keep in mind that this was the final quarter in which we will separately break out revenue for the ShareFile business. As discussed on prior calls, this business has evolved to more of an integrated file sync and sharing solution for our enterprise customers as opposed to primarily addressing the stand-alone SMB space. As such, content collaboration results are now integrated into our workspace business.Networking revenue of $206 million declined 4% year-over-year due in large part to the cyclical ordering patterns at the large hyper-scale providers. In fact, the decline in the SSP business negatively impacted networking revenue by approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the year ago period. Despite this SSP's headwind, we were able to exceed both top and bottom line expectations. For the full year, total networking revenue increased 3% compared to the full year of 2017, and increased from 4% to 9% of the total.Looking ahead, as the mix within our networking business transitions away from hardware, it will create pressure on reported revenue. As we progress through this mix shift transition, the growth of networking subscription revenue will be a more meaningful reflection of the underlying performance of this business. In the fourth quarter, networking subscription revenue more than doubled year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That said, we are earlier in the transformation of our networking business to the subscription model relative to the transformation of our workspace business.The momentum in our business remains strong, particularly considering the 150 to 200 basis points subscription mix headwind as well as the previously noted $20 million SSP headwind. We continue to be pleased with the underlying growth of our core software business in the mid to high single-digits on a year-over-year basis.Turning to the geographies, subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew more than 40% year-over-year in the Americas and in EMEA, and it nearly doubled year-over-year In APJ. For the full year, revenue in the Americas accounted for 58% of total revenue, EMEA accounted for 32% and APJ accounted for 10% of the total revenue for the full year. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 35% and was 32% for the full year, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Recall that adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by the restructuring actions we took in October of that year to realign the organization to better support our subscription model transition and enable us to more aggressively invest in innovation. The lag between the time of the restructuring and the time it takes to ramp thoughtful and disciplined investments and the business explains the variation in adjusted operating margin relative to the year ago period for the quarter and for the year.Looking ahead, we will continue to balance expanding profitability with investments to improve our long-term sustainable growth trajectory. In the quarter, cash flow from operations was approximately $206 million and down from the year ago period. This year-over-year decline reflects the impact of the timing of cash collections as a result of our subscription model transition. As a consequence of the rapid subscription model ramp, more revenue and more cash flow will be recognized and collected in future periods. The primary offset of this is unbilled revenue, which increased over 300% during FY '18 to over $325 million. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1,035,000,000, up 7% from 2017. We expect full year cash flow from operations to continue to grow year-over-year in 2019.Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and investments. During Q4, we repurchased approximately $380 million of shares, thereby completing our $2 billion share repurchase commitment announced in November of 2017. We currently have $770 million of share repurchase authorization remaining.In the fourth quarter, we also paid our first quarterly dividend, returning an additional $47 million to shareholders following our Board of Directors $0.35 per share dividend declaration. As mentioned on today's earning release, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid later this quarter.Now, turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, consistent with our multi-year strategy, we expect continued momentum in the adoption of our cloud services. We are reiterating our full year 2019 guidance, which includes revenue between $3.08 billion and $3.09 billion, adjusted operating margin of 31.5% to 32% and adjusted EPS of approximately $6. This guidance reflects our belief that subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will increase from just over 40% last year to as much as 55% in 2019. This mix shift creates a revenue headwind between 150 and 200 basis points during the year. This guidance also contemplates a headwind from networking hardware. The timing of this networking hardware headwind is the primary driver of our first quarter guidance. We currently anticipate revenue between $700 million and $710 million. Adjusted EPS of approximately $1.15 to $1.20.To provide some context with regard to the quarterly progression through the course of 2019, please keep in mind that the first quarter is always the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for Citrix. However, we expect strong workspace growth in the quarter, primarily driven by Citrix cloud subscriptions. Given the visibility of the timing of the networking hardware orders into a concentrated number of hyper-scale customers, we expect the headwind to the first quarter of revenue to be more pronounced. As mentioned, orders from these customers are volatile, but it's helpful to look at them. Historical seasonality of our results for the ramp of margins and EPS throughout the year, it is important to note that 2018 results were positively impacted by our 2017 restructuring and the adoption of ASC 606. As mentioned earlier, operating expenses in the first half of 2018 benefited from the restructuring actions taken toward the end of 2017 and reflect the lag in time it takes to reinvest in the business.As such, in the first quarter, you should expect to see bookings, revenue, adjusted margin and EPS at the lowest point of the year. In other words, 2019 operating margin expansion and EPS growth will be weighted toward the second half of the year due to normal seasonality. Our continued shift to subscription revenue and our recent investments in building sales capacity.With that, I'd like to open the call up for questions.(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. David, 2018 was a really good year for Citrix that the transition seems to be coming about nicely. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit just looking at your 2020 free cash flow target and where you just came in for 2018, which was pretty close to that, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the 2020 targets and potentially 2022 based on where you currently are? Thank you. -- You bet, Heather. Just to remind everybody, we -- about a year ago when we laid out our multi-year plan, we put a target for 2020 as $7 per share of free cash flow. Clearly, as Heather pointed out, '18 was a really strong year. Our over performance led us to the point where we're nearly there already looking backwards. So we're going to exceed that target in 2019 easily a year ahead of that plan. This is despite all the current headwinds from the success we're having transitioning the business (Technical Difficulty) well ahead of our original plan, at least a year ahead at this point. -- Great. Thank you very much. -- You bet. Thank you.Thank you. Your next question comes from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great close to the year. David just wanted to focus on workspace services. If you look at sort of just your numbers this year, that's been really the area of upside. And you talked about, I think, the best growth since 2012 and then Drew even talked about sort of, I believe, an expectation of potentially continuing to mid to high single-digit growth there. I guess, sort of what's changed that we're returning back to those sort of '12 growth levels and sort of that forward confidence in growth? Is it product? Is it the pricing side? Is it, call it, just the unit growth? I mean, just maybe kind of help me through the puts and takes there? -- You bet, Phil. So just to remind everybody, what we talked about on the call, I mean, workspace as our largest business, which had bookings growth in the double-digits and that's been accelerating over the last couple of years. So we're really happy with where we are and we expect double-digit performance again in 2019. So what's happening is that, overall, we've just laid out a really compelling vision for customers and we've been able to articulate not just incremental value around the workspace for how we're organizing work and we're helping secure and manage a lot of their applications, bringing together content into really a clean simple solution. But we've articulated this vision now for what I described in the prepared remarks as really general purpose. And so what that means in simple terms is that we're adding value to non-virtualized use cases as well. So now we've got a full package of the workspace that could be applicable to every user in every enterprise, not just that current 30% that today is using virtualization, but more of a ubiquitous platform that allows us to go wall to wall. And as we're successful driving that penetration, we can add a lot of incremental value with new engagements and new solutions on top of that for customers. So it's a combination of more focused and direct selling. Our sales teams did a great job in 2018. The best products that we've ever had and I think the most compelling vision both for virtualization capabilities and now outside, and that's what's driving that business recovery overall. -- Got it, thanks. And also just David on the go to market, wondering if you can comment there because obviously the margin has been strong this year. If you look at just sort of the sales and marketing to the product ratio and just the bookings ratios, it looks like you've had good productivity. A similar thing, what was driving that? How you're thinking about sort of sales productivity as you enter '19 here? -- Yeah. Phil, overall, we -- as part of our overall transformation is people remember. We're moving from being a, what I would describe as more of a project based or bottoms up sale to much more of a strategic tops down sale, engaging with the sea level. That's the motion we've been driving our field organization over the course of the last 18 months. Along with that, we're able to do larger transaction size. So we closed a record number of million dollar plus deals last year, over 300 of them, a record number of eight-figure deals and also the largest transaction in the company's history. And so all that is just really the result of all of these individual steps we've been taking along the way because of that we're actually getting better productivity. The second reason we're getting better productivity is part of the transformation, we've simplified the story. We've simplified exactly the message and the value prop we're bringing for customers and we've simplified our product portfolio, frankly, and removed the non-strategic elements that just weren't adding value. -- Okay. Thanks, guys. Congrats. -- Thanks, Phil.Thank you. Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. -- Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Can I start on the networking side? Obviously, like the issues with the big service providers and with the Internet service providers has been going on for a while. What gives you the confidence like that that would at some point resolve during the year? Obviously, there's been other guys that kind of sell into that spending area, have been kind of being somewhat cautions about that in 2019. Can you just talk a little bit toward that? Thank you. -- Sure, Raimo. So let me put a little context around that. So if everyone recalls, a minute ago, we reiterated our full year guidance, but we shifted Q1 to account for the timing of SSP hardware. That's really the only volatile part of our business because workspace is kind of rocking up into the right at this point in time. And so when we engage with hyper-scale, we generally have a demand intent for the full year. So we have a pretty good understanding of what their capital requirements are going to be for a full year period of time. And it just becomes a little harder to predict the exact quarters in which those will fall. We just happen to know Q1 in particular is not a large concentration of purchases for that small group of customers. So we understand the full year, but what I'd say about overall demand and that segment is that SSPs have been declining in the aggregate for about three years now, they're down in the low double-digits and we are assuming that that's going to be based in 2019. That's been in our plan and our guidance as well. So we're pretty much spot on in '18 from our expectation. Directionally, it's a combination of their infrastructure is just becoming more efficient over time combination of more of those capabilities moving toward software. So it's a kind of combination of those two dynamics, but contemplated in our plan and our outlook. -- Okay, perfect. And then the -- I don't know if I missed that, but can you talk toward the Citrix service provider program? Like -- I know, like you -- Drew, I think you wanted to give us more detail, but I'm not quite sure how much more I got from you? So ShareFile, you gave me a number for the last time, could you talk about the service provider program, please? -- Well, Raimo, let me take that question and maybe frame it a little bit because what's really important here is the subscription line of revenue. That's the line where it's reflecting the more ratable elements of our business. And so remind everybody that as we've discussed on prior calls, our subscription revenue includes three components, SaaS revenue, which is from Citrix cloud, that's the largest and fastest growing component. Second is the transactional revenue from CSPs, which continues to grow nicely. And then term licenses for on-prem license sales. You can think of that as kind of a bridge to the cloud. And so what we're doing going forward is we're breaking those out, so that everyone can see with more clarity exactly what's going on in the SaaS part of the business. That is most reflective of our actual strategic evolution and that removes some of the noise that happens quarter-to-quarter with consumption based programs like CSP and term licenses that have a little bit of an accounting adjustment that influences their recognition. Those tend to frankly be more seasonal in nature. So that's why we're isolating that. I'd encourage you to go back and look at our presentation that we laid out because we gave all of the historical quarters for 2018 and allow you to model that really effectively going forward. -- All right. Perfect. Appreciate that. Thank you. -- You bet.Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Mark, please check your mute button. -- I apologize. I was on mute, I was trying to keep it quiet. Okay. The move from hardware to subscription and networking is obviously a headwind to revenue. I think you said about $20 million, but the margin of subscriptions should be higher in the networking business. Can you give us a sense of how much of a tailwind to margin this has been? And how we should think about its impact on margins going forward? And then I got a follow up. -- Sure, Mark. I mean, Mark, if you think about the overall dynamics, I mean, it's clear to everyone that as application architectures change and where applications are being run, whether those are on on-premise or on cloud, the networking industry is changing, more and more value is going to be delivered via software. And that's why our solution has always been to approach networking as a more of a hybrid multi-cloud. So really what that means is we've got a software based solution that can be deployed in the form factor of an appliance, virtual appliance, in a container, et cetera. And what we're seeing from our customers is more and more of those purchases are coming from the software form. That's really a reflection of the hybrid multi-cloud phenomenon. For us, when we talk about margins, in the aggregate, if -- across the company, margin has a little bit of a pressure forward, but there's two dynamics going on. So you'll see margins coming down a little bit. The reason they're coming down is because we're moving from extremely high margin software business on a perpetual basis to cloud. That's really kind of function number one. That's offset as you pointed out by less hardware and more software on the networking side. So those -- that actually helps and provides a tailwind. But in the aggregate, in general, the bigger shift is the one from on-prem to cloud and so I think you should expect to see some gradual pressure on gross margin over the next several years as we drive the success of that transition. -- That's helpful. As a follow up. Long-term deferred seems to be increasing at a slower rate than previously, may be I missed this out in the -- all the data gave us. But is there a billings duration decrease occurring or is there no 606 issue? How should we think about that? -- Mark, what's going on is really the transition from our prior model to our new model. And so what we've been talking about all along is more -- less about deferred revenue and much more about unbilled revenue. So everybody's clear. Our typical Citrix cloud contract is a three-year contractual commitment with annual billings. And that's why we are looking at this huge growth in unbilled revenue. Historically, we'll billed all that upfront. But in the new model, it's much more of this combination of unbilling deferred. So when Drew talks about future committed revenue, that's the number he's referring to. That's the number that was up about 12% year-on-year, it now sits at nearly $2.2 billion and that's the one to keep an eye on. And I think when you add that change to a reported revenue, that gives you a very good approximation of the underlying bookings growth in the company. So that's more of how the business is progressing. Just to do the math for you, that shows that the underlying business is growing in the mid to high single-digit range. -- Perfect. Thank you.Thank you. Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open. -- Hi. Two questions. First just maybe a quick one on the networking side following up on Raimo's question. As we look at the growth maybe for the full year that you're expecting, I think you grew about 3% in '18. Are you still expecting growth in aggregate in your guide in that networking business? -- To be determined on the hardware piece how quickly that goes. We're certainly looking for growth in bookings and overall bookings on the networking business, the question is how much shows up as subscription versus hardware. If that dynamic changes materially, then we'll come back and talk about that with the benefit of hindsight. -- Great. And then just David on the subscription in workspace, could you help us understand how customer usage, you've talked about kind of the term licenses are sort of an intermediate, that's the cloud and then Citrix cloud has a number of value propositions. Where are customers in terms of recognizing the sort of different stage value propositions around ultimately adopting and consuming Citrix cloud? -- Well, the value prop around Citrix cloud is changing pretty rapidly. I'd say a year ago, most customers were looking at Citrix cloud as a hosted control plane to simplify the management of their on-premise virtualization. And honestly, that proposition wasn't that compelling. I mean, it sounded expensive to a lot of customers. Fast forward throughout 2018 and we have articulated a much broader story. And in fact, there's over a dozen services live as part of Citirix cloud to be able to optimize on-premise, should they want that. But more importantly, so much net new functionality, whether we're talking about analytics or unified endpoint management or content collaboration or secure SaaS applications and all these other solutions inside the workspace. So that's one of the reasons why at the end of the year, our trade up motion has started to really uptick and I expect that to be a strong motion throughout '19. So that entire value proposition is really changing. So the customers that are adopting right now are not doing it to simplify an old virtualization deployment. Frankly, we're encouraging them to leave that as is. This is really about that broad general purpose expansion that I referenced earlier, how do we go much broader and deeper on those accounts. And then over time as they move their workloads, the virtualization workloads to the cloud, then we can provide a lot of incremental value on top of that. And I look at that honestly as a phase two. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Thank you. Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Hey, Drew. Could we go back to the progression of the total revenue growth rate throughout the first -- throughout the year? Obviously, we're starting Q1 at roughly 1% growth, given your guide, and you mentioned the full year will be 4%. So it needs to accelerate in quarters two through four, but it sounds like the primary headwinds, the subscription transition and these net scalar issues are likely to persist throughout the year. So I'm just wondering, if you could pinpoint the key growth drivers because your compares actually get modestly tougher actually in the next two quarters? Thank you. And I've got a follow up. -- Sure. Sure, Karl. It's really the timing of the SSP and the timing of the SSP orders, how they come in. And again, that's been a very cyclical business. And then the second thing is really just the ramp of the subscription. -- Yep. And the recognition of all the booking, how that recognizes exactly. -- Okay. Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question is just on the geo performance. Americas has done really well over the last I think three or four quarters, up 6% to 8%, I think it was negative 1% in the quarter jus  ed. And I'm just wondering, if you could put your finger on what might have caused the de-sell on the Americas side? Maybe it was more heavily skewed to this SSP net scalar issue. But maybe, if there's anything else going on? Thank you. -- That -- you have it Karl, it was SSP. -- Okay. Got it. Thank you both.Thank you. Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the questions. And I kind of want to follow up on the 2020 targets that Heather alluded to earlier in the call. I think one of the targets out there was around subscription revenue being around 40% of revenue and we're at -- we sort of stand at 16% today. So I wanted to better understand whether that was still the target going into 2020 and what that progression could look like from 16% to 40%? And I had a follow up, if you don't mind. -- Sure. Let me put it quickly. As you saw, we went from 10% to 15% and we haven't started to move the install base yet. So that's really what's going to drive the more substantial uptick. Net new customers, net new seats, that businesses is homing. I think we've talked a lot about that, that's what's driving a lot of the unbilled and deferred. But the trade up program from install base, right now we're less than 10% of the install base looking back a year or so. So as we put more focus on that in 2019, that'll provide some incremental tailwinds there. So I'd say we're directionally on track to where we'd like to be at this point. We're a little bit ahead from a bookings mix standpoint and that'll translate into recognized revenue as we go forward. -- Got it. It's very helpful. And then in terms of looking at -- we've -- since we've had at least a couple of quarters, actually several quarters of the subscription transition, do you have any sense of how the renewal rates on subscription sort of compare to? Historical renewal rates on maintenance? Are we looking at sort of a 90% plus rate or is it sort of more in line with traditional maintenance? Any sort of on characterization there would be helpful. -- Not enough data points to really call out a trend yet, most of these are three-year commitments. But I will say that a lot of the investments we've been making over the last few quarters and we will in '19 is around the customer success themes and those that really work hand in glove with customers to make sure that they're driving adoption, first off. And second, they're driving value out of the solutions they purchased. That also positions us, as you'd imagine, much, much clean -- much more cleanly to be able to layer in incremental new revenue streams as we introduce new capabilities. -- Appreciate it. Thank you.Thank you. Your next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. My question has to do with just transition to subscription. And I guess, I'm just a little confused because I mean to me, I don't think that's new. I mean, that's something you've been talking about or that's something we've been seeing any way in the market. And I guess, like Drew, you gave us some like headwinds because of that and I just -- I guess, I want understand, I appreciate that you're giving us that, but is it -- is there something else too that's happening, like you did talk about the large hyper-scale customers and we understand that that's been happening for a long, long time too and we understand that that can cause some volatility, but it's not nearly the volatility that used to be as far as what we used to see in that business. So I'm just -- there's a lot of questions around this, especially this next quarter's guidance relative to what's happening for the year. And I just -- I don't know, it just seems like there's something else going on here. I just want to make sure we're not missing something. -- John, it's David, I'm not sure what you're looking for actually. There's really only two things going on. We've moved from up to 42% of new bookings coming from subscription. We're 30 -- mid 20s and then much lower two years earlier. And so, Drew talked about the incremental headwind that comes from moving from 40 last year to 55 plus this year, couple of hundred basis point headwind on revenue growth, incremental to where we were and then it's just a matter of the networking business as we refer to. SSP a little bit lumpy and then gradually over time hardware shifts into software. It's not really a dynamic. I think the easiest way to understand economically the change in our business is look at the change in deferred and unbilled right next to the recognized revenue numbers, it's probably the best way to just measure how many economic dollars are coming in. -- Yeah. But, David, the deferred and unbilled and I appreciate that and you're not the only company that's saying to look at that. But frankly, depending upon the duration of the contracts and if that were to change, things like that, it's -- and without a lot of historical information, it's really hard to just place our faith in that number right now. But I guess my question has more to do with -- you gave guidance and you had given us an idea of guidance and after the last quarter for next year too and it sounds like you're sort of maintaining that, which is good to see. But at the same time, with the first quarter being a little bit lighter than at least we had, obviously, you hadn't given guidance for that and not raising that. I'm just trying to -- I just want to make sure that we're not missing something. So you didn't lower guidance for the year, I get that, that's good. And I guess, it just -- you just feel like the same way you felt about the business when you gave guidance last quarter. This is kind of what I'm trying to get to. And I'm sorry for rambling there, but I'm just trying to -- I deal with a lot of -- there's a lot of information about what headwinds were happening, but those headwinds aren't new. You've been doing that, that's what you've planned for, I believe, unless those were incremental headwinds that you just didn't expect to transition to subscription, but I don't think that's right. Right? -- Hey, John, I am not sure if that's a statement or a question, but... -- It's a question. -- I'm not sure where the skepticism comes from on deferred and unbilled. I'll tell you, our standard cloud contract is simply three-year commitment annual billings, I mean, that's what we go with and we -- that is the vast majority of contracts. So I'm not sure... -- But that standard has changed, that's changed over time and it could change for any company. And given what we do and with all due respect, David, you're very straight forward, you always have and I appreciate that. But given what we do, we know that could change at any time. And it often does, it has for year-over-years too. So -- and that's where that skeptic is. And it doesn't -- just for Citrix, I mean, that -- I'm skeptical about that for any company. I think everybody should be. But I don't know, we can talk about that offline. I don't want to go into that too much. -- It can be a better better topic offline. But I mean, I'll tell you the way that I'm looking at the business from a tops down standpoint as what are the dollars that customers are committing to and what are the value they're driving from our solutions and how does that compare to the year prior. So internally, our focus is entirely on product and subscription. That's the direction we're driving the business. We thought that giving more granularity in the subscription line is the easiest way to have the transparency into that because, like you said, there's occasionally noise in contracts like on-prem term and so we'll just give you the details, so you can look through it. And if there's follow up questions, then let's take those offline. -- Okay. Thanks a lot David. Thanks, Drew. -- Thanks, John.Thank you. Your next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hey. David, a question for you. Microsoft seems poised to launch Windows desktop virtual service on top of Azure. How is the changing relationship with Microsoft? And could at some point customers begin to persist that service as an alternative to Citrix rather than compliment to Citrix? -- I think the way everybody needs to think about Azure Virtual Desktop, which is the name of the platform. I mean, that is analogous to Windows Server platform when it comes to our business. That's the way to think about it. And for the last 25 years, our products, our virtualization products that is have embraced and extends the standard the Windows Server platform. As Windows become subsumed by Azure, we now embrace and extend the Azure Virtual Desktop platform. It's the exact same analogy to where we've been over time. So I think it's fair to say that that platform always gets higher functionality as time goes by. That hasn't changed in decades now. And so our strategy is always for that part of the business to embrace and extend. And we work with Microsoft on a collaborative basis for new initiatives, like desktop as a service. We're the only vendor that is going to be announcing -- well, has announced and going to be delivering a native data service on top of Azure, where we can bundle Azure capacity and sell that as one turnkey solution. I think that's a -- right now, that is not a large part of the overall market, but we recognize that there are use cases, where that is an important solution to have. That's why we're building those together. So overall, I mean, we're working very collaboratively with them both on the development side and on the go to market side and will continue to, not just in virtualization, of course, but in areas like virtual WAN and mobility and mobility and many others. -- And David, as a follow up, coming out of the Partner Summit couple of weeks ago, what was the feedback from partners generally speaking? And what is the focus around incentives with partners this year 2019? Thank you. -- Yeah. I'd say it was, as somebody who's been to last 17 summits, it's been -- it was one of our best ever. I mean, I'd say that the alignment across the go to market teams both partners and Citrix badge is as high as it's ever been and the enthusiasm is good because they were successful in '18. The incentive changes that we made with partners are modest. Last year in '18, we made pretty material changes to move them away from traditional models, where they get paid to renew maintenance and things like that really toward net new product, net new subscription. And so the next phase of that that we introduced in '19 is starting to put more incentive around actual usage of those cloud solutions because it's really critical that customers see success in their purchases. So now, one of the steps is to continue to drive active daily use of those products. And so as customers are successful then the partner gets an additional incentive on the back end of that. That's more just continuous engagement overall. We took them through a lot of this very similar messaging and then other content, which was under NDA, but really talking about this new broad market opportunity that exists by the extended general purpose workspace, where we gave them detailed roadmaps of where we're going on the intelligent workspace and that just gives them a lot more flavor for how the TAM is going to double over time and how we are moving into really higher growth market opportunities. -- Thanks you for the color, David. Appreciate it. -- Thanks, Nikolay.Thank you. Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. -- Yeah, thanks very much. David, maybe just actually another one coming off the back of your Partner Summit. Obviously, a lot of people concerned about sort of weakening economic conditions in places like Europe and Asia-Pac. And given you guys have a pretty broad purview of those regions, anything changing from your perspective, from a macro perspective or are the secular trends sort of powering over any macro noise in your view right now? -- I think noise is a right way to put it. I mean, it is a headwind. If you look at it specifically within our public sector business, state and local are much larger parts for Citrix than federal. But I think it's reasonably to -- reasonable, at least, to assume that there's going to be some broader impact at some point. I mean, I can't point to it quantitatively, but qualitatively there's conversations that everyone's having just trying to understand the potential impact on their business, whether it's from US shut down, whether it's from global changes with Brexit or whether it's things like ongoing political volatility. So there's conversations out there, but we're anticipating that conditions in '19 are roughly similar to what we saw in Q4 timeframe when this was already a pretty hot topic. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe actually on Windows Virtual Desktop, I think the plans to now launch it in the spring, I'd imagine having that much of launch activity around is obviously a positive thing for you all. I guess, any chance that as customers to serve evaluated and understand better how you guys sort of to your point extend the technology? Any concern you have that that could actually be a pausing function for folks or do you think there's not -- you've done enough around the go to market that you feel good about just sort of the joint marketing effort around that that shouldn't change buying decisions or anything like that? -- I think this is a movie we've been in many, many, many times over the years whenever any new platform comes out. And so one of the things that we did at our partner kick off a couple of weeks ago was have a senior Microsoft executive on stage with our teams really talking about the joint solution and the fact that our enterprise customers, the typical people that we sell to, really need Citrix capabilities. And that's why we go in and we do these things together because Citrix is successful, we bring through a lot of Azure capabilities, we bring through O365, we bring through lots of others. So it's a very symbiotic relationship and we're just spending a lot of time together as organizations in the field talking about that dynamic. -- Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, David.Thank you. Your next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks very much. David, last quarter, you talked about the expectation of having a record quarter of large deals in 4Q, was that the case? -- Yes. -- And I don't think you guys provided the number of million dollar deals this quarter. Could you give us that? -- Yeah. Off the top of my head, I think it was 125. We'd have to follow up with you to confirm that number. -- Sounds right, but let's follow up. -- Okay, thanks very much. -- You bet.Thank you. And your next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. -- This is actually Robert Majek on for Michael today. I know it's early, but how has feedback been so far on the offering you recently launched to help MSP deliver SD-WAN to their customers? -- Yeah. We've been talking about SD-WAN much. I mean, it's a small part of the business, but it's growing. And to your point, we've done a couple of things on that that are focused on kind of creating and expanding a new MSP channel, which is -- it's early, it's really starting to get traction. We've done some things with our channel programs and we've done a few things like with Microsoft, where we were basically the preferred virtual WAN provider on Azure. And so I think that market is evolving in a fairly interesting way. I mean, really right now the types of deployments that we're seeing from customers are really focused on optimizing SaaS performance, enhancing a lot of the delivery, resiliency and performance of things like Office 365 and those types of capabilities. And I think that's where that market evolves as well. -- Thanks a lot.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for question-and-answers. I will now turn the call back over to David Henshall, President and CEO for closing comments. -- Thanks, again, everyone, for joining us this evening. Let me just leave you with a few final takeaways. Clear that fourth quarter results cap off a really important year for our overall transformation. We exceeded expectations across all metrics, despite some of the cyclical headwinds and networking hardware the areas that we've talked about. Our subscription model transition is accelerating, as we've said, it's evidenced by subscription revenue at 45% in Q4, the fact that unbilled and deferred revenue is up well over $200 million year-on-year and the other metrics that are supporting that overall. So clearly, we're excited about the opportunity to drive growth in the years ahead and capitalize on the opportunity to further penetrate both our existing install base as well as really using the general purpose workspace concept to attract net new customers, net new opportunities looking forward. So from -- come back in three months, provide you with an upgrade on those initiatives. Everybody, have a good night and talk to you soon.Thank you for participating in today's Citrix conference call.

The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording average positive earnings surprise of 11.3%.In third-quarter 2018, Citrix delivered non-GAAP earnings of $1.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15 cents. The figure surged 14.8% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues increased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $732.5 million and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $723 million.For fourth-quarter 2018, Citrix anticipates momentum in the adoption of subscription-based solutions to continue.Citrix raised guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now expects revenues between $2.95 billion and $2.97 billion (up from previous guidance of $2.92 billion and $2.95 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.96 billion.Moreover, non-GAAP earnings are now projected in the range of $5.55-$5.60 per share (previously $5.30-$5.40 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $5.57 per share.Notably, the company's shares have gained 15.5% year over year, substantially outperforming the  's rally of 11.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Citrix reported 55 transactions worth more than $1 million in the las  ed quarter, primarily from technology, healthcare and government sectors. Robust adoption of unified workspace solutions and hybrid cloud offerings are key catalysts. Traction witnessed by ShareFile is also notable.The company also continues to focus on enhancing its subscription based solutions with new capabilities. In the third quarter, Subscription revenues surged 37.1% from the year-ago to $111.5 million. Management stated that 50% of new product bookings in Workspace services were subscription based.Workspace services revenues in the last reported quarter increased 7% year over year to $462 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Workspace Services and Desktop Solutions revenues in fourth quarter is pegged at $492 million, compared with the year-ago figure of $480 million.Citrix recently acquired Sapho in a bid to empower company's comprehensive Citrix Workspace suite with guided work capabilities. Reportedly, the company completed the buyout for approximately $200 million in cash.Sapho's clientele comprises notable names including the likes of Broadcom, CBS Interactive, evo, among other customers. Additionally, integration of Sapho, which the company anticipates to conclude around second half of 2019, is expected to enhance Citrix's workspace capabilities. This in turn is likely to aid the company's revenue growth, going forward.In a customer-friendly move, the company had purchased Cedexis - a web monitoring company. Apart from expanding the choices to Citrix's customers, the deal offers increased flexibility aimed at improving its operational performance and efficiency.Citrix has expanded its business through partnerships with established sector players. Citrix, in collaboration with Microsoft  , provides services enabling enterprises to deploy Windows 10 desktop systems and other apps, and tools directly on Azure cloud platform, consequently simplifying the implementation of new workspaces.In collaboration with Nutanix, Citrix devised a scalable hyper-converged infrastructure (\"HCI\") solution aimed at enhancing productivity through minimized infrastructure complexity. The company has also extended the application of ShareFile workflows and connectors to Google Drive and G-Suite, as part of its ongoing alliance with Google.Moreover, the company has deployed its Cloud services including XenDesktop and XenApp on Oracle Cloud Marketplace. This is likely to lead to new customer additions, consequently generating incremental revenues.We believe the synergies from buyouts, strategic alliances and focus on adding innovative features to its subscription offerings are likely to act as tailwinds for fourth-quarter results.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

Non-GAAP earnings of $1.40 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15 cents. The figure surged 14.8% on a year-over-year basis driven by robust increase in orders and revenues, and improved operational efficiency.Citrix reported 55 transactions worth more than $1 million in the reported quarter, primarily from technology, healthcare and government sectors. Solid adoption of unified workspace solutions and hybrid cloud offerings are key catalysts. Traction witnessed by ShareFile is also notable.Notably, shares of the company have returned 21.3%, outperforming the  's rally of 14.6% on a year-to-date basis.Moreover, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording average positive earnings surprise of 11.3%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.2% and a market cap of $14.38 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio at least for now.Citrix recently acquired Sapho in a bid to empower company's comprehensive Citrix Workspace suite with guided work capabilities. Reportedly, the company completed the buyout for approximately $200 million in cash. The deal was announced on Nov 15.Sapho, a startup based out of San Bruno, CA, develops micro applications by integrating access to activities, tasks and tools across consolidated work feeds, consequently bolstering employee productivity.Sapho's clientele comprises notable names including the likes of Broadcom  , CBS Interactive, evo, among other customers. Additionally, integration of Sapho, which the company anticipates to conclude around second half of 2019, is expected to enhance Citrix's workspace capabilities. This in turn is likely to aid the company's revenue growth, going forward.Notably, Workspace services revenues increased 7% year over year to $462 million in the third quarter due to rapid adoption of unified workspace solutions. Management stated that approximately 50% of new product bookings were subscription based.On the back of ongoing workspace trends of Bring Your Own Devices (\"BYOD\") and increasing mobile workers, among other factors, the desktop virtualization market is anticipated to accelerate in the near future. Small and medium enterprises, healthcare companies and increasing popularity of desktop virtualization across Asia-Pacific remain key growth drivers in the space.In fact, per Orbis Research data as revealed by Reuters, the desktop virtualization market is projected to reach $8.96 billion by 2023 from $4.98 billion valued in 2017at a CAGR of 10.3% from 2018 to 2023.We believe acquisition of Sapho will enable the company to fortify its competitive position in the rapidly growing desktop virtualization market.In a customer-friendly move, the company had purchased Cedexis - a web monitoring company. Apart from expanding the choices to Citrix's customers, the deal offers increased flexibility aimed at improving its operational performance and efficiencies.Citrix has expanded its business through partnerships with established sector players. Citrix, in collaboration with Microsoft  , provides services enabling enterprises to deploy Windows 10 desktop systems and other apps, and tools directly on Azure cloud platform, consequently simplifying the implementation of new workspaces.In collaboration with Nutanix  , Citrix devised a scalable hyper-converged infrastructure (\"HCI\") solution aimed at enhancing productivity through minimized infrastructure complexity. Nutanix's InstantOn solution complements Citrix's cloud-based XenApp and XenDesktop solutions, empowering customers with a cost-effective high-performance solution offering seamless access to desktops and applications.The company has also extended the application of ShareFile workflows and connectors to Google Drive and G-Suite, as part of its ongoing alliance with Google.Moreover, the company has deployed its Cloud services including XenDesktop and XenApp on Oracle Cloud Marketplace. This is likely to lead to new customer additions, consequently generating incremental revenues.We believe the extended collaborations augur well for the company in the long haul amid the digital transformation era, wherein enterprises seek to find a common ground between on-premise and cloud infrastructures.Citrix repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares during the third quarter. Moreover, roughly $398 million is still remaining under share repurchase authorization.The company increased ongoing share repurchase program by $750 million and announced the first-ever quarterly dividend payment of 35 cents to be paid on Dec 21, 2018.These initiatives are anticipated to bolster investors' confidence in the stock. | However, Citrix is facing increased competition from all product group segments. Citrix Workspace solutions compete with VMware's Horizon, Workspace ONE, and AirWatch offerings and Amazon Web Service's (\"AWS\") Amazon WorkSpaces, Microsoft (particularly post the acquisition of FSLogix), among others.Considering networking solutions, the company faces competition from companies including the likes of F5 Networks, Fortinet, and AWS. Citrix's content collaboration offering, ShareFile directly competes with Box, Dropbox, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, among other companies. Intensifying competition negatively impacts pricing power, which is likely to keep margins under pressure.Nevertheless, acquisitions and partnerships are anticipated to help Citrix rapidly strengthen presence in the desktop virtualization market.All these factors are reasons enough to retain this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in investors' portfolio at least for the time being.

Autodesk also announced the intention of its largest acquisition, $875 million, for PlanGrid, a maker of construction-productivity software.\"It's a story about the evolution of Autodesk, the promise of the cloud, and how any company of importance needs to have a software-as-a-service element,\" Autodesk CEO  told  in a phone interview.His plan, to pivot Autodesk from  - and Emmy-winning computer-aided-design software maker to a cloud and software-as-a-service subscription model for \"people who make things\" such as buildings, roads, movies, games, and bridges, has led to a record $2 billion in fiscal 2018 revenue and guidance for $2.5 billion in its current fiscal 2019. Its stock has nearly tripled to $135.04 per share from $47 in September 2015, giving it a current market value of $29.5 billion. (It was up 9.7% on Wednesday alone.)Anagnost did not make changes blindly: Before becoming Autodesk CEO in June 2017, the former rocket scientist worked in product and marketing for 20 years at the 36-year-old company, based in San Francisco.Anagnost and Chief Financial Officer  wanted to flip Autodesk's reliance on software licenses, which accounted for 60% of its total revenue as recently as 2013, to a subscription model, while at the same time implementing a cloud-computing platform to make it easier for contractors, architects, and engineers to collaborate on building projects. Today, 96% of Autodesk's revenue is via product subscriptions.The story is eerily similar at Herren's previous employer, Citrix.Another long-time employee took over the reins as CEO about a year ago, and devised a plan to transform the virtual-private-network company to a hybrid-cloud solution one while also shifting to a subscription model.CEO , a 15-year company veteran who previously was chief financial officer and chief operating officer, told  that Citrix is \"well ahead\" of its plan to double revenue by 2020.The 29-year-old company's third-quarter  marked its fifth consecutive quarter of beating Wall Street expectations. Citrix recorded earnings of $1.40 per share and revenue of $732.5 million. Subscription-based revenue jumped 37%, year-over-year, to $112 million, and now accounts for 15% of total revenue, versus 10% a year ago.The results pushed shares of the company up 2% the day after it announced results. In the past 12 months, Citrix has gained more than $2.5 billion in market value, to its current $14.4 billion. Shares closed up 0.7% on Wednesday, to $106.89.The secret to its success? \"We want to help customers face the future of a mobile work force,\" Henshall told  noting a recent  that predicts a shortage of 90 million to 95 million medium-to-high-skilled workers globally by 2020. \"Companies want to embrace the cloud, but it takes a while to manage the past while embracing the future.\" Jon Swartz at The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: The Motley Fool.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's third quarter 2018 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Del Matto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.This presentation is being webcast on Citrix Systems Investor Relations website, and the webcast replay will be posted immediately following the call.Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website.I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the US securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on our Investor Relations website.Furthermore, we'll discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.Now, I'd like to turn it over to Drew, our EVP and CFO. Drew? -- Thank you, Dawn, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Our transition to the cloud continues to gain momentum, driving our Q3 revenue growth rate, which about doubled over last year. Financial highlights include: revenue grew 6% year-over-year, led by subscription revenue growth of 37% year-on-year. Our adjusted operating margin was 32%; adjusted EPS was $1.40 per share, up 16% versus last year; and cash flow from operations was $301 million, a record -- a Q3 record growing 18% over last year.Q3 was a typical back-end loaded quarter due to summer time seasonality around the world. This impacted the timing of revenue from cloud and subscription transaction, both of which closed in late September. The result was a deceleration in the subscription revenue growth rate from our second quarter. We expect subscription revenue to reaccelerate in Q4 as we'll see a full quarter of revenue from our September transactions, plus the benefit of the typically more linear bookings quarter.Our Q3 Enterprise business was solid, as we closed 55 $1 million-plus transactions with concentration in healthcare, technology and government sectors. We saw strength in our cloud and subscription offerings across our portfolio, particularly in Workspace services as customers embrace our future of work vision, driving higher productivity and employee engagement. All of our geographies grew at a consistent rate with the transition of Enterprise to our subscription offerings strong across all regions.Citrix's cloud simplified hybrid-cloud adoption, providing the same infrastructure on-premise or in the cloud. Customers are realizing the value of reduced infrastructure complexity, better overall user experience, increased security, faster access to innovation and flexibility to align with their business initiatives.Next, let's take a closer at Q3 results within our primary businesses. Workspace services maintained its momentum, growing 7% year-over-year to $462 million. This was driven by a continuation of recent trends toward our unified Workspace and CSP offerings. Within Workspace services, subscriptions were roughly half of the total Workspace product bookings mix in Q3.We also saw stable results in the Networking business. Networking revenue increased 5% year-on-year to $195 million in Q3, with subscription revenue increasing 95% over the last year. This reflects the strength of our hybrid cloud offerings, providing the flexibility and performance and visibility as Enterprise would anticipate and execute their cloud strategy.Our content collaboration revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. As we discussed over the past year, ShareFile is becoming more of an integrated file sync and sharing solution for our Enterprise Workspace customers, moving away from its prior focus on just stand-alone [ F&B ] space. As such, the reporting of the content collaboration results will be integrated within our Workspace business during 2019. We'll provide more details on our Q4 '18 .Let's now turn to operations. Our adjusted operating margin was 32% in Q3. We'll continue to balance, expanding our profitability with the investments needed to support growing pipeline and sales capacity as we transition the business model. As mentioned, cash flow from operations was $301 million, up 18%, bringing our trailing 12-month cash flow to $1.1 billion. Deferred and unbilled revenue combined grew $187 million or 11% over last year. Unbilled subscription revenue grew nearly 330% or $140 million versus Q3 of last year. Deferred revenue was $1.68 billion in Q3 of '18.Please note that the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard ASC 606 creates about a 300 basis point headwind that you will need to adjust for when comparing deferred and unbilled revenue for Q3 '18 to Q3 '17.At the end of Q3, we have approximately $2.5 billion in cash and investments, and repurchased approximately 1 million shares in the period. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $750 million for share repurchases. This brings our total current authorization for repurchases to approximately $1.1 billion. Since we announced our $2 billion share repurchase program in November 2017, we've repurchased approximately $1.6 billion at an average price of approximately $91 per share. We expect to complete the remaining $370 million in share repurchases during our Q4.As you can see from our announcements, Citrix's Board of Directors also declared a dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid this quarter. Additional details can be found in today's release.Now turning to guidance for Q4 '18 and the full year. In line with our multi-year strategy, we expect to see continued momentum in the adoption of our cloud services and subscription-based offerings. As such, we are increasing our full-year guidance for 2018 to include revenue between $2.95 billion and $2.97 billion, adjusted operating margin of 30.5% to 31.5% and adjusted EPS of $5.55 to $5.60 per share.We'd also like to provide an initial view into our expectations for FY '19. Please note that while we are still working through our planning cycle, which is typical at this point in our fourth quarter, in 2019, we plan to continue investing in go-to-market capacity, demand generation, innovation and the infrastructure areas necessary to scale our cloud services.At a high level, as we now, we are currently looking at FY '19 revenue growth to be about 4% and adjusted EPS of about $6. Very important to note that behind these numbers, we are assuming that the mix of subscription as a percent of product bookings increases from 40% this year to between 50% and 55% next year. This incremental mix shift will create a 1 to 2 percentage point headwind to the revenue growth rate for next year.For quarterization, I would encourage you to look back at the historical seasonality of our results for the ramp of margins and EPS throughout the year. 2018 results were skewed due to our 2017 restructuring and the adoption of ASC 606. 2019 operating margin expansion to EPS growth will be skewed toward the second half due to normal seasonality, our continued shift to subscription revenue and our recent investments in building sales capacity. We'll provide more detail on our next  in January.And now I'd like to turn the call over to David to give further color on the quarter and our areas of focus moving forward. David? -- Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As Drew noted, Q3 was just another good quarter outside the financial expectations, while we continue to execute on the transformation across the Company. More importantly though, customers and partners embracing our strategy will be driving a multi-year plan. Despite the headwind from the ongoing mix shift, reported numbers were once again really solid, largely due to the strength of new product bookings for Citrix Workspace. As you heard, our reported revenue growth doubled over last year, while at the same time, the contribution from subscriptions increased from 12% to 15% of total revenue. (inaudible) of cost discipline, and we delivered a lot of upside against both [ margin ] and EPS goals. It's good performance for Q3, which, as Drew pointed out, historically has some seasonality due to the summer holidays around the globe.In the quarter, our Workspace business continue to lead our execution. What's happening here is that the vision we laid out last year for delivering a general-purpose digital workspace is resonating. Customers are seeing that Citrix adds a lot of value in long-term initiatives in terms of simplifying hybrid cloud environments, improving security and accelerating the adoption of new innovation.Additionally, due to the support of all major platform providers, we give customers the flexibility to migrate workloads to and among the clouds of their choice. In total, Citrix Cloud now includes more than a dozen services with options for SaaS and hybrid models as well as services for those customers with only on-premises implementations to help them manage and monitor their infrastructure much more effectively.As we talked about last quarter, customer momentum has really stepped up after our Synergy sales conference in May. We've had great feedback regarding the alignment and clarity of our strategy as well as the record volume of new innovations and announcements that we made with great partners like Microsoft, Google, ServiceNow and Samsung.Our message has been focused on the future of work and how we help lower IT infrastructure costs while delivering higher employee productivity and engagement. The current cloud mobile era of technology has created really unprecedented flexibility in compute and in work style opportunities. However, most of our customers we see need to deploy a variety and discrete point product solutions to help manage this; an approach that frankly is just really complex and very expensive. Our focus has been to help them extract away as much of the complexity associated with these niche products as possible and highlight the benefits of our complete integrated solutions.As we promised, all the new innovations that we unveiled at synergy were released for general available during Q3. And over the next few quarters, we'll be working with customers on the adoption of the Workspace app, providing access to all of their applications and content needed to be productive across all users in the Enterprise. This includes differentiated capabilities such as federated identity, unified experience, out-of-the-box integration with leading SaaS apps, a broad approach to universal endpoint management and if required, access to Citrix virtual access desktops from an easy-to-use all-in-one interface.Most importantly, we're now delivering a digital workspace for general-purpose use, which is assuring that every employee has access to everything they need to be productive, all-in-one package. Every employee, every app on any network. This translates into greater value and productivity for customers and expanded market opportunity for Citrix. And in September, at Microsoft Ignite, we announced the development and planned release of a new cloud-based desktop-as-a-service offering, positioning us to gain share in the fastest growing segment of virtualization market. This Citrix DaaS offering developed on top of Windows virtual desktop and hosted on -- with Microsoft Azure enables businesses to deliver services and a turnkey end-to-end solution built with our market-leading HCF technology to provide maximum performance. So stay tuned for further announcements on the future launch dates. Lots of excitement from innovation across the Board.So turning back to Q3, let me talk about a couple of large transactions that highlight the discussions that we're driving with both new and with our existing customers. The first is a 150-year-old banking organization operating in the Western US. They've been a longtime XenApp and XenDesktop customers, delivering virtualized applications, VDI. They stared evaluating Citrix cloud earlier this year as part of their corporate hybrid cloud strategy. But after Synergy, they started looking at the new workspace app as a potential way to unify existing branch office applications and widely used SaaS-based applications into a single access and user experience.As their our evaluations progress, they also embraced Citrix content collaboration as a way to deliver secure content to branches and Citrix analytics to provide an enhanced visibility and security with their allocation usage. This evaluation concluded with a roughly $1 million of subscription transaction for our cloud service using the current customer transition program we put in place several quarters ago.Ultimately, we are not only modernizing the management of their virtual apps and desktops, we are expanding to new users with improved experience and security with additional use cases in SaaS, web and mobile apps.Second example I want to highlight is a global food and beverage company. This company was hit hard by malware outage last year, impacted a large number of employees for over two weeks. They asked Citrix to propose a solution that supported existing BPO projects using as-a-cloud, while at the same time new use cases of BYOD and mobility, all from a single platform. And, of course, security was a paramount concern.Final solution we landed on was a three-year agreement for the Citrix cloud access, providing high availability to applications with an evergreen infrastructure that's continuously managed and updated. Additionally, secure global access and two-factor authentication to be enabled with our virtual networking, allowing them to also retire the current VPN solution for simplification and cost reduction.Here's a couple of examples of how our focus on delivering experience, security and choice are proving to be so valuable for both new and existing customers and why we're winning these types of opportunities. In this example, we also demonstrate how our customers are committing to us for multiple years, fully validating the direction as part of our current and future roadmap.So let's talk about networking for a minute as revenue in this area was stable in Q3. However, on a bookings basis, the hyper-scale SSP segment was actually relatively weak, down about 20% year-on-year with the Enterprise segment growing in double-digits. In total, the mix for SSP was 21% compared to 27% of mix a year ago. As we've been discussing over many quarters now, the SSP business is highly concentrated and therefore can be pretty volatile on a fourth quarter basis. Our strategy has been to invest in the larger enterprise market, addressing traditional ADC use cases, hybrid multi-cloud and DevOps as data center architectures are gradually shifting more toward micro-services. Our software-based approach here to networking gives us strong flexibility to help customers migrate to this evolution.Another good example of this in the third quarter was a European mobile network operator and a current ADC customer. Historically, their use of ADC has been fairly simple and pretty straightforward. However, as they look forward, they've requested a proposed solution that was not just an at-the-ready, but really more future proof from an architectural standpoint. The final solution that we delivered and closed as a $2 million contract will include both physical and virtual networking products integrated with full capacity licensing to enhance their mobile network and provide additional capabilities like TCP optimization, content filtering and others.This exemplifies how our shift to software-based networking and more (inaudible) scalable licensing is a step in the right direction and helping grow preferences in this market.Finally, there's several new SD-WAN wins in a variety of areas, including cross-sell to existing workspace customers to improve the performance of remote sites, optimize HDX traffic and other capabilities. While still relatively small part of the overall business, SD-WAN is growing pretty rapidly right now. We've launched a number of products in go-to-market initiatives to help support managed service providers, Microsoft virtual WAN and Office 365 as well as deeper integrations into our Workspace service.So as we exit this year, I feel really good about our momentum and purpose. We are more aligned and more focused on the customer success than ever before. Clearly, the financial results are well ahead of our multi-year targets and proving that we can drive a cloud transition and accelerate both revenue and margins. So a really powerful combination. It's clear that our customers are looking to operate in a multi-cloud, hybrid-cloud world, and Citrix is clearly positioned to provide simple, secure and unified solutions to help them address these challenges and simplify their roadmaps. We're excited about the future and confident of progress we've made so far in 2018.Thank you very much. As always, we look forward to your questions.(Operator Instructions) Philip Winslow. -- The question to the team just on Workspace services because obviously you saw another quarter of a mix shift toward subscription. I think you said 57% versus 34% in the year ago quarter and then 50% last quarter. It's obviously we're seeing that shift there, but if I look at just the revenue numbers that you're putting up as well, continued strength there even just with the shift toward more ratable (inaudible) sort of on a balance sheet and unbilled. So I guess the question is if you look at the past few quarters, what sort of, I guess, just driving that overall strength and reacceleration in the Workspace services business? Is it going back to some of these big customers you have engaged with a while, like the example you gave, and sort of, I guess, catching up on demand there? Just maybe sort of color on what's driving that mix should be great. -- Sure, Phil, it's David. So a couple of things. Overall Workspace bookings on a ACD basis are up double digit this year. So we've seen the underlying business dynamics really move up. And what's driving that is a combination of a couple of things. For those customers that are focused on virtualization and VDI, that side of the house, I mean, we just continue to develop against our underlying strikes, the best performance, the best security, the best manageability. So all that is continuing to move forward. Citrix Cloud is a real driver though. I mean, it not just get allows for -- even traditional install -- on-premises customers to have a number of services that help optimize the underlying infrastructure, provide health checks, just give them much more flexibility, much more simplification and then the ability to stay current and adopt our new innovation. The bigger strategic direction though is as we talk about the future of work and we talk about the Workspace and everything that, that's going to be able to address, we're unlocking non-virtualization use cases. You'll hear me talk a lot about general purpose, and what that means is it's really the idea of creating more of a general-purpose workspace platform that is now applicable to every user in every enterprise regardless of whether you need virtualization or not because of new capabilities to deliver security to SaaS, deliver security to mobile apps and really provide an integrated experience across any device. So it's a broader -- the overall broader strategy and articulation that's really helping uptick the market overall. -- Got it. And then just one follow-up to that. I mean, obviously, in Q2, you had substantial big wins, but just $1 million and the megasize wins. So this quarter seemed to be a bit broader in terms of where the strength came from. Just wondering if you give us some color on sort of what you're seeing on the sort of the big deal upfront, particularly in terms of pipeline as well as just the sort of the breath, I guess, for strength, it seems to be coming back as well. -- Yes. Big deals in general where good. They're down a little bit sequentially from Q2 to Q3. It's always our seasonally weakest quarter and almost back-end loaded quarter, so that's nothing unexpected there. I would -- wouldn't be surprised if we see a record number of large deals coming out of Q4 really across all geo's and all enterprises. You saw in the reported numbers, we've got good balance across the three geo's right now. So it's not really concentrated, it's just general strength.Michael Turits. Excuse me, Michael, your line is open. -- Sorry, I was on mute there. A question for you, David. I just wanted to get a better sense on NetScaler and SD-WAN space and kind of what the traction has been like? And then in particular, who you're going up against, is it's Cisco and VMware mainly? -- Well, I talked a little bit about networking overall in my prepared comments. You know, SD-WAN, it's a pretty crowded market space right now, it's fairly nascent. So it's not moving the needle too much and therefore the growth rates are large, but it's off a small base. What we're focused on there is a couple of things. Optimizing the work space where we can just continue to help with delivery to branches, optimizing HDX traffic and more things that we're doing fairly recently though, haven't really impacted the numbers yet. With Microsoft around the Virtual LAN, optimizing O365, providing solutions for MSPs, a number of those are really future investments. So I'd say stay tuned on the SD-WAN piece. It's a little bit more of a future at this point. Going back to the big business on the rest of the networking, it's really a tale of two segments, more than anything else. The SSP segment, as everyone knows, is highly concentrated and therefore, it is always really volatile quarter-to-quarter. Q3 was one of those quarters that it was down pretty sharply, it was actually down about 20% year-on-year when I look at -- underlying bookings represented just 21% of the overall mix versus the Enterprise, which was up about low-double-digits in terms of demand. So that's been a function of our strategy though as well. I mean, we knew that the SSPs when concentrated for a long time, so we've been investing much more broadly around expanding capacity in the Enterprise, making sure that we have a really strong story around hybrid-multi-cloud, the ability to really be flexible with licensing across physical and virtual environments, a number of those initiatives that we've talked about many times. So I'd say competitively, the landscape hasn't changed too much. It's a lot of F5 in the traditional ADC category and then a number of vendors when you talked about emerging markets like SD-WAN. -- Got it. And then one other thing I want to touch upon. Just as you increased that mix shift to subscription, just any update you can provide on the channel and the go-to-market strategy there would be great. -- Yes. I mean, the overall strategy doesn't change that much. I mean, we've obviously been going through a lot of work with our channel that really help them understand what -- where we want the channel focused in, let's call it, the Cloud First World as you look forward to a number of years. So I'd say channels in transition in a lot of ways. Those partners that had made the transition toward being CSPs and really embracing subscription and such as cloud are doing extremely well. They have -- heard reported growth rates that are much, much stronger than maybe even our overall business. Those partners, however, that are more historically focused and oriented toward renewing maintenance agreements, that's more of a challenging transition. We've certainly put the incentives behind the strategic direction of the Company, and we're going to keep pushing there over the next couple of years. We are doing more direct touch as you'd imagine as we sell more cloud services, and we have been continuing to build out our direct go-to-market now for a few years. And so you'll see us continue to do that as well.Raimo Lenschow. -- This is actually David on for Raimo. First, thanks for clarifying the subscription revenue bookings linearity this quarter, that makes sense. Maybe more of a high-level question, first for David. Since the Microsoft announcement about entering the desktop-as-a-service market, I'm curious to see what you heard from customers so far? And maybe longer term, how do you see that relationship with Microsoft evolving? -- Yes. The relationship with Microsoft overall continues to be great. I mean, we do so many things across Azure, across Citrix Cloud, across inter-operability, whether it's on the networking side, on the mobility side and then obviously on the Workspace side. So as Microsoft continues to evolve their platforms, it used to be called RDS, now it's as a remote desktop, we'll continue to build on top of those platforms and just extend the service for customers. The thing we announced, however, just at Microsoft Ignite was two important points. One was we'll effectively become a Microsoft's CSP in some dimensions. Really what that means is that we can now provide more turnkey complete solutions, bundling in Microsoft capabilities along with Citrix, native dash service built on top of Azure. We haven't announced exactly when that product is going to be GA, so stay tuned for that as well. But it's just you know a continuation of the relationship we've had for a couple of decades now. Feedback from customers has been, \"love to see it, anxious to get our hands on it\", and that's pretty much where we are. We'll, of course, be doing that on a white-glove basis over the next quarter or so and then talk much more about GA as we go forward. -- That makes sense. And maybe if I may, a quick follow-up on the transition. In the previous calls you mentioned that the first half of '18 will be focused more on net new customers and net new Whitespace for Citrix's Cloud and Subscription and that TTU motions would kick-in in the second half of the year. Just curious what you're trending here and what kind of the split between net new customers versus existing base you've seen this quarter? -- Yes. TTU continues to be a small minority in the overall number, and that's by design. And so when you -- if you step back and think about it strategically, we wanted to make sure that we're generating a lot of momentum in net new accounts and net new use cases. It maybe an existing customer, but just outside of what I would consider there, traditional virtualization deployment. So that's how you should think about where we've had the focus. Now as we go forward though, I mean, TTU is a Trading up and Transitions, what the acronym stands for. It's just a combination of helping those customers today that have a virtual deployment, operate it much more efficiently and give them the ease to adapt hybrid-cloud in their own environment and give them the ease to adopt hybrid cloud in their own environment, but also start to expand into much more of these general purpose capabilities that I talked about before. So that will be a bit more gradual motion, and we'll start to ramp that in Q4 and then of course into next year.Nikolay Beliov. -- David, I just spend some time talking to customers while you're hearing in terms of the micro environment, emerging economies, Brexit, Italy, all the moving pieces globally going on. What's customer sentiment? -- Yes, Nikolay, I'd say overall the general environment is pretty good still. I mean, there's a little bit of noise out there, and we've seen a bit of volatility in the last couple of weeks. But in general, the underlying demand drivers for most people remains strong and so therefore that translates into a pretty good spending environment. Of course, there are discussions going on about mid-term elections, interest rate, Brexit, not the normal things, but I think people are taking them in stride. And we haven't seen a material change in the demand environment. -- Got it. And Drew, just wanted to get a sense for, do you say the unbilled DR for 3Q was $140 million or $240 million? -- Unbilled for Q3 was $243 million. -- $243 million? What was it last year same quarter? -- $216 million roughly. -- No, that was last quarter. -- I'm sorry. Yes, I'm off. It's 50, yes, looking through our color, $57 million. -- Okay. You provided in the supplemental numbers last quarter, different numbers. So I guess -- I'll guess we can go from this offline, but going forward, how do you expect -- talk to us about the seasonality of unbilled DR. Is Q4 going to be the highest and then it tapers down in Q1 and starts building up in 2019. I think that's important for us to help us model subscription revenues using the waterfall. -- Nikolay, let me jump in there because I don't think we have talked about the duration of unbilled revenue yet. We'll provide -- because that's the one piece you just need to really triangulate what you're getting out. So unbilled, just to remind everybody, our typical cloud contract is three years TCV with annual billings. So we build that first one upfront and the other two going to unbilled. As Drew said, unbilled is nearly $250 million right now versus $50 million a year ago. So, I mean, we've had a huge increase in unbilled as we've been driving this transition. So you really should look at that in concert with the actual deferred revenue numbers as well. -- As the mix increase, it continues to increase. That's how to think about it. It follows the mix. -- Yes. And going back to my question about the seasonality, is Q4 going to be the peak in unbilled DR and then it's going to taper down in Q1 and build out throughout the rest of 2019? -- Nikolay, we're not in a position where we're going to give a lot of forward guidance on unbilled at this point in time. So we will talk about it coming out of Q4 and much more seasonality. We've got four quarters of actuals right now and they've all been pretty strong growth. The strongest of the year of course was Q2 this year. We just had blow-out quarter last quarter, and so we wanted to get a little bit more history under our belt before we start forecasting some of these off balance sheet items.Heather Bellini. -- This is actually Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a couple of quick ones from me. Drew, given the revenue and the earnings forecast for next year, and I know we're going to get a lot more detail on this on 4Q, but can you give us a sense of how you're feeling about free cash flow next year? And then, any potential updates on churn metrics given the subscription transition? -- Sure. Well, it's still -- we're still in the middle of -- we're early in Q4, so we're still early in the planning process. And so the first -- in terms of operating cash flow, you could see that it's clearly going -- yes, its still -- its clearly following the revenue, right, as we continue to build the mix up. If the revenue goes up, it's going to follow that, and obviously, the other dimension is as we expand margins, then that just falls to the bottom line. So I think you can get a sense for how we guide in terms of the 4% revenue growth and about $6 a share in EPS should give you some level of guidance and that should pop some number out of the bottom. But I mean, right now, operating cash flow for the quarter was up 18% year-on-year. That's operating cash flow, and then again, we've seen a nice uptick kind of following this trend of the revenue being up along with the margin expansion where we are now. Roughly, I think through Q3, the trailing 12 months is about a little north of $7.50 per share on a free cash flow per share basis. And so we obviously expect that, that should continue to go up as we move toward our 2020 targets, progress against those targets. -- Great. And then any update on the churn metrics? -- No, nothing new there.Keith Weiss. -- This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. I was -- I wanted to do a little bit of a status check relative to some of the initial milestones you laid out last year in terms of your 2020 targets. You talked about hitting, I think you said 50% to 55% of subscription bookings mix in 2019. Does that sort of put you on track in terms of your overall 2020 goals when it comes to subscription ratable mix as well as top line growth? Would you say that you guys are sort of tracking to plan or ahead of plan relative to the framework you introduced last year? -- No, we're well ahead of plan versus the plan that we laid out. In fact, if you look at on our revenue basis, we'll exit this year based on current guidance, better part of a $100 million ahead a plan. Cash flow -- as Drew just pointed out, cash flow from (inaudible) per share is already at $7.60 or so trailing 12. So I'd say we're executing very well. We are going to exit this year at about 40% mix, up from mid 20s last year, mix of subscription versus perpetual bookings. And we will continue to drive that next year. If we can get up north of 55% while it's still a couple of 100 basis point headwind to revenue growth, that's well on the way to our overall goals. I think it's fair that after we exit this year, we'll come back, and going into 2019, update our multi-year goals just -- once we close out the full year. I think it's a good time to do it. -- That makes sense. And then just one quick follow-up. The perpetual license business has been stronger than certainly we've expected the last couple of quarters. And -- any sort of comments that you have on what's driving that strength for the license business given that you've seen some weakness from the cloud service providers and NetScaler? So are we seeing more sort of on-prem Workspace deployments than maybe you guys have initially expected? Any sort of color there would be helpful. -- Yes, I'd say it's two things. Not just client service providers, but we had strength in NetScaler enterprise. And so that part of the business is largely perpetual license, and that's the primary driver there. Workspace, it's well over half subscription these days, but since the overall business is growing so nicely, that means perpetual is growing at the same time. So I'd say it's basically just moving from strength-to-strength.Walter Pritchard. -- This is Drew Foster on for Walter. You've seen some good progress in terms of large Citrix cloud deals book so far this year. And I'm curious to what extent those wins are serving as references to other customers in your pipeline? -- Yes. I mean, as you'd imagine, big cloud customers always want to talk to other ones. So we'll -- on the the public references, we'll talk about publicly, but most of them are private. So we'll connect CIO to CIO. Top 10 deals for cloud in Q3 were all over $1 million each. -- And then, just trying to get a better idea of the CSP business in terms of scale. How does that compare in scale relative to the larger (inaudible) cloud business? -- I'm sorry, did you say the SSP business? -- CSP. -- Yes, CSP, sorry. -- CSP business. Yes, CSP is a minority now. I think CSP business runs $120 million a year roughly. Is that right, Drew? -- That's right. Yes. -- Yes, versus the overall number. -- (inaudible) quarter of the Subscription service. -- Yes.Kirk Materne. -- This is Peter Levine in for Kirk. So I just have one here. Your initial guide for '19, you talked about capacity and infrastructure investments in '19. Can you kind of provide a little more color on what those investments will look like? And then the second parts to that is in the second half of '18 versus the first half of '18, I think you're capacity, your headcount was somewhat flat. Can you talk about the new heads you're bringing on and how do you plan on deploying, is it geography, product-based, and how that would look in '19 as well? -- Yes, as Drew pointed out, we're investing in capacity and the infrastructure needed to ramp our cloud services. So think about that in three big buckets: capacity, (inaudible) and customer-facing people that will be across the globe. As we see opportunity, we'll continue to invest there. Second area would be around the customer success. Those folks will be more responsible for picking up a customer after the initial sale, making sure that they're doing the correct level of enablement, ramping new services, et cetera, just really making sure they're successful. That'll ramp up. And then the third is around just cloud operations, the typical things to manage the clouds. These are already big teams, but I'm sure we'll continue to invest behind that. The one area that we didn't really talk or you didn't ask about is around innovation. That's been a combination of both remixing the types of skills that we've had. We've had a lot of that over the course of last year, but also we're continuing to invest in innovation capacity. As you see, R&D starts to tick up a bit as well. So those types of things, we'll continue to do into '19. -- Operator, any further questions?There are no more questions in queue. -- Great. Well, thanks everybody for joining us. We'll talk to you again in three months.This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

The company recently acquired FSLogix in a bid to gain desktop virtualization capabilities to enhance Office 365 suite. However, the financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.The buyout is aimed at boosting customer experience and productivity. Notably, Office 365 is a subscription plan to access Office applications and other productivity services utilized in cloud services.FSLogix which is based out of Atlanta, GA was founded in 2012. Per Crunchbase, it has raised $10.3 million. FSLogix develops robust software applications that enable enterprises to support virtual desktops in a cost-effective and time saving manner.FSLogix has supported desktop virtualization for clients having less than 1,000 users to enterprises with over 50,000 users. The flagship products include FSLogix Profile Container and other FSLogix Apps. FSLogix has also developed Office 365 Container, for Microsoft. The product is aimed at enhancing Office 365 engagement across virtual desktop infrastructure.Per the home page of the company's website, FSLogix is also Amazon's  Amazon Workspaces partner, Citrix's  Citrix Ready partner, Red Hat partner and VMware partner.FSLogix capabilities are expected to facilitate Office 365 ProPlus performance with faster load times, across multi-user virtual infrastructure, comprising the new Azure-supported Windows Virtual Desktop service which was showcased at  event in September. OneDrive and Outlook users will also benefit from the accelerated performance.Notably, Windows Virtual Desktop service which offers a virtual Windows 10 experience is compliant with Office 365 ProPlus. The new multi-user service is aimed at enabling customers to benefit from the security and compliance features of Azure cloud platform.A virtual desktop supports an operating system in a cloud platform, compared with that on a standalone device. This creates a multi-user environment enabling each user to utilize the required set of applications, in turn enhancing productivity.The desktop virtualization market is expected to accelerate in the near future on the heels of ongoing workspace trends of Bring Your Own Devices (\"BYOD\"), increasing mobile workers, among other factors. Small and medium enterprises, healthcare companies and increasing popularity of desktop virtualization across Asia-Pacific remain key growth drivers in the space.In fact, per Orbis Research data as revealed by Reuters, the desktop virtualization market is projected to reach $8.96 billion by 2023 from $4.98 billion valued in 2017at a CAGR of 10.3% from 2018 to 2023.In this particular domain, Microsoft competes with Citrix, Red Hat (to be acquired by IBM), VMware, among other companies. We believe acquisition of FSLogix will enable the company to fortify its competitive position in the rapidly growing desktop virtualization market.Microsoft is firing all cylinders to catch up with Alphabet's  G-Suite by empowering Office 365. In the last reported quarter, Office 365 commercial revenues grew 36% (35% at cc), driven by strong installed base growth and average revenues per user (ARPU) expansion. Office 365 Commercial seat improved 29% on a year-over-year basis. Office 365 consumer subscribers were reported at 32.5 million, up 1.1 million sequentially.Notably, Office 365 revenues are reported under Productivity & Business Processes segment. The segment revenues of $9.77 billion increased 18.6% (up 18% at cc) from the year-ago quarter. | On the heels of the aforementioned factors, we may conclude that Microsoft is leaving no stone unturned to enhance its Office 365 suite. The new capabilities aimed at boosting engagement, will consequently bolster Office 365 adoption rate. This in turn is likely to benefit top-line growth.Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The reasoning: Change with the times or face irrelevance.More than a year ago, David Henshall, the newly-minted president and CEO of Citrix Systems (), hatched a plan for the company-known for virtual private networks-to radically transform its business by developing a hybrid-cloud solution to help businesses simplify information-technology environments and link their remote employees to corporate headquarters.Citrix made the switch because it saw a market opportunity to help companies deal with the major shortage of workers globally by delivering digital work spaces that allow people to work flexible schedules and even from home.There's a premium on being more accommodating to the workforce. McKinsey Group forecasts a shortage of 95 million medium-to-high-skilled workers globally by 2020, and some 61% of C-suite executives believe access to developer talent is crucial to success, according to a Stripe and Harris Poll.\"We want to help customers face the future of a mobile work force,\" Henshall told  recently over the phone. \"Companies want to embrace the cloud, but it takes a while to manage the past while embracing the future.\"Henshall celebrated his one-year anniversary with third-quarter earnings last month that for the fifth consecutive quarter, exceeded Wall Street expectations-adjusted earnings of $1.40 per share and revenue of $732.5 million. Subscription-based revenue, a cornerstone of the three-year plan, jumped 37%, year-over-year, to $112 million. It now accounts for 15% of total revenue, versus 10% a year ago.The results pushed shares of the company up 2% the day after it announced results; it's up nearly 20.5% for the year, compared with 1% for the S&P 500. In the past 12 months, Citrix has gained more than $2.5 billion in market value, to its current $14.4 billion.\"We believe all the pieces are in place for this cloud transition to manifest along with [increased market demand],\" Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research report. Ives maintains a Neutral rating on Citrix with a $115 price target, which implies about 8.5% upside from the current price.It won't be an overnight success- Dell Technologies' () VMware and F5 Networks () are among Citrix's competitors-but Ives and others note recent Citrix customer wins in health care and banking. At least 10 cloud deals are worth more than $1 million.Henshall says Citrix is \"well ahead\" of its plan to double revenue by 2020, and subscription-based growth will pave the way. He told investors on the company's recent , \"We expect 2019 to be another year of progress against this journey. The most important variable will be our mix of subscriptions to perpetual bookings. This year, we are moving that mix up to about 40%. Next year we want to target 50% to 55%.\" The company also updated its expectations for fiscal 2022, calling for more than $10 per share in free-cash-flow with 75% of new bookings coming from cloud subscriptions.Customers are fast buying in to Citrix's SaaS strategy. One such customer, Formula 1 race team Aston Martin Red Bull Racing, uses Citrix to connect teams of mechanics and engineers at race sites all over the world with its headquarters in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, the day of the race to share and dissect thousands of pieces of data in real time. The souped-up cars, which are modified supercomputers on wheels, contain 150 data sensors that measure aerodynamics and other factors.\"The parsing of data in real time can mean the difference between races won and lost,\" PJ Hough, chief product officer at Citrix, told  over coffee.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is scheduled to report third-quarter 2018 results on Oct 24.The company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, Citrix surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 12.7%.In second-quarter 2018, Citrix delivered adjusted earnings of $1.28 per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. The figure surged 24.3% on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, revenues increased 7.1% from the year-ago quarter to $742.4 million and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $717 million.For third-quarter 2018, Citrix anticipates non-GAAP earnings between $1.23 and $1.26 per share. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged $1.25 per share, representing growth of 2.5% year over year.The company expects revenues in the range of $715-$725 million. The analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $723.1 million, near higher-end of management's guidance, up approximately 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  . Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Citrix has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.48% which raises confidence about a possible earnings surprise. | Citrix continues to focus on enhancing its subscription based solutions with new capabilities. In the second quarter, Subscription revenues surged 49% from the year-ago to $110.8 million. Management stated that 50% of new product bookings in Workspace services were subscription based.Workspace services revenues in the previous quarter, increased 7% year over year to $455 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Workspace Services and Desktop Solutions revenues in third quarter is pegged at $448 million, compared with the year-ago figure of $432 million.Citrix's recent efforts to expand product portfolio are impressive. In collaboration with ServiceNow  , the company introduced Citrix IT Service Management Connector, or Citrix ITSM Connector.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of Citrix Systems Inc (Symbol: CTXS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 26.6, after changing hands as low as $100.53 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 37.4. A bullish investor could look at CTXS's 26.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of CTXS shares:    Looking at the chart above, CTXS's low point in its 52 week range is $80.20 per share, with $116.815 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $100.75.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["itrix Systems (CTXS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This cloud computing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.5%.Revenues are expected to be $723.07 million, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Citrix, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.48%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Citrix will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Citrix would post earnings of $1.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.28, delivering a surprise of +6.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Citrix appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

For the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (Symbol: SPLV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $52.97 per unit.With SPLV trading at a recent price near $47.35 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.88% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPLV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD), Baxter International Inc (Symbol: BAX), and Citrix Systems Inc (Symbol: CTXS). Although HD has traded at a recent price of $189.74/share, the average analyst target is 13.01% higher at $214.43/share.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTXS options chain for the new June 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $93.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $102.34/share today.Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CTXS stock at the current price level of $102.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $105.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.44% if the stock gets called away at the June 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTXS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTXS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $105.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.84% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.40% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 24%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $102.34) to be 16%.

Further, the company's new partnerships with CaixaBank, Bankia, HSBC and Barclays Bank remain positives.However, mounting acquisition expenses, integration risk and intensifying competition in the online payment space are major concerns for the company.PayPal stock has gained 21.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 20.3% rally of the  it belongs to.

The chipset is enabled to support safe autonomous driving level 4 and 5 via capturing a detailed image of the size, location and speed of any object within a range of 300 meters of the vehicle.The company has adopted Synopsys' \"DesignWare ARC EM Safety Island, EV6x Embedded Vision Processor with Safety Enhancement Package (SEP), Ethernet Quality-of-Service (QoS) Controller IP, STAR Memory System, STAR Hierarchical System and STAR ECC Compiler for its new 4D high-resolution imaging radar system-on-chip (SoC).\"The ASIL D Ready features of Synopsys' IP are suitable for the strict safety requirements of ADAS.

It provides critical hardware features for safety along with maintenance of high performance. We believe this will provide the company with first mover's advantage in the market, eventually driving revenues. | Discussions regarding ADAS and autonomous vehicles often veer toward the reliability and safety-oriented issues of the vehicles. In March, one of Uber Technologies' autonomous vehicles killed a pedestrian in Arizona, while undergoing test driving.Following this incident, the governor of Arizona suspended Uber from test driving autonomous cars in the state for an indefinite period. Reportedly, this mishap led NVIDIA  , the manufacturer of hardware for Uber's technology, to stop testing of its own self-driving vehicles on roads.Notably, NVIDIA is currently using NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a virtual reality (VR) based autonomous vehicle simulator that enables the virtual testing of autonomous vehicles in diverse conditions. Hence, safety remains a major concern for the companies dealing with autonomous driving and ADAS.Synopsys' IP solutions are equipped with self-checking safety monitor, error correcting code (ECC) and programmable watchdog timer. Also, the lockstep feature enables rapid detection of runtime faults and system failures and addresses the need for real-time networking between the connected devices.We believe that such initiatives on Synopsys' part will eventually increase its client bases, thereby boosting its top line in the long run.

The company has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.8%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a current market cap of $13.3 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio right now.Let's take a look at the factors aiding the company's performance.Increased adoption of Synopsys' products, as well as strength in hardware segment and IP are aiding the company's growth, as evident from its second-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues that jumped 14.2% year over year to $776.8 million. | Notably, the company is gaining traction from acquisitions. In January 2018, Synopsys acquired Kilopass Technology, a provider of one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) IP with applications in automotive, mobile, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) areas. The buyout is expected to help Synopsys in offering a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions.Synopsys is also reaping the benefits of acquiring Black Duck Software, a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. Black Duck's brand recognition as well as cross-selling options are proving to be accretive to the company's top line.Nevertheless, the company's escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the timeline for realization of acquisition synergies remain headwinds.Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from peers like Cadence Design Systems  , which might result in lower prices and profits for Synopsys.Furthermore, the company has customer-concentration risk, as a small number of customers account for significant portion of its revenues. This could be risky, as loss of a single customer could affect its operating performance significantly and thereby jeopardize results.However, Synopsys' improving top line along with shareholder-friendly initiatives like the recent announcement of buying back $165 million worth of common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program make this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock worth retaining in the portfolio.Some better-ranked technology stocks include The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - June 22, 2018 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Computer Software, including  ,  ,  and Industry: Computer SoftwareLink: The Computer Software industry is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation demand environment.Software has become the focal point of technological innovation. The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT), consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry.Moreover, continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) presents significant growth opportunity for industry players.Notably, the cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems.Additionally, the increasing need to secure cloud platforms, amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking, continues to drive demand for cyber security software.Further, as enterprises continue to move their on-premise workload to cloud environments (emergence of hybrid cloud), application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance. This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud-based environments.Robust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth. These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry's growth prospects.The  , within the broader  , has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13.7% and 19.2%, respectively.We believe the near-term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement.However, the Computer Software industry's valuation looks stretched at the moment. One might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.65, which is close to the highest level over the past year.The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.14 and the median level is 18.28.Moreover, a comparison of the group's P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector's forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.71 and the median level of 20.50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry's respective ratios.Nevertheless, strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top-line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company's earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company's earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year's reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of $3.13 per share reflects solid year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2.6% upward since Mar 31, 2018.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it at the top 25% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising. The group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11.89%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Computer Software's long-term growth prospects are alluring. Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models, rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools, the proliferation of wearables & self-driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry.Moreover, the growing usage of Internet of Things (IoT) at home, in office, for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver. These factors are expected to drive top-line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016.Another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group's gross margin.The role of software is evolving. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage is expanding in managing infrastructure. Moreover, the industry is significantly benefiting from the ongoing cloud transition.SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth due to a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate. Moreover, strong spending by enterprises is a positive.Moreover, software companies are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. This enhanced liquidity is expected to boost their appetite for strategic acquisitions.Despite stretched valuations, investors can build positions in the Computer Software industry based on the above-mentioned factors as well as strong earnings outlook.Here, we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see  .) ,  .: The stock of this Pittsburgh, PA-based engineering simulation software and services provider has jumped 45.1% over the past year.

The buyout is expected to boost Citrix's ability to support enterprise customers as far as their adoption of cloud IT infrastructure is concerned.The company also introduced innovations to its Citrix Workspace to support its clientele better with digital transformation at Citrix Synergy conference.The company also announced a wider choice of devices for its Citrix Endpoint Management solution. At the conference, the company announced its tie-up with Microsoft  to offer Citrix value-add capabilities to be deployed on Azure's Remote Desktop Management Infrastructure (\"RDMi\") platform. Further, the company's XenApp will enable Windows Server 2019 to aid it offer virtualized apps.Notably, the company's Cloud services were selected by WAGO. This new customer addition is likely to generate incremental revenues for the second quarter.We believe the company's buyouts, strategic alliances and addition of innovative features to its offerings are likely to act as tailwinds for second-quarter results.Further, the company's efforts to reward shareholders through share buybacks are impressive.High costs have hurt the bottom line for quite some time. Moreover, Citrix results are susceptible to foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.

According to a study, dividends accounted for an  of the total returns over the past seven decades.This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these worlds - safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis (see:  ).Overall, the S&P 500 companies declared a record  in dividend payouts during the second quarter, up 11% from $112 billion in the year-ago quarter. About 89 firms hiked their payouts versus 67 firms a year ago, while 332 have maintained their dividends versus 347 in the same period last year. Notably, 43 companies have retained the 'aristocrat' status of 25 years of consecutive dividend raises. This is primarily thanks to a strong economy, solid earnings, historic tax cuts and results from the second round of Federal Reserve stress tests.Among the special attractions were Citrix Systems  , which declared a dividend for the first time with a payout of 35 cents, and Dr Pepper Snapple  , which announced a special dividend of $103.75 due to merger activity. Lam Research  , Hewlett Packard Enterprise  , Wynn Resorts  , Ralph Lauren  and Starbucks  were among the firms that hiked dividend payouts (read:  ).The trend is expected to continue in the coming months as most large companies have huge cash piles on their balance sheet and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. Additionally, the new tax law encourages the companies to bring their overseas cash back home at much more reduced rates and distribute parts of it to their shareholders. Per Bloomberg, an additional 75 companies will boost dividend payouts this quarter.Investors should also note that a company which consistently increases its dividend has stronger fundamentals, suggesting rising cash flows, good liquidity and a strong balance sheet.Given this, investors could tap growing dividends in the form of ETFs. Below, we have highlighted five popular dividend ETFs that offer excellent dividend growth potential, any of which could be a solid pick for investor in the long term:This is the largest and most popular ETF in the dividend space with AUM of $27.8 billion and average daily volume of about 797,000 shares.

One of the major reasons behind this could be the company's outstanding third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, encouraging fourth-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 10.5% since it reported fiscal third-quarter results on May 22. The stock has outperformed its  in the year-to-date period. Intuit has rallied 32.6% in the said period, while the industry has gained 17%.The company's results in the last reported quarter benefited from a number of reasons. Management was particularly positive about a successful tax season backed by performance of the DIY category and higher average revenue per return. The company also managed to gain some additional share in the DIY market. Additionally, the shift in its product mix toward the higher end of the company's product line was also a positive.Intuit has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.8%. Backed by the impressive results, the company issued upbeat outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal.The company has two main products - QuickBooks which offer financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax which offers income-tax preparation products and services. Notably, Intuit has been witnessing solid year-over-year growth for the past several quarters in its QuickBooks subscriber base, which is driving Small Business segment revenues.It should be noted that about 29 million small businesses in the United States depend on third-party companies to deal with their financial and accounting related preparation. With its rich product portfolio, Intuit has capitalized well on this opportunity which is well reflected in its previous quarterly results.For fiscal 2018, the company expects QuickBooks online subscriber base of 3.27-3.37 million. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal fourth quarter with a subscriber base of 3.223 million, marking 45.2% year-over-year improvement.The year-over-year increase in online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues, going forward. The innovative features being launched by the company will also aid the top line.The company's Consumer Tax segment revenue has been benefiting from strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products.Intuit's continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The company, during the last , stated that its TurboTax Live offering witnessed success in the first season and is likely to be accretive to the company's Consumer business, moving ahead.The recently-launched Turbo offering that provides a snapshot of a user's financial health also witnessed healthy adoption, which is yet another catalyst for expansion of the company's business beyond tax.Furthermore, its TurboTax products derive high margins which are likely to cushion Intuit's bottom-line results.Intuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and flaunts a  of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive its price.Consequently, we believe the stock has huge potential to surge higher and therefore, investors should consider it for near-term opportunities.Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Adobe Systems Incorporated  , Cadence Design Systems, Inc.  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).

It primarily indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Source: ShutterstockThese stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that a company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners. : It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets.However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. : Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.In order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary  to the screen. (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.) (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company's efficiency.)

It primarily indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that a company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners. : It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. : Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.In order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary  to the screen. (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.) (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company's efficiency.)

The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT), consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry.Moreover, continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) presents significant growth opportunity for industry players.Notably, the cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems.Additionally, the increasing need to secure cloud platforms, amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking, continues to drive demand for cyber security software.Further, as enterprises continue to move their on-premise workload to cloud environments (emergence of hybrid cloud), application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance. This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud-based environments.Robust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth. These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry's growth prospects.The  , within the broader  , has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13.7% and 19.2%, respectively.We believe the near-term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement.However, the Computer Software industry's valuation looks stretched at the moment. One might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.65, which is close to the highest level over the past year.The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.14 and the median level is 18.28.Moreover, a comparison of the group's P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector's forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.71 and the median level of 20.50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry's respective ratios.Nevertheless, strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top-line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company's earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company's earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year's reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of $3.13 per share reflects solid year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2.6% upward since Mar 31, 2018.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it at the top 25% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry's rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks.The long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising. The group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11.89%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Computer Software's long-term growth prospects are alluring. Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models, rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools, the proliferation of wearables & self-driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry.Moreover, the growing usage of Internet of Things (IoT) at home, in office, for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver. These factors are expected to drive top-line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016. . (CTXS): The consensus EPS estimate for this Fort Lauderdale-based virtualization, networking and cloud computing solutions provider has moved 8.2% higher for the current year, over the last 60 days. The stock has rallied 32.4% over the past year.(CDNS): The stock of this San Jose-based electronic product designing solutions provider has jumped 31.8% over the past year. The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has been revised 3.8% upward over the last 60 days. (ADBE): The stock of this San Jose, CA-based software solutions provider has gained 77.9% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 3.6% upward over the last 60 days. Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geopolitics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Here are the details-Microsoft's $7.5 billion GitHub purchase is a very big deal because open source prospects have increased hugely in the last few years. And GitHub is the platform hosting the largest open source community of 20 million members with its storage, collaboration and communication tools.The platform functions through three processes: forking, which allows any user to copy a repository to his own account to develop the idea (GitHub has 57 million repositories); pull request, which is a request to the original owner to accept the change if desired; and merge, which allows the owner to accept the change by the click of a button after also checking the member's credentials and past work done on the platform.GitHub charges through a subscription model that includes unlimited public repositories for all plans. Private repositories cost $7, $12, $22 and $50 a month for Micro, Small, Medium and Large plans including 5, 10, 20 and 50 private repositories, respectively (for individuals). Teams are charged $25, $50, $100 and $200 for Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum plans that include 10, 20, 100 and 200 repositories, respectively. Users can add additional storage and bandwidth, each at $5 for a 50 GB pack.Businesses are charged $21 per user per month. GitHub Enterprise (hosted on a company's own servers, AWS, Azure, or GCP) starts at $2,100 per 10-user seat pack per year, which includes maintenance, upgrades and technical support at no extra cost.And still, GitHub has yet to make a profit, which is why it needs a bigger partner that can provide it with funds and additional resources, while also helping it to market the business and enterprise segments.That's where Microsoft comes in with its deep pockets, huge sales team and enterprise focus. CEO Satya Nadella was very clear about the rationale for the deal. He said that software was increasingly getting into non technological sectors at an unprecedented rate such that these sectors were hiring 25% more developers than the technology sector.Microsoft wanted to capitalize on this trend. It isn't hard to understand that these people would need a platform on which to communicate and collaborate. Microsoft could merge some of its tools into the GitHub platform and market them jointly to its huge enterprise customer base.There are some trust issues as some older developers remember Microsoft's past, when it was the bitterest critic of the open source platform and used its might to ensure that its own paid platform continued to dominate. But as the new GitHub CEO Nat Friedman has said, the company is determined to regain that trust. As developers understand that the success of the acquisition depends on its remaining open source and as independent as it is today, these problems will be automatically resolved.Microsoft is sinking a data center called Northern Isles into the North Sea off the Scottish coastline in an attempt to lower cooling costs in the second phase of trials as part of what it calls Project Natick. Natick is a research project studying the efficiency of data centers. In the first phase, a smaller data center was put on the sea floor off the California coast for 105 days with the goal of seeing whether it was possible to operate such a submerged data center.In this phase, Microsoft is going to study the logistics and cost of operating such a data center, as well as its impact on the environment, including the effect of heating up the waters and disturbing surrounding wildlife. A data center uses just 2% of the energy it receives with the rest dissipated as heat that because of its nature, can't be transported or put to other use.The experimental data center is medium sized at 12.2 meters in length and 3.18 meters in diameter, containing 12 racks housing 864 servers. It has a capacity of 27.6 petabytes, which Microsoft says is as much storage space as five million movies and packing as much power as thousands of high-end PCs. Some of the servers will be kept as standby because repairs won't be possible during the 12 months it is intended to remain underwater.Microsoft says that once submerged, the data centers can be moved with relative ease to the places where it's most required and since most people live by the coast line, this will mean faster games and lower latency for all operations, including self-driving cars.E3 for Microsoft was a statement that the company remains as determined as ever to make good on the ground it lost with the last game console.First, it announced 52 new video games including 18 exclusives, which is a big deal given that exclusives are what differentiates a gaming console. This year, the exclusives included Halo Infinite, Gears 5, Gears Tactics, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Forza Horizon 4 and Battletoads.Second, it announced that some games that had been exclusive to Sony's  console, such as the Disney-themed adventure Kingdom Hearts 3, Activision's (ATVI) Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Capcom's Devil May Cry 5 are now also available on Xbox.Third, indicating its focus on exclusives, Microsoft announced the acquisition of a number of gaming studios, including Seattle-based Undead Labs, Montreal-based Compulsion Game, and UK-based Playground Games and the BAFTA-winning Ninja Theory. It is also forming a new gaming studio called The Initiative in Santa Monica, California, headed by industry veteran Darrell Gallagher.Microsoft also said that the next Xbox was in the works and that it was in the process of developing a new streaming service that would enable gaming on Xbox, PCs or phones. carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Sequential decline in revenues and earnings might have impacted the share price movement.Wired Infrastructure revenues (46% of total revenues) totaled $2.3 billion, up 9% from the year-ago quarter and 22% sequentially. The upside was primarily driven by seasonal retrieval in demand for broadband access and robust demand for cloud data centers.Broadcom also stated that robust growth in networking and compute offloading in cloud data centers and solid growth spending by enterprise IT positively impacted the segmental revenues. However, management noted that sluggish spending on video access and in the China optical markets is a concern.Wireless Communications (26% of total revenues) rose 13% year over year but contracted 41% quarter over quarter to roughly $1.29 billion. The sequential decline was primarily led by a sharp drop in shipments of next-generation platform of the company's large North American smartphone customers. However, ramped up shipments to a large Korean smartphone customer was a positive.Enterprise Storage (23% of total revenues) increased 63% from the year-ago quarter and 17% sequentially to $1.16 billion. The improvement was largely backed by contribution from the recently-acquired Brocade Fibre Channel switch business.Industrial & other (5% of total revenues) rose 17% year over year and 5% sequentially to $263 million. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a significant increase in IP licensing revenues. Industrial resale continued to grow, highlighting 20% increase year over year.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 330 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 66.6%. The increase was buoyed by favorable product mix, driven by higher revenues from wired segment.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 11% year over year to $887 million.Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined 140 bps from the year-ago quarter, courtesy of lower research & development expenses as well as selling, general & administrative expenses.Operating margin expanded 470 bps from the year-ago quarter to 48.9%.As of May 6, 2018, cash & cash equivalents were $8.2 billion compared with $7.1 billion in the previous quarter.

The company also revealed that over the first four weeks of the third quarter, it has repurchased an additional 4.9 million shares worth $1.16 billion.Additionally, Broadcom returned $766 million in the form of dividends to shareholders during the second quarter. The company also approved a quarterly cash dividend of $1.75 per ordinary share.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, Broadcom forecasts non-GAAP revenues of almost $5.05 billion (+/- $75 million).The company expects an increase in demand for networking products from cloud and data centers as well and broadband access products to positively impact Wired Infrastructure revenues.Wireless Communications revenues are projected to see a seasonal sequential decline owing to weak demand from large North American customers.However, the launch of next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment.Management stated that Enterprise Storage segment will benefit from robust demand from enterprise, cloud storage and datacenters and recovery in HDD demand.The company expects mid-single-digit sequential growth in industrial product revenues and projects growth in resale. Industrial shipments and resale are likely to grow, which will drive segmental revenues in the third quarter.Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 66.5% (+/-1%), while non-GAAP operating expenses are expected at around $882 million.The company projects capital expenditures of $125 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Currently, Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Amazon.com, Inc.  , NVIDIA Corporation  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  are stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector.

The courses will include designing, deploying, administering and managing HPE servers, data centers and converged systems among others.Arrow Electronics with the assistance of the resources from HPE looks to educate customers with the knowledge related to HPE's host of products and solutions, that will in turn be positively impacting the profit margin of the customers.We believe the collaboration with HPE will be beneficial for Arrow as the latter will be introduced to the vast customer base of HPE, part of which might be interested in Arrow Electronics' electronic components and enterprise computing products.Hence, this partnership is anticipated to assist Arrow Electronics in expanding its customer base, which will eventually boost its top line in the long run. Notably, in first-quarter 2018, the company's revenues were up 14.4% on an adjusted basis to $6.876 million. | Arrow also recently announced the amendment of its Asset Securitization Program.

Symantec has witnessed a significant price decline in the year-to-date period, and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the fiscal. Further, the company's Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Notably, the stock has lost 24.4% of its value in the year-to-date period, substantially underperforming the 17% rally of its  it belongs to.Let's take a look at factors behind this plunge.The plunge particularly came after the company, during the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 , reported that its board's audit committee is making an internal investigation into the concerns voiced by an ex-employee. The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, Symantec stated that it isn't related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems.Lack of clarity on the probe announced, along with executives' refusal to take questions post the , has resulted in a plunge of more than 27% in Symantec's shares since May 10 to till day.Later, on May 14, this cyber-security provider held another press meet and stated that the probe relates to the reporting of certain non-GAAP accounting measures, which includes executive compensation too, public disclosures including commentary on the company's historical financial results, certain forward-looking statements, stock trading plans and retaliation.We believe this information is inadequate to gain investors' confidence. The ongoing investigation may throw light on some serious issues which might severely cost the company in the near future. Therefore, it is wise to wait and watch for some time for better visibility of the stock.Symantec's weaker-than-expected outlook for the first quarter as well as fiscal 2019 makes investors cautious about its near-term performance. Also, the company expects non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2019 in the range of 30-32%, which reflects a substantial decline from the fiscal 2018 level of 34.7%. The reduction in margins is mainly due to continued shift of business model to ratable revenues, and increased investment in sales and marketing capacity.Following the company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results and investigation revelation, the stock has witnessed sharp downward estimate revision. For fiscal 2019, we have seen 14 estimates moving south in the past 60 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend downward from $1.82 to $1.57.Additionally, for the current quarter, Symantec has seen 11 downward estimate revisions, dragging the consensus estimate down to 33 cents per share from 41 cents per share, in the past 60 days.Some better-ranked stocks from the computer-software industry space are Cadence Design Systems, Inc.  , Aspen Technology, Inc.  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Liquidity indicates a company's capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.Liquid stocks have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength. It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

The buyout of ISCS (now called InsuranceNow), FirstBest (now called Guidewire Underwriting Management) and EagleEye Analytics (now known as Guidewire Predictive Analytics) are not only aiding revenue growth but also helping the company to expand clientele.Additionally, management is optimistic about the completion of the Cyence buyout.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 1.4% over the past month. CTXS hit a new 52-week high of $108.97 in the previous session. Citrix Systems has gained 23.6% since the start of the year compared to the 9.1% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 17.7% year-to-date return for its peer group.The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 25, 2018, Citrix Systems reported EPS of $1.29 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.17%.For the current fiscal year, Citrix Systems is expected to post earnings of $5.27 per share on $2.91 billion in revenues. This represents an 8.66% change in EPS on a 3.01% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.79 per share on $3.01 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 9.87% and 3.45%, respectively.Citrix Systems may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CTXS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Citrix Systems has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.5X versus its peer group's average of 25X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.28. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. | We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Citrix Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Citrix Systems fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though CTXS shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.Shares of Citrix Systems have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Sapiens International Corporation N.V.  , Intuit  , and CACI International  , all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CTXS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, it was much lower than the year-ago figure of 16 cents per share.The company posted revenues of $140.5 million, which increased 14% from the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137 million and was above the guided range. The increase can primarily be attributed to growth in Services revenues and Maintenance revenues.Notably, the company is transforming to a subscription based model from a term license based one, which might hurt the top line in the near term. This is because term license revenues include advance payments while subscription-based revenues are a bit delayed.Nevertheless, management is extremely optimistic about the several cloud-based products launched in the quarter, at a time when the P&C insurance industry is moving steadily toward adoption of cloud solutions.Guidewire stock has gained 35.2% year over year, substantially outperforming the 21.4% rally of the  it belongs to.The company has three main segments namely Maintenance, License, and Other and Services.Maintenance revenues amounted to $18.7 million, up 11% year over year. Further, the same from Service increased 50% from the year-ago quarter to $71.4 million. However, License and Other revenues decreased 15% from the year-ago quarter to $50.4 million.Management stated that a substantial majority of second-quarter revenues were from subscription based products (accounted for approximately 50% of total revenues). Backed by the strong performance of subscription products, management continues to expect subscription sales in the range of 30-40%, for fiscal 2018.Perpetual revenues in the third quarter came in at $5.7 million. Perpetual licenses revenues are now expected to be approximately $9-$10 million in fiscal 2018 primarily due to new Latin America activity.With regard to maintenance revenues, higher perpetual revenues and the enhanced timing of sales increased the range of this segment to $76-$77 million, up $0.5 million at its mid-point. However, growth of the Maintenance revenues that are part of subscriptions will be negatively impacted while the change in the company's business model is in progress because of the delayed revenue recognition from the subscription based products.Per management, the license revenues will have a negative impact in fiscal 2018. The sales process might be a bit stretched due to the time taken by customers to choose between on-premise and cloud delivery options. Perpetual license revenues facing a decline will be a further drag to the license and other revenues. Transition to cloud-based subscription sales will also impact license and other revenues.Meanwhile, services revenues were better than expected in the quarter. The segment is anticipated to improve performance in the near term on the back of proper implementation of InsuranceNow.Additionally, management is optimistic about the completion of the Cyence buyout. Notably, Cyence determines the economic impact of a cybercrime via a software platform, which is built on cyber-security related data science. The integration of Cyence would imply that the company would be able to provide an entire life cycle to the insurance products starting from designing to transaction management.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, non-GAAP gross profit came in at $77.5 million, down 4% from a year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.2% compared with 65.1% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was owing to higher investments in lower margin services revenues and cloud operations. Further, payment shift of a Tier-1 term customer negatively impacted gross margins.Total non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $75.2 million during the quarter, up 19% year over. The increase can primarily be attributed to higher research and development and sales and marketing expenses along with the recent acquisitions of Cyence and ISCS.Non-GAAP operating margin was 1.6% compared with 13.8% in the year-ago quarter.

Revenues inched up 2% from the year-ago quarter to $7.16 billion.The year-over-year increase was primarily due to robust growth across switching, wireless and data center business. Switching revenues increased witnessed strong growth across campus and data center. Adoption of new campus switch, Cat9K was impressive.Further, wireless revenues grew on the back of company's Wave 2 offerings and Meraki solution. Robust demand for the HyperFlex data-center solution drove data center's double digit growth.However, continued weakness in service provider which led a slowdown in enterprise routing business remained a headwind during the quarter.Management stated that the subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform has been adopted by more than 5,800 customers, up 2,700 sequentially. Moreover, results benefited from the continuing customer shift to 100 gig architectures. Additionally, rapid adoption of multi-cloud infrastructures was a key catalyst.Cisco's ACI solution continues to witness traction. The company believes that ACI customers are gaining from increased business agility owing to network automation, simplified management and improved security features of the product. Management remains optimistic on the newly introduced ACI SDN offering.Applications (10.5% of third-quarter revenues) consist of Collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications (\"UC\"), Conferencing and TelePresence, Internet of Things (\"IoT\") and application software businesses such as AppDynamics and Jasper. Revenues increased 19% from the year-ago quarter to $1.31 billion.In the quarter, Cisco integrated its Cisco Spark with Webex Platform which enhanced Webex Meeting and enabled it to introduce Webex Teams, further strengthening the company's collaboration portfolio.Collaboration revenues rose primarily driven by growth across AppDynamics, UC infrastructure and TelePresence endpoints.Security (4.7% of revenues) climbed 11% to $583 million. The results were noticeable as deferred revenues surged 38% from the year-ago quarter.Strong growth can be attributed to solid demand witnessed by web security, unified threat and advanced threat solutions.Cisco's AI-driven Talos intelligence platform blocks 20 billion threats per day. The company is striving to leverage machine-learning to deploy security platforms to mitigate online risks on a real-time basis.Other Products segment (2% of revenues) contains service provider video, cloud and system management and various emerging technology offerings. Revenues fell 6% to $249 million.A positive development pertaining to the sector is the recent divestiture of a portion of company's previously acquired NDS video assets. This move is likely to mitigate the sluggishness persistent in this segment.Non-GAAP gross margin contracted 40 bps from the year-ago quarter to 63.9%. Management claims that the decrease can be attribute to higher memory pricing. This is anticipated to persist in the near term.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $4.05 billion, up 5.7% year over year. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, expanded 40 bps to 32.5%.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin contracted 80 bps to 31.5%.Cisco exited the third quarter with cash & cash equivalents and investments balance of almost $54.43 billion down from $67.97 billion in the prior-year quarter. Cash & cash equivalents and investments available in the United States at the end of quarter were $47.5 billion. The company generated $2.42 billion cash flow from operations down from the year-ago figure of $3.3 billion.In the third quarter, Cisco repurchased approximately 140 million shares of common stock for $6.02 billion, translating to an average price of $42.83 per share. Furthermore, the company paid a cash dividend of 33 cents per share. | For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to grow 4-6% on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $12.71 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 4.8%.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated between 68 cents and 70 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is at 68 cents, translating to year-over-year growth of 11.5%.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 63-64%, while operating margin is anticipated between 29.5% and 30.5% for the quarter.With Webex Meetings, Webex Devices and Webex Teams yielding results, we believe Cisco is well poised to capitalize on the emerging AI-based enterprise applications.The company recently closed the acquisition of Accompany for $270 million. The newly acquired company is set to join Collaboration Technology Group (\"CTG\") of Cisco. Accompany's robust enterprise AI capabilities will strengthen Cisco's collaboration portfolio.We believe that company's expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security market holds promise. Security solutions of Cisco are likely to witness traction, going forward. The company's extended partnerships with the likes of Aon, Allianz and Rackspace are likely to boost security segment growth.However, weakness in the switching and routing is a headwind. Moreover, ongoing transition to subscription-based model will continue to hurt the top line. Arista's  recent intention of manufacturing switches that connect campus networks is likely to hurt Cisco as it holds a dominant position in that market.Cisco currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems  and Citrix Systems  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

It primarily indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners. : It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

The transaction, which involves  , is valued at approximately $7.5 billion.On Jun 3, Bloomberg had reported that Microsoft is in advanced talks to acquire the open-source software development platform giant, GitHub. Notably, the company was last valued at $2 billion in 2015.Shares of Microsoft have returned 40.2% in the past year, outperforming the  's rally of 30.1%. This outperformance can primarily be attributed to the company's rapidly expanding efforts in AI and IoT based developments. Undisturbed focus on Azure remains a key catalyst.GitHub offers an open-source platform for coding enthusiasts and software developers. The platform brings developers together to work on projects without compromising on each other's code. Founded in 2008, the \"social coding\" platform, which boasts of 28 million developers, has hosted around 80 million repositories, as of March 2018.The San Francisco-based GitHub has an impressive list of customer base which totalled more than 1.8 million organizations and businesses, as of March 2018. Companies like Airbnb, SAP, IBM, Google, PayPal, Walmart, Spotify, to mention a few, have leveraged GitHubs's platform.The GitHub-Azure integration will further reinforce Microsoft's commitment to its cloud-computing future as it aims to compete against the likes of Amazon  and fellow tech giants.The tech powerhouse also stated that it projects the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2020. Investors should note that Microsoft expects the buyout to dilute adjusted earnings by roughly 1% in fiscal years 2019 and 2020.Slowly but steadily, Microsoft is embracing the concept of open source (free software where code is written by software developers from all around the world) after being averse to it initially. The company has come a long way in its stance on the open-source database subject.Ever since Satya Nadella took over as the CEO of Microsoft in 2014, the company has been coming to terms with the concept in an impressive way. Around 2016, the company started to support the Linux operating system, an open source operating system on its cloud computing platform Azure.Microsoft is also committed to reorganize the company around its cloud-computing businesses and its Office business, instead of Windows. Last quarter, the company witnessed revenue figures of $26.82 billion, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.71 billion. Furthermore, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit revenues, which comprise its rapidly growing Azure segment, climbed roughly 17% to reach $7.79 billion. Azure revenues alone soared 93%, after skyrocketing 98% last quarter.The acquisition is likely to boost collaborative coding and consequently, is expected to bode well for innovations in software development.Going forward, Microsoft anticipates GitHub acquisition to aid the company in becoming more future-oriented by encouraging more developers to create services and apps. This in turn will aid Azure compete better against other computing giants by being more appealing to customers.Microsoft currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Aspen Technology, Inc.  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  are stocks worth considering in the same sector. Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, it stated that it isn't related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems.Lack of clarity on the probe announced, along with executives' refusal to take questions post the , resulted in a plunge of more than 33% in Symantec's shares, last Friday, eroding almost $6 billion of the company's market cap in a single day.However, the stock recovered 9.6% yesterday, following the company's conference-call announcement.

This is expected to throw light on serious issues which might severely cost the company in near future.

Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners. It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14% over the past month. CTXS hit a new 52-week high of $104.88 in the previous session. Citrix Systems has gained 19% since the start of the year compared to the 2.9% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 10% year-to-date return for its peer group.The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 25, 2018, Citrix Systems reported EPS of $1.29 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.17%.For the current fiscal year, Citrix Systems is expected to post earnings of $5.3 per share on $2.9 billion in revenues. This represents a 9.28% change in EPS on a 2.82% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.84 per share on $3.01 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.27% and 3.67%, respectively.Citrix Systems may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CTXS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Citrix Systems has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.8X versus its peer group's average of 23X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.18. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. | We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Citrix Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Citrix Systems passes the test. Thus, it seems as though CTXS shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Shares of Citrix Systems have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including EPAM Systems  , CACI International  , and Baidu  , all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 23% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CTXS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The transaction, which involves  , is valued at approximately $7.5 billion.On Jun 3, Bloomberg had reported that Microsoft is in advanced talks to acquire the open-source software development platform giant, GitHub. Notably, the company was last valued at $2 billion in 2015.Shares of Microsoft have returned 40.2% in the past year, outperforming the  's rally of 30.1%. This outperformance can primarily be attributed to the company's rapidly expanding efforts in AI and IoT based developments. Undisturbed focus on Azure remains a key catalyst.GitHub offers an open-source platform for coding enthusiasts and software developers. The platform brings developers together to work on projects without compromising on each other's code. Founded in 2008, the \"social coding\" platform, which boasts of 28 million developers, has hosted around 80 million repositories, as of March 2018.The San Francisco-based GitHub has an impressive list of customer base which totalled more than 1.8 million organizations and businesses, as of March 2018. Companies like Airbnb, SAP, IBM, Google, PayPal, Walmart, Spotify, to mention a few, have leveraged GitHubs's platform.The GitHub-Azure integration will further reinforce Microsoft's commitment to its cloud-computing future as it aims to compete against the likes of Amazon  and fellow tech giants.The tech powerhouse also stated that it projects the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2020. Investors should note that Microsoft expects the buyout to dilute adjusted earnings by roughly 1% in fiscal years 2019 and 2020.Slowly but steadily, Microsoft is embracing the concept of open source (free software where code is written by software developers from all around the world) after being averse to it initially. The company has come a long way in its stance on the open-source database subject.Ever since Satya Nadella took over as the CEO of Microsoft in 2014, the company has been coming to terms with the concept in an impressive way. Around 2016, the company started to support the Linux operating system, an open source operating system on its cloud computing platform Azure.Microsoft is also committed to reorganize the company around its cloud-computing businesses and its Office business, instead of Windows. Last quarter, the company witnessed revenue figures of $26.82 billion, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.71 billion. Furthermore, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit revenues, which comprise its rapidly growing Azure segment, climbed roughly 17% to reach $7.79 billion. Azure revenues alone soared 93%, after skyrocketing 98% last quarter.The acquisition is likely to boost collaborative coding and consequently, is expected to bode well for innovations in software development.Going forward, Microsoft anticipates GitHub acquisition to aid the company in becoming more future-oriented by encouraging more developers to create services and apps. This in turn will aid Azure compete better against other computing giants by being more appealing to customers.Microsoft currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Aspen Technology, Inc.  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  are stocks worth considering in the same sector. Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth rate for Aspen Technology and Citrix Systems is currently pegged at 10.1% and 9.1%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

(ticker: AMZN) said it would resume a major project there after the council cleaved a proposed corporate tax by nearly half. But the retailing giant isn't happy.Getty Images\"We are disappointed by [Monday's] city council decision to introduce a tax on jobs,\" Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement. \"While we have resumed construction planning for Block 18, we remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council's hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.\"The tax, intended to ease the city's homelessness problem, initially would have cost Amazon more than $20 million. That prompted the city's largest private employer, with more than 45,000 people, to temporarily halt construction of a a 17-story tower on its Seattle campus. It is still mulling whether to use or sublease space in another major downtown development. The two projects are expected to create 7,000 Amazon jobs.Amazon and dozens of other Seattle-based tech companies, including  () and  (), contend the tax will punish jobs-creating businesses. Amazon said the city doesn't need the money--its coffers swelled to $4.2 billion in 2017 from $2.8 billion in 2010. Speaking of finalists for HQ2,  an interesting byproduct of the fevered competition: In selling themselves to Amazon, some candidates are using the same glitzy multimedia presentations to pitch themselves to other companies.Indeed, the head of an investment firm in London is strongly considering Philadelphia for a move to the U.S. after viewing the video city reps there made for Amazon, according to the Journal.Officials from Philadelphia, Boston and Toronto say they're turning their Amazon campaigns into broader city presentations. In the end, there may be multiple winners from the HQ2 hunt, not just the winning city. Murli Thirumale isn't your typical Silicon Valley executive.

And his new company, , a container-storage company, designs products based almost entirely on customer feedback.\"It's the difference between what's cool and what customers want,\" says Thirumale, who explains his company's product philosophy as SDBS (Sell idea, Design, Build, and Sell). \"Instead of pushing technology, let customers pull you to the best product.

Citrix reported 5% revenue growth, to $697.2 million, which was slightly ahead of management's previously guided range of $670 million to $680 million.The company's top line reflected management's recent tilting of Citrix's business model toward subscription services. Subscription revenue jumped 49% to $103.2 million, as the organization enjoyed accelerated adoption of Citrix Cloud Services by both new and current customers. CEO David Henshall noted that both cloud and on-premise networking services also saw healthy growth during the first quarter.Let's check in on a couple of important barometers of top-line health. Deferred revenue increased 1% over the prior-year quarter to $1.69 billion. Deferred revenue actually dropped 10% on a sequential basis, but management observed that most of this difference stemmed from the adoption of a new revenue accounting standard in 2018. Deal flow with larger corporate customers appeared solid over the last three months, as the company completed 50 $1 million-plus transactions with enterprise clients, versus 47 in the first quarter of 2017. Finally, shareholders were also pleased with higher profits. Operating income increased more than five percentage points to 23.7%, which management attributed to vigorous cost discipline.Image source: Getty Images.Citrix's migration toward subscription sales should theoretically dampen revenue in the near term. Since last year, management has warned investors to expect immediate, if slight, headwinds resulting from the new revenue strategy.Yet customers appear to be eagerly embracing the opportunity to migrate digital workspaces and networking to Citrix's cloud environments on a recurring SaaS (software as a service) basis, and this is mitigating the temporary effects of a shift toward more ratable revenue.Thus, due to the strength of the first quarter and an increasingly healthy outlook, Citrix management increased earnings guidance for full-year 2018 alongside first-quarter earnings. The company bumped its revenue target from a prior range of $2.86 billion to $2.88 billion to a revised band of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion. In addition, Citrix now expects 2018  to fall between $3.45 and $3.59, versus its prior projection of $3.18 to $3.33.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The market has been folding its arms in response to solid quarterly numbers of late, but today each of the major indices jumped by 1% or more amid a tech rebound.We can thank good old Facebook for leading the way on Thursday, as the social media giant hasn't lost a step in the wake of Cambridge Analytica and Mark Zuckerberg's Congressional testimony. After the bell yesterday, the company blew past Zacks Consensus Estimates on both the top and bottom lines, which led to shares jumping more than 9% today.Backed up by Facebook, the NASDAQ had no problem ending its five-session losing streak on Thursday. It was easily the best-performing index of the Big 3 with a surge of 1.64% to 7118.7. Best of all, Amazon just reported tremendous profit growth after the bell today, so this index and the market in general could have another shot in the arm on Friday that would pave the way for a third straight week of gains. As of this writing, shares of AMZN are up about 6% after hours.Meanwhile, the S&P was up 1.04% to 2666.9. The Dow ended its own 5-day losing streak yesterday, and today it added another 0.99% to 24,322.3. In addition to the rebound in tech, stocks also benefited from the 10-year Treasury note falling back below 3%. said Jeremy in  Given today's rally in the tech space, Brian Bolan felt it was time to put some money to work. On Thursday, he picked up Citrix Systems (CTXS), a software name that reported a strong quarter last night. It beat on both the top and bottom lines while also guiding higher for next quarter and the full year. CTXS is still only a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but the editor feels that will improve shortly as the company hits \"new highs after new highs\". Read the complete commentary for more on this new addition. The NASDAQ should recover nicely over the next couple of weeks, according to Dave. So Thursday provided a great opportunity for the editor to add a tech name. He picked up a 12.5% allocation in Mellanox (MLNX), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) supplier of semiconductor-based, interconnect products. Shares are moving toward its 52-week high after a strong quarterly report, and Dave thinks it's ready to break on through to new heights. The full write-up has more on this new addition. Over the past four quarters, SodaStream (SODA) has put together an average beat of 40.4%. Dave expects the streak to continue when it reports again next Wednesday, especially since it has a positive Earnings ESP of more than 6%. The editor added SODA on Thursday while also selling Allegheny Tech (ATI) for an approximately 6% profit. See the complete commentary for more on today's moves. The portfolio cashed in a couple of profits on Thursday, as Kevin sold Baxter (BAX) and BioTelemetry (BEAT) for returns of nearly 25% and 17%, respectively. Both companies had good quarterly reports, but the editor feels he can make bigger profits elsewhere. He thinks BAX will struggle to hold $70, while BEAT is suffering from a lack of enthusiasm in the investment community. By the way, HI also had the top performing stock of the day as Alexion Pharma (ALXN) jumped more than 14.5% after a strong quarter. -- Kevin MatrasHave a Good Evening,Jim GiaquintoRecommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.

Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners. It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal. Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.In order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary  to the screen. (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.) (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company's efficiency.) (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see  .

The company reported steady revenue growth through 2016 as well as 2017. However, escalating cost of revenues and operating costs led to lower margins through 2017. Furthermore, higher tax expenses through the year led to negative net income. However, on a non-GAAP basis, company reported a steady 9-10% increase in earnings per share.Strong growth in software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenues is expected to continue through 2018 and help drive overall revenue growth. Similarly, services revenues also grew at a similar pace through the first half of the fiscal year, which eventually slowed down to single digits in the latter half.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Citrix Systems Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $60.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $110.00. The standard deviation is $12.833.But the whole reason to look at the  CTXS price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTXS crossing above that average target price of $91.09/share, investors in CTXS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $91.09 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

And if you\u2019ve owned the shares over the past 52 weeks, you\u2019re up a whopping 82%, while the S&P has risen just 12% during that span.The Linux and Cloud software provider is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the closing bell Monday. And Wall Street, which has assigned a consensus Buy rating on the stock, expects strong results for the company, especially in light of the better-than-expected Cloud results just released from the likes of Adobe () and Salesforce ().For the quarter that ended February, Wall Street expects the Raleigh, NC-based company to deliver earnings of 81 cents per share on revenue of $761.6 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were 61 cents per share on revenue of $628.84 million. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 26% year over year to $2.87 per share, while full-year revenue of $2.91 billion would rise 20.6% year over year.As robust as these numbers would appear, they underestimate Red Hat\u2019s capabilities, both in the near term and long term. In the third quarter, during which it beat on both the top and bottom lines, the company grew earnings 20% year over year to 73 cents per share, while revenues increased 21.6% year over year to almost $748 million, driven by strong demand for its hybrid cloud solutions. The management parlayed that by raising Q4 revenue guidance from $758 million to $763 million, compared to (then) consensus of $748.9 million.Meanwhile, EPS guidance was boosted to 81 cents, above (then) consensus of 75 cents. Growth is being driven by a combination of factors, including breakthrough innovations such as such as OpenShift \u2014 its container platform component \u2014 and its RHEL platform (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)\u2014 its software-as-a-service suite for managing application servers and data storage \u2014 which are helping Red Hat to deliver not only stronger subscription revenues, but also better profit margins.The company also is benefiting from its strong corporate partnerships forged with Fortune 500 titans such as IBM (), Amazon (), Google ( , ) and Microsoft (), to name a few. And given as an example, Red Hat\u2019s recent cloud collaboration deal with Alibaba (), the company is well-positioned for significant double-digit revenue growth rates in the years to come.Red Hat earnings are predicted to grow at more than 16% annually in the next two years, while revenue is projected to grow at an average rate of 18% over the next five years. This means despite stiff competition it faces from the likes of Citrix () and VMware (), Red Hat stock won\u2019t be impeded. So, while the shares \u2014 at 45 times 2019 estimates \u2014 are not bargains, the stock should continue to deliver above-average returns, reaching $180, or 20%, in the next 12 to 18 months.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ: CTXS) entered 2018 as a skinnier, more focused company. The provider of software virtualization services made a key divestment last year, and what's left is a core business that is showing good signs of strength and viability.That was apparent with the company's recently released fourth-quarter and fiscal-2017 results. Lets take a closer look at the numbers.Image source: Getty Images.Citrix managed to boost revenue in all four of its product categories in the final quarter of the year. Honorable mention goes to software as a service, which saw a nearly 40% year-over-year improvement in the quarter to almost $50 million. Collectively, the quartet (which also includes product and licenses, license updates and maintenance, and professional services) produced net revenue of just under $778 million in Q4, a 6% increase.In the press release heralding the results, new-ish CEO David Henshall (who took over in July 2017) said that \"our partners and our customers are really embracing our new subscription services, which have jumpstarted the multi-year plan that we presented in October 2017.\"As with many other American companies, Citrix's net profit took a hit due to adjustments in advance of the changes to corporate income tax. The bottom line dived into the red, to the tune of almost $284 million, from the year-ago profit of just under $200 million.Adjusting for the tax charge and other one-time items, the company's net income was $248.5 million ($1.66 per share), up from Q4 2016's $217.5 million. That exceeded the average analyst estimate, while the revenue figure was broadly in line with expectations.Zooming out to the full fiscal year, Citrix's revenue inched up by 3% to $2.82 billion, while its headline net loss was $20.7 million (2016 result: a profit of $536 million). That was skewed by the tax charge, of course; on an adjusted basis the bottom line was a shade under $744 million ($4.85 per share), against the previous year's $700 million.Revenue improved even though Citrix no longer holds the popular GoTo suite of productivity solutions. Early last year,  of that business unit -- which wasn't all that complementary to its core offerings -- into a new entity that was then merged with  .Even though Citrix added some bulk following the signing of that deal by purchasing application layering specialist Unidesk, it still exited 2017 a smaller company.

It believes it will book revenue of $2.86 billion to $2.88 billion in fiscal 2018, with adjusted earnings coming in at $4.80 to $4.90 per share.

Additionally, MobileIron Core, will enable Rhineland-Palatinate to delete corporate data from employee devices after they discontinue their services, or block access.MobileIron continues to gain from its product selections by wireless carriers like Verizon Communications and T-Mobile.The company's app distribution, analytics, and security offerings along with Google Cloud's Orbitera commerce platform furnished an integrated software solution which ensures an end-to-end solution beginning from purchase to deployment.

If the line is trending higher, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. If the relative strength line is at or near a new high along with the stock at the breakout, it raises the potential for a meaningful breakout.Recent breakout attempts for LogMeIn didn't amount to much, and with underlying market health still in question, it's no guarantee that this one will work, but the stock certainly merits consideration.LogMeIn provides on-demand, remote connectivity services to small and medium-sized business.Last year, the company completed its acquisition of  ' (  ) GoTo business, known for its video conferencing software. When the deal was first announced in July 2016, the GoTo business had a market value of around $1.8 billion. Wall Street loved the news, sending shares higher by 20% on July 27.The deal has powered triple-digit  and sales growth for LogMeIn in recent quarters.Q4 results are due Thursday after the close with adjusted earnings per share expected to rise 89% to $1.17. Sales are seen rising 215% to $277.19 million.Last week, LogMeIn agreed to buy privately held Jive Communications for $342 million in cash. The deal is expected to boost LogMeIn's enterprise business in the unified communications-as-a-service (UcaaS) market.

Moreover, it has surpassed estimates in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 8%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Citrix is likely to beat estimates this quarter on the back of its perfect combination of the two key ingredients: : Citrix has an  of +0.52%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate - pegged higher at $1.61 per share - and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60. A positive Zacks ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Citrix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which incresaes the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions. | Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues are again expected to grow strong in the fourth quarter like the last three quarters. This in turn will boost the company's top line in the period as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter SaaS revenues stands at $48.42 million, higher than $45.81 million reported in the previous quarter.Moreover, a centralized management of employee desktops will provide greater security, control and cost savings, which might further aid results in the quarter.The company's efforts to expand product portfolio are also impressive.Its strong customer base is another positive. Also, the merger between LogMeIn  and Citrix's GoTo business, completed last February, is likely to be value accretive in the quarter to be reported.Additionally, the company's endeavors to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging. In November 2017, the company's board of directors cleared a share buyback program worth more than $2 billion. It can buyback up to an additional $1.7 billion of the company's common stock under the new authorization.The company's attempts to reduce its debt levels are also impressive. This is evident from the fact that the ratio of its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) stands at 69. This compares favorably to the figure of 82.9% for the S&P 500 Index.However, high costs may hurt the bottom line in the fourth quarter as in the previous one.

Weakness in the Ultra Broadband Networks' subgroup is likely to result in Nokia's flagship division's poor performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company also expects segmental results in the final quarter of 2017 to be hurt primarily due to competition in the Chinese market.Furthermore, the top line in the fourth quarter might be hampered by adverse foreign currency movements since the company operates globally.

Now it's turning its guns on targets like  (  ),  (ORCL) and  (ZEN).[ibd-display-video id=2551913 width=50 float=left autostart=true] Early this year, it tripled in size overnight to become one of the world's top 10 Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, companies based on revenue, thanks to its $1.8 billion merger with Citrix's GoTo business.\"The company is well on its way to its three-year, post-acquisition targets, and we believe the cash flow opportunity still justifies a much higher stock price,\" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty wrote in a recent note to clients, after LogMeIn disclosed financial results for the third quarter. JPMorgan is a market maker in LogMeIn shares.Based in Boston, LogMeIn offers software tools for cloud connectivity and collaboration, secure device access, and remote customer support. For an increasingly mobile and global workforce, it offers products such as Join.me, for online meetings; GoToWebinar, for online seminars; GoToAssist, for online assistance; and LastPass, for online password management.Now LogMeIn is at that point where it's an established tech player, yet small enough with around $1 billion in annual sales to generate powerful growth.Thanks in part to a 23% annual pretax profit margin and 26% annual return on equity, LogMeIn ranks No. 1 out of 56 companies in IBD's enterprise software group.  (NOW),  (PAYC),  (BLKB) and Salesforce round out the top five.Within its core markets, LogMeIn is growing fastest in what is known as the identity business. LastPass, a product that offers simple and secure access to apps, devices and data, is doing especially well.In an email interview with Investor's Business Daily, LogMeIn Chief Executive Bill Wagner described his company as a leader in serving small and medium businesses. LogMeIn also counts millions of individuals among its customers, as well as the largest technology providers such as  (DVMT) and  . (HPQ); the world's biggest telcos like  (VZ) and Australia's Telstra; and familiar Silicon Valley growth names like Evernote and Dropbox.A key market where LogMeIn sees long-term growth opportunity is a realm known as Unified Communications and Collaboration. It's one that has emerged as traditional enterprise collaboration vendors such as Microsoft and  (IBM), as well as traditional enterprise communication vendors like Cisco, have made inroads into each other's turfs.\"Prior to the (GoTo) merger, our popular Join.me product was a high growth disrupter in the collaboration market,\" Wagner said. \"Now we have products like GoMeeting, GoToWebinar, OpenVoice and Grasshopper, which essentially bolstered our annual (communications and collaboration) sales by an order of magnitude.\"JPMorgan's Auty says LogMeIn built a successful franchise in remote access, then added several related high-growth businesses around that core, such as web conferencing. Yet he sees room for even more. Auty noted that LogMeIn hit a targeted $100 million in cost synergies a year ahead of plan, and revenue synergies are already starting to kick in. For example, LogMeIn consolidated 50% of data centers and is successfully cross-selling LastPass subscriptions to GoTo customers.Beyond software applications, Auty sees a \"larger opportunity\" in providing a cloud platform for companies tied to the Internet of Things.A LogMeIn spokesperson told IBD that the company's fledgling IoT efforts are centered on customer engagement and support. That could pit it directly against Salesforce's Service Cloud as well as Oracle and Zendesk.It's all showing up in the quarterly results. During the third quarter, LogMeIn logged  , while cash flow from operations surged to $90.5 million, a hefty 33% of revenue. The company also raised guidance for profits and free-cash-flow margins for 2017 as a whole.Shares briefly shot to an all-time high of 129.52 but now sit 7% below that peak, undercutting a 121.35 entry they cleared in October. Still, they are up about 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen 16% over the same period.Auty rates LogMeIn stock as overweight and upped his price target from 140 to 145.In February, CEO Wagner hinted at \"big ambitions\" while alluding to a next generation of cloud technologies.Just a handful of months later, the company acquired the Israeli firm Nanorep. An artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning expert, Nanorep already makes chatbots and virtual agents \"more human\" for hundreds of companies across the world, including  (INTU),  (FDX) and  (VOD), according to LogMeIn.The acquisition accelerates LogMeIn's efforts in the rapidly growing market for digital customer service - one that it expects to balloon from 3% of all customer service interactions in 2017 to 30% by 2022.Wagner told IBD that the $45 million Nanorep deal builds on his company's history of disruptive innovation.\"We were an early innovator in the 'freemium' business model, a structure we relied upon for our organic growth in the early days of the company and one that has been copied by many other successful technology companies,\" Wagner said.That model, of converting free users to paid or premium subscribers, was successfully deployed by Join.me. It offered single-click, frictionless sharing of screens, showing up older rivals like Cisco's WebEx and Citrix's GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting is now part of LogMeIn's portfolio.Launched in October 2010, Join.me was recognized as the  less than five years later.LogMeIn is now looking to harness Nanorep's AI expertise across its entire, newly expanded suite of product offerings. With GoTo under its belt, the company says it supports 25 million users and 900 million conferencing minutes every month, as well as roughly 200 million customer engagements and 5 billion voice minutes every year.But as LogMeIn targets new markets, challenges await. Patent litigation could resurface and roil the stock, experts caution. Plus, upstarts like Splashtop and TeamViewer are moving into remote access, support and monitoring.Competition in this increasingly crowded space is expected to drive down prices, with only the strongest players likely to survive.Still, analyst expectations for future growth have marched up, notwithstanding LogMeIn's formidable annual 45% earnings growth rate and 46% sales growth rate over the past three years.Consensus estimates call for annual earnings of $3.28 per share in 2017, up from $2.03 in 2016 and from $1.66 in 2015. Earnings are seen climbing to $4.10 a share in 2018, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue is forecast at $1.02 billion in 2017, ballooning from $336 million in 2016 and from $272 million in 2015. It is seen rising to $1.17 billion in 2018.LogMeIn's free cash flow, a key valuation metric, has especially impressed industry analysts. Its free-cash-flow margin is now expected to be 30% for the year and to expand to more than 33% in 2019, said Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.Investors and analysts await the strategic road map that Wagner is set to discuss at an event on Dec. 19.\"We think the event could be a catalyst as management updates longer-term targets,\" Hedberg wrote on Oct. 26, calling LogMeIn a \"favorite idea\" for the rest of this year. He rates LogMeIn stock an outperform and hiked his price target from 140 to 143.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n Dec 26, we issued an updated research report on  .  . The stock has been downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Going by the Zacks proven model, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) are likely to underperform the broader market over the next one-three months.High costs are limiting the company's bottom-line growth and the fourth quarter is likely to be no different in this regard. Additionally, declining revenues from products also pose a severe challenge to the company.Moreover, frequent management changes do not bode well for the company and have potential to shake investors' confidence in the stock. Notably, in July, the company made a change at its helm, replacing Kirill Tatarinov with David J. Henshall as its chief executive officer (CEO). Henshall's appointment implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years.The company's results are also liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.Shares of Citrix Systems have underperformed the  it belongs to in a year.

Cut-throat pricing competition resulting in lower ARPU (average revenue per user) and margins, massive investment for upcoming 5G wireless network and fiber optic buildout resulting in low free cash flow and intense competitive pressure shifted investor's focus toward other growth-oriented industries in an overall bull market in 2017.However, the situation has been showing signs of easing from fourth-quarter 2017 as most of the major telecommunications stocks have done well since then. The momentum is likely to continue in 2018 albeit at a slow pace. Several positives have appeared for this industry in the last quarter of 2017.President Donald Trump's proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy. Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his term as the President. We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change.On Dec 14, 2017, in a landmark decision, the U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime. There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality. The current FCC's less-restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies.The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow. Trump's tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators. The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R&D and its deployment.The telecom industry is highly capital-intensive in nature. Therefore, the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible, intangible and real property (other than land) would significantly benefit telecom carriers. This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure. Major proposals such as a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above-mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending.Per the latest  report, only 53 S&P 500 members have reported fourth-quarter earnings results as of Jan 19. Total earnings for these companies are up 11.7% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating EPS estimates and 75.5% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.3%.The Q4 earnings season is on track and is expected to be very good. Four important points can be inferred from the results thus far. First, the +11.7% earnings growth for the 53 index members compares is about the same as the +11.9% growth in Q3 and modestly below the 4-quarter average of +12.8%. Second, the +7.5% revenue growth for these 53 index members represents a notable acceleration in growth momentum. Third, the 81.1% proportion of the companies beating EPS estimates in Q4 is the highest we have seen from these 53 index members in other recent periods. Fourth, the 75.5% of the companies beating revenues is similarly the highest we have seen from this group of companies in recent periods. (Read More:  )In the telecom space, so far, national wireless behemoth Verizon Communications has reported Q4 results. The result was a mixed bag. While the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line lagged the same. Nevertheless, the carrier has witnessed significant net addition of postpaid wireless subscribers with reduced churn rate.With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings estimates could appear a difficult task, however, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for you.

However, a number of companies in the space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTXS options chain for the new February 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $87.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $87.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $84.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $88.08/share today.Because the $87.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CTXS stock at the current price level of $88.08/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.19% if the stock gets called away at the February 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTXS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTXS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Citrix Systems Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $61.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $95.00. The standard deviation is $10.836.But the whole reason to look at the  CTXS price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTXS crossing above that average target price of $82.90/share, investors in CTXS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $82.90 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Citrix Systems Inc:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

The ISM Services index hit record high since Aug 2005, hinting at broadly encouraging economic conditions.

You can see  .ISM Services Index in September came in at 59.8%, surpassing the consensus estimate of 55.5%. This also marked its highest level since Aug 2005 when the index logged a reading 61.3%. The report from ISM also stated that non-manufacturing sector showed strong growth despite hurricanes Harvey and Irma ravaging swathes of Texas and Florida. This augurs well for the economy. Of the 17 non-manufacturing sectors which were surveyed, 14 depicted growth in the last month.

Comparatively, the number of job additions in August was 237,000, revised later to 228,000.Economists attributed lower number of job additions in September to small-business sector losing jobs in the wake of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of revenues.However, things do not look bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter, which moved down 12.6% over the last 90 days.Moreover, shares of Citrix Systems have struggled lately  underperforming the  on a year-to-date basis. The stock has been down 7.3%, as against the industry's rally of 29%.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Citrix Systems' third-quarter results.We expect high costs to hurt the company's bottom line in the third quarter of 2017. With the company making significant investments to expand its product portfolio, costs are likely to shoot up. Personnel expenses are expected to be high as well, hurting the bottom line. Moreover, Citrix System's results in the to-be-reported quarter are liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.Markedly, the company expects net revenues in the band of $685-$695 million. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the range of $1.02-$1.05. Both figures compare unfavorably to those reported a year-ago.Revenues from products and licenses are expected to be soft in the quarter under review, thus hurting the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter's revenues from products and licenses is pegged at $203 million, 3.8% lower than the reported figure in the second quarter of 2017.Amid the gloomy scenario, revenues from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are expected to be strong in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter SaaS revenues is pegged at $43.6 million, 5.1% higher than reported figure in the second quarter.Given this backdrop, investors would keenly await Citrix Systems' third-quarter results under its new chief executive officer (CEO) - David J. Henshall - appointed in July 2017. Notably, Henshall has succeeded Kirill Tatarinov, who had joined Citrix from Microsoft  . The appointment of Henshall implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years. In fact, these frequent changes at its helm have contributed to the stock's underperformance.We believe that the company's third-quarter results would be an indicator to whether the appointment of Henshall yields the desired results as Citrix expects to increase its profitability and find favor with shareholders.Our proven model too does not show that Citrix Systems is likely to beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.

The stock closed Friday at $106.30 and is up 52% year to date, compared with an 11% rise in the S&P 500 index.Indeed, these shares are no longer in the bargain bin \u2014 not to the extent they were when I last discussed Red Hat's prospects at . But given the rate at which Red Hat\u2019s corporate customers, particularly those of Fortune 500 status such as IBM () and Microsoft () continue to embrace its offerings such as OpenShift \u2014 its container platform component \u2014 analysts expects strong growth from Red Hat in the next 12 to 18 months. But for the stock to keep climbing, Red Hat must answer the call Monday.For the quarter that ended August, Wall Street expects the Raleigh, NC-based company to show earnings of 67 cents per share on revenue of $699.45 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were 55 cents per share on revenue of $599.8 million. For the full year, ending in February 2018, earnings are projected to rise 18.5% year over year to $2.69 per share, while full-year revenue of $2.81 billion would rise 16.7% year over year.In the first quarter, thanks to technologies such as its OpenShift, Red Hat\u2019s container platform component that is gaining greater adoption with large franchises, revenues grew 19.2% year over year to $676.8 million. The company is also seeing not only stronger subscription revenues, which are growing at high double-digit rates, but also increased cross-selling of cloud-enabled technology.What\u2019s more, the company is poised to enjoy higher profits in the quarters ahead as evidenced by the rate at which companies are paying premiums for its RHEL platform (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)\u2014 its software-as-a-service suite for managing application servers and data storage. This means despite stiff competition it faces from the likes of Citrix () and VMware (), Red Hat doesn\u2019t have to lower its costs to win large deals.And the fact that it recently expanded its partnership with Microsoft's Azure to make the process of adoption of cloud containers easier, Red Hat should continue to deliver strong recurring revenues from its cloud-based technology. This means while the stock, which is trading at twenty-year highs, is not cheap at 40 times forward earnings, Red Hat \u2014 which I expect to reach $120 \u2014 nonetheless belong on the radar of investors who are looking for long-term revenue and earnings growth.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he  is down -2.28 to 5,930.04.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Citrix Systems Inc (Symbol: CTXS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.7, after changing hands as low as $74.8182 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 45.8. A bullish investor could look at CTXS's 28.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Although RHT stock is not the bargain it was when I last discussed its prospects at , it nonetheless belongs on the radar of investors who are looking for long-term revenue and earnings growth in the next 12 to 18 months.Corporate customers, particularly those with Fortune 500 status, continue to migrate computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon\u2019s AWS platform and Microsoft's Azure, in addition to other public clouds. This shift bodes well for Red Hat, which is a huge Amazon partner. And the fact that these companies are paying premiums for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) \u2014 the company's software-as-a-service suite for managing application servers and data storage \u2014 mean higher profits in the quarters ahead. And it\u2019s already begun.In the most recent quarter that ended May, Red Hat posted earnings of 56 cents per share on revenue of $677 million, easily beating Wall Street\u2019s consensus forecast for earnings of 53 cents per share on revenue of $647.8 million. The Raleigh, NC-based company also raised its full year earnings per share and revenue guidance.Notably, the company\u2019s RHEL platform won massive deals, valued at $5 to $20 million or more. And with technologies such as its OpenShift, its container platform component, gaining greater adoption with large franchises, including IBM () and Microsoft, Red Hat is showing it can fight off the stiff competition it faces from the likes of Citrix () and VMware (). Wall Street has taken notice of the trend.Stifel analysts Brad Reback upgraded Red Hat stock to Buy from Hold with a $115 price target. \"It has become increasingly clear Red Hat is effectively capitalizing on the opportunity presented by enterprise customers increasingly making the push to convert their existing IT infrastructure footprint to a hybrid cloud-based environment,\" Reback noted.Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank\u2019s , who has a Buy rating on the shares and it raised its price target from $100 to $110, sees Red Hat\u2019s business as boosting Amazon.According to Keirstead, Red Hat is able to make corporate internal infrastructure and apps look more AWS-like, which he says makes migrating to AWS less of a burden to corporations.All told, Red Hat is poised to stay red hot in the next 12 to 18 months.And thanks to the company\u2019s close ties with Amazon and Microsoft, combined with the accelerated rate of cloud adoption among Fortune 500 companies, the cloud market \u2014 which has become the focus of both AMZN and MSFT \u2014 is as robust as ever.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 2.

The company delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The year-over-year comparisons on both earnings and revenue front were also favorable.Continued investments in the audio segment have helped Cirrus Logic to come with innovative products time to time. This helps the company in attracting new customers and brings in additional revenues. We expect this factor to positively impact the company's to-be-reported quarter results as it did in the earlier quarters too. Additionally, synergies from acquisitions and expansion in the LED market are anticipated to drive the fiscal first-quarter results.Nonetheless, sluggish economic growth, as well as IT spending may affect its fiscal first-quarter performance. Moreover, the company faces competition from the likes of Texas Instruments Inc.  and STMicroelectronics, which also remain a concern for the to-be-reported quarter results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cirrus Logic will likely beat on earnings this quarter.

This was because revenues were hurt by the Nokia Networks' disappointing performance. Also, weakness in the Ultra Broadband Networks subgroup contributed to the soft results posted by Nokia's flagship division.Quarterly adjusted gross margin was 41.7% in the reported quarter compared with 38.9% a year ago. Operating margin increased 430 basis points (bps) to 10.2% on a year-over-year basis.In fact, at quarter-end, Nokia's net cash from operating activities was \u20ac1,309 million against - \u20ac616 million at the end of the year-ago quarter.In the  segment, total revenue was approximately \u20ac4,971 million (around $5,467 million), down 5% year over year. The division includes three reportable sub-units like Ultra Broadband Networks (which includes Mobile Networks and Fixed Networks operations), Global Services (which includes the Global Services business group) and IP Networks and Applications (which includes the IP/Optical Networks and Applications & Analytics operations). Notably, the decline in the Ultra Broadband Networks' sub-group by 8% to \u20ac2,165 million hurt the segmental sales.In fact, net sales declined in all regions, apart from Asia Pacific (5%) and Middle East and Africa (5%), which led to the segment's below-par performance. The same declined by 16% in Latin America, 7% each in North America and Greater China, and 10% in Europe.However, segmental gross margin improved 150 bps to 39.1% in the reported quarter. Also, quarterly operating margin was 8.2% compared with 6% a year ago.The  segment's quarterly total revenue was \u20ac369 million (approximately $406 million), up 90% year over year. Segmental gross margin was 95.4% compared with 96.4% in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin expanded significantly to 62.3%.Segmental results were aided by Nokia's  with Apple Inc.  . Following the deal, Nokia received an upfront cash payment from Apple in the reported quarter.In  segment, net sales increased 14% to \u20ac307 million (approximately $338 million). Segmental gross margin was 17.6%, down 170 basis points. In fact, this division incurred an operating loss in the quarter under review. | Nokia officially took control of rival Alcatel-Lucent in Jan 2016, and continues to expect annual cost savings of \u20ac1.2 billion in full-year 2018, excluding Nokia Technologies.For 2017, capital expenditure outlook for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is approximately \u20ac500 million. Non-IFRS tax rate is now expected in the range of 25% to 30% in 2017 (old guidance: 30% to 35%). You can see  .The company anticipates net sales in its primary networks division to decline in 2017, which is in line with the primary addressable market. However, the market conditions are expected to be more challenging than expected earlier.Consequently, the primary addressable market for Nokia's main unit is now expected to decline in the band of 3% to 5% as opposed to the earlier projection of a fall in the low-single digits. Segmental operating margin is still forecasted to be in 8% to 10% range.Investors interested in the  sector will now look forward to the second-quarter earnings reports of Harris Corporation  and Citrix Systems  .

Henshall as its new president and chief executive officer (CEO) with immediate effect. He has also becomes a board member at Citrix.Prior to his elevation to the top post, Henshall had served as Citrix's chief financial officer and chief operating officer for over a decade. Henshall has succeeded Kirill Tatarinov as the CEO. In fact, Tatarinov's decision to step down was based on a mutual agreement.Notably, Mark M. Coyle was appointed as chief financial officer (on an interim basis) in place of Henshall as part of the other managerial changes. Also, an Operations and Capital committee has been formed with an aim to drive long-term growth and profitability.The committee will have Citrix's Executive Chairman, Robert Calderoni at its helm. Other members are Henshall and directors of the company- Jesse Cohn and Peter J. Sacripanti.The appointment of Henshall implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years. The frequent changes at the helm did not find favor with investors. Consequently, the stock declined in after-market trading on Jul 10.Notably, Citrix's shares have underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last one year. While the stock was up 20%, the industry's gained 28.7% in the same period.We remind investors that Tatarinov had been appointed as the company's CEO replacing Calderoni in Jan 2016. Calderoni had served as Citrix's CEO since Oct 2015, following the retirement of Mark Templeton.We note that Tatarinov had previously served in companies like Microsoft  .Apart from the frequent changes at the top, Citrix has faced challenges from other quarters as well. Citrix spun off its GoTo family of products following pressure from activist investment firm Elliott Management. Additionally, Citrix is struggling on the top-line front which is evident from its 19.74% year-over-year decline in revenues in the first quarter of 2017.Given this gloomy background, now it remains to be seen whether the appointment of Henshall yields the desired results as the company expects to increase its profitability and find favor with shareholders.The company said that it will release its second quarter results on Aug 2. Citrix still expects net revenue in the band of $685 million to $695 million for the second quarter. Also, earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are anticipated to be in the range of 97 cents to $1.00.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues and earnings per share is $690.42 million and 85 cents, respectively.Citrix currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader computer and technology sector include Nokia Corporation  and Asure Software  , with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

These stocks usually excel in bull markets, but they can also be crushed when their growth starts slowing down or they're unable to squeeze out meaningful bottom line growth.Let's take a closer look at three stocks that could double their revenues this year --  (NASDAQ: LOGM) ,  (NYSE: SNAP) , and  (NYSE: NVTA) -- and the risks that their high-growth business models could face.Image source: Getty Images.LogMeIn provides cloud-based connectivity services for collaboration, IT management, and customer engagement. Its core products let users access remote computers. The company also acquired password management platform LastPass in late 2015, and bought  's(NASDAQ: CTXS) GoTo family of collaboration products earlier this year.Steady demand for its services helped LogMeIn consistently post double-digit sales growth. Its revenues rose 22% in 2015 and 24% in 2016. But looking ahead, analysts expect the integration of Citrix's GoTo business to cause LogMeIn's revenues to soar nearly 200% this year before normalizing to 15% growth in fiscal 2018. Its earnings are expected to rise 85% this year and 26% next year.That acquisition has notably distorted LogMeIn's trailing valuations. The stock nearly doubled over the past year, and trades at nearly 1,000 times earnings, but its forward P/E of 36 (which accounts for GoTo) looks reasonable and remains much lower than the industry average of 54 for application software makers.Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, recently made its public debut with an IPO that initially surged over 70% from $17 to almost $30. However, the stock quickly gave up most of those gains as fundamental gravity kicked in. But even at $21 per share, Snap is valued at $24.4 billion, and its stock trades at 60 times last year's sales of $404.5 million. The company generates most of its revenue from ads and branded filters.Snap still isn't profitable, and its daily active user (DAU) growth has been slowing down over the past few quarters. DAUs rose just 3% sequentially to 158 million in the fourth quarter, compared to 7% growth in the third quarter and 17% growth in the second quarter. Some analysts attributed that slowdown to  's(NASDAQ: FB) introduction of new Snapchat-like features for Instagram and Messenger.Despite all those challenges, analysts expect Snap's sales to more than double to $1.03 billion this year. That figure was mainly based on Snap's own declaration that it could hit $1 billion in revenues this year as it expands its user base and forges new advertising partnerships. But even if Snap can achieve that -- and there's plenty of doubt that it can -- its stock will still remain very richly valued.Invitae uses software tools to process DNA samples, analyze information about genetic conditions, and generate test reports for clinicians. Its customizable tests screen for multiple genes associated with hereditary cancer, neurological disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and other conditions.Image source: Getty Images.Invitae is a small-cap company with a market cap of just over $420 million, but it's growing rapidly. The company went public in early 2015, and it's posted triple-digit sales growth for five straight quarters. Revenue rose 191% annually to $9.2 million during its fourth quarter, and hit $25 million for the full year.Analysts expect Invitae's revenue to rise another 148% to $62.1 million this year. Invitae plans to achieve that target by doubling its sample volume, commercially launching a 20,000-gene medical exome, and securing additional biopharma partnerships to expand its Invitae Genome Network. But here's the catch -- Invitae isn't profitable, its losses are widening, and the stock is very pricey at 17 times trailing sales. Therefore, Invitae's an interesting stock to keep an eye on, but it remains a highly speculative play.Sales growth is important, but it's important to know where that growth is coming from. Logmein's triple-digit growth comes from an acquisition, Snap's growth is based on its own promises, and Invitae's growth will be boosted by its growing sample volume and the expansion of its ecosystem. Of these three companies, only Logmein is profitable -- which could give it more downside protection than unprofitable companies during market downturns.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and LogMein wasn't one of them!

Moreover, the company beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with the average earnings surprise at 17%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our quantitative model does not show conclusively that Citrix Systems is likely to beat on earnings in the first quarter. According to our proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better - to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. However, this is not the case as highlighted below. The Earnings ESP for Citrix Systems is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 75 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Citrix Systems holds a Zacks Rank #3. Though the company has a favorable Zacks Racks, its 0.00% ESP complicates our surprise prediction.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.We believe that Citrix Systems'expanded product portfolio will aid results in the first quarter. We are positive on the company's growth by acquisition strategy. During the first quarter of 2017, Citrix acquired Unidesk which invented the popular application layering technology.Citrix Systems expects (excluding GoTo business) the net revenues in the band of $655 million to $665 million for the first quarter of 2017. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the range of $0.93 to $0.95. The merger between LogMeIn  and Citrix's GoTo business was completed in the first quarter of 2017.However, Citrix's results in the first quarter are liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets. Earnings might also be affected by slow-paced economic growth in major economies as well as intense competition from peers. | Here are some stocks in the broader computer and technology space, investors may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Harris Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.85% and a Zacks Rank #3.

A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in CTXS.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $4.45 a share a month ago to its current level of $3.78.Also, for the current quarter, CTXS has seen 3 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 75 cents a share from $1.06 over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 15% in the past month. | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer - Softwareindustry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  .

Chime's apps work on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac, and the content is synchronized across all platforms via Amazon Web Services (AWS).Chime comes in three versions -- Chime Basis, for 1:1 voice and video calls and chat; Chime Plus, which adds screen sharing and the integration of company directories; and Chime Pro, which adds tools for scheduling, hosting, recording, and personalizing meetings for up to 100 people.Image source: Amazon.These features indicate that Amazon is taking aim at collaborative tools like  's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype and  's(NASDAQ: CSCO) Spark. But are those rivals already too deeply entrenched in the enterprise market for Amazon to disrupt? Let's take a closer look at Amazon's game plan to find out.Amazon's AWS, which has an annual run rate of $14 billion, is the biggest cloud infrastructure platform in the world. It's several times larger than its closest competitor, Microsoft's Azure. But while AWS dominates the cloud platform (infrastructure/platform as a service) market -- which hosts storage space, processing power, and other tools for companies and developers -- it doesn't have a major presence in the SaaS (software as a service) market yet.The SaaS market is the crowded, consumer-facing side of the cloud, which includes services like Microsoft's Office 365, Dynamics CRM, and Skype. The lion's share of Microsoft's commercialized cloud revenue run rate of $14 billion is generated by those SaaS products instead of Azure. Microsoft has also been expanding Skype's capabilities as an enterprise collaboration tool with Microsoft Teams, which enhances Skype's cloud-based communication features and tightly integrates the service into Office 365.Microsoft Teams. Image source: Microsoft.Meanwhile, networking giant Cisco aggressively bundles software and security products with its routers, switches, and unified computing systems. Those bundles include collaboration tools like Spark, the cloud-based platform for messages, meetings, and calls it launched in late 2015. Last quarter, Cisco's collaboration revenues rose 4% annually to $1.06 billion -- making it its third largest business after its core businesses of router and switches.But Microsoft and Cisco aren't the only players in the crowded field of cloud-based collaborative tools.  's Google has been promoting Hangouts to enterprise customers over the past year,  has added collaborative tools on top of its cloud storage platform, and  acquired  's GoToMeeting video conferencing platform for the same purposes. However, all these challengers notably lack Microsoft and Cisco's clout in the enterprise market.But like Microsoft and Cisco, Amazon also has leverage -- the growing importance of AWS to enterprise customers. Amazon likely believes that by offering Chime as an extension of AWS (especially with its 30-day free trial) to its enterprise customer base, it can gain a foothold in the crowded \"unified communication\" platform market.Amazon previously launched enterprise SaaS products like WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, and WorkMail, but it hasn't ever released official growth figures for those products. However, most industry watchers believe that those products are still dwarfed by comparable solutions from Microsoft and Cisco. This strongly indicates that AWS' dominance of the PaaS/IaaS markets doesn't guarantee that Chime will become a Skype or Spark killer anytime soon. Chime Pro also costs more than Skype for Business -- so it doesn't look like Amazon plans to undercut its way into the market.Chime sounds like a logical way for AWS to straddle the PaaS/IaaS and SaaS markets, but it's easier said than done. The market for cloud-based unified communication platforms is incredibly crowded, and it's doubtful that a new service -- even one bundled with AWS -- can claim a meaningful slice of the market. However, Amazon investors should still keep an eye out for future SaaS products to see if the company can eventually challenge heavyweights like Microsoft and Cisco.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

First, it acquired application management company Unidesk to shore up its core offerings. Then, it completed the  of its GoTo business to  .Citrix has made these moves to streamline its product portfolio, increasing its focus on its enterprise offerings and becoming a pure-play software-as-a-service company. The spinoff of GoTo and the acquisition of Unidesk will enable Citrix to ramp up product development efforts in its two biggest segments by revenue -- workspace services and delivery networking.Image source: Citrix Systems.Citrix revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 4% over the past four fiscal years. That's way lower than the 33% annual growth seen in the virtualization desktop infrastructure market from 2009 to 2016, according to ABI Research. And that means Citrix has failed to take advantage of the rapid industry growth.Evidently, the company needs to reshuffle its offerings, as there are still a lot of opportunities in the desktop virtualization market. But to do so, it will need to focus aggressively on the core businesses that drive the majority of its top line.Workspace services and delivery networking businesses account for 72% of total revenue, but they've grown at a very slow pace in the past four years -- the former at just 2.3% annually and the latter at 5.2%. To make more significant progress in these segments, Citrix needs to spend more time and money on product development to fight off competition from the likes of  .In fact, Citrix has lost its innovative edge in this space to VMware, which has a better strategy to tap the end market. IDC ranked VMware as the leader in its magic quadrant chart because of its acquisition strategy, while Citrix came in second.Citrix should now be able to scale its core businesses by giving them more time and R&D dollars. For example, the company will incorporate Unidesk's layering technology into its XenDesktop and XenApp services.Layering is an application packaging and management technology that allows users to separate enterprise-related applications from the operating system. This feature will enable Citrix customers to manage the apps on their employees' devices from a single location, without the need for physical inspection. Since Unidesk is the only provider of full-stack layering technology, Citrix has made a smart move with this acquisition.Citrix is also partnering with  (NASDAQ: MSFT) on the Azure cloud computing platform. Azure is Citrix' preferred cloud platform for service delivery, which is a big positive for investors, since Microsoft's cloud service has seen rapid growth in adoption. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Azure revenue increased a massive 93% year over year, which pushed the revenue from Microsoft's commercial cloud business to $14 billion.Microsoft is now ranked second in the public cloud after  Web Services, and the rapid growth in Azure adoption has led to a revenue increase at the company's channel partners. Citrix, for its part, has been enhancing its offerings on Microsoft Azure by making improvements to its XenDesktop service.Last month, Citrix introduced XenDesktop Essentials for Microsoft Azure to deliver the Windows 10 software. Using this service, Azure customers can deliver apps to devices running on the platform in a secure manner. What's more, Citrix will continue to enrich its Microsoft Azure offerings by adding more apps such as Secure Web and Secure Mail.These moves should allow Citrix to attract more clients as it focuses on offering a comprehensive suite of solutions. In fact, Citrix' product-development moves are bearing fruit already, as it won 96 new contracts with a value of more than $1 million each in the fourth quarter. In comparison, there were 81 such transactions in the year-ago period.In all, Citrix closed 850 contracts in virtual client computing last quarter itself, up from 800 last year. The company should be able to sustain this growth in the long run as the desktop virtualization market gets bigger. For perspective, TechNavio forecasts that the virtual desktop infrastructure market will grow at an annual pace of 11% from 2017 to 2021.Citrix is gearing up to take advantage of this potential growth by repositioning its portfolio under the leadership of CEO Kirill Tatarinov, who was hired last year. Tatarinov's plan for Citrix is to encourage cloud adoption among enterprises by reducing complexity and offering enhanced security. The company's recent moves clearly indicate that the CEO is taking concrete steps in this direction by streamlining its offerings to power long-term growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares have lost about 10.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Citrix's adjusted earnings came in at $1.43 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.5%. Better-than-expected revenues contributed to the earnings beat. Earnings, however, declined 2.05% from the year-ago figure.Net revenue came in at $908.4 million, up marginally on a year-over-year basis and also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $898.8 million. Gross margin (adjusted) was 86.4% in the quarter under review compared with 85.8% in the prior-year quarter. Quarterly operating margin (adjusted) was 35.2% compared with 31.6% in the prior-year quarter. As of Dec 31, 2016, deferred revenues grossed $1.81 billion compared with $1.65 billion a year ago.During the fourth quarter of 2016, Citrix generated approximately $259 million of cash from operations compared with $282 million for the same quarter in 2015. Citrix, which is on track to sell its GoTo business to LogMeIn, exited the quarter with $957 million in cash and cash equivalents well above the year-ago figure.Product and Licenses revenues grossed $255.3 million, down 9% year over year. License updates and maintenance revenues totaled $409.2 million, up 4% year over year. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues came in at $210 million, up 8% from the prior-year quarter. Professional Services revenues declined 8% to $33.9 million in the reported quarter.Net revenues in the Americas (both North & Latin America) decreased 1.2% year over year. While revenues in Europe, Africa and the Middle East region decreased by less than 1%, in the Asia-Pacific region it increased by less than 1% year over year.The company expects (excluding GoTo business) the net revenues in the band of $655 million to $665 million for the first quarter of 2017. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the range of $0.93 to $0.95.The company expects (excluding GoTo business) net revenue in the band of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion for 2017. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the range of $4.60 to $4.65.Analysts were quiet during the last one month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | At this time, Citrix Systems' stock has an average Growth Score of 'C', though its Momentum is doing a lot better with a 'A'.

While that's certainly a sound conservative strategy, investors should also note that $7,000 placed on the right stock can blossom into  of dollars within a few years.One industry that has excelled at delivering multi-bagger returns is the cloud software market. The cloud market has been on fire over the past two decades, as higher internet speeds made it more practical and cost efficient to remotely store and access documents. Let's take a look at three cloud stocks that turned $7,000 into small fortunes within relatively short time frames --  (NYSE: ELLI) ,  (NYSE: CRM) , and  (NASDAQ: CTXS) .Image source: Getty Images.Ellie Mae is a cloud-based software company that processes about a quarter of all U.S. mortgage applications. The company's Encompass software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform modernizes and streamlines the mortgage application process, which is frequently a time-consuming and low-tech process requiring fax machines and piles of printed documents. It also helps ensure that borrowers are creditworthy -- which many lenders failed to do prior to the financial crisis.Ellie Mae went public at $6 per share in 2011. $7,000 would have been enough to purchase 1,166 shares -- which would be worth  . That massive growth was fueled by soaring demand for its software in the aftermath of the financial crisis, which saw regulators tighten regulations across the mortgage industry. That's why Ellie Mae's annual revenue rose from $55.5 million in fiscal 2011 to $360.3 million in fiscal 2016, and it's profitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. Analysts expect its revenue to grow another 22% this year, but for its non-GAAP earnings to dip 18% on higher expenses.Salesforce.com is the biggest cloud-based CRM (customer relationship management) platform vendor in the world. Its core SaaS platforms, which help companies maintain relationships with customers, include the Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, App Cloud, and Marketing Cloud. It recently launched Salesforce Einstein, which uses artificial intelligence to tune its services based on individual customer needs.Salesforce went public in 2004 at $11 per share; $7,000 would have been enough to buy 636 shares. After a 4:1 split in 2013, you'd own 2,544 shares, which would be worth  . That growth occurred because higher-speed connections and computing hardware made it more practical to migrate customer relationship tools to the cloud, where they could be easily scaled up, backed up, or analyzed.Between fiscal 2004 and 2016, Salesforce's annual revenue rose from $96 million to $6.7 billion -- but it still isn't consistently profitable on a GAAP basis. Analysts expect its revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 25% and 31% this year.Citrix Systems popularized cloud-based app virtualization, which delivers apps as services across networks and public, private, and hybrid clouds. This means that instead of using installed software on individual machines, users can remotely run software hosted on other machines. That model makes it easy for companies to scale up their operations, and keeps everyone on the same page with the same software.Citrix went public in 1995 at $15 per share. $7,000 would have been enough to buy 466 shares. The stock subsequently split four times, which would give you 5,592 shares -- which would be worth  today. The same tailwinds which lifted Salesforce boosted Citrix's annual revenue from $44.5 million to $3.42 billion between fiscal 1996 and 2016. Citrix is also profitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.Analysts expect its revenue to fall 17% this year, due to the sale of its GoTo family of products to  , but rebound 4% in 2018. Its non-GAAP earnings are expected to fall 13% this year before rising 9% next year.Ellie Mae, Salesforce, and Citrix all had great post-IPO runs, but the first two stocks aren't cheap. Ellie Mae has a P/E of 94 and Salesforce has a P/E of 276 -- which are both much higher ratios than the industry average of 54 for application software vendors. Citrix's P/E of 27 looks more reasonable, but that's probably because it isn't expected to post positive top and bottom line growth until next year.Therefore, these three stocks are still interesting growth plays -- but investors shouldn't expect them to repeat their post-IPO rallies over the next few years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Just as planned -- and in addition to retaining the shares of Citrix they already own -- Citrix investors received 0.1718 of a share of LogMeIn common stock for each share of Citrix common stock they own. That fraction was worth a little over $18 per share (based on LogMeIn's current trading price around $105 per share), or roughly the same amount Citrix stock declined today, effectively making the transaction a zero-sum game.Keep in mind that no fractional shares of LogMeIn will be issued. Citrix shareholders received cash in lieu of any LOGM fractional shares remaining after the sum of their partial shares was calculated. As it stands, Citrix shareholders own 50.1% of the shares of LogMeIn common stock on a fully diluted basis.Looking forward, this should enable Citrix to hone its research-and-development and investment efforts on its core enterprise products, including XenApp, XenDesktop, XenMobile, ShareFile, and NetScaler.

The extent to which Red Hat stock deserves a spot in your closet, or portfolio in 2017, will likely be determined by what the management says about its growth prospects heading into the new year.For the quarter that ended November, Wall Street expects adjusted earnings per share of 58 cents. Not only would this mark a 21% rise year over year, it would also match Red Hat's strongest gain (percentage wise) since its fiscal first quarter in June 2015. Meanwhile, revenue is expected to rise 19% year over year to $621.7 million, which would match its strongest revenue increase in nine quarters.All told, there's a lot riding on Wednesday's numbers.RHT stock entered 2016 gaining some 20% last year, compared to flattish gains for the S&P 500 Index. But the Raleigh, N.C.-based company, which competes with the likes of Citrix () and VMware (), has found it difficult to maintain its growth path. Accordingly, RHT stock has declined 4% this year, trailing not only the 11% rise in the S&P 500 index, but also the 14% rise in the PowerShares Dynamic Software ETF ().Notably, the stock's underperformance has come even as the company has beaten Wall Street's earnings estimates in ten straight quarters. Essentially, Red Hat, whose Linux software runs computer servers in corporate data centers, has become a victim of its own success. But for these shares to rebound Wednesday and in 2017, the management not only must crush analysts estimates, but also guide with enough confidence to suggest Red Hat can capture market share from its competitors, particularly in its public cloud business.Corporate customers continue to migrate computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon.com's () dominant AWS platform. This bodes well for Red Hat, which is a huge Amazon partner. In that vein, the pressure is on the company to demonstrate that it can secure large Fortune 500 companies as customers, convincing them to keep buying more of its cloud services, particularly its Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) -- the company's software-as-a-service suite for managing application servers and data storage.The company still dominates the Linux server market with more than 70% market share. And to the extent Red Hat can grow its software solutions like OpenShift and OpenStack, RHT stock can, indeed, become red hot in 2017. At around $79 per share, its fair value can reach $92 in 2017, delivering almost 20% gains.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" recently announced that it has acquired Unidesk. Investors should note that the acquiree was the inventor of the famous Windows application packaging and management technology called layering. This technology has gained immense popularity as the best method to separate apps from the underlying operating system. This allows the app to be managed and delivered to any device from an end user computing solution. Most importantly, Unidesk's product has an edge in the field of application compatibility, which is integral in deriving value from any layering solution.Citrix will be adding the Unidesk technology to its XenApp and XenDesktop products. This is expected to significantly simplify the secure deployment and management of apps and desktops.Unidesk provided full-stack layering technology that improves compatibility as it layers the whole Window workspace as modular virtual disks along with the Windows operating system itself (OS layer), and apps (app layers). It also provided a writable persistent layer that captures features like the whole user settings, apps, and data.Customers of Citrix will be able to use the path breaking technology of Unidesk 4.0. The company believes that the combination with Unidesk will promote growth and development in the field. The company will be selling Unidesk as a separate product to users of VMware Horizon and Microsoft virtual desktop deployment.We note that the company has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over the past three months.

Moreover, the company beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with the average earnings surprise of 25.12%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.A major positive for Citrix is its impressive product portfolio, which it keeps enhancing through the implementation of cutting-edge technology. Citrix also raised its earnings per share guidance (adjusted basis) for 2016 to a band of $5.18-$5.20 from $5.00-$5.10. We also expect the company's acquisition strategy to benefit its performance going forward.However, the company faces risks from adverse foreign exchange movements due to its vast global presence.

But the question here is why? This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Take a company's revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!Investors should always look out for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Earnings acceleration, however, works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates. However, if you pick stocks just on the basis of earnings growth then you are paying for something that has already been reflected in the stock price.So, what is earnings acceleration? It is the incremental growth in a company's earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. Sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down. Hence, earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance. :Let's look for stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rate is also expected to be higher than the previous periods' growth rates. The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1). The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2). The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added: : This screens out the low-priced stocks.

(Symbol: CTXS) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2017 expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTXS options chain for the new February 2017 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $90.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $87.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $91.73/share today.Because the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.33% return on the cash commitment, or 20.62% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $90.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $92.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of CTXS stock at the current price level of $91.73/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $92.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.65% if the stock gets called away at the February 2017 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTXS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTXS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $92.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $92.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Encouraging labor market data and rising  also raise hopes of a rate hike this year, giving a much needed boost to the equity market that has been witnessing intense volatility of late. However, uncertainties related to the approaching presidential elections eclipse the prospects to some extent.Amid such an equivocal scenario, investors are often on the lookout for 'cash cow' stocks that would enable them to rake in more profits.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher the better. It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we added  and  as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we take a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock. This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. Of course, the higher the ROA, the better it is. This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.

In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher the better. It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we added  and  as our primary screening parameters.

The single-portal approach is resonating with consumers. Alarm.com already boasts 2.6 million subscribers, and that figure should continue growing, given that the home security market alone includes over 22 million homes. As of August, Alarm.com's installers were adding between 10,000 and 15,000 properties per week to their service.The majority of Alarm.com's sales come through profit-friendly recurring revenue streams (service and licenses), and with a renewal rate of 93%, there's plenty of clarity into future sales and profit. In Q2, total revenue clocked in at $64 million, up 24% year over year, and adjusted EPS were $0.15, up from $0.04 a year ago.The trend toward outfitting homes with 21st-century technology should offer intriguing growth opportunities for Alarm.com, and since Alarm.com already makes money, cross-selling additional services to an increasingly bigger customer base makes this company's future look pretty secure.Image source: Paycom.Paycom's one-stop software solution is resonating with companies. In Q2, Paycom's revenue jumped 51% year over year to $73.9 million, and its non-GAAP EPS more than doubled to $0.21 from $0.10. Management predicts that its full-year sales will surpass $325 million this year, up from $224.7 million in 2015 (which itself was up 49% from 2014!), and that has industry watchers targeting EPS of $0.77 in 2016 and $0.96 in 2017.Although the HR-solutions market is competitive, Paycom is one of the only solution providers that was built from the ground up for the Internet, and frankly, I think its Midwest HQ provides it with some cost advantages over competitors located in pricier markets, such as California. While large companies are likely to continue sticking with software solutions that bigger companies offer, including  , I think there's still a significant greenfield opportunity for Paycom in the mid-size market.

But the question here is why? This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Take a company's revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!Investors should always look out for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Earnings acceleration, however, works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates. However, if you pick stocks just on the basis of earnings growth then you are paying for something that has already been reflected in the stock price.So, what is earnings acceleration? It is the incremental growth in a company's earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. Sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down. Hence, earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance. :Let's look for stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods.

(Symbol: CTXS) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $87.79/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.7% return against the $75 commitment, or a 4.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTXS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $75 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Citrix Systems, Inc. sees its shares decline 14.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $70.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.30 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $75 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $75 strike for the 4.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Citrix Systems, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $87.79) to be 30%.

However, the markets made a dramatic rebound in the later part of the day on expectations of an economic stimulus that would boost hiring and corporate earnings while cutting taxes.Amid such an equivocal scenario, investors are often on the lookout for 'cash cow' stocks that would enable them to rake in more profits.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher the better. It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we added  and  as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we take a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock. This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. Of course, the higher the ROA, the better it is. This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.

But I was as surprised as anyone when, in July of this year, the company announced that it had arranged a merger with its primary competitor, Citrix Systems. That news  , driving LogMeIn stock up 20% when it was announced. What may surprise you even more is that there may be even more gains in store.This morning, analysts at Barclays Capital announced a huge upgrade of LogMeIn stock. As reported on  , Barclays raised its rating on the company from equal weight to overweight, and lifted its price target from $82 all the way to $105 in expectation of greater-than-expected cost synergies from the merger. This implies a further 16% in profits are awaiting investors in the company, assuming the deal to merge with Citrix's divested GoToMeeting and related assets goes forward.Here are three things you need to know about it.LogMeIn software helps people access their computers from anywhere. Image source: Getty Images.LogMeIn was built for telecommuters and computer fixer-uppers. Its core focus is building software that permits a user on one computer to remotely and securely access and operate a computer far away. Over time, the business has evolved to offer new capabilities to its users, and the addition of Citrix's GoTo assets, which include videoconferencing and remote training applications, will turn the company into an \"industry leader\" in the \"Software as a Service\" space.In fact, according to data from LogMeIn's 10-K filings, once the merger takes place, the only remaining direct competitor of significantly larger size remaining would be  .In a press release in July, Citrix and LogMeIn sketched out the effects of combining LogMeIn with Citrix's GoTo assets. According to the companies, their combined operations will generate \"pro forma revenue of $1+ billion,\" and pro forma EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in excess of $350 million in 2017.Synergies from the merger will unleash a wave of excess cash production, says management, saving the companies an estimated $65 million in cash the first year after the merger, and perhaps $100 million two years out. In dollars and cents, this could work out to \"pro forma free cash flow\" of more than $250 million in the merger's first year.That sounds pretty good, but at the same time, LogMeIn and Citrix  described their free cash flow thusly: \"Anticipated Pro Forma 35%+ Free Cash Flow Accretion over Standalone LogMeIn (after year one run rate cost synergies).\" What, one wonders, does all  mean?Well, according to data from  , stand-alone LogMeIn only generated about $71 million in free cash flow (cash from operations, minus capital spending) last year. \"Plus\" another \"35%\" would only grow that number to about $96 million -- which is quite a ways short of the $250 million LogMeIn promises elsewhere in its press release.And this is where Barclays' rationale for recommending the merger could fall apart. According to Citrix and LogMeIn, the combined market value of the merging companies was expected to be approximately $1.8 billion back in July. But that estimation was based on LogMeIn's then-recent share price of $65.31 -- which has since shot past $90, pushing LogMeIn stock's valuation to nearly $2.3 billion, as investors got more and more excited about the merger.Now, paying $2.3 billion for a company generating $250 million or more in free cash flow might make a lot of sense. That would work out to a price-to-free cash flow ratio of less than 10, and for a company that S&P Global says is likely to grow its earnings at 25% or better annually over the next five years, that's a very cheap price indeed.On the other hand, if the best a combined LogMeIn-cum-Citrix can manage is $96 million in free cash flow post-merger, then the resulting valuation of 24 times free cash flow -- while still attractive -- becomes much less so. Such a valuation calls into question Barclays' estimate that the combined company's stock will grow in value from $90 today to $105 a share a year from now. In fact, it might already be about tapped out, and fairly priced.So  LogMeIn a bargain, or is it not? It really all depends on which free cash flow estimate we are supposed to believe -- which one turns out to be fact, and which one mere market puffery. For the answer to  puzzler, we'll probably have to wait for the merger to be effected -- so for now, my best advice is to just wait and see.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Moreover, the company beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with the average earnings surprise at 28.97%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.A major positive for Citrix is its impressive product portfolio. The company regularly innovates and employs cutting-edge technology to enhance its product portfolio. In fact, it launched a string of new products and enhancements especially for its NetScaler App. The company's desktop virtualization segment is also expected to drive top-line growth.However, the company's extensive global presence exposes it to foreign exchange volatility. Earnings might also be affected by slow-paced economic growth in major economies as well as intense competition from peers.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Citrix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

In a  LogMeIn said that the $1.8 billion transaction will give it run-rate cost synergies of $65 million in the first year after the merger and more than $100 million in year two.Bill Wagner, LogMeIn's CEO who will lead the combined company, lauded the merger and the benefits it will bring to shareholders in his comments in the press release. This is a very smart deal by LogMeIn, but as is the case with any merger, whether it works out comes down to execution. In some cases bringing two rivals together can lead to short-term headaches where the expected efficiency gains are not as easy to obtain as planned.It's hard to think this deal won't work out in the long run as these two companies control nearly the entire space The bigger question is whether it works quickly or will it take a few quarters after the deal consummates to bring the two company cultures together.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Yet, results are improving sequentially and showing impressive beat ratios. Moreover, the U.S. equity market has sustained its Bull Run for the seventh consecutive year with stocks hovering around record high territory.As investors scout for cherry pickings, they are often on the lookout for 'cash cow' stocks that would enable them to milk more cash or profits.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is a useful tool for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up cash.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher the better. It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we added  and  as our primary screening parameters. However, these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks. As such, we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock. This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of its assets, which include cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. Of course, the higher the ROA, the better it is. This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated to solid cash strength.

With that on the brain, we decided to look at sectors that are historically strong from August through December. Source: And tech stocks are near the very top of the list.Over the past 19 years, tech stocks - as measured by the  (NYSEARCA:  ) - have shown strong performance into year's end. Given the current strength in the sector there is evidence to suggest that we will see this seasonality trend play out once more in 2016.Following our quantified model, we've identified seven XLK components that are ranked as market outperformers. Or, in terms you'll like even better, these are tech stocks that we see as having or more upside by the end of the year.15% Networking company  (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the relative strength leaders in the tech sector. Both the charts and fundamental picture look strong here.From a technical perspective, Citrix shares are in strong long- and short-term bullish trends. As of now, CTXS is trading well above its 20-month moving average, which has been trending higher, indicating a strong technical trend.Our models identify Citrix as an undervalued stock due to a sheer lack of attention from the market. Meanwhile, short interest on CTXS shares stands at a whopping eight times their daily average, suggesting a short covering rally is likely to propel the stock higher as it moves to new all-time highs soon.Watch for Citrix to move to the $100 mark on the next long-term move.11%  (NYSE:  ) is the talk of the market right now after  . The market once turned away from Alibaba shares because of the fear surrounding economic stalling in China. Now, with the picture not looking so dire, we should expect that the market will warm to BABA.Alibaba's chart sure looks pleasant. The stock moved into a long-term bull market trend last month to break above its 20-month moving average. And like Citrix Systems, Alibaba shares are now benefiting from pessimistic sentiment \"unwinding,\" which results in BABA shares climbing the \"wall of worry\" as the crowd begins to turn bullish and buy the stock.With shares now trading above $90, we expect to see a short-term pullback as traders cash out on some profits. That in turn should create an opportunity to buy a dip in the short-term future.When that happens, strike - that's your opportunity to ride Alibaba back over $100 for the first time since June 2015.16% Big Blue has been seeing green lately. (NYSE:  ) has been successful in reinventing its business line to new technology needs. IBM was all but thrown out by investors and analysts - the very same people that now must take note of the company's turnaround. IBM shares are trading back in a bull market trend for the first time since 2013.From a shorter-term perspective, the stock is finding consistent support at its 50- and 200-day moving averages, which are now trending higher, indicating that an intermediate-term bull run is in effect.A paltry 27% of Wall Street analysts covering IBM recommend the stock as a buy right now, while 19% have sell ratings. Remember: This is a high-profile  component, which means analysts can't afford to be on the wrong side of a long-term move.Expect to see the next quarter's earnings shoe more improvement and serve as a proving ground that will cause Wall Street to warm up to shares. The technical trend and upgrade potential will help IBM hit the $190 region.10% Most investors don't consider  (NYSE:  ) as a tech company, but its electronic payment services are actually in a very hot spot right now. With electronic transactions growing, Western Union's place in the market has strengthened, improving WU's bottom line.The fundamental improvements have resulted in a strong technical picture that has seen the stock rally strongly from its 2012 bottom when investors wrote the stock off. The market still hasn't realized the strength, though - only 19% of the analysts tracking the stock rank it a buy, and the short sellers have increased positions to an extremely high level. These factors indicate that WU, too, is climbing the wall of worry.After testing their 20-month moving average, Western Union shares are trending toward the $23 level, their highs since May 2015. The bears out there will realize that the stock is moving against them and turn into buyers, moving shares beyond $23 before year's end.15%  (NASDAQ:  ) is heading into the holiday season and the new software releases that bolster sales. This makes the gamemaker a seasonal favorite for traders.We've watched EA shares hover just under resistance at the $80 mark. The upcoming earnings and product releases - in the next few months, we'll see  ,  and  - should propel EA shares above this resistance and into a new bullish trend.Sentiment toward Electronic Arts is somewhat bearish, as the short sellers are heavily betting against a break higher. Recent short interest data shows that almost 10 times the average daily volume is tied up in bearish EA bets. But expect a break higher to shake the shorts loose - short sellers will have to buy to close their positions, and that will only further drive EA shares north.Our model currently ranks Electronic Arts shares a strong buy with a target of $90 over the next four months.10% Similar to Western Union,  (NASDAQ:  ) belongs in this list of tech stocks because of its electronic processing of payroll and payroll service for companies. Paychex is benefiting from growth in the jobs market, which obviously fuels better revenue and earnings.At 28 times earnings, PAYX shares seem overvalued, but remember that overvalued can always become  .Paychex's charts are incredibly strong for PAYX as the shares have remained in a long-term bullish trend since 2011. Less than of the  can claim that! Despite this strength, only of Wall Street's analysts rank the stock a buy. Again, this puts PAYX in another rare category in the S&P 500, as the average stock within the index has at least 50% of recommendations leaning toward buying.This stock will benefit from a change of heart by the analyst community as we should see upgrades from hold to buy on any opportunity, especially around the next earnings season. Our model ranks PAYX a buy with a target of $66 before year-end.18%  (NASDAQ:  ) is something of a wild card, as it reports earnings on Thursday, Aug. 11. So a lot is going to hinge on what happens after its report.The semiconductor company has been tearing it up, as shares have improved by more than 140% in just a year! Normally we would be cautious about such a strong run, but Nvidia's fundamental picture is just so darn good - the company keeps expanding into new product lines, which we like - that it supports ever higher valuations.The chart for Nvidia has gone parabolic, going from $35 to almost $60 in the last four months, and the stock is setting all-time highs seemingly every day. While we think NVDA shares could see a short-term pullback, we would view it as a buying opportunity. The reason: Analysts have been sitting on the sideline while Nvidia has sprinted away.

Yet, results are improving sequentially and showing impressive beat ratios. Moreover, the U.S. equity market has sustained its Bull Run for the seventh consecutive year with stocks hovering around record high territory.As investors scout for cherry pickings, they are often on the lookout for 'cash cow' stocks that would enable them to milk more cash or profits.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is a useful tool for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up cash.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher the better. It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we added  and  as our primary screening parameters. However, these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks. As such, we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock. This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of its assets, which include cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. Of course, the higher the ROA, the better it is. This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated to solid cash strength.

A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of Citrix Systems, Inc.

By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 32.1.

The software company, in fact, has a healthy track record with respect to earnings, having delivered positive surprises in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 36.60%.Citrix is focused on innovation and provision of best services to its customers. The company operates in three main markets - desktop virtualization, cloud infrastructure in addition to collaboration and sharing. Citrix is expected to gain from an accelerating desktop virtualization market as it has become a top priority for any IT setup. Citrix's practice of centralized management of employee desktops would result in greater security, resulting in better control and cost savings. Moreover, the company's extended partnership with Microsoft Corporation  should boost top-line performance too.However, a slowdown in economic growth and contraction in market share due to lower global demand for PCs and notebooks could hurt the company's top line. Additionally, foreign exchange risks pose a threat to the company's bottom line. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Citrix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below. The Earnings ESP for the company currently stands at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 92 cents. Citrix carries a Zacks Rank #1 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement,especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies you may want to consider instead, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Open Text Corp.  has an earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank #1.Bruker Corporation  has an earnings ESP of +5.26% and a Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: CTXS) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $86.41/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $67.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.4% return against the $67.50 commitment, or a 4.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTXS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $67.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Citrix Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 21.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $63.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.30 from $67.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.3% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $67.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $67.50 strike for the 4.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Citrix Systems, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $86.41) to be 35%.

In other words, there are lots more put buyers out there in  so far today than would normally be seen, as compared to call buyers.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ybersecurity firm  (NYSE: IMPV) recently slashed its second-quarter sales guidance due to extended sales cycles and the smaller size of larger purchases. The company now expects sales to rise only about 8% for the quarter that ended June 30, compared to its prior forecast for 22.4% to 24.3% growth. Analysts, on average, had expected 23.6% sales growth.Shares of Imperva fell 5% in the two days following the July 11 announcement of preliminary Q2 results. The stock has stabilized since then, but it remains down about 33% over the past 12 months due to concerns about slower enterprise spending, competition, its lack of profitability, and lofty valuations. While those bearish arguments against Imperva are valid, investors should also take a contrarian view and see why this out-of-favor stock might bounce back and consider how much weight to give those potential catalysts.Image source: Getty Images.Imperva's core SecureSphere product is a web application firewall (WAF) that shields individual apps from specialized attacks. This is a small niche market, but Sandler Research forecasts it will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 17.3% between 2014 and 2019.Last July,  named Imperva the sole market leader in its  for WAF vendors for the second straight year. Imperva's competitors in the WAF space include  (NYSE: CUDA) ,  (NASDAQ: CTXS) ,  (NASDAQ: FFIV) , and  (NASDAQ: FTNT) .However, Gartner reports that Barracuda can't match Imperva in security automation, Citrix doesn't offer competitive pricing, and F5 and Fortinet both offer WAFs with their application delivery controllers (ADCs). Neither F5 nor Fortinet focuses heavily on stand-alone \"WAFs as cloud services,\" which Imperva does with its subscription-based Incapsula service.Therefore, if Imperva maintains its market-leading position and the WAF market continues growing, its tepid second-quarter guidance could just be a bump in the road. Analysts don't expect Imperva's long-term growth to slow down anytime soon -- sales are still expected to rise 19% this year and 23% next year.There's also a strong chance that Imperva could be acquired for a premium to its current stock price, though it isn't wise to invest based on a hope for acquisition. In late June, activist investor Elliot Associates disclosed that it had a stake of almost 10% in Imperva. In the filing, Elliot called the stock \"materially undervalued,\" and said it was talking to the company's management about pursuing \"strategic and operational opportunities.\"That implied one of two things would likely happen -- Imperva could dramatically cut costs to narrow its losses, or it could sell itself. In early July, Bloomberg reported that Imperva had hired investment bank Qatalyst Partners to help it explore a sale after receiving \"unsolicited takeover interest.\" Imperva's CEO Anthony Bettencourt also isn't a stranger to big deals. Back in 2005, he orchestrated the sale of his former employer, Verity, to Autonomy for $500 million.Imperva's market-leading WAF technology would be a good fit for many larger tech companies with growing security portfolios like  and  . Its current enterprise value of $1.2 billion would also be a small price to pay, even after factoring in acquisition premiums. However, investors should remember that Barracuda tried to sell itself earlier this year for similar reasons, but no  emerged.Short interest in Imperva rose nearly 29% in the two weeks ending on July 12, accounting for 9.4% of the overall float. That isn't a huge percentage of its shares, but short interest may have continued rising following its dismal guidance on July 11.Investors who short a stock make money if its price falls.Investing in a stock with rising short-interest generally isn't a good idea, and investing in hopes of a short-squeeze driving up the price is also not a good idea, but a short-squeeze could occur in Imperva stock if potential suitors emerge or its second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 4 reveals more encouraging figures. A rising price on a heavily shorted stock can lead to an even higher price because people who shorted a stock borrowed shares to do so. They have to buy shares to return the ones they borrowed and if the price starts to rise, they could start buying, increasing demand.I'm personally not interested in buying Imperva, since its slowdown in sales growth and widening losses hint at plenty of downside risks ahead. There are also better niche cybersecurity plays  , which dominates the market for privileged account management and is actually profitable on a GAAP basis. However, investors with an appetite for riskier cybersecurity plays might want to keep this stock on their long-term watchlists.However, it could also be a bad idea to short Imperva right now, since the company is trying to sell itself while short-interest is rising.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

This has lured investors back to the equity markets from safe-haven assets like government bond and gold.As investors scout for cherry pickings, they are often on the lookout for 'cash cow' stocks that would enable them to milk more cash or profits.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is a useful tool for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up the dry powder.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher the better. It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we added  and  as our primary screening parameters. However, these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks. As such, we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.

The main objective of the consortium is to build an open standard that can facilitate cloud-based digital signatures for both the mobile and web platforms. Through the offering, the company expects to allow users to digitally sign a document from anywhere in the world.Like the hand-written signature, a digital signature is a method of digital authorization. The only difference is that digital signatures are the most advanced and secure form of electronic authorization. Due to its user-friendly nature, digital authorization is increasingly gaining popularity among businesses and governments worldwide. Existing standards-compliant digital signatures are time consuming and exhaustive processes that often require storing certificate-based IDs on physical devices such as a smart card or a USB drive. This keeps users tethered to their workstations. The current offering also fails to meet growing consumer expectations of a simple and engaging experience that can work on any device from any location. The cloud-based digital signature solutions available in the market today are proprietary and fragmented that don't offer a choice for certificate providers. The new standard of digital authorization would give everyone access to secure digital signature solutions on various cloud applications and mobile devices, bringing about a transformation in businesses globally. Application processes that involve signer identification such as business license, marriage, loans or social security benefits are expected to be significantly expedited with the implementation of the new standard.Adobe is developing an open standard, in collaboration with industry leaders, to bridge the gap between the most secure form of electronic signature and over seven billion mobile devices online across the world.In this regard, we note that through Adobe Sign and Adobe Document Cloud, more than six billion digital and electronic signature transactions are already processed every year. Backed by its recent offering of cloud-based digital signatures, Adobe will likely be able to take the industry to new highs.In fact, by the end of this year, the Cloud Signature Consortium intends to release the specifications of the new standard, followed by its implementation shortly thereafter.At present, Adobe carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include ACI Worldwide, Inc.  , Citrix Systems, Inc.  and Exa Corp.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, one should not confuse it with a blend strategy. While the blend strategy chooses value and growth stocks, GARP investing looks for stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.So when the market is rebounding strongly after bleeding or staying stable over a prolonged time period, investing in stocks by following the GARP strategy should boost one's portfolio returns.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by borrowing the best features of both value and growth investing. While investors following the GARP strategy give precedence to value ratios such as price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio, they also use earnings per share (EPS) growth rates and return on equity (ROE) like growth investors to identify potential stocks. However, the range of the values of metrics that are considered by GARP investing may differ from those that are considered by value or growth investors.While value investors look for an extremely low P/E ratio to choose a company, the GARP strategy focuses on acquiring stocks that have relatively higher ratios but less than their respective industry average. Meanwhile, GARP investing chooses stocks with P/B ratios lower than their industries similar to value investors.Separately, investors following the GARP strategy give priority to stocks with an impressive EPS growth track record over those with extremely high growth rates. Companies that qualify GARP investing are believed to have 10% to 20% past as well as expected growth rates over the next few years.Another metric, which is borrowed by GARP investors from growth investing, is return on equity (ROE). Like growth investors, the GARP strategy looks for stocks with higher ROE than their industry average.Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section, we have also considered a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) - to make the strategy more profitable.(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)\u2022 (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)\u2022 (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)\u2022 (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are the stocks that made it through the screen: (  ) is specialty retailer of products for the home.

This has lured investors back to the equity markets from safe-haven assets like government bond and gold.As investors scout for cherry pickings, they are often on the lookout for 'cash cow' stocks that would enable them to milk more cash or profits.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is a useful tool for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up the dry powder.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher the better. It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we added  and  as our primary screening parameters. However, these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks. As such, we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.

SAP Hybris Commerce offers a comprehensive commerce platform that allows integration of digital and physical customer interactions across multiple platforms including online, mobile, point-of-sale, call center, social media and print.Few of the notable upgrades in the solution include new promotions engine, augmented customer support & back-office tools and redesigned content management system. SAP Hybris Commerce solution has a \"single-stack architecture\" at its core which enables rapid deployment on \"on premise\", private cloud and software-as-a-service platforms.SAP believes that omnichannel commerce and state-of-the-art experiences are the future of digital commerce. The company believes that the latest launch will fortify its hold in the digital commerce platform by offering services beyond commerce. SAP Hybris has been a popular offering, earning accolades like Gartner's 2016 Magic Quadrant Report for Digital Commerce and The Forrester Wave: B2B Order Management, Q4 2015.Meanwhile, market research reports reveal more than 90% of marketers are focusing on improving customer experience through personalization. Currently, an average of 11 siloed channels are being deployed by the marketers, which is resulting in below-par results.Despite the product launches and thriving cloud business, SAP's prospects looks gloomy. A host of factors like stiff competition in the IT services industry, persistent weakness in multiple end-markets like Latin America and Brazil along with escalating research and development expenses pose significant headwinds. Also, there is an inherent seasonality in client's technology spending, which exposes the company's sales to risks of quarterly fluctuations. | As a matter of fact, earnings estimates of the company have been going down prior to its second-quarter release. Over the past 30 days, brokers have revised earnings estimates downward from $3.61 to $3.52, reflecting a bearish outlook.SAP currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the same industry include Nuance Communications, Inc.  , Citrix Systems, Inc.  and Exa Corp.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

As the news spread like a wildfire, about $2.1 trillion of investor wealth was wiped out from the global markets - reportedly the heaviest suffered in a single market day.Though the markets have bounced back, the situation still remains volatile, where money can play a key role in surviving carnage. So, investors are often on the lookout for \"cash cow\" stocks to milk more cash or profits to avert capital flight.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is a useful tool for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up the dry powder.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry - the higher the better. It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we added  and  as our primary screening parameters. However, these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks in a turbulent market. As such, we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy to mint money. This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock. This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of its assets, which include cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. Of course, the higher the ROA, the better it is. This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated to solid cash strength. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are 5 of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening: : Headquartered in Richmond, VA, Altria manufactures and sells cigarettes, smokeless products, and wine through its subsidiaries. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has a healthy long-term earnings growth expectation of 7.5%. : Headquartered in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, Braskem has the largest petrochemical operation in Latin America.

However, one should not confuse it with a blend strategy. While the blend strategy chooses value and growth stocks, GARP investing looks for stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.So when the market is rebounding strongly after bleeding or staying stable over a prolonged time period, investing in stocks by following the GARP strategy should boost one's portfolio returns.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by borrowing the best features of both value and growth investing. While investors following the GARP strategy give precedence to value ratios such as price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio, they also use earnings per share (EPS) growth rates and return on equity (ROE) like growth investors to identify potential stocks. However, the range of the values of metrics that are considered by GARP investing may differ from those that are considered by value or growth investors.While value investors look for an extremely low P/E ratio to choose a company, the GARP strategy focuses on acquiring stocks that have relatively higher ratios but less than their respective industry average. Meanwhile, GARP investing chooses stocks with P/B ratios lower than their industries similar to value investors.Separately, investors following the GARP strategy give priority to stocks with an impressive EPS growth track record over those with extremely high growth rates. Companies that qualify GARP investing are believed to have 10% to 20% past as well as expected growth rates over the next few years.Another metric, which is borrowed by GARP investors from growth investing, is return on equity (ROE). Like growth investors, the GARP strategy looks for stocks with higher ROE than their industry average.Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section, we have also considered a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) - to make the strategy more profitable.(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)\u2022 (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)\u2022 (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)\u2022 (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are the stocks that made it through the screen: is specialty retailer of products for the home.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he first half of 2016 was rather tumultuous for investors. The slowdown in the Chinese economy coupled with sliding  set off alarm bells every now and then at all the major domestic indexes, fueling concerns of a global economic slowdown.Also, in March, the Federal Reserve backtracked on its decision to hike rates four times a year to two times in 2016 statin that \"global and financial developments continue to pose risks\", thereby failing to allay investors' concerns.However, in a meeting held in mid-June, the Fed didn't hike rates as a weak jobs report for May; a low level of business investment and lower-than-expected inflation wasn't conducive to a rate hike. For the time being, interest rates continue to stay between 0.25% and 0.50%.Finally, shocking \"Brexit\" results, whereby the people of Britain chose to leave the 28 nation European Union, led the equity markets across the globe, including the U.S, to a massive sell off, wiping out nearly $3 trillion dollars. Prior to the referendum held on Jun 24, most of the poll results were in favor of \"Bremain\" but the actual results came in favor of \"Brexit\" by a slight margin. While the \"Leave\" vote share was 51.9%, votes to \"Remain\" in the EU came in marginally below at 48.1%. Following the results, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he would step down by October. The Fed chairperson had earlier added at the FOMC meeting that the \"Brexit\" scenario was likely to have \"consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets.\"It seems that markets have started to shrug off the overblown fears of Brexit. Last week, the S&P 500, NASDAQ composite and Dow Jones industrial average closed in the green, reverting most of the Brexit losses. The S&P 500 was up 4.3%, NASDAQ composite was up 4.4% and DJIA was up 4.2%, given the recent encouraging pool of economic data. This signals further growth for the domestic economy in the latter half of the year.Data for the month of June on private sector jobs, manufacturing and consumer spending was encouraging. Also, the \"third\" estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that first quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 1.1%, higher than the consensus estimate of a 1% increase. In addition, relatively lower gas prices will give Americans the freedom to spend more on discretionary activities, thus boding well for the economy.Volatility has had its fair share of impact on the technology sector. Year-to-date, the S&P North American Technology Sector Index is down 0.2% as against a gain of 2.9% for the S&P 500. However, we believe that it is too early to call out the sector now because the stronger season is typically in the back half of the year and there are other catalysts that can increase technology spending very rapidly. Also, the buzz surrounding cloud computing, AR/ VR and AI technology keeps investors' interest in the sector alive. It's also important to note that tech companies have huge cash balances that should help in facilitating organic and inorganic expansion.Now that the first half of 2016 has come to an end, let's not sulk over opportunities lost. By using our Zacks Stocks Screener, we bring forth five such stocks with a VGM Score of 'A' or 'B' and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that promise better returns, on an average, than the individual components, as it considers three times as many items that are correlated to future stock returns. : Headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, Arista Networks offers cloud networking solutions for datacenter and cloud computing environments.

This is an omnichannel cloud customer engagement solution that will aid clients to deliver contextual and relevant service experiences regardless of channel or device. This offering further expands the company's service solutions in the SAP Hybris portfolio and will help organizations in combining unassisted and assisted service with digital commerce during and after the buying process.The company believes this solution will take call centers to the next level by resolving issues stemming from the ongoing proliferation of interaction channels and customer touch points. Notable benefits would include higher agent productivity, accelerated online buying decisions, lower return rates and reduction of operational costs. This offering will help business enterprises supplement business applications with geographic data from geographic information systems (GIS), such as Esri ArcGIS. Also, continuous collaboration between SAP and Esri will help clients to obtain contextual insight from business and spatial data. In addition, this can also be used in conjunction with SAP BusinessObjects Cloud and SAP BusinessObjects Lumira software to enrich data with geographic information and map visualizations.Despite the product launches and thriving cloud business, SAP's prospects looks murky. A host of factors like stiff competition in the IT services industry, persistent weakness in multiple end-markets like Latin America and Brazil along with escalating research and development expenses pose significant headwinds. Also, there is an inherent seasonality in client's technology spending, which exposes the company's sales to risks of quarterly fluctuations. | As a matter of fact, earnings estimates of the company have been going down prior to its second-quarter results. Over the past 30 days, brokers have revised earnings estimates downward from $3.61 to $3.52, reflecting a bearish outlook. In addition, inherent seasonality in technology spending has largely hurt this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company's software revenues and may continue to do so in the to-be-reported quarter.Better-ranked stocks in the industry include CommVault Systems, Inc.  , Citrix Systems, Inc.  and Exa Corp.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In most cases, betting on whether a company will beat or miss has been a crapshoot, with unpredictable outcomes in EPS.  and  are recent examples where investors have been disappointed, after missed expectations have caused big gaps lower in the stocks.However, there has been a consistent area in tech that has been seeing a beat in both top and bottom lines and gaps higher in stock price. Recent earnings from VMware (VMW), F5 Networks, Citrix Systems and Manhattan Associates are examples of what some of the internet software and cloud names are doing after earnings. More specifically, business and application software is a segment of technology that is standing out above the rest.While there are many of these companies out there, I wanted to focus on top ranked business and application software companies showing strong earnings momentum and healthy price action. The stocks listed below have a Zack Rank #1 or #2 and have recently had strong earnings, or anticipate an EPS beat in the near future. is a Zacks Rank #1 that is a developer and provider of supply chain commerce solutions. The company is engaged in selling, deploying, servicing and maintaining software solutions to manage supply chains for its customers. Manhattan's solutions enhance distribution efficiencies through the integration of supply chain constituents, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, suppliers, transportation providers and end consumers.Manhattan has a market cap of almost $5 billion and a forward PE of 41. The high valuation is an issue for some investors and this is why it has a Zacks Style Score of \"F\" in Value. However, the stock sports a Style Score of \"A\" in Growth and Momentum, as many investors believe that the high valuation is justified by growth in the business.The investors focused on growth were recently rewarded after Manhattan reported a Q1 EPS of $0.42 verse the $0.39 expected. While the EPS beat was nice, guidance was very impressive as the company raised fiscal year 2016 to $1.69-1.72 verse the $1.67 expected.Investors responded positively as the stock jumped over 15% and held onto most of its gains. Looking at the chart below, we see that the surprise beat probably should have been expected, as the company hasn't missed on EPS in the last 4 years. The stock seems like it still has room to run and is likely to see 2015 highs some point this year. is a Zacks Rank #2 that is one of the leading suppliers of application delivery and management software and services that enable the effective and efficient enterprise-wide deployment and management of applications. The company's solutions offer secure, mobile workspaces that provide people with access to apps, desktops, data and communications on any device, over any network or cloud. The Ft. Lauderdale based company operates in two segments: Enterprise and Service Provider division and the Mobility Apps division.Citrix has a market cap of $12.75 billion and a forward PE of 21. The stock sports a Style Score of \"A\" in Growth and Momentum with an expected 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 14.37%.Q1 earnings came in last week at $1.18 verse the $0.93 expected and revenues were reported at $826 Million verse the $787 Million expected. The company also guided Q2 above expectations and raised their fiscal year outlook to $4.90-5.00 verse the $4.72 expected.The stock jumped over 10% after the release before pulling back to the $83 level on Friday. Brokerages rushed to raise price targets, including Cowen who raise from $85 to $92, reiterating their Outperform rating.Like Manhattan, Citrix has shown an amazing ability to perform every quarter. This pullback after earnings could provide investors with a great opportunity to buy, before the sock breaks 2012 highs and heads towards its tech bubble high of $122.31 is a Zacks Rank #1 that provides sophisticated information processing and computer software services and products that help clients improve productivity, increase efficiencies, and provide higher levels of customer service. DST is organized domestically and internationally into three operating segments: Financial Services, Output Solutions, and Customer Management. The Kansas City based company operates one of the most advanced data centers in the world, which provides information-processing services to support the products within each operating segment.DST has a market cap of $4 billion and a forward PE of 18. The company sports a Zacks Style Score of \"C\" in Value, \"B\" in Momentum and pays a dividend just over 1%.In 2015, the stock hit all-time highs at $13.65 before pulling back below the $100 level multiple times. Last week the company reported Q1 earnings that beat both the top and bottom line causing the stock to jump almost 5% over the next couple days. Sitting at the $120 area now, the stock looks to continue its momentum over the last couple years and get back to 2015 highs.CEO Stephen Hooley went into detail on the quarter: \"We are pleased with our first quarter operating results particularly in our Healthcare business which delivered double digit growth over prior year. We have also achieved revenue growth in our Financial Services segment as the benefits of our recent acquisitions are coming through in this quarter's results and we continue to generate margin expansion in our Customer Communications business. We continue to deliver in line with our overall strategic plan. This includes a focus on growing revenue through organic opportunities and targeted acquisitions, and making investments in our businesses to prepare and position DST for the future.\" is a Zacks Rank #1 that provides voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers worldwide. The Burlington, Massachusetts based company operates through four segments: Healthcare, Mobile and Consumer, Enterprise, and Imaging. Its technologies, applications and services make the user experience more compelling by transforming the way people interact with information and how they create, share and use documents.Nuance has a market cap of $5.5 billion and a forward PE of 19. The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of \"B\" in Momentum and \"B\" in Growth. The company's expected 3-5 year EPS growth rate in 14.50% and will report earnings on May 10th.If Nuance follows the sector trend, the stock should surprise higher on EPS for the seventh consecutive quarter. If they can show a substantial beat, the momentum the stock has had over the last year should send shares to multi year highs. is a Zacks Rank #1 that provides a suite of software products and services that assist organizations in finding, utilizing, and sharing business information from various devices. The Canadian based company allows individuals, teams, organizations, and global trading communities to collaborate on projects, share ideas and accelerate innovation to the fastest possible speed.Open Text has a market cap of almost $6.7 billion and a forward PE of 16. The company sports weak Style Scores of \"D\" in both Growth and Value and Momentum, but pays investors a 1.4% dividend.The company reports on April 27th where it will go for its fourth EPS beat in as many quarters. If the stock follows the EPS trend, a big EPS surprise to the upside could bring the stock back to all-time highs. If the bullish scenario plays out a short squeeze could lead to a surge in price, as the stock has a short interest ratio (days to cover) of 13.7.Sometimes investing can be easy if you just stick with what's working. Computer software companies that continue to exceed earnings expectations will continue to see higher stock prices. Investors that want exposure to tech and this earnings power need to focus some of their portfolio on software application companies. The growth in this area remains as businesses and individuals continue their desire to become more efficient.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

Source: So, instead of looking for opportunities to time the market, simply buy bulletproof blue-chip stocks. They will help you manage risk, maximize opportunity and keep your blood pressure down.If you are looking for some stability in this dynamic, range-bound market, your best choice is one or more of these stocks.With global growth slowing, and likely to remain weak through the end of the year, you need to look for companies that know how to profit even when the business cycle isn't in their favor.The following bulletproof blue chips are market leaders that have a history of making lemonade out of lemons. And its a diverse group as well, which goes to show, with a little effort you can still find really good companies at a very good price. (  ) is an obvious top choice. Up more than 200% since going public four years ago this week, this social media juggernaut continues to grow its subscribers through other services and build a very solid advertising business.At this point, 80% of FB's revenues are derived from mobile. That's a good thing because it means it doesn't rely much on the waning desktop business and its poised for significant future growth.What's more, it also is moving into the virtual reality market. Its Oculus Rift headset, along with controllers and games is the first VR set to make a splash, and others will follow. But being first is important, especially because some firms are making augmented reality headsets and there will likely be a fight between the two for supremacy among gamers and casual users.This is expected to be a $120 billion market in the next four years. Right now, it's around $1 billion. That's some huge growth, quickly. And FB is there. (  ) may not be at the tip of your tongue when it comes to thinking about companies that are major beneficiaries of the hottest trends in the market today - the cloud and apps. But it should be.CTXS makes all this work between users and apps or the cloud and then on the back side for enterprise operations that manage the data.The company has been around for 25 years and was an early adopter of the software-driven workplace and the needs to make IT flexible enough that business can be conducted from any location on virtually any device.The stock is up 25% in the past 12 months, which puts it pretty near the top of Big Tech stocks. What's more, because it built its business around a big idea that will be playing itself out for the next decade, it's sure to grow for a long time to come.The stock is up about $30 per share since the turnaround went\ninto effect, and it shows what visionary management can do. (  ) has had quite a couple years. First, it looked doomed to become a has-been in the fast-food world.Poor management, little effort to keep up with new dining trends, an upper management that had basically become an echo chamber where they only listened to their own voices - pride cometh before the fall.But then, after consistently bad quarters with lower revenues (almost unheard of for the massive burger chain) it finally decided it was time to make some big changes.New leadership, new menu items, healthier options and all-day breakfast turned this battleship pretty quickly.Essentially, MCD need a reboot and finally got one. It's up 27% in the past 12 months and there's no reason it can't keep this momentum. Its 2.8% dividend is also attractive. (  ) is becoming a massive firm that is successfully involved in everything from original content to grocery delivery to cloud-based computing.The knock on AMZN has been that no matter how good its revenues, it was always plowing the money back into new projects or expanding established ones. Analysts didn't trust that approach. They like huge piles of cash to build up like Smaug's treasure.Yet, in the past year, AMZN is up a stunning 63%, and for the past five years it's up 244%. That makes it a serious juggernaut in the \"new retail\" sector. And a large part of its continued strength is in its cloud computing division. It's the fastest growing part of the business and has the best margins.The stock is off a bit from its recent highs, which makes this a great time to get in.If you want to play the next leg of Retail 2.0, AMZN is the hands-down choice. (  ) is one of those stocks that you either love or hate. Right now, I happen to love it.It knows how to make money, quarter after quarter, year after year. It can even pay out billions of dollars in fines, completely reorganize its business structure and still, technically, be a Dividend Aristocrat.It's a tobacco company that only derived revenue from U.S. tobacco products. Then it added a wine division and an e-cigarette division. The latter is seeing massive growth. But even its smokes are seeing an uptick in revenues.Add in a rock-solid 3.6% dividend and you have quite a compelling long-term growth holding. Yes, I said growth. In the past year MO returned 20%; that's far better than most companies that are in typical growth sectors.Home Depot possesses many of the qualities I love to see in a business. It earns a high return on invested capital, generates excellent free cash flow, maintains healthy payout ratios, operates in a slow-changing industry, and has created substantial value for shareholders over time. (  ) had an amazing quarter, especially if you compare it to other consumer-driven business, like the big-box department stores.Comparable sales (sales in stores open for a year or more) were more than management expected, much less analysts. And sales per customer were also higher.Put simply, that means more people were buying more stuff than they were last year. And this was just the first quarter, before the weather moderated and before planting season and yard work geared up.It looks like the trend is in upgrading current properties rather than buying a new house. A slow economy means that people tend to take care of the things they have rather than look to buying new things, particularly major investments.This trend will play in HD's favor for a while. (  ) has been around for 127 years. That makes it one of the oldest health care companies in the world. It also means it has seen a few things over the years and knows how to use its product mix to get the most out of its business.As is typical of companies with long, successful histories, JNJ continues to lead in almost every category in which it does business. From consumer healthcare to medical devices to pharmaceuticals.JNJ is making a push to expand its consumer and medical device businesses in the current economy, which makes perfect sense. Because the Affordable Care Act rewards patient outcomes more than volume of care, good equipment becomes more valuable and desirable.Barron's tends to agree.

Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is one of the popular strategies in this domain. Instead of picking both value and growth stocks like the blend strategy does, GARP looks for stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.Though investors following GARP consider popular metrics of both value and growth investing, the ideal range of these metrics is different from what is considered by value and growth investing. GARP investing employs popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio - to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued or not.In case of P/E ratio, investors following the GARP strategy look for a higher value of the ratio compared to value investors. However, they avoid picking companies with extremely high price-to-earnings ratios. On the other hand, like value investors, GARP investors give precedence to low P/B ratios. A ratio less than the industry average is preferred by GARP investors for choosing undervalued stocks.The other metrics that are borrowed by GARP investors from the growth investing strategy are strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects for the coming years. Unlike growth investors, GARP investors look for stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates. Growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal in GARP strategy.Return on equity (ROE) is another growth metric used in GARP strategy. Here, those stocks that have higher ROE compared to the industry average are considered as strong ROE is an indicator of superior stocks.In order to make GARP strategy more profitable, we have only considered those with a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)\u2022 (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)\u2022 (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)\u2022 (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 8.Here are five stocks from the eight that made it through the screen: (  ) is one of the leading suppliers of application delivery and management software and services.

(Symbol: CTXS) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $82.26/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $65 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.9% return against the $65 commitment, or a 4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTXS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $65 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Citrix Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 21.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $60.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.50 from $65), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $65 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $65 strike for the 4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Citrix Systems, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $82.26) to be 35%.

During the networking technologies provider's most recent quarter, sales rose 25% annually to $56.6 million, beating estimates by $2.1 million.Furthermore, A10 expects sales for the current quarter to rise 22% at the midpoint of its guidance, while analysts expect its revenue to rise 16% for the full year. A10 still isn't profitable, but it has been narrowing its net losses on a non-GAAP basis. Let's take a closer look at A10 and whether its stock will sink or swim in 2016.A10 Networks' ADC. Source: A10 Networks. A10 sells three software-based advanced application networking solutions, all of which are built on its Advanced Core Operating System (ACOS). These three solutions include Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs), which optimize data center performance; Carrier Grade Networking (CGN) products, which provide address and protocol translation services; and Distributed Denial of Service Threat Protection Systems (TPS) for network security.A10's biggest rivals in ADCs are  , which controls over half of the , and  . F5 and Citrix's dominance of the ADC market even forced networking giant  to abandon its ADC business in 2012. But after retreating from that market, Cisco integrated A10's ADCs into its ACI (application centric infrastructure) ecosystem -- which widened A10's moat against F5 and Citrix. Although A10 is smaller than F5 and Citrix, its revenue growth is accelerating at a more impressive rate:\n  \nYOY revenue growth. Source: Company earnings reports.That growth is fueled by A10's ability to keep adding customers. The company added 200 customers last quarter, boosting its total end-customer base to 4,700. A10 attributes that \"record\" growth to a \"broad-based increase in demand across our product portfolio and customer verticals.\"Those victories all boosted A10's enterprise bookings 23% annually during the quarter. Product revenues rose 22% and accounted for 70% of A10's top line, while service revenues rose 33% and accounted for the rest. Looking ahead, the company believes that the enterprise transition to the cloud will boost demand for its three core solutions. Last November, Oppenheimer analysts also expressed confidence that A10's Thunder TPS security solution, which generated 10% of its sales last quarter, will become a new pillar of growth. The two main threats facing A10 are a slowdown in enterprise spending and the likelihood of its larger rivals undercutting its products to gain market share. Both factors could cause A10's margins to decline and its losses to widen. In that regard, A10 hasn't fared well compared to more profitable rivals like F5 Networks and Citrix:Source: Moreover, A10 still has a negative free cash flow. The company's total cash and equivalents rose 7% annually to $98.1 million last quarter, and it hopes to become profitable later this year, but it remains vulnerable to any aggressive pricing and bundling strategies from F5, Citrix, or other more diversified competitors. A10's sales and marketing already rose 10% annually and gobbled up nearly three-fourths of its revenue last quarter, so it could struggle to respond to those threats.Source: Lastly, A10's lack of profitability makes it hard to compare its stock price to its earnings growth potential. The company's P/S ratio of 1.8 compares favorably to F5 and Citrix, which both trade at 3.7 times trailing sales. However, A10's lack of earnings growth could cause the stock to be sold off faster than either rival in a volatile market. A10 might struggle against bigger rivals like F5 and Citrix, but the company's strong sales growth, its partnership with Cisco, and its confidence in turning a profit this year indicate that overall sentiment should be more bullish than bearish.

This is because it lacks the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - that reflects the possibility of a positive earnings surprise. : Earnings ESP for Citrix Systems is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.74. : Although Citrix Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3, the 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We expect the company's first-quarter results to benefit from its strong product portfolio.

SAP HANA Vora promises to bring unprecedented contextual analytics for enormous quantity of data stored in Hadoop, enterprise systems and other distributed data sources.SAP HANA Vora has been engineered to bolster the Apache Spark execution framework to offer highly advanced interactive analytics on Hadoop. Boasting a host of impressive features, which include data correlation, ability for simplified management of Big Data and online analytical processing, SAP HANA Vora can be used to analyze data large volumes of operational and contextual data obtained from enterprise applications, data warehouses and data lakes.In addition, SAP agreed to contribute a portion of the code for SAP HANA Vora to the Apache Spark open source ecosystem, a highly renowned open source community, for improving distributed storage and assisting distributed processing of large data sets.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .The S&P 500 posted its worst-ever five-day start to a year in 2016. China's sluggish economic growth and slump in crude  adversely affected the index. The S&P 500's year-to-date return has fallen 6%. The index's dismal performance came in after it had snapped a multi-year winning streak to end in the red in 2015.The index has now entered \"correction\" territory, with the S&P 500 closing at its lowest level on Wednesday since Sep 29, 2015. Hence, it will be prudent to invest in growth stocks which should get a lift once the index recognizes their full potential. Moreover, the index had already gained momentum on Thursday boosted by a rebound in oil prices.Let's now look into the factors that dented the S&P 500 recently:S&P 500 started 2016 on a disastrous note after weak Chinese economic data stoked fears about global growth prospects. China manufacturing purchasing managers' index declined to 48.2 in December from 48.6 in November, according to Caixin Media Co. The index fell below 50 for the 10th straight month. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing activity. The People's Bank of China responded to this dismal data by injecting short-term funds worth 130 billion yuan ($19.9 billion) into the country's financial system in order to stimulate its ailing economy.However, a second batch of dismal Chinese economic data renewed fresh concerns about decelerating growth in the world's second largest economy, which eventually had a negative impact on the S&P 500. According to Caixin Media Co. and research firm Markit, the Caixin China services purchasing managers' index dropped to 50.2 in December from 51.2 in November. The reading was a hair's breadth from 50 that separates expansion from contraction.Additionally, Beijing's move to allow the yuan to fall further against the dollar last Thursday raised concerns about capital flight and the health of the world's second largest economy.The People's Bank of China's downward adjustment to the yuan resulted in a steep fall in Chinese equities. China's stock markets had halted trading after only 30 minutes on Thursday last week, the shortest trading day in its 25-year history. Trading was stopped after the newly installed circuit breaker system was triggered for the second time by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.The system was activated by sharp moves in an index. While a 5% move resulted in a 15-minute halt to trading, a 7% move resulted in trading being stopped for the rest of the session. China's securities regulator decided to suspend the circuit breaker as the newly installed mechanism was criticized for escalating volatility rather than fixing it.Global oil prices took a beating after bearish economic data from China raised concerns about demand for oil in an already oversupplied market. Rise in crude stockpiles along with jump in gasoline and distillate supplies also had a negative impact on oil prices.The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that crude inventories increased by 200,000 barrels for the week ending Jan 8. Additionally, gasoline supplies increased by 8.4 million barrels and distillate stockpiles rose 6.1 million barrels last week. Separately, fundamental factors including a stronger dollar and concerns that Iran may add its barrels to a glutted  also continued to weigh on oil prices.The S&P 500 remained in \"correction\" mode as oil prices sagged to new lows and hammered energy stocks. The index dropped 2.5% on Wednesday, its biggest one-day percentage drop since September. This loss has taken the S&P 500's decline since last year's high beyond 10%, the commonly accepted definition of correction.Meanwhile, all is not that gloomy since the broader markets made a comeback yesterday, banking on a rebound in oil prices. Oil prices gained after some players covered short positions. The S&P 500 climbed above its key technical level of 1,900 with 11 out of 12 sectors of the S&P 500 ending in the green. Since the long term seems to bode well for stocks after the initial jitters, it will be a wise move to invest in growth stocks.

The software company, in fact, has a healthy track record with respect to earnings, having delivered positive surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 22.29%.Despite the impressive background, an earnings beat is not guaranteed this time around, as suggested by the Zacks model.Here is what our model indicates:The possibility of Citrix Systems beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter is rather low. This is because it lacks the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - that reflects the possibility of a positive earnings surprise. : Earnings ESP for Citrix Systems is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00. : Although Citrix Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3, the 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Citrix Systems is benefiting from its strong product portfolio and the trend is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well. In 2015, the company launched Citrix Workspace Cloud, a new platform designed to simplify the on-demand delivery of a wide range of IT tools and services. We expect an update on its product portfolio on the fourth quarter conference call.The company, while updating on its operations review on Nov 17, 2015, had stated that it intends to spin off its GoTo business to concentrate exclusively on its areas of strength. We expect further update on the issue on the fourth quarter conference call.We are also impressed by the company's focus to reward shareholders through buybacks. In the third quarter, the company bought back 3.9 million shares. We expect an update in this regard as well on the fourth quarter .Meanwhile, Citrix Systems is undergoing multiple changes, which include the recent appointment of a new CEO and restructuring efforts. Such significant changes will tend to affect the performance of the stock in the final quarter of 2015. Moreover, results may well be affected by the ongoing global worries. With so much to look forward to, we expect investors to keenly await Citrix Systems' fourth quarter conference call.Here are some companies for investors to consider in the computer and technology sector that are likely to report higher-than-expected earnings in their upcoming release.With an earnings ESP of +2.21% and a Zacks Rank #2, Harris Corp.  is scheduled to report on Feb 2.ARRIS International plc  , which has an earnings ESP of +4.88% and a Zacks Rank #1, is expected to report on Feb 17.With an earnings ESP of +5.77% and a Zacks Rank # 3, Level 3 Communications, Inc.  is scheduled to report on Feb 4.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Keeping with this, the company recently announced the buyout of Goanna Software. However, the financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.Australian-based Goanna offers static code analysis tools that meet the industry coding standards and compliances which improve the code quality while reducing security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the integration of Goanna will enable Synopsys to enhance its static code analysis solution capabilities.Currently, Synopsys provides static code analysis solutions under the Coverity product suite. The recent acquisition will improve Coverity's analysis capabilities while enhancing security and quality.Furthermore, Synopsys in its press release revealed that \"[it] will leverage Goanna Software's technology to improve the Coverity Software Development Kit (SDK) to enable customers to more easily develop dedicated static analysis rules and checkers for their specific use cases\".Therefore, we believe that Goanna will enable Synopsys to offer a more comprehensive portfolio of software solutions. Moreover, through the acquisition Synopsys will gain the former's customers thereby boosting the top line.The recent acquisition is in line with Synopsys' continued investments toward enhancing the software security product portfolio. To strengthen its presence in the software security market, the company acquired Codenomicon Oy and Elliptic Technologies in June.Moreover, Synopsys has taken over certain assets of Quotium Technologies, including the Quotium Seeker product and the R&D team. We believe that these acquisitions will enhance its presence in this market while expanding the product portfolio and quality of its wholly owned subsidiary, Coverity.Synopsys sells electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships while focusing on cost efficiencies, and many have selected Synopsys as their primary EDA partner.Acquisitions have helped Synopsys to gain access to newer markets and technologies. Also, since intensifying competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate into, acquisitions have boosted the company's revenues. The company recently reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results wherein revenues witnessed a year-over-year increase of 8.9%.We believe that the company's sustained focus on product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will aid results, going ahead. Apart from this, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will drive results. Additionally, the company's acquisitions will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A well-ranked stock in the technology sector is Citrix Systems Inc.  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

He also asserted that \"SunEdison was very aggressive in the way they were bidding for projects. If they're unable to sell those projects, I don't know how much longer the equity can last.\"The stock has been on a downtrend since the second half of 2015 as investors have become increasingly cautious over the company's ability to finance its projects. Last year, the company made a string of buyouts to expand its global operations and become the world's leading renewable energy developer.These acquisitions, once believed to be strategic, are now burning a hole in SunEdison's pocket. The acquisitions have taken a toll on its balance sheet with total outstanding debt (including current portion) nearly doubling to $11.7 billion at the end of third-quarter 2015 from $6.3 billion a year ago.To lower its debt burden, the renewable energy developer last week announced some debt restructuring moves. Though the move according to  will increase SunEdison's net liquidity position by $555 million, it will incur a very high cost.Citing Sven Eenmaa, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp.,  revealed that the new transaction will increase SunEdison's annual interest expenses by about $40 million.

The striking similarity of the fitness band with its more feature-packed smartwatch competitors, disappointed investors resulting in more than 18% plunge in share price.This PurePulse technology has been used in Fitbit's fitness wearables like Surge, Charge HR and Blaze. Last November, the company upgraded Surge and Charge HR, thereby making exercise tracking smarter and easier. It had also updated the PurePulse heart rate technology, claiming that it will offer enhanced heart rate monitoring during and after sessions of intense workouts like boot camp and Zumba.However, the plaintiffs accused Fitbit of wrongly advertising about the accuracy of its heart rate tracking products that fail to count every beat, giving inaccurate and dangerously low beats per minute (BPM) numbers. The court documents describe a case where the user's personal trainer recorded the heart rate at 160 BPM, while the device read only 82 BPM. This could put the user at risk if the heavy exercise was continued due to the under-reported rate.Earlier also, in 2014, Fitbit was sued for its activity tracker named Fitbit Force after consumers complained about skin irritations. The company voluntarily recalled the wristband.Consumers might shy away from purchasing Fitbit's hardware, because of these lawsuits, thereby impacting the top- and bottom-line growth.Though Fitbit enjoys a leading position in the wearable space, the cut-throat competition in both the high- and low-end product ranges cannot be denied. These lawsuits could dent its reputation and waste considerable amount of time and money, in turn hurting the balance sheet.Considering the poor response to its Blaze fitness band, intense competition and the new lawsuit will negatively impact the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Some better-ranked stocks are Autodesk, Inc.  , Blackbaud Inc.  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  .

(Symbol: CTXS) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $75.58/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $55 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 8% return against the $55 commitment, or a 3.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTXS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $55 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Citrix Systems, Inc. sees its shares fall 27.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $50.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.40 from $55), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $55 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $55 strike for the 3.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Citrix Systems, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $75.58) to be 32%.

This analyst action pushed the stock back to the Zacks #1 Rank. And it didn't hurt that the company has delivered an earnings beat for several consecutive quarters, averaging a 22% positive surprise for the last four reports.In fact, CTXS became a Zacks #1 -- for the first time in several quarters -- in early July when it was trading under $69. From there to the climb above $82 in late October, the #1 Rank was reiterated at least twice more as analysts either revised estimates upward and/or the company delivered another beat as they did on October 21. : (  ) is another great example of a stock with strong downward earnings momentum that the Zacks Rank nailed perfectly and warned you to stay away from plenty early.Although NUS had been a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) quite often in the first quarter of 2015 when shares were trading near $60, it didn't become a #5 Rank (Strong Sell) until May after the company's first quarter report disappointed investors.Since then, shares have plummeted from $51 to $31.

Considered as a coveted launch pad for next-generation innovations in the market, CES will offer the much-required publicity for FLIR's latest offerings.The product launches reflect concerted efforts by FLIR to leverage its exclusive Lepton technology to introduce innovative products and grab greater market share in the Instruments segment business. Both of FLIR's new offerings deploy low-cost Lepton microcamera core, which has driven significant popularity for thermal imaging across multiple applications.While FLIR Scout TK is priced at $599, FLIR TG130 has a selling price of $249. Both products are expected to be commercially available from the first quarter of 2016. FLIR Scout TK thermal vision monocular, being the most compact and lightweight camera of the FLIR Scout TK series, is ideal for outdoor activities like camping, fishing or hiking, as it functions even in absolute darkness and rough environmental conditions.On the other hand, the entry-level FLIR TG130 spot thermal cameras that are engineered to bolster the energy efficiency in customer households. They can find use in multiple home and small business applications, including detection of heat loss and locating areas of missing insulation.We believe that a CAGR of 6.6% (as per Markets and Markets report) for 2015-2020 for the thermal imaging market is one of the key factors that drives FLIR to continuously launch new products.

Although the company has not disclosed the amount spent on the facility, it did mention that it is part of the $50 million investment for beefing up its Cyber Security Services business globally.In a press release, Symantec said, \"With the launch of the SOC in Singapore, businesses will have access to intelligence, accurate threat detection and proactive notification of emerging threats to ensure their most sensitive data is protected. The new SOC will also enable businesses to shorten the time between detection and response, reduce operational costs and proactively counter emerging threats.\"With the opening of this facility, the company now operates four SOCs in the Asia-Pacific region. The other three are located in Chennai, India; Tokyo, Japan; and Sydney, Australia.The $50 million investment plan will enable Symantec to further expand its SOC's capabilities in Chennai and Tokyo. Moreover, the company plans to unveil an SOC in Europe and more such facilities over the next 12 months. Once the projects are completed, the company will be operating eight SOCs worldwide.Cyber security has become a growing threat for organizations of all sizes. Potential cyber attacks led Symantec to unveil an advanced threat protection method, thereby delivering a complete attack prevention solution. The company offers a solid portfolio of cyber-security products including Managed Security Services, DeepSight Intelligence, Incident Response and Security Simulation training.We believe that opening new SOCs and enhancing capabilities of the existing ones will help Symantec to serve clients better.Although investments to enhance cyber security capabilities are encouraging, persistent weakness in PC sales is hurting the company's core Norton Anti-virus software business.

Its products include XenApp, which runs the business logic of applications on a central server, and XenServer, an enterprise-class platform for managing server virtualization in the datacenter as a pool of computing and storage resources.Their Citrix Workspace Cloud delivers secure access to apps, desktops, data and services from any device, over any network and cloud.And Citrix is also well known as the provider of GoTo Meeting services and applications. In a November announcement about the company's strategic restructuring, management revealed that they plan to spin-off the GoTo suite.Here were the headline updates from November 17...Increasing focus on core enterprise strategy of secure and reliable app and data deliveryProviding FY16 GAAP diluted EPS outlook of $2.64 - $2.82; non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook of $4.40 - $4.50Targeting 17 percent GAAP operating margin for 2016; at least 28 percent non-GAAP operating margin for 2016; targeting at least 30 percent non-GAAP operating margin for 2017Announces plans to spin off GoTo businesses into separate companyIn response to this update, analysts raised estimates yet again for this year and next. This analyst action pushed the stock back to the Zacks #1 Rank. And it didn't hurt that the company has delivered an earnings beat for several consecutive quarters, averaging a 22% positive surprise for the last four reports.In fact, CTXS became a Zacks #1 -- for the first time in several quarters -- in early July when it was trading under $69. From there to the climb above $82 in late October, the #1 Rank was reiterated at least twice more as analysts either revised estimates upward and/or the company delivered another beat as they did on October 21.Citrix operates in four reportable segments as follows:\u2022License Updates and Maintenance (45.1% of the total revenue in 2014): This segment consists of fees related to Citrix's Subscription Advantage program that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically 12 to 24 months. Subscription Advantage is an annual-renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of unspecified software upgrades, enhancements and maintenance releases if they become available during the term of the subscription.\u2022Product and Licenses (28.6%): This segment primarily consists of fees related to the licensing of Citrix's major products including Desktop Solutions products, Datacenter and Cloud products.\u2022Software as a Service (20.7%): This segment consists primarily of fees related to online service agreements, which are recognized ratably over the contract term.\u2022Professional Services (5.6%): This segment includes fees from technical support services, which are recognized ratably over the contract term as well as fees from product training and certification and consulting services.You may be surprised to know that the company was started in 1989 as a software company. Here's their description of technology landscape that has inspired them to continually adapt and innovate...While CTXS shares are widely owned by many large institutional investors, one smaller hedge fund has been accumulating shares rapidly of late. In the third quarter of this year, the $5 billion Elliot Associates bought nearly 4.4 million shares (mostly in July) to bring their haul to 5.87 million as of September 30.And they were found adding to that stake in November based on a November 30 SEC 13D filing, after the company's strategic update. It seems they are on board for the changes to come.While this hedge fund was quietly accumulating their first big stake in July, the Zacks Rank told you why as the earnings outlook improved. Most institutional fund managers have an outlook for their investments that spans beyond a quarter or two, but we may not know when Elliot sells.Thus, your main guide about the direction of CTXS shares should remain the earnings momentum as indicated by the Zacks Rank.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Also, the company stated that it will likely lead to growth of 24% in annualized recurring revenues during the period.The company is primarily banking on cloud transition to fuel this growth, which is further supplemented by increasing demand for licenses, a large active customer base of 2.8 million (including non-subscribers as well) and scope for conversion of non-subscribers to subscribers. For this, the company will also be offering its subscription services packages for a smaller timeframe (at present it only offers perpetual licenses, which are expensive for short-term users).Moreover, in the last reported quarter, Autodesk finally achieved breakeven earnings and also raised its earnings guidance for fourth quarter 2015, despite an expected softness in billings. In the three-month period, the company has returned over 39% compared with the S&P 500's gain of only 6.2% in the same period. Morever, in the past 30 days, upward estimate revisions have pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 by over 133% to 14 cents a share.Nonetheless, ongoing investments in cloud-based infrastructure and discontinuation of perpetual license offerings in 2016 can prove to be dampener in the near term.Autodesk sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

In fact, in these reports, CTXS has beaten estimates by at least 30% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Two quarters ago, CTXS expected to earn 63 cents per share, while it actually produced earnings of 87 cents per share, a beat of 38%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 67 cents per share, when it actually saw earnings of 87 cents per share instead, representing a 29.9% positive surprise.Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Citrix Systems. In fact, the  for CTXS is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This is the case for CTXS, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.00%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that CTXS has a great Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile.

Recall that when Citrix announced  last month, management promised this update was on the way, specifically to keep investors in the loop regarding progress in its ongoing transformation intended to reposition the business for sustained long-term growth.Specifically, Citrix says as a result of its operations review, it determined \"a spinoff of the GoTo family of products into a separate public company is in the best interest of all stakeholders, allowing both companies to enhance its strategic focus and respective competitive positions, while permitting Citrix to improve operational efficiency.\" In a separate press release, Citrix noted the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016 as a tax-free spinoff to Citrix shareholders. The new company will be made up of GoToAssist, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, GoToTraining, GoToWebinar, Grasshopper, and OpenVoice. Collectively these products totaled unaudited revenue of $600 million in the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2015.Consequentially, Citrix announced plans to \"increase emphasis and resources\" to its core enterprise products including XenApp, XenDesktop, XenMobile, ShareFile, and NetScaler. To achieve that focus, Citrix will stop investing in \"certain other products and programs, in some cases moving technologies into strategic products, in other cases providing an orderly end-of-life to non-core products.\"\"This separation will create a leading, pure-play [software-as-a-service] company that will have a targeted focus with the flexibility to invest in its portfolio of products,\" elaborated interim Citrix CEO Bob Calderoni. \"It will also allow Citrix to refocus and amplify investment in our core mission to enable secure and reliable delivery of apps and data for the modern enterprise.\"Finally, Citrix will restructure to eliminate roughly 1,000 full-time and contract employees, excluding the GoTo spinoff, with the majority being eliminated this month and in January. Collectively, Citrix expects those actions to result in roughly $200 million in annualized pre-tax cost savings, with roughly $150 million anticipated to be realized next fiscal year. That said, Citrix also anticipates incurring pre-tax charges of $65 million to $85 million related to employee severance agreements between the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and into fiscal 2016.In addition, Citrix offered its initial outlook for the full fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016, calling for net revenue growth of 1% to 2%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.40 to $4.50. Analysts, on average, were anticipating higher revenue growth of 4.7%, but slightly lower adjusted earnings of $4.21 per share.Finally, Citrix also outlined targets for the full fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2017, calling for revenue growth of 4% to 5%.In the end -- the unfortunate layoffs notwithstanding -- there's no denying this is an ambitious effort to drive higher profits, achieve sustainable growth and, ultimately, maximize shareholder value. But given the uncertainty, cost, and amount of work these actions will take to fully implement -- from the employee severance, spinning off a promising line of products in GoTo, and narrowing Citrix's focus to a small number of core remaining products -- it's hard to blame investors for taking a step back as they process today's news. For now, that's why I'm also content watching Citrix's progress from the sidelines until the dust settles.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Also, the company's top as well as bottom line managed to outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter of 2015. This marked the tenth consecutive quarter of earnings beat for Citrix.Meanwhile, Citrix is focusing on three broad markets: Desktop virtualization, Cloud Infrastructure and networking, and Collaboration and sharing. As desktop virtualization has become the top priority for any IT set-up, Citrix is continuously introducing innovative products that will facilitate business flexibility, security and centralized management system.We believe that the global trend toward virtualization and cloud computing will help Citrix retain its momentum. Moreover, the company's products like XenMobile and XenApps are gaining significant market traction in the highly lucrative enterprise mobility segment and Windows app virtualization.In addition, the company's launch of the innovative app - ShareConnect - will not only provide unique desktop-like facilities to iPads and Android-based tablets but will also boost demand.Such a strong product portfolio coupled with increased demand for virtualization and cloud computing has encouraged Citrix to raise the earnings and revenue projections for 2015. The company estimates 2015 revenues in the band of $3.24 billion to $3.25 billion (previous outlook: $3.22 billion to $3.25 billion). Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are now projected in the band of $3.85 to $3.90 (previous outlook: $3.65 to $3.75).Citrix currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In the last reported quarter, Adobe recorded a positive earnings surprise of 11.43%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Adobe is being driven by continuous innovation in its Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud businesses.The Creative business in its Digital Media Solutions segment is seeing acceleration in Creative Cloud subscriptions. Also, the conversion of enterprise customers to Enterprise Term License Agreements or ETLAs is leading to increased adoption of its enterprise Creative Cloud offering.Increased subscription, ETLA adoption and digital publishing suite adoption will help drive Creative annualized recurring revenues.We remain positive about Adobe's market position, its compelling product lines (including CS cloud initiative and digital media products), continued innovation and strong balance sheet. In addition, we believe that the consistent adoption of the Adobe marketing cloud could serve as a potential catalyst in the to-be reported quarter.Adobe posted decent third quarter results with earnings exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. Revenues were down 5.9% sequentially but up 1% year over year. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales in its digital media business, which includes the Creative Cloud software suite.For the fourth quarter of 2015, Adobe expects revenues in the range of $1.025 to $1.075 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to be $1.306 billion. Based on a share count of 508-510 million, GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 5-11 cents per share, while non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 26-32 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Adobe will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. : Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 45 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. : Adobe carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.  , with Earnings ESP of +2.44% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)Citrix Systems, Inc.  , with Earnings ESP of +1.00% and a Zacks Rank #1Intel Corporation  , with Earnings ESP of +1.59% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

They're the big movers in the technology space, belonging to the category of fundamentally sound stocks with healthy financials. However, other than these giants, there are many companies that have shown great potential for excellence and have been impressive in terms of growth and performance.As many as 38 companies from the technology world are part of the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index, which turns ten in February 2016. The top five performers of Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index are companies with market capitalization ranging from $13 billion to a whopping $500 billion! Out of these five stocks, we're taking a look at NVIDIA, Cognizant Technology Solutions, and Citrix Systems, leaving out the well-known Alphabet and Facebook, which rank second and third on the list with 35.40% and 30.70% returns year-to-date.While NVIDIA and Citrix have a market capitalization hovering around $15 billion, Cognizant has a market capitalization of about $41 billion. These stocks have delivered strong returns during 2015 so far. Let\u2019s get to know them better.The shares of NVIDIA Corporation () are up 41.50% year-to-date and by 45.19% over the last one-year period. On year-to-date basis, NVIDIA is the top performing constituent of Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index, gaining more than bigger players like Google, Facebook, and Apple. While the stock has rallied spectacularly in the recent past, it\u2019s still below its record high of about $36, hit in the beginning of 2007. NVIDIA has a market capitalization of $15.29 billion.NVIDIA Corporation was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company was listed with Nasdaq in 1999, and its product range covers the entire range of visual computing and operates across three major vertical markets: gaming; professional visualization; and high performance computing and data centers. As NVIDIA says, \u201cat the core of our company is the GPU \u2014 the engine of modern visual computing \u2014 which we invented in 1999.\u201d The company has approximately 7,300 patent assets and a workforce of 9,100 employees worldwide.The company has sound financials with its revenue and net income steadily rising over the years. NVIDIA reported $4.68 billion in revenue in FY15, an increase of 13.35% over the previous fiscal. The company\u2019s net income in FY15 was at $630.58 million, an increase of 43.32% over the figure reported in FY14. The earnings during the first and second quarter of FY16 have been mixed with its net income declining by 81% sequentially and 80% year-over-year during the Q2 FY16.This was mainly led by the company\u2019s decision to wind down its Icera modem operations, after NIVIDIA could not find a viable buyer. This increased its non-recurring operating expenses to around $90 million. The company is set to announce its third quarter results soon (it\u2019s expecting revenue of $1.18 billion as per guidance). The results and earnings guidance would be directing the stock\u2019s performance in near-term. Overall, the company has a sound business model which is diversified, innovative and backed by strong sales. Given the soundness of NVIDIA, there is potential for its stock to rise further, although, given its steep climb, it should take a breather sometime soon, which can be a good time for investors to join in.The shares of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation () are up by 29.34% year-to-date in 2015 and by 41.95% over the last one-year. Cognizant is a leading information technology, consulting and business process services provider and is ranked among the top performing and fastest growing companies in the world. The company is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, and has a market capitalization of $41 billion.Cognizant has a sound financial base with its revenue and net income rising steadily over the years. The company\u2019s revenue was up 16.05% to $10.26 billion during fiscal 2014 compared to the previous fiscal while its net income increased by 17.15% to $1.44 billion during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. During the current fiscal, FY15, the company has seen sound number being reported during the first and the second quarter.During the second quarter 2015, Cognizant\u2019s revenue was $3.09 billion, up by 6% sequentially and by 22.6% compared to the same period a year ago. The net income was reported at $420.1 million in Q2 FY15 as compared to $382.9 billion during Q1 FY15 and $371.9 million in Q2 FY14. A recent press release quoted Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer of Cognizant, who said, \"Our second quarter sequential revenue increase in dollar terms was the strongest in our history.\u201dAccording to the guidance provided by Cognizant during the Q2 FY15 earnings release, the Q3 FY15 revenue is expected to be at least $3.14 billion with a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.75 while the full year revenue is expected to be at least $12.33 billion, up at least 20.1% compared to 2014 with a non-GAAP diluted EPS of at least $3.00. The company is set to announce its Q3 FY15 earnings on November 4, 2015.The shares of Citrix Systems, Inc. () have risen 28.68% year-to-date in 2015 and by 27.82% over the last one-year. With a market capitalization of $13.19 billion, Citrix is one of the smaller companies with big returns on the index. Citrix focuses on software solutions, with an emphasis on uniting virtualization, mobility management, networking and software solutions to enable new ways for businesses and people to work better. The solutions by Citrix help business mobility by providing secure, mobile workspaces with instant access to apps, desktops, data and communications on any device, over any network and cloud.Founded in 1989, Citrix reported revenue of $3.14 billion during FY14, an increase of 7.68% over the previous fiscal\u2019s revenue. However, there was a dip of 25% in its net income in FY14 compared to the previous fiscal. During the current year, the numbers reported by Citrix have shown a steady growth. During the recently announced third quarter results for fiscal year 2015, Citrix\u2019s revenue was $813 million, an increase of 7% compared to the same quarter previous year while its net income was up 16.67% to touch $56 million during Q3 FY15. Its cash flows from operations increased 58.54% during Q3 FY15 to touch $260 million.According to Mark Templeton, president and CEO for Citrix, \"Our results are starting to reflect the benefits of the actions we have taken since the start of the year to improve our operating margin and drive integrations among our strategic products.\u201d Citrix increased its outlook for fiscal 2015 and now targets revenue in the range of $3.24 billion to $3.25 billion with an earnings-per-share in the range of $1.83 to $2.05.

The top line was supported by a 15.4% rise in the company's software-as-a-service business segment, which recorded sales of $190.1 million. Through the first nine months of this year, software as a service has proved itself the company's fastest-growing revenue stream, offsetting revenue declines in the product and licenses and professional services segments.The company also posted appreciable improvements in profit and earnings per share. Citrix finished the quarter with $55.9 million in net income, outpacing the comparable quarter by 17.7%. Similarly, diluted earnings per share expanded by nearly 21%, to $0.35.Adjusting for one-time events, operating results showed even more strength. Citrix recently announced its intention to explore strategic alternatives for its ByteMobile and GoTo businesses. During the quarter, the company took non-cash impairment charges against intangible assets in the ByteMobile business of $64.5 million. Removing this charge, the quarter's operating margin of nearly 8% (equal to Q3 2014's margin) nearly doubles to 15.8%.The operating gains stem from management's ambition to control costs, a theme it's emphasized to analysts over the last few quarters. During the quarter, Citrix decreased operating costs as a percentage of revenue dollars in each of the three major expense categories on its income statement (research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses). Alongside the earnings release, longtime CEO Mark Templeton announced his retirement. Executive Chairman of the Board Robert Calderoni has been named Interim President and CEO. The executive transition won't change Citrix's focus on its next generation of software, including products like ShareFile, the company's secure data platform, which saw product subscription growth of nearly 40% last quarter.Investors have reason to be enthusiastic about the increased clarity in Citrix's business model. Exploring alternatives for products on the wane, while cutting costs and pouring resources into promising cloud-based offerings, should continue to boost earnings per share over the long term.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include the  (  ),  (  ),  ,  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .After logging a record performance in October, stocks have continued to rise higher. Markets gained significantly on Monday and stuck to their winning ways on Tuesday.Yesterday's highlight was the remarkable performance of the Nasdaq 100. The index gained 0.3% yesterday to reach 4,719.05, breaching the previous high set during the dotcom bubble in 2000. The technology-heavy index had set a record closing high of 4,704.73 on Mar 27, 2000.There are clear indications that markets may continue to move upward for the rest of the month. In this situation, betting on stocks which have made impressive price gains recently and have significant momentum may be a prudent move.Firstly, the index, which comprises the largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq Composite, has been lifted by broader market optimism. Construction spending increased 0.3% in September while the final Markit manufacturing PMI increased to 54.1, its highest level in six months.Apart from positive economic indicators, familiar fears about the economic situation in China have eased following last month's rate cut. Dovish signals from the European Central Bank have also boosted investor sentiment.While healthcare is on a rebound, it is the tech sector which has lifted the broader markets recently. This trend is likely to continue going forward, unless a December rate hike is announced. Even this is unlikely to faze investors, who may have already priced in such a situation.There are some fears that the Nasdaq 100 may slide lower, given that it has exceeded its dotcom bubble levels. Though valuations are high, they are not even close to those witnessed at the time of the millennial crash. Additionally, yesterday's intraday high of 4,735.31 was well short of the record intraday high of 4,816.35 attained on Mar 24, 2000.This is why it may be a good idea to latch onto the index's strong momentum and invest in some of its best performing stocks.

In some cases that stereotypical image would be true, but there are companies where the reality is very different.If I told you that there was a tech company that has been around for 20 years, shows rapid growth in a fast-growing field, is expected to grow at around 15 percent a year for the next five years, has nearly the same amount of cash as debt on its books and yet trades at only a couple of points above the average forward P/E for the S&P 500 I think you would be interested. That stock is Citrix ().The company is best known for it \u201cGoTo\u201d suite, such as Gotomeeting, a virtual conference room that has emerged as a major competitor to WebEx, which was bought by Cisco () in 2007 for $3.2 billion. That is an extremely competitive market, however, and one in which margins are getting squeezed, which is why the activist investor Elliott Management made investigating a spinoff of that division a condition of the deal that staved off a proxy challenge a few months ago.The results of that internal review and investigation are due the middle of this month, but given the circumstances of its formation it is hard to see how the committee cannot recommend the divestiture. One of the problems that a company has that has been pursuing growth for decades is that the focus can become blurry. Divesting a well-known brand to concentrate on core business makes a lot of sense when that happens. The market seems to see that as a big positive in this case, so buying now before the stock runs up in anticipation of or in reaction to that announcement makes sense.To some extent that looks to have begun already with an exaggerated reaction to the earnings beat announced a couple of weeks ago. Don\u2019t get me wrong, EPS of $0.87 versus consensus estimates of $0.67 is nothing to be sneezed at, but the positive reaction really got going during the subsequent call when management announced that the results of the investigation would be released this month. There is, however, still plenty of upside left if analysts are to be believed. Credit Suisse, for example, just increased their price target to $100 in the belief that the split is imminent.Shrinking to grow often strikes me as a strange tactic, but in this case it makes perfect sense. It will free up more cash for Citrix to resume growth in their core software and enterprise businesses, whether that comes organically or through acquisition. GoTo could also benefit in their intensely competitive field from being smaller and more nimble, although that remains to be seen.In order to buy CTXS at these levels, however, you don\u2019t even have to believe that divestiture of their best known business is a positive move by Citrix. You simply have to believe that a lot of others will feel that way, and that looks likely enough to make this a risk worth taking.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["op Tech StocksMSFT +0.98%AAPL +2.56%IBM +1.00%CSCO +0.22%GOOG +0.75%Technology stocks were mostly higher this afternoon, helped along by a 2.5% rise for Apple (  ) after the tech giant was added to Goldman's Sachs Conviction List.

I simply looked at the stock market: \"It's getting hot in here!\"Following August's market rout and the slump in September, stocks staged a dramatic comeback in October turning the heat up.In fact, it was the \"hottest\" month in four years.Why?Because the U.S. stock indexes posted the highest monthly gain since 2011.Let's look at the major indexes for October-\n  \nWhat propelled the stocks? In our view, 3 things:Aided by strong earnings reports and continued consolidation in the semiconductor industry, the technology sector witnessed excellent returns during the period.Here is a list of 4 tech stocks that had a stellar October.We expect this trend to continue in the near term since all these stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank as well as an attractive Growth and Momentum Style score.Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from the company's financial statements to achieve a true sense of quality and sustainability of its growth. Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.October Return: 34.24%Zacks Rank #2Growth Style Score: BMomentum Style Score: AKLA-Tencor's first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of 71 cents a share, topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents by 26.8%. Apart from this, what drove the shares higher was its decision to merge with semiconductor equipment maker, Lam Research Corp.  .The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first 12 months following the closure. The companies expect to realize $250 million in annual ongoing pre-tax cost synergies within the next one-and-a-half to two years and $600 million by 2020.The merger of these two companies will create an equipment powerhouse with a massive range of products, customer base and scale. The increased integration and efficiency of operations could also help the combined entity drive further extension of Moore's Law.October Return: 22.40%Zacks Rank #2Growth Style Score: AMomentum Style Score: AAmazon's stock was driven mainly by robust quarterly results. The company's adjusted EPS came in at 17 cents, much better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 10 cents. Revenues of $25.4 billion beat the consensus estimate of $24.851 billion and increased 23% year over year from $20.6 billion.In the recently reported quarter, AWS was the biggest positive. Its revenue share was steady, while operating profit margin expanded 1,660 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter, operating profit dollars skyrocketed 431.6% (511% ex-FX). Accounting for just 8% of revenues, AWS comprised more than 52% of profit.October Return: 33.50%Zacks Rank #2Growth Style Score: BMomentum Style Score: BFirst Solar reported adjusted third-quarter 2015 earnings of $3.38 a share sweeping past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55 by 118.1%.First Solar is steadily expanding its global footprint. The company primarily caters to the North American market but is also keen on securing a larger market share. Like the other solar majors, such as Canadian Solar and SunPower, the company is looking to expand its operations in the Middle East, India, Japan, Australia and South America. Expansion into other geographies would lead to both top-line and margin growth.First Solar is able to develop economically sustainable businesses as it has established its expertise in PV generation solutions as well as in other areas of the solar-value chain, such as project development, EPC capabilities and O&M services. It continues to focus on retaining its competitive edge and aims to further consolidate its position in the market. The company's R&D investments are also proving beneficial.October Return: 18.50%Zacks Rank #2Growth Style Score: AMomentum Style Score: ACitrix Systems beat third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates and issued a bullish view.The cloud-computing company's earnings (excluding special items) came in at 87 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20 cents and up 53% from the year-ago quarter. Higher-than-expected revenues contributed to the earnings beat.Citrix expects revenues in the range of $3.24 billion to $3.25 billion for 2015. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the range of $3.85 to $3.90. These projections are much higher than the 2015 Zacks Consensus Estimates of $2.97 per share in earnings on revenues of $3.23 billion.We believe that 2015 is playing out just as it should - easy profits from this 6-year bull market have already been earned and valuations are near fully engorged. Gladly, there is not much fear of a bear market, either.When you add it all up, it says the bull market is still on, only the pace is slowing down to around 5% per year.I agree that doesn't sound quite attractive. But compared with the subdued returns for cash, bonds and precious metals, it is a pretty fair deal.Though early in a bull market there are many hidden gems that can generate substantial returns, it has been six years and nearly every stone has been turned.So don't go looking for a needle in a haystack... it ain't there! Instead look where the sun is shining to make your hay!Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares of  were up 11% as of 12:40 p.m. Thursday after the software virtualization company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. Quarterly revenue rose 7% year over year to $813 million, including a 7% increase in product and license revenue, 15% growth from software-as-a-service revenue, an increase of 6% from license updates and maintenance, and a 13% decline in professional services revenue.On the bottom line, that translated to a 16% increase in net income to $56 million, and a 20.7% increase in net income per share to $0.35. On an adjusted basis -- which means excluding things like stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, and impairment charges related to acquisitions -- net income rose 34.4% to $168 million, or $1.04 per diluted share.Analysts, on average, were only expecting adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share on revenue of $786 million.\"Our results are starting to reflect the benefits of the actions we have taken since the start of the year to improve our operating margin and drive integrations among our strategic products,\" explained current Citrix CEO Mark Templeton. \"I am extremely proud of the dedication and work of the Citrix team.\"Following the earnings release, Citrix also announced Robert Calderoni, the company's executive chairman of the board, has been appointed interim president and CEO. Recall in July, Citrix announced Templeton had informed the board of his plans to retire after 20 years with the company. Templeton will continue to serve in an advisory capacity through the end of 2015. For the full-year 2015, Citrix now expects revenue in the range of $3.24 billion to $3.25 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.83 to $2.05, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.90. Analysts' consensus estimates were modeling lower 2015 revenue of $3.23 billion, and adjusted earnings of just $3.71 per share.Finally, Citrix promised that in mid-November, it will both discuss the results of ongoing operational and strategic reviews, and provide an initial business outlook for fiscal 2016.Until then, today's report marks an encouraging step in the right direction for Citrix's  , which is intended to reposition the business for sustained long-term growth. If its outlook next month for 2016 is equally encouraging, and as long as Citrix continues to show progress implementing its strategic goals, I expect Citrix Systems stock will also continue to reward patient investors going forward.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Not only are there a wide range of choices, but the space can be extremely volatile and fraught with risk as well. But thanks to our new  we have been able to identify a few growth stocks which have incredible potential in the near term.One such company that stands out in this regard is undoubtedly  . Not only does this company have a favorable growth score, but it is ranked as a buy too. And while there are numerous reasons why CTXS is so attractive right now, we have highlighted three of the most important-and pertinent to growth investors-below:Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, earnings growth in the double digits is definitely necessary and it is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) ahead for the company in question.While CTXS has put up a historical EPS growth rate of 10.5%, investors should really focus on the projected growth. Here, CTXS is looking to grow at a rate of 11.8%, thoroughly crushing the industry average which calls for EPS growth of just 6.1% in comparison.Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but especially so for growth oriented companies. A positive figure here indicates that cash is flowing into the business (obviously a good thing), while a negative reading here means that net cash is exiting the company.Right now, CTXS' current cash flow growth is an impressive 14.6%, a level that is far higher than many of its peers, and the industry average. In fact, the industry average sees cash flow growth of negative 2.3% in comparison, suggesting that CTXS is a better pick from a cash flow look.If the metrics outlined above weren't enough investors should also consider the positive trends that we are seeing on the analyst estimate revision front. Analysts have been raising their estimates for Citrix Systems lately, and now the earnings picture is looking a bit more favorable for the company.Over the past 7 days the consensus estimate for the full year has surged from $2.97 per share to $3.16 per share today.For the reasons outlined above, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that Citrix Systems has earned itself a growth score of 'B' as well as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This means that we believe Citrix Systems stock is a potential outperformer that is an impressive choice for growth investors, making it a security that you need to keep on your radar in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Ltd. The value of the deal stands at a minimum of $626 million. However, the company said the final price of the deal will be determined by an independent third party.In 2010, NQ Mobile had taken over 33% shares of FL Mobile. Later in 2012, the company assumed full control of FL Mobile. FL Mobile operates as an online game publishing unit of NQ Mobile. In the recent quarters, FL Mobile has in fact, driven the company's revenues higher.In a second development, the company has announced its decision to sell Beijing NationSky Network Technology Co. to Hou Shuli - the founder and Chief Executive of NationSky. The value of the deal is pegged at $80 million. Both the deals will provide the company the required cash and credibility.So, is the rough patch for NQ Mobile now over? Ever since Muddy Water Research, an independent research group, published a report on NQ Mobile on Oct 24, 2013, the company's shares have declined more than 80%. Muddy Waters had blamed NQ Mobile of being a \"massive fraud\" revealing that at least 72% of the company's 2012 China security revenues fictitiously come from a shell company called Yidatong, which is actually owned by NQ Mobile itself.Moreover, NQ Mobile's Antivirus 7.0 was termed a spyware by the  firm. Additionally, Muddy Waters had accused the company of flaunting an inflated cash balance just to gain the confidence of investors. Following this report, NQ Mobile had almost faced a share trading blackout and had even threatened to sue Muddy Waters.The company's positive run on the stock market yesterday can also be attributed to its second quarter 2015 results. NQ Mobile reported a 25% increase reported in revenues of $102.1 million in the quarter. The company posted net loss of $1.6 million or a loss of 2 cents per ADS in comparison to net loss of $16.8 million or a loss of 22 cents per ADS in the year-ago quarter.For 2015, the company expects net revenue to increase in the range of 36.9% to 38.4%. For the third quarter of 2015, the company estimates net revenue between $110.0 million and $112.0 million, indicating a 35.5% to 37.9% increase from the third quarter of 2014.Well-placed stocks in the same sector include Aspen Technology, Inc.  , Citrix Systems, Inc.  and Cadence Design Systems Inc.  .

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe the global trend toward virtualization and cloud computing will help Citrix retain its momentum in the upcoming quarter as well. Moreover, its products XenMobile and XenApps are gaining significant market traction in the highly lucrative enterprise mobility segment and Windows app virtualization space.New product launches are significantly boosting Citrix's top line. Earlier in the year, the company launched Citrix Workspace Cloud, a new platform designed to simplify the on-demand delivery of a wide range of IT tools and services. We expect an update on its product portfolio at the third quarter conference call. For the third quarter of 2015, the company anticipates revenues in the band of $780 million to $790 million while earnings (on an adjusted basis) are expected in the 83-85 cents range.We are also impressed by the company's focus to reward shareholders through buybacks. During the third quarter, the company authorized an additional $500 million share buyback plan.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Citrix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. : Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Thus, the ESP for the company is currently 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents. : Citrix carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction inconclusive.Note that Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Here are some other companies for investors to consider, that according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CenturyLink, Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +6.15% and a Zacks Rank #1.Level 3 Communications Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +2.17% and a Zacks Rank #3.Qualys, Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +6.15% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The electronic devices direct traffic to corporate computer servers and data centers, helping to make websites and communication networks faster and more efficient.F5 has in recent years expanded its ties with customers by also selling them security products and services, and continues to do so under Rivelo. Demand in this arena is mounting amid a torrent of headlines about major organizations suffering cyberattacks that resulted in costly data breaches. In recent months alone, cybercriminals have infiltrated systems at Harvard University, health insurerAnthem (WLP), and the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management.F5 competes withCitrix Systems (  ),Brocade Communications Systems (  ) andA10 Networks (  ). The company is part of IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, which also includesRackspace Hosting (RAX),Akamai Technologies (AKAM) andEquinix (EQIX).\"It's just going to keep growing and growing,\" U.S. Global Investors trader Mike Matousek told IBD, referring to demand for data security.He said investors are increasingly interested in companies such as F5 because they are continuously hearing that organizations fear the worst when it comes to cybersecurity and view as vital their ongoing investments in the latest technology to thwart breaches.\"So there's more opportunity here,\" Matousek said. \"There's a lot of potential ahead.\"F5's stock is up about 14% over the past year. The company in July posted fiscal third-quarter revenue of $483.6 million, up 10% from a year earlier, and GAAP net income of $93.2 million, up 8.7%. On a per-share non-GAAP basis, earnings rose 5% to $1.67.The sales trajectory is expected to continue. For the quarter ending Sept. 30, F5 set a revenue goal of $500 million to $510 million.A company executive told IBD that F5 does not break out the percentage of its product revenue generated by its security business. But during the company's  in July, F5 executives said software sales, which are often linked with security services, have more than doubled over the past three years and now make up about a third of revenue. Customers, the company said, are moving more of their systems into the cloud, via software, and need accompanying security protections.Rivelo, a former Cisco Systems executive, officially took the helm at F5 on July 1. But he began leading the company after his promotion, from executive vice president of strategic solutions to CEO, was announced last spring. He replaced John McAdam, who had been F5 Networks' chief executive for about 15 years.Rivelo was not available to comment for this article, but during the  he said F5's security business will remain \"a major growth driver\" for the company.Given the spate of highly publicized cyberattacks, he added, \"more customers from an increasing diverse pool are approaching F5 for our ability to secure applications, manage user policy and access, and mitigate application attacks across traditional data centers, and public and private clouds.\"Rivelo said in F5's third quarter alone it established major new business relationships on the security front with a branch of the U.S. government and \"a prestigious medical research group,\" among others.CFO Andy Reinland told investors recently that security \"continues to be key for us. And we're going to continue to incentivize the sales force to really push that.\" This week F5 named John DiLullo to lead global sales, reporting to Rivelo.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management and an observer of companies affected by cyberattacks including banks, said in an interview that \"it is hard to see where the threat ends.\"He said regulators of various industries and leaders of major governments around the world are increasingly paying attention to cybersecurity and likely will over time join forces to create stronger global security standards. This, he said, should make it easier for companies and governments to work together to combat cybercriminals.Should all of that materialize in coming years, Paulsen said, it could help more companies get beyond playing catch-up on the security front and instead make investments to continuously stay ahead of criminals. This, he said, could ultimately minimize the number of high-profile breaches. But it would not diminish the need for high-level security services.\"It's never going to go away,\" he said of the threat of attacks. \"They aren't going to just shut this down, but the good guys are going to get better and better at this.\"Toward that end, F5 said it is on the lookout for acquisitions that can fortify its suite of products and help drive more growth.\"We look for a nice technology tuck-in that we can bring in, integrate the code into the platform, and then offer it as part of a platform solution,\" Rivelo said at an August conference. \"We do aggressively look at companies ... We look at them every week.\"He said sellers' pricing expectations are currently a bit lofty. \"In general, right now it's a little heated,\" Rivelo said of the M&A market. But if F5 finds an appealing and affordable target, \"we'll bring it on board to accelerate our roadmap and our vision.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" , a leading supplier of communications equipment and services, recently landed a deal worth $21 million from a Latin American nation for the delivery of its popular wideband Falcon III tactical radio systems.These RF-7800H wideband tactical radios will help upgrade military communication systems by means of offering high long distance network speeds. Moreover, the radios will help the department share voice messages, images and other extended data files over long distances within lesser time.A few days back, Harris received orders worth $13 million from Air National Guard (ANG) to deliver vehicular tactical and public safety radio systems. Earlier this month, Harris struck a $228 million IDIQ deal with the Space and Naval Warfare (SPAWAR) Systems Center Pacific in San Diego, CA, to assist the U.S. Navy's maritime mine countermeasures (MCM) endeavors. The five-year contract incorporated a three-year base and two one-year options. In the ongoing first quarter, the company has already won contracts worth over $400 million.Meanwhile, Harris reported fourth-quarter 2015 financial results wherein both the top and the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate mainly buoyed by synergies from the Exelis integration. The segment generated orders worth $402 million from the Tactical Radio Communications business and $128 million from the Public Safety and Professional Communications business in the quarter. Total order backlog at the Tactical Radio Communications segment and the Public Safety and Professional Communications segment stood at $488 million and $514 million, respectively.Thus, we believe that such strong order backlog coupled with continuous contract wins will certainly boost the company's top line.Harris currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other favorably ranked stocks in this sector are Leidos Holdings, Inc.  , Citrix Systems, Inc.  and Calix Inc.  .

Despite some overlap in their respective product portfolios, Good appears to be a nice strategic fit for BlackBerry's software business, as it will help improve BlackBerry's cross-platform EMM support and bring in a relatively large and diverse customer base, while also helping to drive incremental revenue growth. Additionally, the deal, whichwill be the largest acquisition in BlackBerry's corporate history, indicates that the management remains resolute about its software-focused turnaround plan. Below we review the strategic and financial aspects of the deal and how it impacts our view on the stock. , which is slighly ahead of the current market price.BlackBerry's mobile device management efforts had largely been tied to the proprietary BlackBerry operating system, and the company was late to the cross-platform game, as it only introduced the the multi-platform BES 10 EMM solution in 2013 with a follow-up called BES 12 in 2014. BlackBerry's cross platform offerings still have some shortcomings, and this has proved a handicap in the current environment, where deployment models such as bring-your-own-device (BYOD) and corporate owned, personally enabled (COPE) have resulted in a diverse set of mobile operating systems in the workplace. Now, this deal should alleviate these issues to a large extent, since Good has strong expertise in multi-OS management with iOS devices accounting for 64% of its activations, followed by a broad Android and Windows customer base. This experience, combined with BlackBerry's strength in BlackBerry 10 and Android management, should allow the company to effectively address various customers and their deployment models. Good's success with iOS activations is very positive, given that Apple has been gaining share in the enterprise as well as the overall smartphone market.The deal should help BlackBerry expand its customer base meaningfully. Good's customer base includes more than 6,200 organizations, and the company is strong in verticals such as aerospace and defense, healthcare and financial services. Many customers in these verticals have abandoned BlackBerry hardware and device management software in recent years, on account of the company's flailing device sales and weak cross platform support. Now, with the acquisition BlackBerry could bring them back into its fold, while up-selling its suite of professional security software and value added services such as document management and secure communications. BlackBerry intends to maintain both companies' products as it develops a unified platform, which is expected within two years.While the enterprise mobility management software market is expanding fast (27% growth in CY2014), it is also fiercely competitive, with a large number of small players, holding low levels of market share. For instance, according to IDC, the largest vendor in 2014- AirWatch, owned by VMWare - had a market share of 11.4%, followed by Good with 9.7% and BlackBerry with a 9.5% share. With the Good deal, BlackBerry has effectively absorbed a key rival and bolstered its market position, possibly making it the largest EMM vendor after the deal closes. This sort of consolidation may appear all the more important with giants such as IBM and Microsoft - with their financial muscle and stronger enterprise software ecosystems - looking to make deeper inroads into the market. BlackBerry's organic growth has been faltering in recent years and the deal does provide the firm scope to drive incremental revenue growth. BlackBerry expects to realize approximately $160 million in GAAP revenue from Good in the first year after closing, including the impact of an expected write-down of certain deferred revenue of Good. Moreover, Good's revenue stream is stable and over 80% of the company's revenues are recurring, according to S&P Capital IQ. Now, Good does have a sizable cost base (it posted operating losses of $83.9 million losses in 2014) and the company has been burning through cash. However, there are likely to be meaningful cost synergies that the two companies can leverage, since they operate in overlapping markets. Moreover, BlackBerry CEO John Chen has a proven track record of cost management at BlackBerry- having effected operational restructuring and several rounds of headcount reductions - and it's likely that Good's cash burn will be stemmed as the integration progresses (the deal is expected to close by Q3 FY'16). Additionally, BlackBerry expects to remain cash flow positive overall following the deal.While we reserve judgement on the true value that BlackBerry will be getting in return for its $425 million purchase, until we have a better idea of the magnitude of revenue and cost synergies involved, there are a few facts that indicate that BlackBerry is getting a decent deal. First, the sale price is less than half the $1 billion valuation Good received just two years ago, according to data from the Wall Street Journal. Second, with Good having just about $25 million in cash as of the end of last year, the company may have had less leverage at the negotiating table. BlackBerry, on the other hand, can comfortably afford the sticker price, given that it had over $3.32 billion in cash and investments at the end of May. Third, in terms of relative valuations, BlackBerry is paying just about 2x trailing revenues for Good. In comparison, VMWare's 2014 purchase of EMM leader AirWatch was apparently closed at a whopping 15x trailing revenue multiple.While we like the acquisition and what it could do for BlackBerry's software business, we remain cautious about the company's long-term earnings prospects (related: Why BlackBerry May Still Be Better Off Sold). The company's smartphone business continues to flounder amid weak uptake of its flagship handsets, while its lucrative service access fees (SAF) have also been declining at a steady clip (projected decline of 15% per quarter) as customers abandon its legacy BB7 platform. Now, the EMM software market that BlackBerry is betting on to stabilize revenues and drive growth represents a very small and relatively niche part of the broader mobile software space, with the overall market size standing at just $1.4 billion in 2014. For perspective, that's less than half of BlackBerry's sales over CY2014. Even if BlackBerry is able to make a big dent in this market going forward, its unlikely to mean much for its earnings or valuation upside.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis): |  | The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["inding a great growth stock can be a tough task. Not only are there a wide range of choices, but the space can be extremely volatile and fraught with risk as well. But thanks to our new  we have been able to identify a few growth stocks which have incredible potential in the near term.One such company that stands out in this regard is undoubtedly  (  ). Not only does this company have a favorable growth score, but it is ranked as a buy too. And while there are numerous reasons why CTXS is so attractive right now, we have highlighted three of the most important-and pertinent to growth investors-below:Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, earnings growth in the double digits is definitely necessary and it is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) ahead for the company in question.While CTXS has put up a historical EPS growth rate of 10.45%, investors should really focus on the projected growth. Here, CTXS is looking to grow at a rate of 12.03%, thoroughly crushing the industry average which calls for EPS growth of just 5.98% in comparison.Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but especially so for growth oriented companies. A positive figure here indicates that cash is flowing into the business (obviously a good thing), while a negative reading here means that net cash is exiting the company.Right now, CTXS's current cash flow growth is an impressive 14.55%, a level that is far higher than many of its peers, and the industry average. In fact, the industry average sees cash flow growth of negative 2.31% in comparison, suggesting that CTXS is a better pick from a cash flow look.If the metrics outlined above weren't enough investors should also consider the positive trends that we are seeing on the analyst estimate revision front. Analysts have been raising their estimates for Citrix Systems lately, and now the earnings picture is looking a bit more favorable for the company.Over the past 60 days 5 EPS estimates have been revised higher compared to no lower, at least for the current year time frame. And the magnitude of these revisions has also been impressive, as the consensus estimate for the full year has surged from $2.78 per share to $2.98 per share today.For the reasons outlined above, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that Citrix Systems (CTXS) has earned itself a growth score of 'B' as well as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This means that we believe Citrix Systems stock is a potential outperformer that is an impressive choice for growth investors, making it a security that you need to keep on your radar in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Last quarter, the company posted loss per share of 6 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.IntraLinks provides Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions globally for securely managing content, exchanging critical business information and collaborating within and among organizations.The exponential increase in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors.Cloud computing consists of the entire gamut of computing intelligence required to carry out day-to-day operations by companies and professionals. This basically means that other than the hardware, which could be of any shape or form, all the supporting technology involved in creating, storing, retrieving, transporting, protecting, sorting, processing, analyzing and presenting information from multiple sources and formats, which when available from a shared (private) or public pool, could be referred to as cloud computing.Cloud service providers therefore help organizations to store data and applications remotely in this pool, which can be accessed from anywhere, anytime via the Internet. Therefore, users can access their files and settings from any connected device.Given its scope and advantages (cost, scaling, convenience, etc.), it is not surprising that the demand for cloud computing software and applications is on the rise. Cloud vendors usually offer the infrastructure or other technology as a service, which further reduces the costs for users.According to Centaur Partners, the SaaS and cloud-based business applications are likely to grow from $13.5 billion in 2013 to $32.8 billion in 2016, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5%. Moreover, Computerworld forecasts that 42% of IT decision makers are planning to increase spending on cloud computing in 2015.We believe that the increasing mainstream adoption of cloud-based solutions will positively impact IntraLink's second-quarter results.However, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and competition from Citrix Systems, Inc.  and International Business Machines Corporation are likely to affect results in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that IntraLinks will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 5 cents per share. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. IntraLinks currently has a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Amtech Systems Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +8.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.SunEdison Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +13.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

But it wasn't until he founded his hedge fund with money from friends and family that he unleashed the career that would earn him billions.According to the most recent estimates from  , Singer today is worth about $1.9 billion, making him the 351st wealthiest individual in the United States and No. 16 among hedge-fund managers.Singer's massive wealth stems from his successful hedge fund, Elliott Management Corp. The firm manages around $25 billion in total, with just over $8 billion in its domestic fund.Singer founded the fund in 1977, and it has returned over 14% annually since then. The fund's success has come from Singer's ability to find distressed assets, buy them up on the cheap, and then successfully use international court systems, boardroom tactics, and brilliant financial engineering to extract as much value as possible from those assets.In 1995, for example, Singer bought $11 million worth of distressed Peruvian bank debt with a face value of $20 million. In 1998, Peru paid Singer over $58 million to make the debt whole, including past-due interest.During another debt battle, Singer exposed corruption in the Congolese government while battling for repayment of $20 million in debts from that country. That legal fight eventually netted Singer $90 million.Singer has been battling Argentina in a similar fashion for nearly 15 years over bonds issued in 2001. That ordeal even made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in Singer's favor, but as of yet the fight remains unresolved.While these international fights grab headlines, they're not the only way Singer has amassed such huge wealth. Singer and his cohorts at Elliott Management also take an activist role in boardrooms across the corporate world.Earlier this year, Elliott installed two board seats on the board of cloud-storage firm  after investing over $1 billion in the company.Elliott hopes to divest EMC's equity stakes in the companies that comprise the so-called \"EMC Federation.\" Singer thinks that these companies are worth more as separate entities rather than as a consortium of cloud-computing businesses bound by equity investments from EMC. EMC's management sees the federation as a play on synergy, while Elliott sees inefficiency.Singer is 70 years old, but he isn't slowing down. In June, Elliott sent a letter to the management team and board of directors at  , announcing Elliott's 7.1% equity position and laying out plans to improve operational performance at the company.The letter made the case that Citrix is underperforming its peers in efficiency and effectiveness driven by poor execution and bloated operations. Singer thinks Citrix stock could exceed $100 per share by the end of 2016 with these improvements implemented. The stock today trades at $69 and is down 1.25% since Singer's hedge fund sent the letter to the company.In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Singer saw yet another opportunity: distressed real estate assets around the world. The fund quickly deployed resources to set up real estate offices in London, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. He has funded equity and debt investments in skyscrapers, distressed properties, hotels, and more.If you're keeping a tally, Singer has used strategies in foreign sovereign debt, corporate breakups, improving operational efficiency, and even real estate. The one thing that links them all is opportunity and aggressiveness, and that's the key to his massive wealth.These are qualities that everyday investors can seek to emulate. No, we can't take a foreign government to court and expect to win. Nor can we finance the construction of a skyscraper or win a board seat on a  500 company. But we can pay attention to the markets around us, and we can take advantage of opportunities we see.That could have meant investing in a rental property in your neighborhood following the real estate collapse, or buying shares of a bank stock on the rebound in 2010 or 2011. It could be local to you or a national trend. The key is staying aware of the marketplace around us, being patient, and, when an opportunity arises, seizing it aggressively.It's fundamentally the same approach Warren Buffett uses in his equity investments, except Buffett is willing to pay a little extra to invest in the companies he thinks will prosper for 100 years or more. Look for companies that have a competitive advantage, whose products that are particularly difficult to replace, and that run a business you can understand.That's what Buffett does. It's also what Paul Singer does. And you can do it, too.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

But the stock's stumble post-earnings last week saw several exchange traded funds sour in a flash.PowerShares QQQ (  ), the Nasdaq-tracking ETF with a hefty stake in  , slipped 1% upon the company's mixed results.Apple is a top 10 holding in 105 equity exchange traded funds, according to financial data provider S&P Capital IQ.ETFs tracking the S&P 500 index have it. So do broadly diversified as well as niche technology ETFs. So do growth, dividend and smart beta ETFs -- some well-known, others less so.That heavy presence can bring risks. ETFs overly reliant on one stock are likely to take a big hit if it tanks. And investors may unwittingly have more exposure to one stock than they realize.For example, if they ownVanguard S&P 500 (  ) for broad market exposure, as well as a focused sector bet such asVanguard Information Technology (  ), Apple is the No. 1 holding in each.That's great for investors who are bullish on the Cupertino giant for  . For others, maybe not so much.\"We definitely have to look at holdings overlap inside all of the ETFs we use,\" says Chris Cook, president of Ohio-based Beacon Capital Management. \"In particular, Apple. It's by far the largest company market-cap-wise and virtually every company is putting Apple in (their products).\"To avoid concentration of one stock, Cook uses a pure sector-focused  .\"We diversify across the sectors pretty evenly,\" he said. \"We like to control weightings at the sector level. How much you have in each sector is key to performance.\"He can't get that fine-tuned sector exposure with, say, VOO.Cook describes his firm's investment philosophy as fairly conservative: \"Most of our clients love the downside protection.\"He added: \"We don't have to worry about severe overlap of one major company\" with a sector-based approach to ETF investing.For Craig French, director of investments at WBI Investments, that's a nonissue. \"We would not generally select ETFs based on 'too much' or 'too little' single stock exposure, Apple included,\" he said. WBI owns the iPhone maker in several investment strategies and portfolios.\"If cash and securities were gross domestic product, Apple would be the 53rd largest country in the world,\" French added. \"That is a strong balance sheet.\"For investors who want to avoid an overreliance on one  , \"an equal-weighted approach is worthy of attention,\" says Todd Rosenbluth, Capital IQ's director of ETF research.Citrix Systems (  ), an $11 billion enterprise software company, has a 2.9% weighting in First Trust NASDAQ 100Technology Sector (  ).Apple gets 2.9% of this equal-weighted ETF's $322.6 million in assets too.

Moreover, its products XenMobile and XenApps are gaining significant market traction in the highly lucrative enterprise mobility segment and Windows app virtualization space.New product launches are significantly boosting Citrix's top line.

This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. : The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Thus, the ESP for the company currently stands at 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. : Citrix carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction inconclusive.Note that Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.ePlus inc.  , has an earnings ESP of +0.85% and a Zacks Rank #3.Tangoe, Inc.  , has an earnings ESP of +14.29% and a Zacks Rank #3.Interactive Intelligence Group Inc.  , has an earnings ESP of +3.85% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: CTXS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 2016 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTXS options chain for the new March 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $61.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $69.71/share today.Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CTXS stock at the current price level of $69.71/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $72.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.46% if the stock gets called away at the March 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTXS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTXS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $72.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $72.50 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

It directed traffic from one server to another when the original server was down or becoming overloaded.1999: The company lists on NASDAQ as F5 Networks, at $10.2000: The year of the dot.com crash; between January and December, F5's stock falls from $160 per share to $9.43 per share.2000: As the scope of the downturn becomes apparent, John McAdam is hired as president and CEO. He immediately begins cutting costs and streamlining the product line, shifting the company's focus from Internet startups to big brick-and-mortar companies.2000 to 2014: Nine major acquisitions during this period.2004: Introduction of TMOS (Traffic Management Operating System), which becomes the company's core technology.2010: Named as one of America's 100 fastest-growing companies (number 64) by Fortune Magazine.Unless otherwise noted, this section is based on information provided at Wikipedia and Company-Histories.com.F5's main area of business is in Application Delivery Controllers, or ADCs. The company says ADCs \"...dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users and servers (physical or virtual), making multiple servers look like a single resource to the user.\"In addition, \"...our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security, WAN optimization, application acceleration, policy management, and Diameter signaling and routing, where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional ADC vendors.\"In its 10-K for 2014, F5 calls itself \"...the leading developer and provider of software-defined application services.\"Its core technology is a software platform called TMOS (Traffic Management Operating System). TMOS ensures that applications are accessible over Internet Protocol (  ) networks, and that they are secure, fast and available.F5's application services, which are available as software modules, include:Hardware products include the BIG-IP family of appliances and a line of scalable VIPRION systems.In addition to software and hardware, it offers a range of services that includes consulting, training, installation, maintenance and other technical support services.Customers include companies in technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing, and healthcare, as well as government agencies.The company runs all of its operations as one segment; revenue breaks out this way:International sales represented 48.3% of the company's net sales in 2014.Yahoo! Finance lists F5's competitors as:The company believes competition is based on the following characteristics:F5 notes some competitors are reducing prices in a bid to increase market share, but it thinks it can remain competitive without following them. It attributes this to high levels of customer satisfaction and brand awareness because of its products' superior performance, functionality, and unique capabilities.In fiscal 2014 the company spent $263.8 million on research and development.F5 Networks is incorporated in Washington State, and headquartered in Seattle, Washington.At the end of fiscal 2014 (September 30) it had 3,834 full-time employees, including 1,054 in product development and 1,448 in sales and marketing.Unless otherwise noted, the information in this section and the rest of the article is based on F5's 10-K for 2014.Comments: F5 Networks provides essential Internet networking products and services to large companies and governments. It had annual revenues of more than $1.7 billion last year and has been able to maintain its position in a competitive sector through product innovation and development.With a history of successful acquisitions, F5 can look at future acquisitions as a source of new growth opportunities. In many cases this would involve broadening the scope of its offerings and expanding into adjacent markets.Security, fraud detection, and related threats offer new opportunities for F5; its portfolio of products/services already includes a number of applications that help customers in their core and adjacent markets.The company's business development team monitors the market for opportunities to partner with other companies offering complementary solutions. Such partnerships open doors to new markets.F5 also has a history of successful International expansion, which should allow it to build revenue globally, and especially as emerging markets quickly grow their technology sectors.As the company focuses on larger business accounts, it adds new risk factors. For example, delays in recognizing revenue from just one account could hurt its operating results for a specific quarter or year. Growth in customer size also brings with it increased credit risks.Its customer are moving to hybrid computing environments that involve cloud-based software and services that are accessed by way of smart client devices. Within this environment, pricing and delivery models are changing.Some of F5's competitors do what it is doing: making acquisitions and developing partnerships. This means competitors can offer more comprehensive solutions to customers in the space.Innovation remains critical, as the company and its competitors race to develop new products and features. F5 needs to be able to offer the market the right products at the right time (as noted above, the company spent $263.8 million on research and development in the past fiscal year).As an international company, it faces a wide array of risks, including the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of countries in which it has operations. Internation exposure also includes country risks.F5 Networks has demonstrated strong growth since its IPO in 1999. The following chart shows revenue (green line) and Earnings Per Share (EPS - blue line):5 Ne    In its Annual Report for 2014, F5 notesIt has completed major upgrades to its core operating system TMOS, positioning it for growth with a number of major enhancements.Similarly, it has completed what it calls a \"complete refresh\" of the BIG-IP appliance family.As noted, it has developed a number of new applications to take advantage of growing interest in security products.It recently added F5 Synthesis, described as, \"a new architectural vision, consisting of three integrated components designed to address the needs of customers in today's rapidly evolving technology landscapes.\"This section based on information in the F5's Annual Report and.Comments: A strong history of growth, a history that should continue with new and upgraded products. Risk factors do not appear to pose any outstanding issues of concern.President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director: John McAdam, age 64, has been the CEO since 2000. Prior to that, he had been General Manager of the Web server sales business at IBM.CEO-in-waiting: Manuel (Manny) Rivelo, age 50, will be promoted from EVP of F5's Strategic Solutions to CEO on July 1, 2015, succeeding McAdam. Rivelo has been with the company since 2011, and before that served as Senior Vice President of Engineering Systems and Operations for Cisco Systems.Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Andy Reinland, age 50, joined F5 in 1998 as a senior financial analyst.Board Chair: Alan J. Higginson, age 67, has been a director of the company since 1996, the year of its founding. He has also served as chair and CEO of Hubspan, Inc., an ebusiness infrastructure company.Board of Directors: Seven independent directors plus CEO McAdam.ISS Governance QuickScore: 5, a median score, on a scale that ranges from 1 (lesser governance risk) to 10 (greater governance risk). F5 receives two red flags, for Equity Risk Mitigation and Termination. It receives one green star for Board Composition.Unless otherwise noted, the management and governance section is based on information at the company's website and Reuters.comComments: The senior executive team has extensive experience with F5 and with the industry, and should be able to execute on the company's continuing growth plans. Rivelo, obviously, will be new but should have another experience within and outside F5 to know the business and what it needs to do.Gurus: only one of the legendary investors followed by GuruFocus owns stock in F5: Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), with 21,830 shares.Institutional: according to  institutional investors (mainly pension funds, mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies) own almost 98% of FFIV's shares:    Short Interests: GuruFocus puts the short interest at just over 7%, and shows this history of short holdings:Insiders: 1% of F5's outstanding shares, according to GuruFocus, with the biggest holding by CEO McAdam:Comments: The big money, institutional investors, have a solid investment in F5, as does its outgoing CEO.\n  \nComments: The share price is about $10 below the 1 year high; strong ROE at 25 and a half percent; the company pays no dividend; and it had a strong year of buybacks in fiscal 2014.F5 Networks receives an exceptional 9/10 for Financial Strength and 9/10 for Profitability & Growth; especially exceptional for a value stock:We'll review a few critical financial metrics, beginning with the company's long-term debt. It's one of the simplest charts we'll ever see, no long-term debt now or in the past:Next, a look at free cash flow, which has risen steadily since the company pulled itself out of the dot.com crash in 2000:And, how about the company's ability to generate steadily increasing earnings? Again solid progress since the dot.com days:The GuruFocus system posts one Medium Warning Sign: Price is close to the three-year high:Comments: No long-term debt, coupled with strong free cash flow and EBITDA, paints an encouraging picture of financial health for F5.F5 Networks was discovered on the Buffett-Munger screener at GuruFocus, thanks to its high predictability rating and a fairly low PEG ratio.On the predictability side, the company enjoys a 5- (out of 5) Star rating because of the consistency and growth of its earnings. If we go the All-in-One Guru screener, and make a 5-Star predictability rating the sole criterion, we see only 125 names. In other words, out of the many thousands of stocks covered by GuruFocus, only 125 have a predictability rating that good.Turning to the PEG ratio, we see it stands at 0.93 at the close of trading on May 11, 2015. The PEG, or PPEG ratio, is calculated by dividing a company's P/E by the average growth rate over the past five years. A ratio below 1.00 indicates an under-valued stock; a ratio between 1.0 and 2.0 indicates fair valuation; and a ratio of more than 2.0 suggests a stock is over-valued.At 0.93, F5 sits just below the fair value threshold; based on recent price action, and assuming investors bid the price up beyond the range of the past couple of weeks, F5 could soon be in fair-valuation territory. Of course, investors might also consider this price a resistance point and back away from the stock, leaving it to wither again.Adding a little sauce to the situation is a report from Credit Suisse on April 29, listing F5 Networks as a potential buyout target (no further information is provided).Comments: The current valuation seems somewhat low, and not only because of the PEG ratio. 5-Star Predictability would suggest this stock will get back on track again.Notwithstanding today's price action, I suspect Mr. Market will act like Santa in the long term. This company has lots of earnings horse- (or should I say deer-) power that should pull up share prices.It undoubtedly will have more bad days, as news washes in and out of the market about currency exchange rates and technological developments. But in the long run, it may well be worth wrapping and leaving under the tree.About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

The decline was due to higher research and development, general and administrative expenses, and lower gross profit.VMware exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of $7.23 billion compared with $7.08 billion in the previous quarter. The company reported operating cash flow of $683 million in the quarter, down 8.9% year over year, and free cash flow of $577 million, down 14.3% from the prior year quarter.For second-quarter 2015, the company expects revenues in a range of $1.580 billion and $1.600 billion.

Non-GAAP EPS is expected within$3.94 and $4.02 (earlier expected range was $3.96 to $4.04). Non-GAAP operating margin is likely to be 31.5%. Cash flow from operations is expected around $1.95 billion in 2015, down from $2 billion projected earlier.The company expects stock repurchase worth at least $1 billion in 2015 compared with roughly $700 million shares repurchased in 2014.We believe that VMware's strong product portfolio is a major positive. The company continues to win contracts. Robust international sales will boost the top line, going forward. The acquisitions of Cloud Volumes, Desktone, AirWatch and the recent buyout of Immidio will also add to the top line, going forward.However, a sluggish IT spending environment and intensifying competition from its peers such as Microsoft Corp.  , Hewlett-Packard  and Citrix  are the primary headwinds. Moreover, VMware's continued investments in the emerging markets, product innovation and acquisitions are expected to weigh on margins in the near term.Currently, VMware has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Today, however, Citrix released its official numbers. And lucky for investors in the software virtualization specialist, they weren't as bad as Citrix initially feared.When all was said and done in the first quarter, Citrix's revenue climbed 1.3% year over year to $761 million, or just above the high end of the $755 million to $760 million range it provided less than two weeks ago. But that was still well below Citrix's original guidance  for sales of $780 million to $790 million.Meanwhile, Citrix's  net income came in at $29 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, down from $0.30 per share in the same year-ago period. Again, however, that was above Citrix's preliminary range for GAAP net income per share of $0.15 to $0.17, and not alarmingly below its original range of $0.20 to $0.22. On a non-GAAP basis -- which means excluding things like amortization charges and stock-based compensation -- Citrix's net income was $106 million, and up by a penny on a per-share basis over the same year-ago period to $0.65. That's at the high end of Citrix's expected $0.63 to $0.65 revised range, but again falls below its previous range of $0.70 to $0.72 per share. To be fair, keep in mind Citrix also repurchased 2.4 million shares during the quarter at an average price of roughly $63.12 per share.As it turns out, analysts were similarly optimistic going into the report, calling for adjusted earnings and revenue of $0.65 per share and $762.9 million, respectively. Even so, after rising nearly 1% in Wednesday's regular session, shares of Citrix are currently up another 1% in after-hours trading. As it stands, Citrix sits almost exactly where it stood before the pre-announcement on April 9.Revenue from products and license sales continued to remain weak, falling 12% year over year to $183.3 million. And the smaller professional services segment fell 13% over the same period to $36.9 million. But those declines were more than offset by an 8% increase from Citrix's Software-as-a-Service business to $169.4 million, and 8% growth from the larger licensing updates and maintenance stream to $371.3 million.To blame for its overall weakness, according to Citrix CEO Mark Templeton, is a combination of foreign exchange volatility, and the greater-than-expected negative impact to Citrix's business from its ongoing restructuring effort. Templeton expressed disappointment with the results, but elaborated, \"We underestimated the impact caused by our restructuring, organizational evolution, and changes to our field and channel strategies,  .\" [emphasis mine]For perspective, during last quarter's , CFO David Henshall detailed how the restructuring was  . As the restructuring continues to forge ahead, that growth should be realized not just through the unfortunate elimination of redundant positions, but more importantly by better aligning Citrix's business with its long-term ambitions. To start, Henhall says, that means furthering its vision of a \"simplified software-defined workplace,\" and seizing market share in the related mobility, cloud services, and networking industries. In the meantime, Citrix expects current quarter revenue of $785 million to $795 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 to $0.83. Both ranges fall short of analysts' models, which called for adjusted second-quarter earnings of $0.86 per share on sales of $815.4 million.For the full year, however, Citrix sees revenue of $3.22 billion to $3.25 billion, with adjusted earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.60. In this case, Wall Street would have settled for 2015 earnings of just $3.53 per share on slightly higher sales of $3.26 billion.All things considered, it helps that Citrix got the bad news out of the way early in releasing its light preliminary results. That gave investors time to digest the information and realize while its not ideal, these current headwinds should ultimately pass and leave Citrix a stronger business in the end. As a result, with the caveat that I'll be watching Citrix's progress closely in the coming quarters, I still think Citrix stock is poised to reward patient shareholders going forward.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"...

Moreover, its products XenMobile and XenApps are gaining significant market traction in the highly lucrative enterprise mobility segment and Windows app virtualization.However, Citrix slashed its top and bottom line guidance for the upcoming quarter. The company now projects first-quarter 2015 revenues in the $755-$760 million range against the previous outlook of $780-$790 million. Net income per diluted share for the period is expected in the band of 15 to 17 cents against the earlier projection of 20 to 22 cents per diluted share.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Citrix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Thus, the ESP for the company currently stands at -4.35% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 44 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at 46 cents.

The company's fourth-quarter earnings (including stock-based compensation expense) of 90 cents comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents and was also higher than the year-ago figure of 87 cents.Higher-than-expected revenues contributed to the earnings beat in the final quarter of 2014. Including special items, Citrix Systems reported earnings of 58 cents per share, down 21.6%.Total revenue in the reported quarter climbed 6.1% year over year to $851 million.

Revenues from the company's SaaS delivered mobility apps climbed 10% to $168 million with most of the revenues (60%) coming from the communications cloud family.The company expects revenues in the range of $780 million to $790 million for the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter are projected in the band of 70 cents to 72 cents.

In an encouraging follow-up to  , shares of the software virtualization specialist are up 4% in after-hours trading Wednesday following its exemplary fourth-quarter report.Quarterly revenue climbed 6.1% year-over-year to $851 million, which translated to adjusted net income of $180 million, or $1.10 per share. Analysts, on average, were only modeling earnings of $1.03 per share on sales of $844 million.In addition, Citrix announced it will implement a restructuring program, \"designed to increase strategic focus and operational efficiency.\" The program will align Citrix around three business units -- Workspace Services, Delivery Network, and Mobility Apps -- and will unfortunately mean the elimination of 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions. At the same time, it should result in annualized pre-tax savings of $90 to $100 million. Before that happens, however, Citrix expects to incur pre-tax charges in 2015 of roughly $40 million to $45 million for employee severance packages and $9 million to $10 million related to the consolidation of leased facilities.\"I'm proud of our 2014 performance,\" elaborated Mark Templeton, \"but we're not satisfied. We are looking ahead to 2015 with a focus on innovation that delivers a better experience, more flexibility, and greater security to our customers, and a more focused organizational footprint that enables profitable growth.\"So what drove the better-than-expected results in Q4?First, product and license revenue decreased 1% but was more than offset by solid 10% growth in software as a service revenue, a 9% increase in revenue from license updates and maintenance, and a 26% bump from professional services.Breaking that down in terms of the above-mentioned business units, Citrix first saw Workspace Services revenue climb 2% over the same year-ago period to $437 million. Within that, Workspace Suite comprised roughly 15% of total licensing revenue. Citrix Service Provider sales also notably jumped around 50% year-over-year, albeit from a much smaller base.Next, Delivery Network revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $195 million. Citrix saw transactions from over 2,600 unique customers in the segment, with two-thirds of its sales coming from enterprise customers. SDX platform revenue enjoyed the most impressive performance, growing more than 20% over last year to comprise around 19% of the mix.Finally, SaaS-Delivered Mobility Apps saw revenue climb 10% year-over-year to $168 million, driven primarily by Communications Cloud sales which represented over 60% of the segment total. ShareFile sales also jumped around 60% over the same quarter last year, adding over 50,000 new customers to bring its base to 10 million total users.Citrix ended the year with cash and equivalents of $1.9 billion -- and that's after spending more than $215 million during the fourth quarter to repurchase 3.3 million shares at an average price of $65.26 per share. As it stands, Citrix still has around $288 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.For the current quarter, Citrix expects revenue to be in the range of $780 million to $790 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.70 to $0.72. Citrix also noted the first quarter will see the brunt of its pre-tax restructuring charges, with $30 million to $35 million for employee severance and $3 million to $5 million for lease consolidations. Both ranges are below Wall Street expectations for earnings of $0.80 per share on sales of $796.7 million.For the full year 2015, however, Citrix is calling for revenue of $3.29 billion to $3.33 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.60 to $3.65. The mid-points of both ranges are still below analyst models, which call for 2015 earnings and revenue of $3.65 per share and $3.36 billion, respectively. At the same time, however, they significantly narrow the gap between the two. Assuming Citrix's restructuring efforts are successful, the resulting annualized savings and renewed focus on profitable growth should leave the company poised for much improved results going forward.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed. It could make early investors wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism ...  is calling it \"transformative\"...

In addition, earnings per share (EPS) comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents.Revenues increased 15% year over year to $1.70 billion and surpassed the Zacks consensus estimate of $1.69 billion. The year-over-year growth was primarily attributable to strong customer adoption of VMware's products and services worldwide. Revenues from services rose 16.3% to $926 million. This resulted from 13% growth in license revenues to $777 million, 14.9% increase in Software maintenance to $803 million and 26.9% improvement in professional services to $123 million.Total revenue for 2014 came in at $6.35 billion, up 16% year over year.Operating margin declined 230 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 33.3%. The decline was due to higher research and development, general and administrative expenses, and lower gross profit.VMware exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of $7.08 billion compared with $7.10 billion in the previous quarter. The company reported operating cash flows of $2.18 billion in 2014, down 14% year over year, and free cash flow of $1.83 billion, down 17% from 2013.VMware initiated a new share repurchase program of $1 billion scheduled to end in 2017. The new stock repurchase authorization is in addition to the current $1 billion stock repurchase program initiated in Aug 6, 2014. The company expects the new share repurchase program to offset equity based compensation programs in 2015.For first-quarter 2015, the company expects revenues in a range of $1.49 to $1.51 billion and License revenues within $570 to $580 million.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of 83 to 85 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 64 cents. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 29.5%.For 2015, the company expects revenues in the range of $6.64 to $6.76 billion and License revenues to be between $2.735 billion and $2.815 billion.Non-GAAP EPS is expected within $3.96 to $4.04. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.59. Non-GAAP operating margin is likely to be 31.5%. Cash flow from operations is expected around $2 billion along with cash taxes of $350 million.The company expects stock repurchase worth at least $1 billion in 2015 compared with roughly $700 million shares repurchased in 2014.We believe that VMware's strong product portfolio is a major positive. The company continues to win contracts. Robust international sales will boost the top line, going forward. The acquisitions of CloudVolumes, Desktone and AirWatch will also add to the top line, going forward.We further believe that the numerous strategic partnerships and accretive acquisitions that the company is entering into will significantly boost its top line.However, a sluggish IT spending environment and intensifying competition from its peers such as Microsoft Corp. (  ), Hewlett-Packard and Citrix (  ) are the primary headwinds. Moreover, VMware's continued investments in the emerging markets, product innovations and acquisitions are expected to weigh on margins in the near term.Currently, VMware has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

In a nutshell, MDM services help companies monitor and manage their employees' mobile devices from a central location. This is an increasingly important trend and demand for MDM services is rising across the enterprise sector, due to the relaxation of BYOD (bring your own device) restrictions.Source: Pixabay. has three MDM solutions. The largest, Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS), is aimed at large enterprises. Intune, a subset of EMS for smaller businesses, originally monitored Windows PCs, but Microsoft expanded it to manage iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices last October. In late March, Microsoft expanded its MDM services to monitor Office 365 across all devices. But unlike the subscription-based versions of EMS and Intune, the Office 365 MDM service will be free for all commercial Office 365 customers.However, Microsoft's interest in the MDM Market could hurt  , which is relying on its MDM solution, BES (BlackBerry Enterprise Service), to offset its losses in smartphones. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft and BlackBerry's interest in the MDM market, which research firm Markets and Markets forecasts will grow from $1.01 billion in 2013 to $3.94 billion by 2019. A $4 billion market opportunity is a drop in the pond for Microsoft, which is expected to report $94 billion in revenues in fiscal 2015. However, the MDM market is an ecosystem play rather than a revenue one.On its own, the MDM market's future looks murky. The market is being fragmented and commoditized by a wide range of players like  ,  ,  , AirWatch, and BlackBerry. Open source MDM solutions, like Talend, are flattening price expectations. MDM products cost up to $150 per device back in 2010, but by 2013, the average price fell below $30, according to  research VP Peter Firstbrook.Microsoft Intune. Source: Microsoft.As price expectations for the MDM market decline further, businesses will start expecting MDM features to be bundled with cloud-based services. That's why Microsoft added MDM features to Office 365, a main pillar of its commercial cloud business, which posted an annualized run rate of $5.5 billion as of last quarter.The Office 365 MDM solution also serves as a \"freemium\" gateway which leads enterprise customers toward Intune and EMS subscriptions. That can help Microsoft ramp up its presence in the larger enterprise mobility market, which Markets and Markets expects to grow from $72 billion in 2014 to $284 billion by 2019. Unlike Microsoft, a $4 billion market opportunity matters financially to BlackBerry, which reported just $3.3 billion in revenues in fiscal 2015. Last quarter, nearly 90% of BlackBerry's top line, which fell 32% year-over-year, came from hardware and services. Just 10% came from software, which rose 20% annually to $67 million.BlackBerry believes that its software segment -- which  , its  , and  (BBM) -- can eventually offset its losses in hardware and services. Yet BlackBerry finished fiscal 2015 with $234 million in software revenue, which missed its prior target of $250 million. This could make it tough to achieve the company's lofty goal of more than doubling software revenue to $600 million in fiscal 2016.BES 12. Source: BlackBerry.BlackBerry tried to accelerate the adoption rate of BES with its EZ Pass program, which let businesses swap BES 5 or competitors' MDM licenses for free BES 10 trial licenses, which could be upgraded to BES 12. The EZ Pass program ended with 6.8 million licenses issued, but BlackBerry didn't disclose how many EZ Passes were converted to paid subscriptions since the program ended on Jan. 31.BlackBerry is optimistic about BES' ability to boost its software revenue and lead MDM customers toward its other enterprise mobility services, but that effort could be crippled by the aforementioned commoditization of the market. Microsoft's addition of MDM services to Office 365 was a clever move which gives the company three mobility solutions for small, medium, and large enterprise customers. While it may not generate much revenue on its own, it will enhance its commercial cloud and enterprise mobility ecosystems. But that move, which further flattens price expectations for MDM services, could curb BlackBerry's ability to turn BES into a major source of revenue.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"... But you'll probably just call it \"how I made my millions.\" Don't be too late to the party --  when the Web goes dark.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe that the global trend toward virtualization and cloud computing will help Citrix retain its momentum in the upcoming quarters. Moreover, its products XenMobile and XenApps are gaining significant market traction in the highly lucrative enterprise mobility segment and Windows app virtualization.In addition, the company's latest launch of the innovative app - ShareConnect - will not only provide unique desktop-like facilities to iPads and Android-based tablets but will also boost demand going forward.On the flipside, the server virtualization market is intensely challenging and is also becoming increasingly commoditized. Citrix has been steadily cutting the prices of its XenServer products and this has resulted in most of its offerings being free. Also, the company witnessed a relatively slow conversion from free offerings to paid-for-essential versions. Such a discouraging conversion rate will certainly impact the company's business in the upcoming quarters.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Citrix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.

Also, an announcement related to certain management changes was made.Per NQ Mobile, Yu Lin stepped down as he unable to perform his duties citing personal reasons, which were in no way connected to the affairs of the company. NQ's current President Zemin Xu will be appointed as the Co-CEO and member of the board. Xu will join the other Co-CEO, Omar Khan. NQ's Co-Founder, Chief Operating Officer (COO) and acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Dr. Vincent Wenyong Shi will take over the duties of the Chairman of the Board going forward.Moreover, management also declared its intention of carrying on with its share repurchase program in the near future.Meanwhile, in an endeavor to express confidence in the future of the company, RPL Limited, a substantial shareholder of NQ Mobile (approximately 11.3% of outstanding shares) has agreed to an additional two-year voluntary lock-up scheduled to expire in Dec 2016.In Aug 2014, KB Teo resigned from the office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) citing personal reasons, pretty similar to Yu Lin. We believe that in order to divert public attention from this management reshuffle, the company stressed on the share repurchase plan and the extension of lock up period.Nevertheless, the company's decision to continue with its share repurchase plan will bolster its bottom line going forward. Also, the extension of the lock-up period will encourage more investment in the company.Better-than-expected user growth in FL Mobile's gaming platform and new game launches remain growth catalysts. The company's associations with Sprint and Samsung are positives. Moreover, the recent partnerships with the likes of Mobile Telesystems OSJC will help the company in expanding its reach worldwide.However, the company's margins have been adversely impacted by rising expenses and higher contribution of lower-margin businesses. Moreover, competition from Autodesk Inc. (  ), Cadence Design (  ) and Citrix Systems Inc. (  ) remains a major headwind going forward.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: CTXS) saw new options become available this week, for the September 18th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTXS options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTXS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $60.49/share today.Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.50% return on the cash commitment, or 13.04% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of CTXS stock at the current price level of $60.49/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $62.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.93% if the stock gets called away at the September 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTXS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Citrix Systems, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTXS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $62.50 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.60% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.66% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 29%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $60.49) to be 24%.

On one hand, the cloud computing and software virtualization specialist beat expectations on adjusted earnings per share, which rose 8% to $0.75. On the other hand, that was largely due to share repurchases as actual net income fell more than 5%. Citrix also fell short of analysts' top-line expectations, with both disappointing third-quarter sales and full-year guidance.But Citrix stock has largely recovered since then, in part thanks to subsequent color on the report provided by management, who spent roughly an hour speaking with financial analysts following the announcement. Here are five key takeaways from that call.To be sure, quarterly revenue from Citrix's primary Mobile and Desktop business climbed just 3% year over year to $393 million. And that even includes a 90% uptick in XenMobile sales, which is obviously still just a tiny sliver of its overall business. That said, Henshall elaborated that they continue to execute well in both desktop and app virtualization, winning \"virtually every competitive opportunity due to the breadth and performance of XenDesktop with Flexcast.\" In the end, demand has simply remained limited as Citrix sees customers focus on deploying multiple kinds of new applications -- not just Windows apps, per Citrix's focus -- and slower migration to new platforms.As evidence of this promise, Templeton also highlighted the fact that, shortly after Workplace Suite's release, Citrix closed \"several multi-million dollar deals in the health care and financial services verticals.\" Despite broader near-term weakness, then, investors should be encouraged Citrix is using this new strategic licensing structure to bolster its leadership position.This echoes Henshall's  , when he said Citrix's strongest growth would come from its networking, mobile platforms, and data sharing businesses. Once again, it's a question of just how long it takes for these relatively small segments to meaningfully contribute to Citrix's overall growth. However great their performance is now, investors should continue to closely monitor the progress of these outperforming emerging businesses.We should note Citrix stated last quarter's complete mobile solution figure sat at 80%. Of course, at this early stage, the sequential decline could simply be the result of a few customers opting out. In any case, that three out of four customers still opt for Citrix's complete mobile solution shows XenMobile's impressive 90% year-over-year growth is no fluke.To elaborate, Henshall later in the call described that margin improvement is \"more of a target objective,\" and explained that the performance taken into account for their 2015 plan will be \"largely driven by revenue upside.\" That said, Henshall also stated the 100 basis point increase in operating margin is one they expect to be able to deliver on for \"multiple years into the future\" given a combination of revenue gains and operational efficiencies. If one thing is sure, it's that this is great news for patient, long-term investors.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development \"dream team\" -- Apple Watch.

But alas, however advanced its products might be, slow and steady seems to be the name of the game for software virtualization specialist  today.Shares of Citrix fell more than 5% during Wednesday's after-hours trading, after the company announced that third-quarter revenue climbed just 6.5% to $759 million. That was below not only Citrix's own guidance for sales of $765 to $775 million, but also analysts' expectations for $771.8 million.Meanwhile, Citrix's adjusted net income fell by more than 5% year over year to $125 million. To Citrix's credit, however, through a combination of share repurchases and improving operational efficiencies, adjusted earnings  simultaneously increased by almost 8% to $0.75. By comparison, both analysts' estimates and the high end of Citrix's guidance called for earnings of just $0.73 per share.Citrix CEO Mark Templeton summed it up well: Citrix's core product license revenue fell 4% during the quarter. The majority of Citrix's bookings declines, Templeton elaborated, came from the broad, project-specific segment within its Mobile and Desktop business, where it has already seen sluggish demand all year.Even so, Mobile and Desktop revenue still managed to increase by 3% year over year to $393 million, helped both by an impressive 90% jump in sales for Citrix's XenMobile solution, and a 50% increase in Citrix Service Provider revenue. With regard to mobile solutions in particular, Citrix saw 75% of all mobile customers opt for their complete XenMobile Enterprise Edition, which speaks to its advantages over competing standalone mobility solutions from Citrix's peers.In addition, Citrix saw a reasonably strong performance from its Networking and Cloud business, sales from which rose 6% to $155 million. And  , that was led by low-double-digit growth in its popular NetScaler line of products. That said, it still marks a deceleration from the 9% year-over-year growth in Networking and Cloud, which Citrix achieved only last quarter.Next, sales for Citrix's software as a service-delivered mobile apps, listed under its Communications and Documents Cloud segment, grew 12% to $165 million. That performance was led by a 50% increase in ShareFile sales, as well as a 13% increase in Communications Cloud products -- the latter of which now comprises around 60% of overall SaaS revenue. Finally, Citrix continues to expect the strongest forward growth from NetScaler, XenMobile, Service Providers, and other mobile apps. Given their recent results, however, the company is choosing to remain cautious on expectations for its larger desktop and app virtualization businesses until they see better traction develop going forward.As a result, for the full year 2014, Citrix lowered its net revenue guidance to a range of $3.13 billion to $3.14 billion, and then narrowed its range for adjusted earnings per diluted share to $3.22 to $3.25. The midpoint of both ranges sits just below analysts' expectations for earnings of $3.24 per share on sales of $3.18 billion.In the end, I'll admit that Citrix's results aren't exactly riveting, and it's frustrating for investors to watch the desktop and app virtualization businesses languish. But at the same time, it's encouraging that Citrix's emerging businesses, however small they might be, continue to perform exceptionally well. While I can't blame the market for bidding down shares of Citrix today, I think it's definitely worth adding Citrix to your watchlist to keep an eye on its progress over the next few quarters.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

However, earnings per share (EPS) managed to comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents.Revenues increased 17.5% year over year to $1.52 billion and were in line with the higher end of management's guided range of $1.42 billion-$1.52 billion. Revenues managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 billion. The year-over-year growth in revenues was primarily attributable to strong customer adoption of VMware's products and services worldwide.This is reflected in a 13.3% growth in license revenues to $639.0 million and a 20.8% increase in services revenues to $876.0 million in the reported quarter. Among services revenues, software maintenance jumped 21% from the year-ago quarter to $779 million while professional services rose 19.8% to $97 million.Moreover, strong demand for VMware solutions across international as well as U.S. markets helped revenues. International accounted for 48.5% of net revenue in the reported quarter while the U.S. chipped in with the remnant 51.5% share.Relative performance wise, bookings grew in EMEA during the quarter. However, in Russia, geopolitical tensions weighed on the bookings performance and it underwent a 50% decline year over year. Bookings registered year-over-year growth in the Asia-Pacific region despite softness in Japan.Among the product groups, End User Computing (EUC) license bookings (including AirWatch) grew 60% on a year-over-year basis. More than 75% of the company's vCloud Suite license sales were attached to Enterprise License Agreements (ELAs) during the quarter. NSX gained significant momentum during the quarter. The product has more than 250 paying customers right now.The hybrid cloud business grew over 80% on a year-over-year basis in the reported quarter. Currently, VMware is listed as one of only five mega providers in Gartner's 2015 planning guide for cloud computing.During the quarter, VMware secured three deals greater than $10 million worth. ELA's accounted for approximately 29% of third-quarter bookings. The company registered its highest-ever renewal support rate in the third quarter.Recently, the company announced its plan to open a new data center in Germany in order to expand the geographical reach of its hybrid cloud offerings.VMware recently launched EVO: RAIL, a hyper-converged infrastructure appliance that helps customers streamline the deployment and scale-out of Software-Defined IT infrastructure. During the quarter, the company also unveiled VMware vRealize Suite 6 and vRealize Code Stream 1.0 as an integral part of its endeavors to diversify and expand cloud portfolio.Operating margin declined 250 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 21.5%. Operating profit includes stock-based compensation but excludes one-time items.The decline in operating margin was due to higher research and development expense (up 90 bps), general and administrative expense (up 50 bps) and lower gross profit (down 220 bps).Non-GAAP net income (including stock based compensation but excluding all one-time items) was $264.7 million or 61 cents per share compared with $278.9 million or 64 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Net margin declined 410 bps on a year-over-year basis to 17.5%.In an effort to expand and diversify its cloud service offerings, VMware recently acquired CloudVolumes, which is a leading provider of real-time application delivery technology.During the quarter, the company entered into a joint venture with the likes of Docker, Google and Pivotal to enable enterprises to run and manage container-based applications on a common platform.Moreover, the quarter also witnessed VMware's strategic partnerships with Arista Networks, 5F and Hewlett-Packard (  ) as well as a technology and global reseller agreement with Dell to deliver NSX solutions worldwide.Additionally, VMware's End-user Computing Group recently announced key strategic partnerships with the likes of H-P, Google, NVIDIA and SAP.VMware exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of $7.10 billion compared with $6.64 billion in the previous quarter. Cash from operations was $606 million while free cash flow was $506 million in the third quarter.During the quarter, VMware repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares for around $43 million at an average price of $99 per share.For 2014, VMware forecasts revenues to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.04 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.02 billion (at the mid-point of the company guided range). Excluding Pivotal and Divestitures, the company expects the mid-point of its 2014 total revenue growth to be approximately 17%.License revenues for 2014 are expected to be in the range of $2.58 billion to $2.60 billion. Excluding Pivotal and divestitures but including AirWatch, license growth rate is expected to be 14%.For 2014, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 31% while GAAP operating margin is expected to range between 16% and 18%. Management expects the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 0-1 percentage point higher than the non-GAAP tax rate of 18.5%. The company expects to continue its share buyback program in 2014.Further, management believes that by the end of 2014 VMware operated clouds will be available in over 75% of the world's cloud market.For the fourth quarter of 2014, management expects revenues to be in the range of $1.67 billion to $1.71 billion (up 13% to 15% year over year).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.70 billion. License revenues for the fourth quarter are expected to be $765 million to $785 million (up 11% to 14% year over year).Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be within the range of 33% to 34% while GAAP operating margin is expected to range between 18% and 22%. Moreover, management also expects to continue its share buyback program in the fourth quarter of 2014.We believe that VMware's strong product portfolio is a major positive. The company continues to win contracts. Robust international sales will continue to boost the top line, going forward. The acquisitions of CloudVolumes, Desktone and AirWatch will also add to the top line, going forward.We further believe that the numerous strategic partnerships and accretive acquisitions that the company is entering into will provide a significant boost to its top line going forward.However, a sluggish IT spending environment and intensifying competition from its peers such as Microsoft Corp. (  ), Hewlett-Packard and Citrix (  ) are primary headwinds for VMware. Moreover, VMware's continued investments in the emerging markets, product innovations and acquisitions are expected to weigh on margins in the near term.Currently, VMware has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Moroever, in all of the past four quarters, the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings beat of 25.88%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe the global trend toward virtualization and cloud computing will facilitate Citrix to retain its momentum in the long term. Moreover, both its XenMobile and XenApps are gaining significant market traction in the highly lucrative enterprise mobility segment and Windows app virtualization space.In the last reported second quarter of 2014, the company achieved revenue growth in all its segments. Presently, even outside the U.S., it continues to experience strong revenue expansion. As a result, the company expects revenues to increase in the range of $765-$775 million in the third quarter of 2014. Meanwhile, revenue growth for full-year 2014 is estimated at 8.5% to 10%.Citrix provides software and equipment for streamlining business computer systems. The demand for its products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for business-related computer appliances and software. Fluctuations in the demand for these products and services could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Citrix Systems is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. : Citrix Systems has an earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are poised at 51 cents. : Citrix Systems has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which increases the predictive power of ESP; however, when combined with an ESP of 0.00%, it makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies in the Business Software & Services industry that investors can consider, as, according to our model, they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

Additionally, the company refreshed its line-up of Kindle Fire tablets.These new e-readers are Amazon's 7 th generation of Kindle, which come with hardware improvements and new features designed for book lovers. Both the devices have a long battery life, an improved page-turning experience and latest features including Kindle FreeTime, Smart Lookup and Goodreads, helping readers to freely search and share books. The devices have an X-Ray feature, similar to Kindle Paperwhite, which provides useful insight into books.On the hardware front, Kindle Voyage is very light and only 7.6 mm thin, weighing less than 6.4 ounces. The device will use a new Paperwhite display allowing readers to adjust the brightness according to the surrounding light. Additionally, the new e-book reader will have free 3G connectivity, helping users to save money on Wi-Fi.$79 Kindle, an improved version of basic Kindle e-reader, will now include a touch screen, 20% faster processor and twice the storage capacity. However, the model has been priced 15% more than the current basic model. Both the $79 Kindle and Kindle Voyage, with a price tag of $199, are already available for pre-order.Amazon's new Kindle Fire HD (high definition) tablets are available in two screen sizes - 6-inch, with a price tag of $99, and 7-inch, priced at $139 onwards, down from $154.Additionally, Amazon upgraded its Kindle Fire HDX, which now includes a quad-core 2.5 GHz processor, 8.9-inch display, better sound and faster processor. It also includes WPS Office app, helping users to create and edit documents on the tablet. The app is integrated with Amazon's Cloud Drive, which will back up documents on Amazon's servers.Amazon also added a kid-friendly Kindle HD tablet to its line-up. The 6-inch version of Kindle HD will be available for $149 and a 7-inch screen for $189. Both the devices come with a two-year warranty and one year of Amazon's FreeTime Unlimited. The Fire HD Kids Edition also disables in-app purchases as Amazon is in the midst of a dispute with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over allegations that it has unlawfully billed parents for unauthorized in-app purchases without their consent.Amazon expects the shipments of the new devices to start in October, a crucial time as the holiday shopping season will set in. However, Amazon's new devices will face competition from a variety of tablets and smartphones, including Apple's (  ) new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus - the current dominant player in the tablet segment.Amazon's constant upgrading of its e-book reader is surely benefiting for customers. However, while Amazon may have the best e-reader, Apple certainly has the best tablet. Despite the fact that Kindle has acquired many new features over the years, it is not a full-blown tablet yet. Therefore, given that the tablet market is far larger than the e-reader market, Amazon's Kindle is unlikely to catch up with Apple's iPad any time soon.Currently, Amazon's shares hold a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

(Symbol: CTXS), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of FleetCor Technologies Inc (Symbol: FLT), the market cap is now $11.83B, versus Citrix Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CTXS) at $11.78B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FLT vs. CTXS:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FLT and CTXS collectively make up 1.60% of the iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF (  ) which is lower by about 0.6% on the day Friday.At the closing bell, FLT is down about 1.7%, while CTXS is down about 1.4% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n Oct 10, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  (  ), a leading provider of virtualization, networking and cloud computing solutions in the U.S. Citrix is concentrating on three broad markets: Desktop virtualization, Cloud Infrastructure and networking, and Collaboration and sharing. As desktop virtualization has become a top priority for any IT set-up, Citrix is continuously introducing innovative products that will facilitate business flexibility, security and centralized management system.We believe the global trend toward virtualization and cloud computing will facilitate Citrix to retain its momentum in the long term. Moreover, both its XenMobile and XenApps are gaining significant market traction in the highly lucrative enterprise mobility segment and Windows app virtualization.Last month, Citrix Systems launched an innovative app called ShareConnect, which will provide unique desktop-like facilities to iPads and Android-based tablets. Using ShareConnect will make work easier for users who are on the move for the greater part of the day. Through this app, they will be able to access important business applications, files and networks even when they are out of office.

Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expense.Following the earnings release, share price was down 4.6% in after-hours trading due to weaker-than-expected revenue guidance and lower sales in its digital media business, which includes the Creative Cloud software suite.Adobe reported revenues of $1.005 billion, down 5.9% sequentially but up 1% year over year. Reported revenues were within management's guided range of $975 million to $1.025 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.016 billion.Products generated 34.7% of Adobe's revenues but were down 40% year over year. Subscription comprised 54.4% of total revenue, up 82.9% year over year while Services & Support brought in the balance, down 4.1% year over year. , Adobe's largest segment, generated 61.8% of the revenues in the quarter. Segment revenues declined 10.3% sequentially to $621.0 million. The decrease was due to the removal of perpetual licensing from the channel in the Creative Cloud software suite.The two major revenue earners within the segment were the Creative family of products and Document Services products. In the Creative business, Creative Cloud subscriptions continued to accelerate. The company ended the third quarter with approximately 2.81 million paid Creative Cloud subscriptions, a sequential increase of 502K.The conversion of enterprise customers to Enterprise Term License Agreements or ETLAs which led to increased adoption of its enterprise Creative Cloud offering through ETLAs. ETLAs for enterprise customers are term-based and allow customers to access ongoing technology updates and represent the first phase of migrating enterprise customers to Creative Cloud.The increased subscription, ETLA adoption and digital publishing suite adoption helped drive Creative annualized recurring revenues or ARR to $1.40 billion, up $209 million sequentially.Management is quite optimistic about Creative Cloud adoption and expects to build a healthy pipeline for potential Creative Cloud paid subscribers through marketing programs, trial downloads and free memberships. The company's Photoshop Lightroom offering, which was re-branded as the Creative Cloud Photography Program in June, helps Adobe acquire new customers as well as convert those who originally licensed Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom.In the Document Services business (includes Acrobat family and the new cloud-based services such as EchoSign), revenues were $208.0 million, up 6.1% sequentially. The segment performed well driven by continued Acrobat adoption in enterprise as well as continued momentum in EchoSign and other related Acrobat cloud services. Also, the company closed several large contracts during the quarter. ARR in Document Services business grew to $217 million, up 18.5% sequentially.The  segment accounted for 33.5% of total second-quarter revenue. Within the segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud revenues were up 2.5% sequentially to $290.0 million. The growth is being driven by increase in the size of transactions, number of solutions per customer, international expansion and growth in partner-driven business. Bookings also increased year over year in this segment.LiveCycle and Connect businesses generated revenues of $47.0 million in the reported quarter, flat sequentially. revenues were $47.0 million in the last quarter, up 2.2% sequentially.Reported gross margin for the quarter was 84.3%, down 90 basis points from 85.2% in the comparable year-ago quarter. The gross margin is typical of a software company and variations are generally related to the mix of revenues between categories.Adobe incurred operating expenses of $773.5 million, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter's $737.7 million. As a percentage of sales, research & development expenses, general & administrative as well as sales & marketing expenses increased from the year-ago quarter. As a result, operating margin decreased to 7.4% from 11.1% in the year-ago quarter.On a GAAP basis, Adobe recorded net income of $44.7 million (9 cents per share) compared with $83.0 million (16 cents) in the year-ago quarter.On a pro-forma basis, Adobe generated net income of $707.9 million compared with $106.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Pro-forma earnings came in at 14 cents per share compared with 2 cents in the year-ago quarter.Adobe ended the quarter with cash and investments balance of $3.52 billion versus $3.33 billion in the previous quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSO) were 48 days, flat year over year, and up from 45 days in the last quarter. Deferred revenues increased $68.5 million to $947.6 million.In the third quarter, cash generated from operations was $268.5 million and capital expenditure was $55.0 million. Additionally, the company repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $133.0 million.For the fourth quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $1.025 to $1.075 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to be $1.085 billion, higher than the guided range. Additionally, management expects total Digital Media to increase sequentially. Management also expects Creative ARR and Document Services ARR to grow sequentially.In Digital Marketing segment, management expects Adobe Marketing Cloud revenues to increase slightly year over year but LiveCycle and Connect revenues to decline sequentially. Print and Publishing revenues are expected to be relatively flat sequentially.Accordingly, based on a share count of 508-510 million, GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 5-11 cents per share, while non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 26-32 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 14 cents, well below the guided range.Also, for the third quarter, non-operating expense is expected within the $12-$14 million range and tax rate is expected to be within 28-29% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.Adobe reported decent third-quarter results with earnings surpassing our expectations but the top line missing the same.Though the transition to web-based subscription for Adobe's Creative Suite 6 from traditional box licenses could impact its near-term revenues, it will attract more predictable recurring revenues, going forward. We remain positive about Adobe's market position, its compelling product lines (including CS cloud initiative and digital media products), continued innovation and strong balance sheet.Also, we believe solid adoption of Adobe marketing cloud could serve as a potential catalyst, going forward. Adobe's acquisition of Neolane will further enhance its Adobe Marketing Cloud by integrating online and offline marketing data and accelerating its entry into social media advertising.Currently, Adobe has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It is a \"fabless\" chipmaker, meaning it designs the computer chips but outsources the manufacturing to third parties.The semiconductor company is probably best known for its core embedded chips and encrypting security processor chips. Its biggest customer isCisco Systems (  ), which accounted for 19% of sales last year.Cavium has also scored design wins with numerous other leading lights of the tech world, includingIBM (  ),Citrix Systems (  ),Qualcomm (  ),Netgear (NTGR) andJuniper Networks (JNPR).Now Cavium is eyeing a bigger share of the market for data-center infrastructure, which includes servers, storage, networking, security and virtualization equipment.Increased spending on this kind of gear has been driven by an alphabet soup of 21st-century tech trends, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).To better harness these technologies, and stay current with the general shift to cloud-based and next-generation data centers, customers need a higher grade of system-on-a-chip solutions.Cavium figures it has the answer with its new line of ThunderX server processors, which are designed for computers operating as cloud-based servers and data-center appliances.On June 3, the firm introduced the ThunderX processors, which are based on 64-bit processing technology fromARM Holdings (ARMH).ThunderX is the fifth generation of multicore processors from Cavium targeting high-performance volume servers and appliances for large data centers and cloud infrastructure, the company said in a press release. Cavium did not respond to requests for comment.In a report, Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsay said Cavium's portfolio of embedded and security processor products is \"sufficient to sustain strong recent top-line growth.\"But the ThunderX lineup adds a new dimension to the company's growth prospects, Ramsay said, because it \"both expands Cavium's total addressable market and positions the company for strong long-term growth.\"Wall Street seemed happy enough with the ThunderX announcement. Cavium's stock price rose 6% over a two-session period following the announcement. Shares continued to push higher over the next couple of weeks -- hitting a record high of 53.31 on June 16. However, Cavium shares have since fallen and currently trade near 45. Other stocks in the fabless semiconductor group have also retreated in recent days.JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reckons ThunderX could add $200 million to $400 million in incremental revenue over the next three to five years for Cavium.\"Although a meaningful revenue contribution is expected in the second half of 2015, we believe the company could start to generate initial revenues as early as the first half of 2015, as several of Cavium's lead customers have already started to develop applications around ThunderX,\" Har said.ThunderX's potential should help Cavium maintain its recent momentum in terms of revenue and earnings growth, analysts say.The company has delivered five straight quarters of double-digit sales gains. That streak ended a run of four straight quarters of declines amid a slump in the chip market.Cavium has also produced six straight quarters of double-digit or better EPS growth.\"Revenue drivers for 2014 include demand from wireless infrastructure, cloud data center and security markets,\" said Imperial Capital analyst Ashok Kumar, who initiated coverage on Cavium three weeks ago.During the first quarter, Cavium posted earnings of 30 cents a share, up from 19 cents the prior year and 2 cents above consensus estimates. Revenue rose 20% to $83.2 million, also topping views.Cavium is due to report Q2 results on Wednesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 33 cents, up 43% from a year earlier. Revenue is seen rising 21% to $90 million.Full-year earnings are expected to climb 39% in 2014 and an additional 28% in 2015.\"Over the next few years, we continue to see a runway of double-digit top- and bottom-line growth as the company fires on several new product-cycle ramps,\" Har said.Cavium's recent growth is partly attributable to a rebound in the global chip market.Earlier this month, the Semiconductor Industry Association said worldwide sales of semiconductors reached $26.86 billion in May, the most recent month data are available. That was up 8.8% from the previous year and 2% from the previous month.The global semiconductor market posted \"healthy\" growth throughout all geographic regions in May, led by continued strength in the Americas, said Brian Toohey, president and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association.\"Overall, the  has posted growth each month for over a year, and sales are expected to increase for the foreseeable future,\" Toohey said.That bodes well for Cavium, which does a pretty good job of spreading its business around.In 2013, about 30% of its revenue came from the U.S. China ranked second at 26% of the total, followed by Korea (10%), Taiwan (9%), Mexico (7%), Finland (6%) and Malaysia (5%). The remaining 7% was scattered among other countries.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) has come up with an innovative app called ShareConnect, which will provide unique desktop-like facilities to iPads and Android-based tablets.Using ShareConnect will make work easier for users who are on the go for the greater part of the day.

A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in SREV.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 1 estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions.

With its next announcement coming up later this month, now's a great time to revisit what Citrix has told investors to expect going forward. Here are five things that Citrix CFO David Henshall said during the company's most recent conference call:First, though Citrix's Mobile & Desktop business grew just 4% to $396 million last quarter, Henshall assured investors that the company's mobile solutions are thriving. He cited Citrix's XenMobile solution as a main catalyst which \"continue[s] to set the bar in the enterprise mobility market with [mobile device management], mobile productivity apps, and virtual apps and data in a unified, secure solution [...].\" Henshall elaborated on the stickiness of XenMobile, saying:Mobile solutions might still represent a small slice of Citrix's overall business, but if it can continue growing the segment at anywhere near its current pace, it shouldn't be long before it materially boosts results.But as Henshall began to detail Citrix's guidance -- which included steady expectations for revenue growth of 8.5% to 10%, and increased adjusted earnings per share of between $3.20 and $3.25 -- he also reminded investors mobile wasn't their only catalyst when he said, \"We expect to see the strongest forward growth coming from our networking, mobile platforms, and data sharing businesses.\"Networking & Cloud revenue jumped 9% to $179 million last quarter, driven primarily by Citrix's NetScaler products. Meanwhile, Citrix's software-as-a-service business grew 12% to $161 million. That included 60% growth in ShareFile sales, which now comprise around 9% of Citrix's overall SaaS mix. Henshall didn't elaborate on specific numbers, but it's certainly great for investors that these segments are expected to continue chugging along.However, noting networking in particular is a lower-margin business for now, Henshall also says this growth has come at a cost of a \"500 basis point decline over the last few years as we've been ramping up networking and SaaS [...] very aggressively.\" That included a 130 year-over-year basis point decline in gross margin to 85% last quarter.On one hand, then, as networking and SaaS grow to represent a greater mix of Citrix's overall business, gross margin will inevitably continue to decline over the near-term. On the other hand, those declines are expected to plateau in the second half of this year and level off as Citrix moves into 2015.In the meantime, Citrix certainly isn't sitting on its hands. Early in the call, Henshall said \"We're also taking direct actions to improve operating efficiencies. [...] This includes refinements to the portfolio, real estate, delayering and others, initiatives that will continue into the second half.\"In Q2, for example, Citrix's operating expenses declined about 130 basis points, thanks mostly to a modest 200-point decline in sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue to 39%.Better yet, Henshall says, once Citrix's networking-related gross margin declines abate, \"that stops becoming a headwind to all the activities that we've been driving to just improve efficiencies.\" When that happens, those efficiencies should finally start translating to Citrix's bottom line.Finally, touching on the massive share repurchase plan announced  , Henshell stated [emphasis mine]:In the upcoming quarter, investors should keep an eye on whether Citrix puts that remaining $400 million to work to retire even more shares. Considering both Henshell's \"programmatic\" verbiage and the fact that Citrix doesn't pay a quarterly dividend, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the company does so, and/or authorizes another expanded share repurchase in the coming quarter.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"...

So far the main thrust of the communications service providers has been on developing advanced hardware, which would enable them to attain enhanced speed, scalability and reliability.However, recent developments suggest that operators are gradually shifting focus from a hardware-centric growth model to an IT/software centric one. The primary reason behind this shift is the significant growth of cloud-based virtual networking.Massive growth of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) encouraged newly emerging digital media companies to invest heavily in the communications infrastructure market. SDN facilitates customers enjoy increased bandwidth utilization, higher reliability and reduced capital spending.NFV is designed to consolidate and deliver the networking components needed to support a fully virtualized infrastructure, including virtual servers, storage and other networks. It utilizes standard IT virtualization technologies.According to a recent research report of IDC, the global SDN market size is likely to reach $8 billion by 2018 compared with $960 million in 2014. Using SDN, data centers and enterprise networks can enjoy automated network provisioning, network virtualization and network programmability to bring efficiency and agility of the network.As the internal dynamics of telecom vendor market is shifting towards a software-centric approach, the traditional large network hardware developers are facing severe competitive threat. On the other hand, IT/software telecom vendors like VMWare Inc. (  ), Citrix Systems Inc. (  ), Juniper Networks Inc. (  ), Ciena Corp. (  ) and ConteXtream are expected to gain from the new trend.Large business enterprises generally have operations throughout the world. A strong and robust wireless network is essential for these companies to maintain connections with remote sites.Thus, cloud-managed infrastructure has become indispensable for these large business houses as it offers several advantages like central manageability, smaller physical footprint and linear scalability.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Also, the company reported strong first-quarter 2014 financial results with both the top and the bottom line outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The desktop virtualization market is expected to accelerate in the near future. Currently, server virtualization has an addressable market size of approximately 35 million servers worldwide whereas desktop virtualization has the potential to impact more than 600 million desktop users in corporate environments alone.Citrix is continuously introducing innovative products that will facilitate business flexibility, security and centralized management system. In order to counter installation difficulties, Citrix has launched XenDesktop 7.5 suites. XenDesktop 7.5 is a cloud-ready platform that allows easy access of Windows apps and desktops from any console. At present, it is one of the most popular products with 360,000 users and has witnessed 50% year-over-year growth in demand. Moreover, an aggressive sales force for the XenMobile business has already created a $300 million pipeline for 2014.With Cloud.com in its kitty, Citrix is now comfortably placed on par with the cloud computing software leader, VMware. Citrix has also become a strong competitor for  's (  ) web services software and  's (  ) Windows Azure software. Separately, Citrix has teamed up with VMware to install NetScaler programs in networks allowing cloud administrators to incorporate program-based NetScaler services into application-based datacenters built on the latter's virtualization platform. Furthermore, various industry researchers estimate that the global web conferencing market size may exceed $4 billion by 2014.Citrix Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Notably, the acquisition of Desktone by VMware will enable the company to offer DaaS through its Cloud Hybrid Service. Moreover, Citrix's desktop platform faces competition from VMware's View product and Oracle's broad virtualization stack. Furthermore, as the company forays into different markets, it will be exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risks.Citrix provides software and equipment for streamlining business computer systems. The demand for its products and services significantly depends on the general demand for business-related computer appliances and software. Fluctuations in the demand for these products and services could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition.The global economy is still suffering from fluctuation and has not come out of the woods completely. Various geo-political concerns in the European and African countries have limited the momentum of economic recovery. This could make Citrix's near-term financials volatile. Any adverse macroeconomic situation may result in the slowdown of enterprise IT spending. Hence, the desktop virtualization market may turn out to be less booming and Citrix may lose its market share sooner than expected.During the reported quarter, geographically, total net revenue fell 4.4% from the past quarter. At present, Citrix is facing two main problems, namely the continuation of global macroeconomic headwinds limiting the momentum of new license sales and secondly, the rising demand for tablets instead of PCs or notebooks. As per Gartner Research firm, sale of Pcs is expected to decline in the coming years and will lag behind tablet sales by the end of 2015.For the current quarter, in the past 90 days, there has been downward movement in the earnings estimates.

So far the main thrust of the communications service providers was on developing advanced hardware, which would enable them to attain enhanced speed, scalability and reliability.However, recent developments suggest that operators are gradually shifting focus from a hardware centric growth model to an IT/software centric one. The primary reason behind this shift is the significant growth of cloud-based virtual networking.Massive growth of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) encouraged newly emerging digital media companies to invest heavily in the communications infrastructure market. SDN facilitates customers enjoy increased bandwidth utilization, higher reliability and reduced capital spending.NFV is designed to consolidate and deliver the networking components needed to support a fully virtualized infrastructure - including virtual servers, storage and other networks. It utilizes standard IT virtualization technologies.According to a recent research report of IDC, the global SDN market size is likely to reach $8 billion mark by 2018 compared with $960 million in 2014. Using SDN, data centers and enterprise networks can enjoy automated network provisioning, network virtualization and network programmability to bring efficiency and agility of the network.As the internal dynamics of telecom vendor market is shifting towards software centric approach, the traditional large network hardware developers are facing severe competitive threat. On the other hand, IT/software telecom vendors like VMWare Inc. (  ), Citrix Systems Inc. (  ), Juniper Networks Inc. (  ), Ciena Corp. (  ) and ConteXtreme are expected to gain from the new trend.Large business enterprises generally have operations throughout the world.

The company cited a report from an independent investigation to defend itself against the allegations of Muddy waters. Shares of NQ Mobile were up 6.8% (28 cents) following the investigation.This investigation was conducted by a Special Committee comprising four of its independent directors along with two renowned firms, Shearman & Sterling LLP and Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Limited. The aim of the investigation was to determine whether NQ Mobile had resorted to any unfair means or not.The results of the aforesaid investigation were revealed to the public soon after it was over. Per the investigation, NQ Mobile had submitted all material information within the stipulated timeframe as well as in full compliance with all Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. Hence, the Committee concluded that no fraudulent practice had been adopted by NQ Mobile.Muddy Waters, LLC is a pioneer in the field of . It conducts research on business fraud, accounting fraud and other fundamental problems. It also engages in short selling activities.In Oct 2013, Muddy Waters had accused NQ Mobile of being a \"massive fraud\" with at least 72.0% of its 2012 China security revenue fictitiously coming from a shell company called Yidatong, which was actually owned by NQ itself.Moreover, NQ's Antivirus 7.0 was termed to be spyware by the  firm. Additionally, Muddy Waters had accused the company of flaunting an inflated cash balances just to gain the confidence of investors. Following this report, NQ Mobile had almost faced a share trading blackout and even threatened to sue Muddy Waters.On Jul 7, 2014 Muddy Waters again issued a report in which alongwith the prior charges; it also accused NQ Mobile of concealing important information from public including the stepping down of the head of the company's audit committee, Ying Han due to personal issues not related to NQ Mobile in any way.NQ Mobile responded to these accusations by conducting the aforementioned investigation. We believe that the results of the investigation are a major positive for NQ Mobile as it will help the company to regain the confidence of its shareholders, going forward.NQ Mobile reported mixed fourth-quarter results. The company's better-than-expected user growth in FL Mobile's gaming platform and new game launches remain the growth catalysts. The company's associations with Sprint and Samsung are positives.However, the company's margins are adversely impacted by higher expenses and higher contribution of low-margin businesses.

I happen to believe it is, and here's why.There are a few great anecdotes around that capture the real scale and scope of the explosion in information and data generated by business worldwide. Now saddled with the simplistic yet succinct \"Big Data\" tag, that label already appears understated.But the best anecdote, to convey in a one sound bite what is happening in the world of Big Data, is this one from Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google: .Now, think of it in terms of one of the latest buzzwords in enterprise computing, 'BYOD', which stands for 'Bring your own device'. In other words, enterprises have learned that both productivity and employee satisfaction are dramatically enhanced when they can conduct their tasks on their preferred devices. At the same time, employees are demanding access to applications and cloud-based data sources on those devices.Source: Cormark Securities, IDCSource: Cormark Securities, IDCSource: Cormark Securities, IDCIn understanding the value proposition for investors arising from the combination of Overland with Sphere 3D and its already completed acquisition of V3 Systems, the thesis is simple: The whole is worth more than the sum of the parts. A lot more.First, let's look at what put Sphere 3D Corp. on the map: it's called  , and it does one thing, but does it better than everything else out there, including its mega-cap competitors. Glassware 2.0 allows you to extend the life of software indefinitely by making software available to any device regardless of its operating system. For simplicity's sake, imagine being able to access virtual versions of any application, from mainframes to windows 8 on your iPad, with near-identical performance and minimal latency, as if you had it installed on your iPad.The company's software achieves this without straining the capacity of the network through resource hungry virtualization code or virtual machine architecture, as is the traditional standard in this space:Source: SelfSource: Jacob SecuritiesFor consumers, it's not a huge deal. But for enterprises and institutions who have distributed networks around the world, with members running every conceivable combination of smart devices, laptops and workstations, the challenges of providing uniformly configured software apps with secure and fast connections to data sets stored in the Cloud is daunting to say the least. And, up until now, very expensive.Citrix and VMware are analogous to Sphere 3D, whereas EMC, the largest information storage provider in the world, is analogous to Overland Storage; in addition Sphere 3D acquired V3 Systems Inc., which is poised to give California darling and  start up Nutanix a run for its money.Citrix is notoriously onerous and complex to deploy and administer across enterprise IT infrastructure, and has a limitations that prevent it from scaling linearly, often requiring replication of both hardware and software iterations across the same organization when confronted with differentiated core tasks.Unfortunately, Citrix and even VMware have a problem with virtualizing the more complex and mission critical applications. An article in  : \"traditional virtualization technologies are great for handling commodity work, but they are fundamentally unsuited for applications that organizations depend on to run their most important, sensitive, business-critical processes - such as those that drive customer relationships, financial transactions and supply chains - or mission-critical applications.\"VMware is the 900 pound gorilla in virtualization software and increasingly, in hardware, and is majority owned by EMC Corporation. That combination makes the utmost sense once you understand that the vast majority of enterprise data is stored on server farms that are best accessed via virtualized software programs converged on a 'hypervisor' single interface for users.In fact, to really understand the differences and similarities among VMware and EMC Corp. on the one hand, and Sphere 3D, V3 Systems and Overland Storage on the other, you really needn't look further than the evolutionary history of the former two. Both started as independent entities pursuing their individual destinies, who, when combined with the purchase of struggling VMware by cashed up yet stagnating EMC, found their combined offering an irresistible and profound game changer in the Information Technology as a Service (ITaaS) sector. It was this converged solution that suddenly gave enterprises a more economic approach to storing reams of data that needed to be accessed and modified remotely by a distributed workforce around the world.Think of it as mp3s finally making it into the mainstream and replacing CDs once it was available on devices like the iPod. Software drove the hardware sales which drove software market penetration.Of course, VMware's product offering and EMC's storage offerings have greater breadth than anything Sphere 3D can offer (yet); however, when the acquisition of Overland Storage is complete, expected to occur by the end of August 2014, the gap will begin to narrow. The combination of Sphere 3D and Overland Storage represents exactly the same combination that was the seed that grew VMware and EMC into 50 billion dollar enterprises with sales in the billions each year.Source: Sphere 3D MD&AV3 Systems was acquired by Sphere 3D in March of 2014 for just under $10 million. The thing about V3 Systems that Sphere 3D needed was its leadership and talent in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure architecture and a proven delivery mechanism for their Glassware 2.0 software. In other words, the appliance that can come pre-installed with either Glassware 2.0 or any other virtualization software or both.The company was founded by Peter Bookman, who now serves as Sphere 3D's Head of Global Strategy.According to  announcing the acquisition in February 2014:So V3 Systems provides a key component that allows Sphere 3D to control their future architecture both form a hardware and software perspective, unlike VMware's reliance on Nutanix and recent  with them as a partner.Overland Storage has a long and really quite interesting history itself. It got started back in 1980 as Overland Data in San Diego, California, and built a business focused on the storage of data on tape drives. Through acquisition and its own product development, the company became one of the largest tape Storage Vendors in the world.In fact, Overland continues to win awards, even recently having  with its NEO 8000e Tape Library and its Tandberg Data Storage Library T40+ honored as a runner-up in the competition; it was also nominated in numerous disk storage categories.People in the Enterprise IT universe tend to view tape storage as primitive, but there are thousands of companies who have critical data stored over decades on tape and for whom it is cost-prohibitive to update.According to IDC, \"worldwide data growth will reach the unfathomable amount of 40,000 exabytes by 2020 -- or approximately 5,247 gigabytes of data per human on the planet. Furthermore, according to the DatacentreDynamics 2012 Global Census, the worldwide data center energy requirements to store and process this accumulating data grew 63%, in just one year, to reach 38GW in 2012, or roughly the equivalent of 30 nuclear power plants.\"So, despite the fact that most of the IT universe has been moving first to disk-based, and now increasingly to cloud-based storage (which is still disk-based storage accessed through the internet), Overland has been continuing to expand making serious advances in tape storage, including their patented Virtual Tape Library products, while simultaneously advancing its own brand of disk storage infrastructure appliances -  and  .As stated on the company's web site, On a recent investor conference call to explain Sphere 3D's interest in Overland Storage, Sphere 3D CEO Peter Tassiopoulos stated:So perhaps now it is a little bit clearer as to why Sphere 3D's shares have soared by  . If you look at each of the parts, they don't individually constitute any tremendous value. But when you look at what the combined service offering entails, and the partnerships now in place, the value proposition becomes quite apparent.In addition, it's possible the appreciation here is more an indication of a legitimate resurgence of the tech sector and the increased attention given to the space as a result of rotation out of declining sectors, such as resources, rather than complete acknowledgement of Sphere 3D's financial prospects.It's simply too soon to project the numbers or even try to forecast what the future revenue picture is going to look like for the combined entity, and doing so prior to the closing of the Overland acquisition would be premature.Early stage tech companies don't lend themselves to traditional valuation methods. There are typically no revenues (and only negative cash flows), and visibility into real revenue tends to be murky until the first commercialization effort pans out and is observable.As Sphere 3D's revenue model becomes more apparent, and the company transitions to being revenue positive over the next couple of quarters, forward EV/Sales multiples should expand, providing further lift to shares and investor confidence in Sphere 3D's outlook.In the press release announcing the definitive merger agreement with Overland, the following statement appeared:Sphere 3D, for its part, is anticipated to begin reporting significant revenue this quarter, and so at this point, it is impractical to try and value the company via its financials. It recently closed a $10 million bought-deal financing, so is sufficiently capitalized for the near term. - Sphere 3D needs to commercially capitalize on its first mover advantage in next gen virtualization with Glassware 2.0, and has a limited window of opportunity to do so. Should the company's channel partners fail to achieve sales traction, companies with competitive offerings to Glassware could capture the market position sought after by Sphere 3D - As an early stage venture, Sphere 3D will have ongoing working capital and research and development funding needs in excess of the cash it generates from operations. The company's ability to continue its growth is predicated on its continued success in raising capital. - Companies currently operating in the virtualization space have achieved considerable customer penetration selling \"traditional\" virtualization solutions (as referenced from above). The customers of these companies may been unwilling to switch to an alternative solution, such as Sphere 3D, meanwhile their vendors will likely attempt to transition to the same type of technology Sphere 3D has developed. Should Sphere 3D and its partners fail to maximize their first mover advantage and grab market share for their next gen offering, results and share price would be adversely affected.It will take a significant amount of capital to fully deploy such an ambitious business plan, but Sphere 3D has a few things going for it in that regard. First of all, with only 23 million shares outstanding, the company has an incredibly tight structure that will enable it to raise substantial amounts of capital on terms that will not prove excessively dilutive to current shareholders.Secondly, the company is the beneficiary of an incredible amount of industry press, because the bloggers and tweeters and posters in the technology world are all abuzz with the idea that Glassware could displace VMware and Citrix, and the combined company could take a big bite out of EMC with its superior data virtualization offering.Third, this is a company whose meteoric rise thus far shows no sign of abating. And with the commencement of trading on NASDAQ this week, U.S. institutional investors will be able to start buying Sphere 3D. That's when the real fireworks could begin.Source: StockWatchGetting onto the NASDAQ allows ANY shares greater liquidity, and allows a lot of U.S. funds which may not have had the mandate to invest in Canadian-listed or Over-the-Counter stocks to now invest. And likewise for retail investors hesitant of the same issues. As the story continues to develop, there is major risk for a short squeeze at  time (yes, pun intended). So whether you are long or short, some has got to give here.Overall, this virtualization software company has had an incredible stock market run, and some investors are sitting on very large returns; however, there has been a lot of new and interesting developments in recent months suggesting there is still a long way to go for this stock.I like the technology, now it's up to management to continue to execute. The Overland-Sphere merger should close in the next couple weeks, and Q2 financials are due out before the end of August. I'll primarily be looking for revenue inflection which will mean that users are adopting the platform and we could have a serious new contender in the space.Given its current market capitalization, Sphere 3D is the best offering out there to rapidly rise to the top of the proverbial pile of storage and virtualization converged products available for enterprise.

Moreover, the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters with an average beat of 13.6%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe that the shift in global trend toward virtualization and cloud computing will help Citrix maintain its favourable momentum over the coming quarters. Banking on these positives, the company raised its guidance for the second quarter as well as for fiscal 2014 on May 5, 2014.In the first quarter of 2014, the company had achieved revenue growth across all its segments. Even outside the U.S., it continues to maintain strong revenue expansion. As a result, Citrix expects revenues to remain in the range of $765-$775 million in the second quarter, with an increase of 8.5% to 10% for the full year.Citrix provides software and equipment for streamlining business computer systems. The demand for its products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for business-related computer appliances and software. Fluctuations in the demand for these products and services could lead to an adverse effect on the company's business, operational results and financials.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Citrix Systems is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. : The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are poised at 41 cents. : Citrix Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the Business Software & Services industry for investors to consider, that, according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with earnings ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Concur is a leading provider of integrated travel and expense management solutions. The Perfect Trip initiative that was started a couple of years back has been benefiting the company by increasing its distribution capacity and integrating the travel space. In the second quarter 2014, the company witnessed strong new customer growth across the segments.Concur's Perfect Trip initiative has been conceived to enhance and improve travel experience, especially for corporate travelers. As a part of this initiative, Concur has been investing in several companies in the travel industry with the aim to bring together all the elements for a perfect trip. For this the company has a well-defined software development methodology, which allows it to deliver products that satisfy the business needs and meets commercial quality expectations. This initiative is driven by the presence of an open platform - Travel & Expense (T&E) that makes the travel ecosystem more efficient and competitive. Recently, it announced that the Concur Perfect Trip Fund will be investing around $150 million in Table8 to roll out their novel restaurant reservations services on its T&E platform.The company has witnessed strong customer growth for the past few quarters. New customers included those from financial institutions, technological firms and oil field companies leading to brisk expansion of the company's total customer base.At present, the company has a remarkable base of over 23,000 customers. In this quarter itself, its customer base grew by more than 30%. In the last few months the company has added over 30 new partners for its Concur App Center. Some of the recent key new additions include VMware, Live Person, Boston University, Mitsui, the New York Yankees, Chevron, a large chemical manufacturer in Japan among others. Concur has also been providing travel expense management solutions for the U.S. government employees as per its E-Gov Travel Services 2 (ETS2) contract.The increasing acceptance of this initiative by Concur's customers, partners, developers, and suppliers across the globe reflects the immense potential of this novel concept.However, the company's financials have been affected by the increasing expenses in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, the company had reported a net loss of $56.0 million or 99 cents per share in the second quarter, wider than the loss of $7.6 million or 14 cents in the prior-year period. Further, its business is highly dependent on strategic relationships with third parties, which can limit the visibility into the company's future. Moreover, this business is prone to be negatively impacted by global economic volatility as it leads to reduced spending on travel as well as lesser travel and expense transactions.Concur currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Reported revenues were above management's guided range of $1.0 to $1.05 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 billion driven by higher subscription sales of creative cloud and Adobe marketing cloud suites.Products generated 44.9% of Adobe's revenues but were down 25.7% year over year. Subscription comprised 44.6% of total revenue, up 87.3% year over year while Services & Support brought in the balance, up 1.0% year over year. , Adobe's largest segment, generated 64.8% of the revenues in the quarter. Segment revenues were up 8.0% sequentially to $692.0 million.

The company ended the second quarter with approximately 2,308k paid subscriptions, an increase of 464K sequentially.As announced earlier, the company started to convert enterprise customers to Enterprise Term License Agreements or ETLAs, which led to increased adoption of its enterprise Creative Cloud offering through ETLAs. ETLAs for enterprise customers are term-based and allow customers to access ongoing technology updates and represent the first phase of migrating enterprise customers to Creative Cloud.The increased subscription, ETLA adoption and digital publishing suite adoption helped drive creative annualized recurring revenues or ARR to $1.2 billion, up $208 million sequentially.Management is quite optimistic about Creative Cloud adoption and expects to build a healthy pipeline for potential Creative Cloud paid subscribers through marketing programs, trial downloads and free memberships. The company also expanded its Photoshop Lightroom offering, which enabled it to acquire new customers as well as convert those who historically licensed Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom.In the Document Services business (includes Acrobat family and new cloud-based services such as EchoSign), revenues were $196.0 million, up 1.0% sequentially. The segment performed well driven by continued Acrobat adoption in enterprise as well as continued momentum in EchoSign and other related Acrobat cloud services.

The gross margin is typical of a software company and variations are generally related to the mix of revenues between categories.Adobe incurred operating expenses of $778.0 million, up 1.8% from the year-ago quarter's $764.0 million. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased, while general and administrative as well as sales and marketing expenses increased from the year-ago quarter. As a result, operating margin expanded to 12.7% from 11.0% in the year-ago quarter.On a GAAP basis, Adobe recorded net income of $88.5 million (17 cents per share) compared with $76.5 million (15 cents) in the year-ago quarter.On a pro-forma basis, Adobe generated net income of $114.9 million compared with $123.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Pro-forma earnings came in at 23 cents per share compared with 24 cents in the year-ago quarter.Adobe ended the quarter with cash and investments balance of $3.33 billion versus $3.13 billion in the previous quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSO) were 45 days versus 42 days in the year-ago quarter and 46 days in the last quarter. Deferred revenues increased $48.0 million to $879.1 million.In the second quarter, cash generated from operations was $368.0 million and capital expenditure was $27.2 million. Additionally, the company repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $166.0 million.For the third quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to be $1.021 billion, at the higher-end of the guided range. Additionally, management expects total  to decline sequentially.In  , management expects Adobe Marketing Cloud revenues to increase 20% year over year but LiveCycle and Connect revenues to decline sequentially.  revenues are expected to be relatively flat sequentially.Accordingly, based on a share count of 506-508 million, GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 2-8 cents per share, while non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 22-28 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expect non-GAAP earnings of 14 cents, well below the mid-point of the guided range.Also, for the third quarter, non-operating expense is expected within the $14-$16 million range and tax rate is expected to be within 26-28% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.Adobe reported strong second-quarter results with both earnings and revenues exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate.We remain positive about Adobe's market position, its compelling product lines (including CS cloud initiative and digital media products), continued innovation and strong balance sheet.Also, we believe solid adoption of the Creative Cloud and Adobe marketing cloud could serve as potential catalysts, going forward. Adobe's acquisition of Neolane will further enhance its Adobe Marketing Cloud by integrating online and offline marketing data and accelerating its entry into social media advertising.Currently, Adobe has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The platform will also provide coaches an insight into the errors made in the previous matches thereby allowing the players to better prepare for future matches. This innovative solution can create seven million data points with 10 players and three balls in just 10 minutes.

Unprecedented growth in high-speed mobile Internet traffic, chiefly for wireless data and video, has transformed the industry into the most evolving, inventive and keenly contested space. In addition, the emergence of wireless broadband technology has created several new service areas, which offer significant growth potential.According to a report by Infonetics Research, telecom operators globally generated approximately $2 trillion in revenues in 2013. This is a slight improvement from $1.9 trillion revenues recorded in 2012. Notably, the report also stated that telecom carriers are increasingly spending on network upgrades with the latest technologies. In 2013, carriers' expenditures rose 6% year over year and are expected to rise at a CAGR of 2% from 2013 to 2019, most likely to reach a significant $367 billion.While the telecom growth momentum is expected to be maintained in the U.S. over the near term, the major impetus is likely to come from the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil and Russia. Carrier expenditures have increased in Japan and even major telecom operators in Western Europe, the most economically vulnerable region, have raised their budgets.Currently, the U.S. telecommunications Industry is evolving around 5 broad factors. These include wireless gradually becoming the future of the telecom industry and the consequent popularity of spectrum. High-speed fiber-based network is projected to expand more aggressively, especially for video/TV offerings.In addition, consolidation within the industry will continue mainly due to shortage of airwaves and attainment of economies of scale. Innovative product launches are expected in areas of m-Commerce, virtualization and cloud-based technology, high-speed metro Ethernet, to name a few. Apart from these, there still remains ample scope for expansion in the U.S. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), nearly a fifth of rural American households lack broadband access.Despite the massive growth in fiber-to-the-home networks, we believe that wireless networks will boost growth in the telecom industry. The GSM Association's research wing, GMSA Intelligence, recently revealed its estimation of more than 1 billion global LTE connections by 2017. Currently, approximately 274 LTE networks are commercially available in 101 countries. More than 350 LTE networks will be commercially functional by the end of 2014. By 2017, the number is likely to reach nearly 465 LTE networks across 128 countries. At present, there are approximately 200.1 million LTE subscribers globally.GSMA Intelligence further reported that LTE users consume an average of 1.5GB data per month, twofold of what is consumed by non-LTE users. In the developing countries, LTE users can generate 20 times higher average revenue per user (ARPU) to carriers than non-LTE users, whereas in the developed countries, ARPU can be 10-40% higher for LTE users than non-LTE users. Apart from the terrestrial wireless network, the U.S. has an advanced satellite broadband network, mobile satellite radio systems and extensive WiFi networks.Research firm ABI Research recently reported that a significant boost for LTE network is expected to come from the Asia-Pacific region. In 2014, the Asia-Pacific region is likely to excel all other regions in the world with respect to LTE base-stations installation. LTE base-stations, which are popularly known as radio access networks (RAN), are expected to grow eight fold in the region this year. Also, wireless operators are projected to spend around $35 billion for RAN in 2014, globally, with Asia-Pacific accounting for the major share.The telecom infrastructure developer's market is witnessing a technical change globally. So far the main thrust of the communications service providers was on developing advanced hardware, which would enable them to attain enhanced speed, scalability and reliability. However, recent developments suggest that operators are gradually shifting focus from a hardware centric growth model to an IT/software centric business model. The primary reason behind this shift is the significant growth of cloud-based virtual networking.Growth of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) encouraged newly emerging digital media companies to invest heavily in the communications infrastructure market. SDN provides customers increased bandwidth utilization, higher reliability and reduced capital spending. NFV is designed to consolidate and deliver the networking components needed to support a fully virtualized infrastructure -- including virtual servers, storage and even other networks. It utilizes standard IT virtualization technologies.The U.S. telecom industry is likely to witness more mergers and acquisitions in 2014. Owing to the rising demand for scarce and valuable wireless spectrum, mergers and acquisitions have increased exponentially. While established players need more spectrums to gain competitiveness, small players prefer to collaborate with strong rivals rather than trying to establish a nationwide foothold, which is extremely capital intensive.Recently,  (  ) announced the largest acquisition proposal of the wireless industry. The company has decided to acquire the remaining 45% stake of Verizon Wireless Network from  (  ). Verizon currently holds the majority 55% of this venture. In Feb 2014, Comcast reached an agreement with  (  ) to acquire the latter in an all-stock deal valued at around $45.3 billion.Softbank of Japan recently acquired a 78% stake in  (  ) for $21.6 billion. Sprint is further eyeing  (  ) to acquire. Satellite TV operator  (  ) boasts has a lucrative portfolio of spectrums (an estimated value of $10 billion) and is looking for a suitable merger option to develop a nationwide wireless network.Severe spectrum crunch coupled with gradual smartphone adoption are compelling wireless operators to seek other options to raise revenues. Further, growing demand for technically superior products has been the silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment.The cloud-managed WiFi market has become a major growth driver for telecom operators as increasing number of large and mid-sized business enterprises are adopting this technology. According to a recent report by IDC, worldwide cloud-managed infrastructure and managed services revenues are estimated to reach $653 million in 2014 and might scale up to $2.5 billion by 2018.Large business enterprises generally have presence throughout the world. A strong and robust wireless network is essential for these companies to maintain connections with remote sites. Cloud-managed WiFi networks have become indispensable for these large business houses as they offer several advantages like central manageability, smaller physical footprint and linear scalability.The machine-to-machine (M2M) wireless communications technology has been significantly driving mobile data revenues for wireless service providers. M2M is a rapidly growing market opportunity. According to a report by research firm IDATE, the global M2M communications market is expected to generate revenues of over $53 billion in 2019, substantially up from $33 billion in 2013. Over the same timeframe, the number of M2M module deployment is predicted to rise from 175 million to 470 million.The global pay-TV market size may reach up to $270 billion by 2017. Similarly, for the cable TV operators, a new growth area is the small and medium sized business (SMB) segment. Currently, the market size of the U.S. Business Services segment is approximately $8 billion. Various industry researches estimate that the SMB segment is anticipated to offer a market opportunity worth $20 billion to $30 billion in the long term.Within the Zacks Industry classification, Telecommunications is broadly grouped in the Computer and Technology sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and are further sub-divided into nine industries at the expanded level: Communications Infrastructure, Communications Components, Satellite Communications, Communications Semiconductor, Wireless Equipment Supplier, National Wireless Service Provider, Non-U.S. Wireless Operator, National Wirleline Operator and Non-U.S. Wireline Operator. The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank. As a guideline, the outlook for industries with a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'The Zacks Industry Rank for Communications Infrastructure is #168, Communications Component is #186, Satellite Communications is #110, Communications Semiconductor is #49, Wireless Equipment Supplier is #104, National Wireless Service providers is #95, National Wireline Operators is #110, Non-U.S. Wireless Operators is #236 and Non-U.S. Wireline Operators is #245. Looking at the Zacks Industry Rank of the nine telecommunications industries, we derive that the near-term outlook for the group is tending toward 'Neutral.'The broader Technology sector, of which the Telecommunications industry is part, remains strong with respect to earnings. So far, as much as 81.3% of the sector participants have reported first-quarter 2014 results, which have been strong in terms of beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) and generated a positive growth.Although earnings beat ratio was pretty robust at 73.1%, the revenue beat ratio was a moderate 59.6%. Additionally, total earnings for the reported companies have shown a 4.9% year-over-year increase on a 4.2% growth in revenues. This compares with a substantially higher earnings growth of 5.3% on a much higher 6.1% growth in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014.Nevertheless, the consensus earnings expectations for full year 2014 also depict a lackluster trend. Earnings growth is expected to decline at 0.1% in the second quarter and is expected to decline further to 1.5% in the third quarter. Overall, the sector is expected to register full-year earnings growth of 2.5%.For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our weekly  reports.The telecommunications industry as a whole offers a number of attributes that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.

Carrier expenditures have increased in Japan and even major telecom operators in Western Europe, the most economically vulnerable region, have raised their budgets.Currently, the U.S. telecommunications Industry is evolving around 5 broad factors. These include wireless gradually becoming the future of the telecom industry and the consequent popularity of spectrum. High-speed fiber-based network is projected to expand more aggressively, especially for video/TV offerings.In addition, consolidation within the industry will continue mainly due to shortage of airwaves and attainment of economies of scale. Innovative product launches are expected in areas of m-Commerce, virtualization and cloud-based technology, high-speed metro Ethernet, to name a few. Apart from these, there still remains ample scope for expansion in the U.S. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), nearly a fifth of rural American households lack broadband access.Despite the massive growth in fiber-to-the-home networks, we believe that wireless networks will boost growth in the telecom industry. The GSM Association's research wing, GMSA Intelligence, recently revealed its estimation of more than 1 billion global LTE connections by 2017. Currently, approximately 274 LTE networks are commercially available in 101 countries. More than 350 LTE networks will be commercially functional by the end of 2014. By 2017, the number is likely to reach nearly 465 LTE networks across 128 countries. At present, there are approximately 200.1 million LTE subscribers globally.GSMA Intelligence further reported that LTE users consume an average of 1.5GB data per month, twofold of what is consumed by non-LTE users. In the developing countries, LTE users can generate 20 times higher average revenue per user (ARPU) to carriers than non-LTE users, whereas in the developed countries, ARPU can be 10-40% higher for LTE users than non-LTE users. Apart from the terrestrial wireless network, the U.S. has an advanced satellite broadband network, mobile satellite radio systems and extensive WiFi networks.Research firm ABI Research recently reported that a significant boost for LTE network is expected to come from the Asia-Pacific region. In 2014, the Asia-Pacific region is likely to excel all other regions in the world with respect to LTE base-stations installation. LTE base-stations, which are popularly known as radio access networks (RAN), are expected to grow eight fold in the region this year. Also, wireless operators are projected to spend around $35 billion for RAN in 2014, globally, with Asia-Pacific accounting for the major share.The telecom infrastructure developer's market is witnessing a technical change globally. So far the main thrust of the communications service providers was on developing advanced hardware, which would enable them to attain enhanced speed, scalability and reliability. However, recent developments suggest that operators are gradually shifting focus from a hardware centric growth model to an IT/software centric business model. The primary reason behind this shift is the significant growth of cloud-based virtual networking.Growth of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) encouraged newly emerging digital media companies to invest heavily in the communications infrastructure market. SDN provides customers increased bandwidth utilization, higher reliability and reduced capital spending. NFV is designed to consolidate and deliver the networking components needed to support a fully virtualized infrastructure -- including virtual servers, storage and even other networks. It utilizes standard IT virtualization technologies.The U.S. telecom industry is likely to witness more mergers and acquisitions in 2014. Owing to the rising demand for scarce and valuable wireless spectrum, mergers and acquisitions have increased exponentially. While established players need more spectrums to gain competitiveness, small players prefer to collaborate with strong rivals rather than trying to establish a nationwide foothold, which is extremely capital intensive.Recently,  (  ) announced the largest acquisition proposal of the wireless industry. The company has decided to acquire the remaining 45% stake of Verizon Wireless Network from  (  ). Verizon currently holds the majority 55% of this venture. In Feb 2014, Comcast reached an agreement with  (  ) to acquire the latter in an all-stock deal valued at around $45.3 billion.Softbank of Japan recently acquired a 78% stake in  (  ) for $21.6 billion. Sprint is further eyeing  (  ) to acquire. Satellite TV operator  (  ) boasts has a lucrative portfolio of spectrums (an estimated value of $10 billion) and is looking for a suitable merger option to develop a nationwide wireless network.Severe spectrum crunch coupled with gradual smartphone adoption are compelling wireless operators to seek other options to raise revenues. Further, growing demand for technically superior products has been the silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment.The cloud-managed WiFi market has become a major growth driver for telecom operators as increasing number of large and mid-sized business enterprises are adopting this technology. According to a recent report by IDC, worldwide cloud-managed infrastructure and managed services revenues are estimated to reach $653 million in 2014 and might scale up to $2.5 billion by 2018.Large business enterprises generally have presence throughout the world. A strong and robust wireless network is essential for these companies to maintain connections with remote sites. Cloud-managed WiFi networks have become indispensable for these large business houses as they offer several advantages like central manageability, smaller physical footprint and linear scalability.The machine-to-machine (M2M) wireless communications technology has been significantly driving mobile data revenues for wireless service providers. M2M is a rapidly growing market opportunity. According to a report by research firm IDATE, the global M2M communications market is expected to generate revenues of over $53 billion in 2019, substantially up from $33 billion in 2013. Over the same timeframe, the number of M2M module deployment is predicted to rise from 175 million to 470 million.The global pay-TV market size may reach up to $270 billion by 2017. Similarly, for the cable TV operators, a new growth area is the small and medium sized business (SMB) segment. Currently, the market size of the U.S. Business Services segment is approximately $8 billion. Various industry researches estimate that the SMB segment is anticipated to offer a market opportunity worth $20 billion to $30 billion in the long term.Within the Zacks Industry classification, Telecommunications is broadly grouped in the Computer and Technology sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and are further sub-divided into nine industries at the expanded level: Communications Infrastructure, Communications Components, Satellite Communications, Communications Semiconductor, Wireless Equipment Supplier, National Wireless Service Provider, Non-U.S. Wireless Operator, National Wirleline Operator and Non-U.S. Wireline Operator.

So far, as much as 81.3% of the sector participants have reported first-quarter 2014 results, which have been strong in terms of beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) and generated a positive growth.Although earnings beat ratio was pretty robust at 73.1%, the revenue beat ratio was a moderate 59.6%. Additionally, total earnings for the reported companies have shown a 4.9% year-over-year increase on a 4.2% growth in revenues. This compares with a substantially higher earnings growth of 5.3% on a much higher 6.1% growth in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014.Nevertheless, the consensus earnings expectations for full year 2014 also depict a lackluster trend. Earnings growth is expected to decline at 0.1% in the second quarter and is expected to decline further to 1.5% in the third quarter. Overall, the sector is expected to register full-year earnings growth of 2.5%.For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our weekly  reports.The telecommunications industry as a whole offers a number of attributes that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.

However, the cheaper version will not come with Kinect motion sensor for gesture and voice control.The price cut marks the first significant discount by Microsoft since the software giant released the new console. This cut could be in response to its closest competitor,  (  ), taking a lead in the game console market.

We believe that the global trend toward virtualization and cloud computing will facilitate Citrix to maintain its momentum in the long term. Further, the business fundamentals of Citrix remain intriguing as the corporate spending for IT is expected to rise globally.Citrix has delivered positive earnings surprise in all four quarters last year, with an average beat of 7.58%. The company reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same.The desktop virtualization market is expected to accelerate in the near future. Currently, server virtualization has an addressable market size of approximately 35 million servers worldwide whereas desktop virtualization has the potential to impact more than 600 million desktop users in corporate environments alone. As a result, the company expects an 8-10% increase in revenues for first quarter and full-year 2014.Citrix strengthened its position in the highly lucrative cloud-based data storage segment with the acquisition of ShareFile, a leading provider of secure, cloud-based data storage, sharing and collaboration solutions. ShareFile offers cloud solutions to companies of various types and sizes.However, the global economy is still suffering from fluctuations and is not completely out of woods. Various geo-political concerns in the European and African countries have slowed the momentum of the economic recovery. This may make Citrix's near-term financials volatile.

It helps clients in managing and safely securing large quantities of increasingly complex information. It offers data storage, back up and archive, content and infrastructure management, information security, analytics, virtualization, cloud computing, and other services that enable companies to store, manage, analyze and protect data.Every organization needs data management and hence EMC's clients are very diverse ranging from financial institutions, social networking, media, manufacturers, healthcare, internet service providers, telecommunications operators, airlines and transportation companies, educational institutions, public-sector agencies, etc.The company generates revenues from five segments: two being the major: information storage (69.5% of the revenues as of FY13) and VMware (  ) virtual infrastructure (22.2% of the revenues as of FY13).As of 31 December 2013, EMC owned 80% controlling interest in VMware and held approximately 97% of the combined voting power of VMware's outstanding common stock. Public cloud, which is growing at an exponential rate, is a threat to EMC and VMware. In public cloud, data is stored and managed by the cloud application provider. This has advantages (especially to start-ups) as the cloud application user has no initial network infrastructure and maintenance cost, all it needs is the internet connection. Public cloud service providers offer storage and computing to organizations as and when needed and how much they need it, as compared to the traditional way of buying storage and systems from EMC (or NetApp) and essentially paying for extra, unneeded capacity (at least initially) and hence they are seen as a large threat to EMC's traditional business model. It also allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and enables IT to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand. Simply put, public cloud reduces enterprise hardware needs, which is a threat to EMC and VMware. Also, some of these public cloud providers (such as Amazon web services (AWS)) are not using EMC and VMware products and services which takes away the growth aspect. Most cloud customers are startups and small and medium-sized businesses. However, public cloud providers such as AWS and Google are expected to shift focus to large companies soon, heading right into EMC's and VMware's sweet spot, which could be a big threat. EMC's management very well understands that public cloud is a threat and are taking very aggressive measures to mitigate the revenue loss in information storage segment by launching new emerging storage offerings. Also, to compete on the public cloud front, VMware has recently launched vCloud Hybrid. Hybrid cloud is a system that combines public cloud with a compatible private cloud. The private cloud holds crucial data and applications, while the public cloud offers scale and superior pricing.Though start-ups and even smaller and medium business IT departments are moving towards subscription based public cloud services to save cost the larger enterprises, especially those that have long established investments in on site infrastructure are not. Main reasons why public cloud hasn't been able to penetrate in larger organizations are:To transform and improve business, CIOs have to find efficiencies in their current IT environment. EMC supports the vast majority of enterprise customers contained in these environments (is a market leader) and hence is well positioned to help customers optimize and modernize their current IT needs by transitioning from existing exchange-servers to emerging technologies such as converged infrastructure, software defined data center and private cloud.Lastly, EMC and VMware have launched Pivotal, which will provide enterprise-class cloud-computing platform and infrastructure and big data for VMware customers. Some companies and public cloud service providers are gravitating towards free and open source virtualization such as Citrix's (  ) XenServer and not VMware's virtualization software. Though Citrix's XenServer is freely available its market share in the segment is very small and has been declining. Support, service and maintenance are very important for IT departments in which VMware is good at. VMware is a leader with 55% share of the virtualization market. Market share of VMware has been constantly declining over the last few years (declined to 55% in 2013 from 65% in 2008). Comparatively, Microsoft's share in the market has gone up from around 20% at the end of 2008 to 28% in 2013. Competition has been increasing with companies like Rackspace, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and others entering the market. Though VMware's market share has been declining with increased competition, overall server virtualization market is growing and is still expected to grow 18% annually. VMware has grown its revenues by 23% CAGR in the last 5 years and growth in FY13 was 13%. VMware is still the market leader with 55% market share and its new internal and acquired technologies should further boost revenues and market share. Information storage segment makes up 70% of revenues and virtualization 23% of revenues. Information storage business is in a secular decline. Overall enterprise information storage market is growing at a very small pace (1% to 2%) in dollar terms. Though the need for data is unstoppable and is growing exponentially, the slow growth has been mainly due to reduced pricing, database appliances that manage more in-memory computing and fast growing adoption of cloud offerings and software-defined storage that reduce enterprise hardware needs. Hardware market has stagnated at current levels as price declines offset most of the growth in unit shipments. That said,  from competitors. Its information storage revenue (70% of total revenues) increased by 4.5% in FY13 and its  , which is double IBM (second in the list) and triple its nearest competitor, NetApp (  ). The company is gaining market share because of its strongest and most complete portfolio, aggressive focus on R&D and innovation along with right acquisitions leading to outstanding new emerging technologies and solutions and excellent service. Also, storage software is growing and is expected to achieve a  in the next two years. EMC is the market leader in both storage hardware and software with a 34.2% and 23.6% share in them respectively. EMC operates in a very stick business as it has long-term relationships with its customers and the solutions are sold through multi-year enterprise license agreements. Also, it takes a significant amount of time and effort to set up the networks and servers, which makes it difficult for existing customers to move. Though the overall growth in information storage market is stagnant, EMC has been growing its information storage segment revenues (70% of total revenues) by approximately 5%. The growth is being driven by smaller, but much faster growing emerging storage offerings. These latest emerging storage solutions like Isilon (network attached storage), Atmos (cloud storage), VPLEX (virtualization and private cloud) and XtremIO (all-flash storage array) are growing exceptionally well: up 54% in FY13 recording a revenue of USD 1.5bn. In less than two months of availability, XtremIO has already taken the market-leading position and combined product sales for Atmos and Isilon more than tripled in FY13. Also, new products such as ViPR, software-defined storage solution, significantly speed up performance. ViPR got off to a very strong start in 4Q. In September 2013, EMC also launched the new VNX Series, which delivers up to four-times the performance of the previous generation. These latest emerging storage offerings have had y-o-y growth of 73% in 4Q13 and 66% in 3Q13. Although this sub-segment (emerging storage) only contributed about 10% of the USD 16bn information storage segment, the momentum and the growth in these emerging storage offerings could boost storage business. EMC intends to focus on emerging storage going forward. EMC owns 80% of VMware, which has the largest market share in providing virtualization to enable enterprise customers to deploy private clouds. Medium-sized enterprises are still in the early stages of deploying a server virtualization and this market is expected to grow 18% annually. VMware is uniquely positioned as i) it offers solutions which run on industry-standard desktop computers, servers and support a wide range of operating systems, application environments and networking and storage infrastructures and ii) it is 80% owned by EMC and hence has access to the massive EMC clientele and relationships. VMware has been growing its revenues and FCF by 23% and 29% CAGR in the last 5 years (13% and 32% in FY13), respectively.Also VMware is attempting to become a cloud management provider, which is a transformation from offering primarily server virtualization solutions. VMware only recently released its vCloud Hybrid Service and made it available in the US in September 2013. It will roll out this service in other regions throughout 2014. The hybrid cloud service has gained tremendous popularity and despite the competitive environment the company's management tools for cloud are selling very well. Also, its  is expected to be available in 2H14.Just like EMC, VMware is also focused on innovation. In November 2013, VMware launched desktop as a service (DaaS) offering, with the goal of simplifying the delivery of cloud-hosted desktops, to any device, anywhere. DaaS is a cloud-based desktop service that delivers virtual desktops running on VMware's vCloud Hybrid Service. It gives customers the ability to blend public cloud desktops and on-premise VMware private cloud desktops. VMware is also adding virtualized GPU (vGPU) by bringing Nvidia GRID technology to its DaaS platform.  . GPU helps in delivering a quality interactive visual experience and has been increasingly used even in mainstream Microsoft Office 2013 and rich HTML5 content on the internet.Lastly, VMware acquired AirWatch, the leader in enterprise mobile management and mobile security, providing software tools required by IT organizations to manage, monitor, and secure mobile devices in their enterprise. This helps organizations empowering the mobile workforce.Apart from growing virtualization market, VMware will be able to pace the delivery of all these services and solution (DaaS, vGPU, AirWatch) through its network of over 11,000 VMware service provider partners further accelerating its top-line growth. Vast majority of enterprise workload is supported by client-server era, in which EMC is the market leader. With EMC's massive clientele and long-term relationships and VMware's seamless integration with EMC products, EMC is better equipped to help customers bridge the gap as they transition from the client-server to cloud computing, big data, mobile, and social networking. During 2013, EMC continued to deepen the level of integration between its data protection hardware and software products, as well as with enterprise applications from Oracle, SAP and Microsoft and virtual infrastructure from VMware and Microsoft. This integrated approach to delivering solutions helps users address challenges associated with exponential data growth, physical-to-virtual migration and cloud computing initiatives. EMC also engages in numerous alliances with other technology companies for interoperability, seamless integration and hence improved the total customer experience. In 2013, EMC delivered significant technology integration and new solutions for SAP, Cisco, Brocade, Citrix, Microsoft, Oracle and VMware to help accelerate customers' journey to private, public or hybrid cloud. It also expanded its partner ecosystem with global and regional technology and solutions providers. One of EMC's competitive advantages is its massive direct sales force and distribution network. EMC markets its products and services through direct sales (in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, South Africa and the Asia Pacific region) and through multiple distribution channels (including value-added resellers and distributors, cloud service providers, systems integrators, outsourcers, independent software vendors, and original equipment manufacturers). EMC and VMware have demonstrated to be market leaders by continuing to dedicate significant resources towards expanding their product scope organically and through acquisition and then maximizing those investments by leveraging their significant distribution capabilities. The current need for innovation is extremely important as the IT infrastructure market is going through the biggest and most disruptive (and opportunistic) transition. With internal annual R&D expense of USD 2.7bn and 15,000 engineers, it is difficult to beat EMC on innovation. Investment in R&D and new technologies and solutions is reflected in numerous innovations, refreshes and successful product launches in 2013. The company continues to develop a product portfolio with customers' current and future needs in mind. The company continues to make major investments in new business areas including NSX, DCHS Pivotal, ViPR, ScaleIO, XtremIO and Project Nile. EMC acquired 11 companies in FY12 and 5 in FY13. It has a track record of making smart acquisitions and have generated very attractive ROIs on them. Examples include VMware, Data Domain and Isilon. EMC's strong sales force and partner network help reach the product to its massive client base, which creates such attractive returns. Growth in EMC's unearned revenues has been much faster than the actual growth in the top-line revenues. Revenue growth was 8.5% and 6.9% as compared to growth in unearned revenues of 22% and 19%, in FY12 and FY13 respectively. This shows the growth has been faster than actually depicted in the revenues. Cash on companies' balance sheet is at its all time high but  . Average age of equipment is 7.4 years, the oldest since 1995. Average age of even quickly-depreciating assets like software and information processing equipment is at historical peaks. IT spending could increase significantly with an upturn in the capex cycle. Large volumes of complex data generated by increasing use of smart devices have initiated the need for big data. Smartphones, tablets and new PC form factors are only the beginning. This trend will accelerate as sensors are built into almost every imaginable product that will collectively throw massive amounts of data. The world's data is expected to expand at a CAGR of almost 40% from 2013 to 2020. This data is stored in new clouds quickly and affordably. New and powerful cloud infrastructures provide technology that organizations can use to mine through massive quantities of data and enable them to use their findings to identify new business opportunities, trends and to make better and faster customer-focused decisions by understanding client needs and behavior while improving their operational efficiencies. Pivotal (launched in April 2013 and 84% owned by EMC) is a USD 1bn initiative, offering Platform-as-a-Service ((  )) to target next-generation cloud and Big Data, as well as agile development tools. It is spun out of VMware, and backed by EMC and GE. The total investments to Pivotal are expected to be USD 400m, most of which will be coming in 2014. Pivotal is predicted to see exceptional growth with potential to exceed revenue of USD 1bn by FY17. A recent  shows that the Big Data technology and services market will grow at a 27% CAGR to USD 32.4bn through 2017. Pivotal currently contributes just 1.3% of total revenues and could be a huge growth engine for the company in the future. EMC continues to spend more cash on share repurchases. It repurchased USD 3bn, USD 685m and USD 2bn of its common stock from the market in FY13, FY12 and FY11, respectively. In FY12, it also repaid USD 1.7bn of long and short-term debt. In FY13, it issued USD 5.5bn of debt at a weighted average interest rate of 2.4%, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment. Most of this money will be used for stock repurchases and dividend payments. The company expects to spend another USD 2bn on EMC share buybacks in 2014. As per the company, combined payouts of dividends and share repurchases are seen around 50% of free cash flows. With strong annual free cash flow of USD 5.5bn and a massive USD 17.6bn of cash on balance sheet (31% of the market cap) buyback could only increase and the company could be a target for shareholder activism. has had a 5-year average growth of 23%, 26% and 32% in revenues, EBITDA and FCF, respectively. Last year (FY13) revenues grew by 13%, EBITDA by 18% and FCF by 32%. Assuming a 10% growth rate for the next 5 years, a terminal growth rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 10% gives a stock price trading at approximately current levels. : However, EMC on a stand-alone basis (excluding VMware), is trading at extremely cheap multiples (5.4x EV/FCF and 3.6x EV/EBITDA). The core EMC (stand-alone) seems significantly undervalued considering it is a market leader, has been growing its top-line by 5% and  . Its competitor for stand-alone business NetApp, trades at 7.5x EV/FCF and 6.6x EV/EBITDA. Valuing at those multiples suggest an approximate 80% upside on the core EMC (stand-alone) and an approximate 30% upside on the consolidated EMC. Valuing EMC (stand-alone) using a -1% growth rate in FCF for next 5 years, -1% terminal growth rate, and a discount rate of 10% gives a stock price approximately 70% above current trading levels, and a 23% upside on the consolidated EMC. These assumptions are really conservative as revenues from the EMC (stand-alone) grew by 5.2% and 4.5% and EBITDA by 10.1% and 3.7% in FY12 and FY13, respectively.Even under such conservative assumptions EMC (stand-alone) is significantly undervalued. These valuations remind me of hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturers, WDC and Seagate. In mid 2012, WDC was trading at EV/EBITDA of 3.5x. The rationale behind such low multiples was that HDD manufacturers will not survive as solid state drives (SSDs) are the future. Since then WDC stock has almost tripled. HDDs are still sold and are very much alive. EMC is trading at a discount even on a very conservative basis and the market is ignoring its competitive advantages including quality, breadth of offerings, strong distribution (sales force and channel partners), after sales service, scalability, interoperability, time-to-market enhancements and expertise in acquiring new emerging technologies with power to scale them. Furthermore its huge cash pile (31% of the market cap), high ROCE, 10% FCF yield and growing emerging segments are also overlooked. The stock has been down 8% in the last 2 years as compared to a 32% gain in S&P on fears of client-server and data storage systems being obsolete with emergence of public cloud. In those 2 years, EMC has recorded an average top-line growth of 7.7% and FCF growth of 11.7%.EMC is taking very aggressive measures to mitigate the revenue loss in information storage segment and so far has been very successful in doing the same. It is well positioned to benefit from the current growth segments of IT: big data, cloud, virtualization, storage, security, and software-defined storage. : This is not an investment advice.

However, earnings per share managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Revenues increased 14.2% year over year to $1.36 billion and were slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues were toward the higher end of management's guided range of $1.33 billion-$1.37 billion.The year-over-year increase in revenues can be attributed to 15.0% growth in license revenues and a 13.7% increase in services revenues. Among services revenues, software maintenance jumped 15.9% from the year-ago quarter, while professional services remained flat on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, strong demand for VMware solutions across international as well as U.S. markets helped revenues.In constant currency, the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA total bookings increased less than 10% each on a year-over-year basis. Relative performance wise, the Americas was the strongest region followed by the Asia-Pacific and EMEA.Amongst the product groups, End User Computing (EUC) license bookings grew 35.0% on a year-over-year basis while Cloud Management grew over 30.0% in the reported quarter.During the quarter, VMware secured two deals, each worth more than $10.0 million.

In the reported quarter, the company unveiled the Virtual SAN, which happened to be VMware's first software defined storage product.During the quarter, VMware formed an alliance with Google to modernize corporate desktops for the Mobile Cloud Era by providing businesses with secure, cloud access to Windows applications, data and desktops on Google Chromebooks.Also, the acquisition of mobile security firm, AirWatch for $1.54 billion was completed during the reported quarter. With AirWatch having already contributed about $5.0 million to revenues in the reported quarter, we expect this acquisition to be a major catalyst going forward.Some of the other products launched during the quarter include the likes of VMware Horizon DAAS and VMware Horizon 6. Horizon DAAS would enable simple and flexible delivery of desktops in the cloud while Horizon 6 would deliver published applications and virtual desktops in a single integrated platform.Operating margin declined 80 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 21.5%. Operating profit includes stock-based compensation but excludes one-time items.The decline in operating margin was due to higher general and administrative expense (up 120 bps) and lower gross profit (down 80 bps), which was partially offset by lower research and development expense (down 120 bps) and lower sales and marketing expense (down 20 bps).GAAP net income was $199 million, which when adjusted for the following items (intangible amortization of $28 million, acquisition and other related items of $24 million and tax of $9.4 million), led to non-GAAP net income of $241.6 million.VMware exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of $6.62 billion compared with $6.18 billion in the previous quarter. Cash from operations was $750.0 million versus $688.0 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow was $673.0 million compared with $590 million in the prior quarter.During the quarter, VMware repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for around $169.0 million at an average price of $96.0 per share.For 2014, VMware forecasts revenues to be in the range of $5.94 billion to $6.10 billion. Excluding Pivotal and divestitures but including $75.0 million from recently acquired AirWatch, revenues are expected to grow in the range of 16.0% to 18.5% for 2014. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.04 billion.License revenues for 2014 are expected to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.63 billion (up 12.0% to 16.0% year over year). Excluding Pivotal and divestitures but including AirWatch, license growth rate is expected to be up 13% to 17% versus 2013.For 2014, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 31.0% while the GAAP operating margin is expected to range between 15% and 18%. Management expects the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 1-2.5 pts lower than the non-GAAP tax rate of 18.5%. The company expects to continue its share buyback program in 2014.For second quarter of 2014, management expects revenues to be in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.4737 billion (up 15% to 18% year over year). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.44 billion.License revenues for the second quarter are expected to be $605.0 million to $615.0 million (up 14.0% to 16.0% year over year).Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be within the range of 29% to 29.5% while GAAP operating margin is expected to range between 12% and 15.5%. Management expects the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 1-2.5 pts lower than the non-GAAP tax rate of 18.5%. Moreover, management also expects to continue its share buyback program in the second quarter of 2014.We believe that a sluggish IT spending environment and intensifying competition from its peers such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are primary headwinds for VMware, going forward.Moreover, VMware's continued investments in the emerging markets, product innovations and acquisitions are expected to weigh on margins in the near term.However, VMware's strong product portfolio is a major positive. The company continues to win contracts and robust international sales will continue to the boost top line, going forward. Moreover, the acquisitions of Desktone and AirWatch will boost the top line, going forward.Currently, VMware has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is up 36.02 to 3,503.84.

(Symbol: CTXS) has taken over the #348 spot from Akamai Technologies Inc (Symbol: AKAM), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Citrix Systems, Inc. (Symbol: CTXS), the market cap is now $10.74 billion, versus Akamai Technologies Inc (Symbol: AKAM) at $10.69 billion.Below is a chart of Citrix Systems, Inc. versus Akamai Technologies Inc plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (CTXS plotted in blue; AKAM plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CTXS vs. AKAM:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, CTXS and AKAM collectively make up 5.09% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (  ) which is up by about 1.3% on the day Thursday.At the closing bell, CTXS is up about 2.5%, while AKAM is up about 1% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) declared mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2013.

However, the company's flagship product, the vSphere Hypervisor, which provides a virtual operating platform to guest operating systems, faces increasing competition from players such as Microsoft (  ), Citrix and Oracle (  ). Currently, VMware accounts for about 56% of the virtualization market, but its market share has been declining steadily in recent years. Although VMware continues to provide a top-notch virtualization platform, rivals have started to catch up in terms of performance and features. In this article, we take a look at some of VMware's main competitors and how each of them could affect VMware's hold over the market in the coming years.The architecture of virtualization software is such that it \"sits on top of the hardware beneath the operating system\", which in turn reduces dependence on the host operating system (  ). VMware's presence in this segment made Microsoft feel the need to enter the virtualization market and eliminate the threat VMware was posing to its core product, the Windows OS. Consequently, Microsoft launched Hyper-V in 2008.Since its launch, the Hyper-V has constantly improved and added more features to compete with the market leader, VMware. Between the two, there are a number of varied features and flexible configurations that vSphere offers, which the Hyper-V doesn't. The Hyper-V is therefore available in only one edition and is also much cheaper than the full vSphere Enterprise Edition. Admittedly though, not all clients buy VMware's full enterprise edition of vSphere.Where Microsoft clearly scores over VMware is its existing Windows client relationships, which it has effectively leveraged to gain virtualization market share. The company has been offering the Hyper-V for free to customers of other Microsoft products such as System Center. In addition, due to the general improvement in the product and services offered, Microsoft has become VMware's toughest competitor. As a result, while VMware' market share has declined from 64% in 2008 to 56% in 2013, Microsoft's has increased from around 20% to 28% in the same period. Microsoft's Hyper-V is VMware's biggest area of concern in the coming years.Citrix's (  ) Xen Server, which is different from Microsoft's Hyper-V, is a bare-metal hypervisor. This means it runs directly on the host hardware and doesn't need an operating system to be hosted on. With the recent release of XenZerver 6.2, Citrix believes it is in shape to give serious competition to VMware. The most significant feature of the XenServer is that it has no licensing charges. It is freely available, with the company charging customers only for support and maintenance. Even though Citrix's market share in the segment dropped from around 4% in 2011 to 3.3% in 2012, a lot of customers, including a number of small and medium businesses (SMBs), are likely to switch to the XenServer going forward.VMware also has several other competitors, the most prominent being Oracle's VirtualBox, which is also a freely available virtualization hypervisor. It is supports a variety of operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS and Solaris, which makes it a very flexible platform. The only downside to this product (from a commercial standpoint) is that it specifically targets advanced users - those who can edit code for customized usage. It is also slightly slower in terms of performance and likely doesn't pose an immediate or a significant threat to VMware's market share.Next on the list is the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor (REVH), which uses the Linux kernel as a hypervisor with virtual machines having direct access to the hardware resources. It is available both in the bare-metal form and as a hosted platform. The key distinguishing factor of REVH relative to other hypervisors is that it allows user to provision virtual machines themselves, again an option for advanced users.Due to an increase in competitors over the last few years, VMware has seen a decline in market share. Going forward we expect the share to drop even further. If Microsoft's Hyper-V causes a greater decline in VMware's share than we currently forecast, there could be a significant downside to our  for VMware.In terms of the virtualization market, competition is a major concern for VMware as Citrix's XenServer and Microsoft's Hyper-V could be big winners in the upcoming few quarters. Additionally, VMware has shifted focus towards cloud computing and intends to use its huge virtualization enterprise customer base to utilize its enterprise-level hypervisor for cloud computing, the ESX. With the hybrid cloud market expected to grow significantly over the next few years, things are looking bright for VMware on the back of its recently  .

The company reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2013. The bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line missed the same.Citrix is concentrating on three broad markets: Desktop virtualization, Cloud Infrastructure and networking, and Collaboration and sharing. As desktop virtualization has become the top priority for any IT set-up, Citrix is continuously introducing innovative products that will facilitate business flexibility, security and centralized management system. NetScaler product suite remains the largest catalyst for the Cloud Infrastructure and networking segment.Citrix strengthened its position in the highly lucrative cloud-based data storage segment after its acquisition of ShareFile, a leading provider of secure, cloud-based data storage, sharing and collaboration solutions. As per the company, the personal cloud computing market is expected to become a multi-billion dollar opportunity by 2015.Moreover, the company has enhanced its mobile computing platform by offering Citrix Worx App Gallery with more than 100 apps from third-party developers. The Worx App Gallery reduces the need for IT administrators as it is managed by Citrix XenMobile that offers complete security and better corporate usage.On the flip side, the global economy is still suffering from fluctuations and we are not completely out of woods. Various geo-political concerns in the European and African countries have slowed the momentum of economic recovery. This may make Citrix's near-term financials volatile. Any adverse macroeconomic situation may result in the slowdown of enterprise IT spending. Hence, the desktop virtualization market may evolve less than anticipated and Citrix may lose its market share more quickly than expected. During the reported quarter, geographically, total net revenue dropped 2.4% from the preceding quarter.Citrix provides software and equipment for streamlining business computer systems. The demand for its products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for business-related computer appliances and software. Fluctuations in the demand for these products and services could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition.Citrix currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Other stocks to consider in the Business Software & Services industry are  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

Critically, this became a focus during the call. As a general rule of thumb, investors use billings as a key metric for Red Hat given that it measures the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement.According to the company, weakness in Europe and a slower deal environment were the culprit for the deceleration in billings. Specifically, two of the company's largest deals (~$20 million) were billed for only 15% of the total contract value during the quarter. The average contract length was 21 months.Management also cited summer seasonality, a weak economy, and currency headwinds, which further contributed to the softness in billings. The silver lining came from subscription revenues, which came in slightly ahead of expectations. Moreover, profitability was also ahead with adjusted operating margins at 25.2%, 130 bps above forecasts.On the , management gave guidance for Q3, which came in mixed. For Q3, the company guided for revenues of $381-$384 million versus the street at $391 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.34-$0.35 versus the street at $0.34.For FY14, the company narrowed its revenue guidance to $1.51 - $1.52 billion, which fell short of the street at $1.53 billion although non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.36-$1.38, which is above consensus of $1.35.RHT is currently trading at 36x forward earnings, which is at a slight discount to its 5 year median of 39x. The company trades at a premium versus competitors Citrix Systems (  ) at 22x, Ca Inc. (  ) at 11x, Microsoft (  ) at 12x, and Oracle Corp (  ) at 11x, respectively.RHT does deserve a premium multiple over CA, MSFT, and ORCL, respectively given the company's low-mid teens earnings growth rate versus the large cap vendors which have low-mid single digit earnings growth rates.However, given the choppy deal flow for billings, relative valuation, and mixed guidance for Q3 and FY14, a lower multiple in line with its 5 year median (and also closer to its competitor such as CTXS) is likely warranted, such as 30x versus its current valuation at 36x.Back of the envelope, assuming the company's long term growth rate of 14% (per StarMine) and the midpoint of FY14 guide at $1.35 would imply FY15 EPS of $1.56. At 30x would suggest a target price of $47 (11% downside from RHT's closing price).As a recap, Red Hat (  ) reported Q2 revenue of $374 million, vs. the analyst consensus of $372 million on Capital IQ. EPS was $0.35, vs. expectations of $0.33 per share.Subscription revenue for the quarter was $327 million, up 17% in U.S. dollars year over year, or 18% measured in constant currency.RHT 48.88 -4.05 -7.65CTXS 74.18 -0.20 -0.27MSFT 32.70 -0.04 -0.12CA 30.39 -0.09 -0.30ORCL 33.81 -0.13 -0.38The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is relying on strategic partnerships to fuel growth.

It helps in agile development services, and also supports data science consulting. Some of the main offerings of Pivotal include its Enterprise PaaS product, which is powered by Cloud Foundry.This brings us to Cloud foundry, which becomes an important topic of discussion.

Cloud Foundry is a new concept driven by Pivotal.VMWare is taking the help of these technologies to develop Pivotal CF. This would be available on VMware's vSphere and the vCloud Hybrid Service. The partnership will help customers to take full advantage of the PaaS.The open source Cloud Foundry platform is growing fast and includes support for vSphere. This considerably reduces time to market for new applications that are deployed on-premise and will make VMware solutions much more acceptable to end users.We believe that VMware's ability of innovating new products, entering into new technological collaboration and solutions, along with its existing product pipeline and strategic investments will enable the company to drive its top line over the long term.This apart, the Virtualization space is also providing new opportunities every day, and companies such as BMC Software and  (  ) are also implementing different strategies to grab a major share of this business.However, we believe that sluggish North American and European markets coupled with modest IT spending environment and stiff competition from  (  ) and  (  ) are the headwinds going forward.VMWare has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ), which offers cloud computing services to PC and laptop users, will be launching its popular NetScaler Control Center for  (  ).

The acquisition will allow Rogers to expand its reach within the enterprise segment spread across Canada.BLACKIRON Data is an innovator in data centre and cloud computing services and has approximately 4,000 customers. BLACKIRON offers a wide range of IT infrastructure solutions including Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and works closely with clients to deliver value to their business.Acquisition of BLACKIRON will allow Rogers Business Solutions (RBS) to strengthen its capacity and coverage across Canada as almost 80% of all Canadian businesses are located within 200 km of a BLACKIRON Data centre.Notably, BLACKIRON owns and operates 8 data centres across five important cities of Canada and has recently opened a contemporary data centre in Markham, Ontario. The data centre has expanded its current operations by 45%. This strengthens RBS's position in Ontario, where it already owns two data centres and has partnerships with multiple cloud vendors.Combining Rogers' fibre-based network with BLACKIRON's advanced range of data centres will allow the Canadian telecom company to become a turnkey IT infrastructure solution provider for enterprise clients. BLACKIRON, which has 132 skilled professionals, reported an EBITDA margin of 38.6% on annual revenue of $33.7 million at the end of 2012.Companies providing cloud computing service continue to flourish as virtualization has become essential for business enterprises to reduce costs and for exploring the markets worldwide. Instead of installing their own virtualization and data centre set up, the corporate bodies are now sharing the cloud computing platform of dedicated providers like  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) that allows them to fulfil their data storage needs.According to research firm Gartner, the cloud computing service market is expected to reach $131 billion by 2013 representing an 18.5% annualized growth.

The company posted strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2012, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimates.The stock price of Citrix moved up nearly 33% in the last year, outpacing the S&P 500 return of just 23.4% over the same period. Citrix is currently trading at the high end of its 52-week price range. With respect to several valuation metrics, the stock is also trading at significantly higher multiples compared to the S&P 500.

In fourth-quarter 2012, 55 deals exceeded $1 million.

With Cloud.com in its kitty, Citrix is now comfortably placed at par with the cloud computing software leader,  (  ). The company became a strong challenger for  's (  ) web services software and  's (  ) Windows Azure software. Citrix further strengthened its position in the cloud-based data storage segment after its acquisition of ShareFile, a leading provider of secure, cloud-based data storage, sharing and collaboration solutions.Nevertheless, the global economy is still suffering from fluctuations and yet to fully recover from recession. Various geo-political concerns in the European and African countries have slowed the momentum of economic recovery. This may make Citirix's near-term financials volatile.Any adverse macro-economic situation may result in the slowdown of enterprise IT spending. Hence, the desktop virtualization market may evolve less than anticipated and Citrix may lose its market share more quickly than expected.

One survey suggests that  now use their smartphones for work, and BYOD (bring-your-own-device) has become a catchword in IT departments. As moves toward new technology often do, this one has created its share of na\u00c3\u00afve optimism. An  (  ) study found that  , more than any other benefit, as a reason for allowing employees to work from their personal devices. That contrasts with  (  ), which says that the number of companies running a blacklist of certain mobile apps - preventing their use on company phones - more than doubled in the fourth quarter.  (  ) and  routinely top these blacklists. This would seem to indicate that some employees aren't too worried about their productivity. (KRX:005930)  , and like Intel, it found a \"gap\" between what employees and their bosses expect from mobile devices. The average worker sees them as an opportunity to stay connected and conveniently handle email (or play  ), while IT staff are more concerned with security, and the ability of these devices to run company software. These demands have led the market in two different directions:  (  ) is gaining strength in the enterprise sector - where iOS now holds a 58% share - while  (  ) Android runs away with the general smartphone market.That divergence is an opportunity for the Windows Phone.  (MSFT) mobile operating system now accounts for 4-5% of the  - an underwhelming number, but nevertheless an improvement over recent years.  (NOK) hardware provided an encouraging data point, when it reported that the Lumia brand - its line of Windows Phones - was the company's best performer in the first quarter. The enterprise sector appears to have high expectations; a  found that Windows Phone leads both IOS and Android when it comes to the number of enterprise apps under development. With most business infrastructures designed around Windows PCs, and Microsoft's Office installed on most of those machines, there's hope that the mobile version of Windows will offer a better fit with existing technology.Ultimately, Microsoft's opportunity has less to do with the strength of its own products - always a controversial subject - than with the problems that both iOS and Android bring to the workplace. Tech specialists tend to like Apple's operating system because there are only a few devices to support - the iPhone and iPad - and Apple maintains quality control over both the hardware and software. The situation is less ideal for employees, who find themselves without many options. The iPhone's 4-inch display can be a little small for those who deal with a lot of email, and there are some who prefer a smartphone with a stylus, or a button keyboard. And then there's the price: Apple's products aren't cheap, and while this is less of a concern in the US - where carriers like  (T) are willing to subsidize them - the Apple price tag can be a stumbling block in many parts in the world.Google's operating system, meanwhile, is a headache for administrators. There are thousands of different devices running Android, and they come in many different shapes, sizes, and performance capabilities. Large numbers of them are using old versions of the OS, and since Google encourages hardware makers to tweak the operating system, there's little consistency from one device to the next. Android  , so manufacturers like Samsung feel compelled to add their own security features, bringing even more fragmentation to the ecosystem. The result is that Droid handsets are more likely than Apple's to be the target of malware - in fact,  . That's an issue for IT professionals, who routinely rate security as their greatest concern.Windows Phone presents a happy medium. Microsoft exercises some control over how the OS is used, by setting hardware standards and working through partnerships with phone makers like Nokia and  (TPE:2498), but consumers are still offered a range of manufacturers, sizes, and price points. If Android is the Wild West, and iOS is a closed shop, then Windows Phone is somewhere in the middle.In the short term, Microsoft's best chances are overseas. The company has already established a beachhead in Europe and emerging markets, where partners like Nokia carry more clout. Even more interesting will be Asia, where Windows Phone currently has little presence. There's little love for the Google brand there - few use its products, with the exception of Android - and Microsoft sees an opportunity; it's  (SHE:002502) in an attempt to break open the market.

The acquisition is expected to close by the end of first quarter of 2013.Virsto software addresses the complexity that enterprises face in the virtual environment, particularly related to virtual desktop infrastructures (VDI), large software development and test centers and business-critical applications. Virsto's software helps in streamlining the processes by improving storage performance at a much less cost compared to other software in the market.According to VMware, Virsto reduces cost of storage per desktop by as much as 70%. The acquisition will expand VMware's storage product portfolio, which includes vSphere and vSphere storage appliance. VMware also announced that its parent,  (  ), is planning to license Virsto technologies, which will expand its reach in storage architectures.Currently, Virsto has partnerships with both  (  ) and  (  ), closest competitors of VMware. Although, VMware announced that post acquisition it will continue to support Virsto customers, the future of these partnerships is not clear. This is due to the fact that the primary strategy behind the Virsto acquisition is to fight off increasing competition from Microsoft's Hyper-V software.Acquisitions have played a pivotal part in driving VMware's growth over the past few years. VMware has acquired approximately 18 companies over the last three years.

In our view, business fundamentals of Citrix remain intriguing as the global virtualization market will continue to flourish in the near future.At present, Citrix is concentrating on three broad markets: Desktop virtualization, Web Collaboration & Cloud Computing, and Application Networking. As desktop virtualization has become the top priority for any IT set-up, Citrix is introducing newer innovative products that will facilitate business flexibility, security, and centralized management system.

The company also announced the acquisition of Nicira for $1.26 billion, a software-defined networking company.Revenue for the quarter increased 22.0% year over year to $1.12 billion. This was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher end of management's guided range of $1.10 billion-$1.12 billion. The upside was primarily driven by strong growth from the license and services segments. Moreover, strong demand in the international and domestic markets also contributed to the revenue.License revenue was up 11.3% year over year to $517.2 million, primarily attributable to strong global demand for VMware products. Enterprise License Agreements were approximately 30.0% of second quarter bookings and included four transactions worth $10 million or more.Services revenue jumped 32.7% year over year to $605.8 million. It includes two segments, namely Software maintenance and support and Professional services. The revenues of these two segments increased 33.0% and 24.0%, respectively.VMware stated that with the purchase of new licenses, customers continued to buy more than 24 months of support and maintenance. This reflects their strong commitment to VMware as a core element of their data center architecture and hybrid cloud strategy.US revenues increased 22.0% year over year to reach $551.0 million, while International revenues witnessed a year-over-year growth of 22.0% to $572.0 million in the reported quarter.Gross profit (including stock-based compensation) increased 22.3% year over year to $979.8 million in the second quarter. Gross margin was 87.2% versus 87.0% in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year increase in gross margin was due to higher revenue base.Operating expenses increased 20.4% from the previous-year quarter to $722.5 million due to 14.5% increase in the research and development expenses, 24.9% increase in the selling and marketing expenses and 17.8% increase in the general and administrative expenses. However, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined 90 basis points.Operating income (including stock-based compensation) in the reported quarter jumped 27.9% year over year to $257.3 million. Operating margin was 22.9% in the quarter compared with 21.8% in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by strong revenue growth, higher gross margin base and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.Net income (including stock-based compensation) was $223.9 million, up from $171.5 million in the second quarter of 2011. Net margin was 19.9%, up from 18.6% in previous-year quarter.VMware exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of $5.35 billion, compared with $5.23 billion in the previous quarter. Cash from operations was $391.3 million versus $576.6 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow was $379.7 million in the quarter versus $596.6 million in the previous quarter.VMware expects total revenue to range from $1.11 billion to $1.15 billion, reflecting an increase of 18.0% to 22.0% over the third quarter of 2011. Moreover, revenue from license agreements is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 13% from the previous-year period. However, management expects services revenue to outperform license revenues in 2012.VMware continues to increase its investments in emerging markets, product innovations and acquisitions. Increased investments are expected to hamper operating margin expansion for 2012. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be within a range of 28.75% to 29.75%.For fiscal 2012, revenue is expected in the range of $4.54 billion to $4.635 billion, an increase of 20.5% to 23.0% from fiscal 2011, primarily driven by strong license revenue growth, which is expected to increase within 11.0% to 15.0% range. Operating margin is expected in the range of 30.25% to 31.25%.We believe that VMware's strong and innovative product pipeline along with its strategic acquisitions will enable the company to drive its top-line growth over the long term.

The upside was primarily driven by strong Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) growth. Moreover, strong demand in the international markets, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region, contributed to the revenue growth.For further details please read: In the last 30 days, four out of the 14 analysts covering the stock revised their estimates upward and only one downward revision was noticed. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter 2012 increased by a penny to 48 cents.For the second quarter, the revenue estimate as per Zacks Consensus is $1.12 billion, which is in line with the higher end of management's guided range of $1.10 billion to $1.12 billion. Management's revenue guidance reflects an increase of 19.5% to 21.5% over the previous-year quarter.The company recently released the preliminary result for the second quarter, wherein the company reported revenue of $1.12 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Analysts expect VMware's results to be driven by the continued demand for server virtualization and cloud computing technologies, as it commands a dominating position in this area.Moreover, analysts are optimistic about the prospects of the company benefiting from the data center upgradation in the near term. Additionally, the strategic acquisitions made by VMware not only diversify the company's product portfolio, but also expand VMware's customer base and market share.However, on the hindsight, analysts expect the company to face pricing pressures due to similar virtualization solutions being launched by competitors like  (  ) and  (  ).We believe that VMware's strong and innovative product pipeline along with its strategic acquisitions will enable the company to drive its top-line growth over the long term.

The Wanova acquisition will expand VMware's end-user computing product portfolio. With the combination of Wanova's Mirage and VMware's View, clients will get an integrated desktop virtualization solution in a cost-effective manner.Desktop virtualization essentially eliminates the location-based access problems, as employees in an enterprise can access and manage required business data that are lodged in their respective desktops remotely from multiple devices (PC, Laptops and Mac). According to ABI Research, the  for virtual desktops is projected to grow from about $500 million in 2009 to nearly $5 billion in 2016.Another study by IDC reveals that the virtual client computing market is expected to increase from $2.3 billion in 2011 to approximately $3 billion by 2015. Incidentally, the centralized virtual desktop market is expected to account for nearly a third of the estimated amount.According to a recent study by  (  ), the demand for desktop virtualization should increase manifold. Thereby, Citrix as well as VMware can immensely benefit from this opportunity, as the two companies together account for nearly 80% of the total desktop virtualization market.Incidentally,  (  ) has 15% market share in the aforesaid domain.

Wyse has business ties with tech giants such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Make Technologies provides software and services that modernize traditional applications used by cloud-based systems. The cloud-based products from the company have the capacity to cut cost, reduce risk and re-engineer applications.Wyse Technology will not only enrich Dell's desktop virtualization capabilities, but will also expand its enterprise solutions portfolio, as a whole. On the other hand, inputs from Make Technologies will open up growth opportunities for Dell's core application portfolio management software and services.

I like to attend a few conferences per year to open my eyes to previous unknowns. They can be quite tedious, but every once in a while you pick up an idea or theme worthy of exploring further. I recently attended a Street Tech Conference where Checkpoint (  ) presented and answered questions regarding the industry landscape. The Q&A quickly turned to Imperva (  ) having  competition in their particular security niche. I became more interested when I found out that the co-founder of Checkpoint started Imperva, so I started exploring.Imperva is an independent platform solution that works with multiple databases to protect high-value business data. The idea is that enterprises can segment data in either traditional or virtual data centers.From the  : is its product. However, the last line of its description from the filing had me intrigued.Imperva hasn't been picked up by the research arms of the IPO underwriters yet (i.e. it's not on the generalists' radar yet). JPM, DB, RBC, PacCrest, and Lazard will all likely initiate with Buy/Hold recommendations and targets above the last trade. It seems likely that $35 becomes the consensus target, but as we know, this is largely irrelevant. The market cap is small here - less than $600M, and I believe there may be runway.Again from the filing:The answer is that it's hard to quantify at this point. An investor has to take a stance on whether or not the security spending going forward will be more or less than it is today, and if this could be an emerging segment or not. I find it hard to take the under on either of these in today's environment, given the focus of IT managers on security. There is a  dollar market here. Assuming 0.5 % of today's $27B security spend is allocated to high-value data, it could be a $1B+ opportunity already. Not to mention IMPV doesn't have any serious open source competition.The competition in security is clearly formidable. However, it's hard to believe that a co-founder of Checkpoint would set out to build a company that could easily be replicated. IMPV has a niche business, but this could clearly change.IMPV's revenue has grown at a CAGR of 46% over the last 3 years and they maintain gross margins of 77%. However, I look at Imperva from a Market Cap standpoint for the time being. The company is not profitable, but given that SuccessFactors (SFSF) was just purchased at 10x's revenue by SAP - I don't think a $600M Market Cap on LTM revenue of $70+M is unreasonable. SFSF wasn't growing at 46% over a 3 year period. This is one to watch.Imperva has been added to our Watch List - look for follow up\nafter the Street initiates.Imperva has been added to our Watch List - look for follow up after the Street initiates.

The agreement was well received by the board of directors of both companies and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2012.As smartphone and tablet usage is gaining momentum in the corporate world, the need for virtual network for mobile phones is also on the rise. Higher usage of mobile network has led to significant growth in network traffic. The acquisition of Bytemobile will help Citrix to integrate its NetScaler cloud networking technology with Bytemobile Smart Capacity technology, thereby reducing mobile network traffic.The acquisition will also help Citrix gain access to Bytemobile's huge customer base. It will facilitate improved performance, better service and user experience, and in a cost-effective manner.Continuous product launches and the huge growth opportunity in the virtualization and cloud computing market (Desktop virtualization is expected to touch the 100 million personal computers mark by 2013, and the web conferencing market size will likely reach $4 billion by 2014) will act as positive catalysts for the company going forward.However, the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty may act as a headwind for the company as it limits the IT spending of several firms.

XenDesktop currently accounted for more than 50% of total product revenue.

We believe Citrix can also capitalize on the growing demand for mobile computing since its software enables customers to remotely log in to desktops.Nevertheless, some industry researchers have predicted that of all the corporate desktop PCs, only a few will use virtualization in future due to costs associated with this technology.

While the volume was not incredibly large (2,500 contracts traded on each leg of the spread), the overall strategy is interesting and worthy of commentary.The strategy traded in January 2012 expiry was a broken-wing long iron condor. At roughly 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, the following strikes were active:Evidently, the trader bought the call spread (buying the 65 strike, selling the 75 strike) and simultaneously bought the put spread (buying the 55 strike, selling the 50 strike). The net debit for this spread was $5.95 (for a total of almost $1.5 million for the 2,500-lot).Note that the spread between call strikes is twice as wide as the spread between put strikes. Hence the \"broken wing\" nature of this trade. At expiration in 15 months or so, the maximum gain is $4.05 per spread ($1.01M in total) if CTXS is trading above the short call strike (75). This is the difference in call strikes less the total premium paid for the spread. The maximum loss is limited to the $5.95 premium paid and occurs if CTXS is trading between the long strikes (55 and 65).Below the 50 strike, losses are capped at 95 cents per spread, or the difference between put strikes minus the maximum profit. The lone breakeven level is $70.95, or the short call minus the maximum profit. Anywhere below this level, the spread is in losing territory at options expiration. This is a complex strategy, but the OptionsHouse  can help illustrate potential outcomes.Currently, this strategy has a slightly positive delta skew of roughly 8 per spread. In other words, it should advance (albeit slightly) if CTXS shares gain ground. Vega is also positive, so the spread should theoretically react favorably to a positive change in implied volatility.Speaking of volatility, Citrix is scheduled to report earnings next Thursday (October 21) and analysts expect per-share results of 49 cents. This is an improvement of six cents (14%) from year-ago levels. The company has surprised analysts' expectations to the upside in seven of the last eight reporting periods. Given the long-term nature of the options traded today, this is likely not an earnings-related play. It will be interesting nevertheless to watch and see how these traders react if the stock has a dramatic reaction to its report.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Mware (  ), owned by EMC (  ), leads the virtualization software market with a share of 45% and competes with players like Microsoft (  ), Oracle (  ) and Citrix (  ). VMware reported strong earnings for Q1 2011, which raised its stock price by almost 11% in the past week and also boosted EMC stock by 6%. VMware is crucial for EMC as it constitutes around 40% of its stock price, by our estimates.As a pioneer in virtualization software, VMware's virtualization software share has been declining slowly over the years due to lower pricing of competitor offerings and the growth in adoption of open source software. While we anticipate VMware's share will continue declining to 34% by the end of our forecast period, Trefis members forecast the share will increase for the next few years and eventually decline to current share levels. The member estimates imply an upside of 4% to our EMC stock price estimate.We currently have a  , about 30% above the current market price of $26.91.Firms like Microsoft, Citrix and Oracle have become active in the virtualization market with their own versions of virtualization software and have taken share from VMware which once comfortably dominated the market. VMware had a share of 50% in 2005, which has declined to 45% in 2010. Even in terms of pricing, VMware's virtualization software package is one of the more expensive in the industry. Few of its competitors offer similar software at a fraction of that price. VMware is also challenged by open source products that are usually available for free.VMware reported license revenues of $419 million for the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 34% year on year (YoY). The company saw growth across all geographies - a good sign. The U.S. and international revenues grew 26% and 44%, respectively, compared to first quarter of 2010. During the quarter, VMware introduced new offerings like Cloud Foundry and vCenter Operations, which again boosted the overall performance of the company. If VMware continues to maintain this pace of growth in the following quarters, we can expect it to notch a few market share points higher in coming years.Our  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n Monday, IBM (  ) launched the Virtual Desktop for Smart Business, a new workforce mobility offering that provides anytime, anywhere access to personal desktops from mobile devices - including tablets, netbooks, laptops and thin clients. IBM's offering has come at a crucial point as desktop virtualization adoption picks up among businesses. While the market is already dominated by competitors like VMware (  ) and Citrix (  ), we believe IBM's brand recognition and large network of business partners will help its easy-to-use and well-priced product to gain share in the desktop virtualization market.We currently have a  , about 14% above market price.IBM plans to offer virtual computing solutions to smaller companies, giving these companies greater agility and lowering bot the cost and complexity of managing their PC environment. IBM Virtual Desktop (VDI) will allow Windows or Linux desktops to be hosted and managed centrally, enabling rapid deployment of new applications, automatic software updates and a reduction in help desk requests.While similar solutions are being offered by market leaders VMware and Citrix, IBM is betting on the ease of use and pricing of its product. IBM's solution has self-configuring, self-managing and self-protecting features enable easy installation and management, and can be administered via a web interface. Another advantage IBM seems to have over VMware is that its products' pricing at $150 per user (annually) is lower than VMware's starting price of ~$180 per user.Also, the fact that IBM's VDI solution can either be hosted in the customer data center or through an IBM partner's private cloud environment should facilitate adoption. IBM also has many midsize businesses as clients, which typically lack the IT resources and time required to manage a traditional PC environment.We believe these factors could help IBM become a prominent player in the rapidly growing market for desktop virtualization solutions, which some estimate could reach $1.5 billion by 2014.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Mware (  ) competes with Microsoft (  ) and Citrix (  ) in the virtualization market, which it leads with around 45% share globally. As server virtualization becomes increasingly popular and the benefits offered - less power consumption, space optimization, greater capacity utilization and cost effectiveness - become indispensable to businesses, VMware is likely to benefit going forward.The percent of servers that have been virtualized has increased from around 5% in 2005 to around 14% currently led by multiple benefits of virtualization in terms of ease of use and lower costs, greater interoperability in virtualization, and falling prices and improved functionality. These trends are going to benefit companies like VMware.While we expect the percent of virtualized servers will continue increasing to 27%, the Trefis members expect a higher level of 40%, translating to an upside of 43% to our price estimate for VMware stock.We currently have a  , which is about in line with the current stock price.VMware's server virtualization technology decouples the software from the underlying hardware, enables aggregation of multiple servers, storage infrastructure and networks into pools of resources that can be delivered dynamically, securely and reliably to applications as needed.There are already a number of initiatives to make managing multiple Virtual Machine (VM) vendors easier. Novell's ZENworks VM Manager and Orchestrator products are just one of many products that will offer a way to manage more than one vendor's hypervisor, or virtual machine monitor (  ).Microsoft (with its System Center software), CA and others have announced plans to support both Microsoft's and VMware's hypervisors, while Novell will support Citrix's solution. The eventual goal of these standards is to provide hypervisor interoperability, such as by taking a VM image built on the Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor and running it on a Citrix XenServer hypervisor without having to modify the VM's configuration.Most free products like Microsoft's Virtual Server line continue to be a great way for enterprises to become familiar with VM technology. VMware has introduced support for 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GE) networks and larger memory and disk support with its latest version. Citrix has also boosted the performance of XenServer especially when it comes to XenServer working with the company's flagship Presentation Server product line.The Trefis community forecasts that Percent of Servers Virtualized will increase from 21% in 2011 to around 39% in the coming years, compared to the baseline Trefis estimate of an increase from about 16% to 28% during the same period.

But myself, I've always liked math-there's a certainty to it, and given that everything in the stock market is totally uncertain, it's nice to be able to rely on a trusty partner.(In fact, I actually was planning on getting a minor in math in college, and the first handful of classes-calculus one, two and three, etc.-were no problem. But I specifically remember, at the start of a semester, going to exactly two classes of Linear Algebra (whatever that is), listening to my professor teach for an hour, and having absolutely no idea what he was talking about. None. So I dropped the class and my minor the next day, and haven't regretted it since.)Luckily, any math needed for the stock market is basic stuff, and we all have calculators or spreadsheets that do the heavy lifting for us. Today, I want to touch on the four factors that affect your portfolio-they're really the only four things that determine your portfolio's return.The first is the one that most people focus on: Your winning percentage, or what is often called your batting average. This is simply the number of winning trades versus the number of losing trades.The second factor is routinely named your slugging percentage-that is, the average amount of money you make on your winners, divided by the average amount of money you lose with your losers.The third factor is something that few investors focus on, but actually has an outsized effect on your total return: your average position size (what percent of your portfolio you invest in each stock).The last factor is simply your turnover-i.e., how many trades you make per year (or per quarter or per month).Why write about these four factors? Because, if you're striving to improve your results, these are really the only four things that move your performance. Think of them as levers-changing one up or down usually affects the others, and it has an effect on your performance.For example, if you're determined to have a very high batting average, the chances are you're not going to take huge positions, and you're also going to be taking a lot of quick, small profits \u2026 thus lessening your slugging percentage. Or, if you decide to constantly strive for big winners, you're going to have to give your winners time to move up \u2026 thus decreasing your turnover.Are any of these four factors more important than the others? Well, interestingly, most investors focus on their batting average; in fact, investors subconsciously work to not necessarily maximize profits, but to maximize the number of times they are right. That's why so many investors are quick to sell winners and slow to sell losers (the wrong strategy with growth stocks).Yet it turns out that your batting average is not overly important for your results, or at least, it's not any more important than the other factors. Yes, if you're only correct on 10% or 20% of your trades, you're doing something wrong. But usually, any batting average above 40% should be good enough to produce profits for you.As a growth stock investor, I would say the most important factors are going to be your slugging percentage and your position size. If you're able to keep all your losers relatively small, yet hit on a few big winners each year, while at the same time having the courage to manage a concentrated portfolio (say, 8% to 12% of your portfolio in each position), you'll be in position to make great money.I really don't have any specific conclusion on the best balance between these four factors because, well, there isn't a perfect balance-as usual, it depends on what kind of investor you are and what your true goals are.But the next time you're sitting around looking for ways to improve your results, be sure to do some work ahead of time and determine your batting average, slugging percentage, average position size and turnover. Just examining these four metrics will help you spot the strengths and weaknesses in your investing practice, and hence, help you make more money.---At this point in the overall bull market that began in March 2009, many stocks have made huge moves and have become rather obvious to the crowd. These obvious names can still work, and in fact, it's usually true that the best part of the major uptrend occurs in the last 20% of the move-so names that have already had big runs and are still strong could have more in store should the market's nascent rally continue.An example here is Baidu (  ), which remains one of the top institutional-quality growth stocks in the market. Growth at the firm is truly astounding, and estimates call for more of the same for many quarters into the future. However, after a mega-advance during the past 15 months, it's hard to say BIDU isn't already known by most investors. That means there are more investors who will be willing to book some profit, which could stunt any advance.Just to be clear, I like Baidu a lot and think it could easily have another leg higher, but to be fair, nobody can say the stock is in the second or third inning of its overall advance; more likely, it's in the seventh or eighth, though we'll let the stock decide.In addition to monitoring extended leaders, now is the time to look for new leadership, or stocks that have been good performers during the bull move, but haven't been the much-talked-about names. These stocks tend to have higher potential for the simple reason that most investors don't already have a position \u2026 and thus, if business is truly turning around, lots of institutional investors will be piling in.One such stock is Citrix Systems (  ), which gapped out of a good-looking base last week following a solid earnings report. Before this gap, the stock had been a decent performer during the bull market, more than doubling during the past year, but it certainly wasn't on the lips of every investor. But now, thanks to its industry-leading desktop virtualization product, CTXS is acting well.Even so, my beef with CTXS is that its current and projected growth just isn't there-even after an analyst ratcheted up estimates, the bottom line is only supposed to jump 4% this year and 17% in 2011. Maybe those numbers are just way too low, but my own experience is that these great charts with so-so growth are not easy to handle, at least after they've gapped up.Another idea isn't a stock at all-it's an exchange-traded fund (  ) that tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets index (symbol EEM). Emerging markets, of course, were all the rage for much of last year, and EEM rallied from a bear market low of 19.5 all the way to 41.3 in October.But then, the ETF effectively entered into a long consolidation phase-shares made a marginal new peak at 43 in January, but bobbed (down to 36 in February) and weaved (back up to 44 in April) and bobbed (down to 35 in May) and are now weaving again (back up to 42.5 this week).The bottom line is that shares have been consolidating their huge 2009 advance for more than nine months, and I think EEM is ready to enter a new, sustained upleg. Backing this view is the action of commodity-related stocks, which tend to trade alongside emerging markets (China in particular), and are showing renewed strength.My bet is that if the market rally is for real, EEM could be a leader among ETFs.Until next time,Mike CintoloFor Cabot Wealth AdvisoryThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["itrix Systems is consolidating at its highest levels since the tech bubble burst 11 years ago, and one investor apparently thinks that it's on solid ground.optionMONSTER's tracking systems detected the sale of about 5,000 May 70 puts for $2.30 to $2.45 against open interest of just 832 contracts.
