Splunk is coming off a fiscal first quarter where revenue growth was minimal. The company guided for a loss in Q2. And at 140x forward earnings, Splunk stock is hardly cheap.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\tBut I believe that take would be wrong \u2014 for two reasons.First, simply looking at a few fundamental metrics isn\u2019t sufficient due diligence. It certainly wasn\u2019t a way to make money in the bull market that ended in February. It has hardly been a winning strategy amid the market\u2019s V-shaped recovery, either.High price-to-earnings multiples, in particular, sometimes are a sign of overvaluation. But for a company like Splunk, elevated P/E ratios often are a sign of a company investing in its business ahead of a big long-term opportunity. \u00a0(NASDAQ:), which has been called \u201ctoo expensive\u201d for about two decades now, is one of the best examples. There are many, many, more.It can be easy to forget, but investors in the market are buying a business, not just a stock. A few metrics don\u2019t always show the strength of that business.Second, Splunk\u2019s numbers are being impacted by the company\u2019s shift to the cloud. This essentially is just an accounting issue. But it has the effect of obscuring strong underlying performance.Taking a closer look, the case for Splunk stock becomes evident \u2014 and attractive. I recommended buying Splunk\u2019s stock  in March, and even with a snapback rally leaving shares near the highs, I still think there\u2019s more upside left for long-term investors.Again, Splunk\u2019s Q1 report , to say the least.Revenue increased just 2% year-over-year, which hardly sounds like the performance expected of a growth stock. Guidance for the second quarter suggests top-line growth of less than 1%.Profit numbers look worse. Splunk\u2019s operating loss, even on an adjusted basis, expanded to $111 million in Q1 from just $8 million the year before. The Q2 outlook is better, but not great: its operating loss is expected to come in around $60 million.This looks like the kind of performance that should send a stock tumbling. Yet Splunk stock rose 13% the day after earnings last month.But investors need to understand the impact of the company\u2019s transition to the cloud. Instead of selling software licenses, where revenue is recognized upfront, Splunk is moving investors to recurring cloud-based billing.That shift , as Splunk CEO Doug Merritt explained. But it\u2019s essentially just an accounting issue. Splunk still is closing more and larger deals with more and larger customers, winning the likes of  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:) in the first quarter. Some of the revenue from those deals, however, is being recognized in later years.Adjusting for that shift, Splunk still is growing like gangbusters. Annualized recurring revenue (ARR) increased 52% year-over-year in Q1. Cloud now drives almost 50% of bookings and is growing at a rate over 80%.As for operating losses, there\u2019s a simple explanation. Splunk is spending big on sales and marketing. All of the company\u2019s gross profit in the first quarter, and a bit more, went to that line.That makes sense. Splunk has a massive opportunity. Customers acquired now will contribute high-margin revenue for years to come. Splunk, wisely, is focusing on long-term profits over near-term earnings.Of course, that strategy only works if customers acquired now truly will stick around for years, and perhaps decades. The good news for Splunk stock is that I believe they will.Put simply, Splunk is one of the best \u201cBig Data\u201d plays out there. Its business analytics offering, importantly, creates actionable insights for companies to understand why marketing campaigns are working (or not) or how to improve customer service.Quite literally, Splunk\u2019s platforms makes sense of data that humans simply don\u2019t have the ability to analyze. As I\u2019ve written before, it\u2019s  made by  (NYSE:) in creating digital chess player Deep Blue.Once customers have access to that knowledge, there\u2019s simply no going back. And with megatrends like 5G wireless and artificial intelligence driving increasingly massive amounts of data, the value of Splunk\u2019s platform will only increase.Customers know that. That\u2019s why Splunk is posting explosive growth \u2014 even if accounting standards mean that growth isn\u2019t showing up in this year\u2019s results. That growth, over time, will drive huge profits and cash flow. That in turn will make Splunk stock a long-term winner.Matthew\u00a0McCall\u00a0left Wall Street to actually help investors \u2014 by getting them into the world\u2019s biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

Organizations have loads of digital data that needs to be parsed through and made sense of, and as digital transformation accelerates because of the coronavirus lockdown, data creation and the need to manage it are set to get a big bump.As a leader in cloud-based software for managing big data and cloud operations, Datadog has a bright future, although much of that future has been priced into its shares at this point.According to tech researcher , spending on IT operations management is expected to reach $37 billion by 2023. Datadog says it believes this figure doesn't capture the additional spend on  management, which is a double-digit growth industry at this point. The company helps businesses crunch data in both the legacy IT and modern cloud world. And since Datadog itself was born as a cloud-computing business, picking up market share as organizations migrate to newer systems works in its favor. Image source: Getty Images.Besides its core business, Datadog has been expanding the use of its data monitoring suite to address adjacent IT needs. For example, it launched security monitoring to help IT teams detect unauthorized tampering and orchestrate a response. With a unified software platform, Datadog is trying to break down the barriers between software development, operations, and . \u00a0Thus, its addressable market is massive and still growing. And the company's development of new tools means it should be able to scoop up plenty of new business over the next few years. Based on its easy-to-implement subscription model, the company often signs up new customers using a feature or two, then expands the relationship from there. The beauty of many cloud software providers like Datadog is that they grow as their customers grow -- or in this case, as those customers increase use of cloud-based operations. The strategy has worked exceptionally well so far. After full-year 2019 revenue increased 83% to $363 million, first quarter 2020 revenue grew another 87% year over year to $131 million. Expected full-year 2020 results imply 54% revenue growth at the midpoint of guidance. Datadog is growing fast, but its slice of the IT management pie is still small. There's plenty of room for the company to keep growing. Margins are thin as the company invests for further expansion, but Datadog is free-cash-flow positive (revenue less cash operating and capital expenses), generating $21 million over the last year. \u00a0A number of trends are intersecting that could keep the data analytics industry riding higher for years. But the recent pandemic has caused another trend that could work against Datadog: Some organizations are looking to simplify and consolidate the number of IT vendors they use. Legacy firms like  and  have already been addressing that possibility the last few years via acquisition and internal development of new tools to address markets\u00a0adjacent to their original services.Thus, if Datadog is to maintain its momentum, development of its data analytics platform will need to continue. The company itself acknowledges its sizable competition, including , , and even chipmaker , which has added infrastructure software management to diversify its hardware business the last few years. Then, there are other firms focused on data analytics, like the aforementioned Splunk, as well as .And on the cloud monitoring front are the three biggest names in the business.\u00a0Web Services, 's , and Microsoft Azure each have their own similar offering as well as integration to third-party services like Datadog. Put simply, with Datadog and its industry growing so fast, plenty of companies have piled onto the bandwagon. For now, this small upstart has been one of the best-performing companies in its segment. But eventually all of the competition will take its toll. Expect its growth trajectory to decelerate over the next five years.Nevertheless, its cloud-native software should serve it well in the coming years. But don't think that Datadog's potential will automatically equate to further share price increases like in the last few quarters. This is a stock priced for exceptional business growth. As profits are plowed back into the business right now, investors are left with the price-to-sales ratio to stick a valuation on the company. And at 40 times trailing 12-month revenue, investors are pricing in at least a couple years' more of performance on par with the recent past. For comparison, here's what Splunk and Elastic go for on a price-to-trailing-revenue basis.Data by .To be fair, Datadog fetches a higher premium because of its higher growth. But Elastic wasn't too shabby, putting up 60% revenue growth in its last reported quarter. And while Splunk's revenue was only up 2% according to its most recent report, annual recurring revenue grew 52% as it makes its transition to cloud-based software service. With its hefty premium at the moment, Datadog will need to continue outpacing its industry peers by a wide margin to justify its valuation -- let alone continue growing at the rate they have been since the IPO last year. And the keys will be continual innovation of new services and picking up new customers it can expand relationships with, especially as larger peers already provide many of those features.Datadog has experienced early success and has already established itself as a leader in the IT monitoring industry. I think its business will be much larger in five years than it is today, although I'm not buying at the moment because of the steep price tag.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Revenue in the first quarter increased a meager 2% from a year ago to $434 million, but that obscures massive growth in its cloud-based data analytics business as the company transitions to new accounting standards more suitable for a modern-day software outfit.The coronavirus lockdown is, of course, clouding the outlook for the rest of the year, but digital transformation is accelerating as organizations look to quickly update operations to avoid any future disruption. For Splunk, which recently surpassed  as the market share leader in IT performance analysis, work-from-home and shelter-in-place mean more fuel just got added to its growth engine. Image source: Getty Images.Splunk's Q1 results came in as expected, with its cloud transition taking basic revenue growth down to a meager low single-digit rate. However, as I , the company's migration to a cloud-centric software model is hiding the massive growth actually taking place under the surface. Splunk said its customers' demand for cloud products was once again much greater than anticipated, and it reported an 81% year-over-year surge in that department (with cloud representing 44% of software bookings in the quarter, up from 35% just three months ago). Annual recurring revenue (ARR), which combines renewable cloud contracts and term sales and which now makes up nearly all of the revenue mix, was up 52% to $1.78 billion. That's impressive because management had said to expect a mid-40% increase in ARR this year. But the massive global transformation to digital-first that has been boosting Splunk's business the last few years is stronger than ever with the pandemic on everyone's mind. The acquisition of cloud monitoring outfit  last year also helps, as will a new strategic partnership with 's  . \u00a0The company did withdraw its specific guidance for the current full-year period, but it also provided a little visibility into the second quarter. Revenue is expected to be $520 million -- roughly flat with the year-ago period. However, as the company still laps its old way of billing customers, ARR is still expected to be up in the mid-40% range this year and up by a similar rate in the next two years following. The fast move to the cloud is creating some near-term hiccups, the biggest glare coming off the negative operating profit margin. The adjusted operating margin was negative 25.6% in Q1 and expected to be negative 10% to 15% in Q2. Ouch. \u00a0However, stopping short at operating margin doesn't tell the whole story. Free cash flow -- revenue less cash operating and capital expenses and excluding non-cash expenses -- remains in positive territory and was $31.3 million in Q1. That's a 56% year-over-year increase and good for a free cash flow profit margin of 7%. As its new cloud and term software license agreements start to kick in, that margin should only increase. The balance sheet is also in good shape, with cash and equivalents of $1.76 billion and debt (which can be converted into stock) of $1.74 billion at the end of April 2020.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, there is plenty to like about Splunk. New customers like , which is using Splunk to help with its , and an expanded data monitoring relationship with e-commerce giant   help reinforce the long-term tailwind propelling this data analytics firm higher.

This bodes well for cybersecurity stocks, many of which use a software as a service (SaaS) model.Another catalyst is the emerging 5G infrastructure that raises additional concerns about connected devices adding strain to cybersecurity measures. In response to a question from InvestorPlace, Braden Allenby, President\u2019s Professor and Lincoln Professor of Engineering and Ethics at the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University, wrote, \u201c5G may well be an important enabling technology for the \u2026 Internet of Things (IoT), which will deploy literally billions of sensors, processors, and chips across global systems.\u201dMore devices mean more threats. Says Allenby, \u201cthese data and assets can in turn be suborned for any number of purposes, from feeding neural net AI at scale, to forming massive bot armies that can then be used for nefarious purposes.\u201dAdding to this dilemma is the increased volume of data. As Allenby said, there is now an independent data economy: \u201cData have independent value, and all things (being) equal, the tech firm that has the most data has a better chance to win the AI (artificial intelligence) race.\u201dWith that in mind, here are six cybersecurity stocks to buy that take advantage of this growing trend.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\t\nLike most of the cybersecurity stocks on this list, Palo Alto Networks is benefiting from the surge of employees who are now working from home. PANW stock is up nearly 20% in the last month. The company delivered an earnings report that . But what was more important than the quarterly results was the forward guidance.The earnings report made clear that the company is benefiting from the mitigation efforts caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. With that trend likely to continue to at least some extent, that should be a catalyst for this cybersecurity stock.Palo Alto is an example of a company that has successfully pivoted from a firewall model to cloud-based cybersecurity products such as GlobalProtect and Prisma Access. And the company also uses a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model that investors love because it means recurring, predictable revenue.In a statement that accompanied the company\u2019s earnings report, CEO Nikesh Arora said the transition that is occurring due to the Covid-19 pandemic could last up to 18 months. \u201cWe believe this will prompt key trends to accelerate, including remote working models, shift to the cloud, and focus on AI/ML and automation to drive effective cybersecurity outcomes.\u201dSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\t\nZscaler is another of the cybersecurity stocks that is benefiting from the work-from-home movement. ZS stock is up over 115% in 2020. Zscaler uses a cloud-native platform to provide secure web gateways help users access any application from anywhere on any device.Zscaler\u2019s signature product is its Private Access (ZPA) product that allows users to incorporate applications without network access. In its most recent quarter, the company had a  mostly propelled by the needs of companies to connect remote workers. Zscaler posted a 40% year-over-year (YoY) increase in billings at $110.5 million. And in the all-important category of billings, Zscaler also posted an increase of 55% or $131.3 million.Partnerships are a key part of Zscaler\u2019s business model. The company was in two  (NASDAQ:) Security 2020 Partner Awards. \u201cOffice 365 and Azure adoption remain long-term tailwinds for Zscaler,\u201d said Needham analysts Alex Henderson. \u201cZscaler continues to train Microsoft professionals on their solution and is seeing positive traction with the salesforces working together.\u201dThe company also partners with CrowdStrike and is actively working in tandem with the company to help capture more market share.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\t\nThat brings us to CrowdStrike. Whereas Zscaler and other companies like it help secure data, CrowdStrike works to protect the devices that are being used to view the data. This is called endpoint security. According to the Gartner research firm, it\u2019s a field that is getting crowded. However, according to Gartner, CrowdStrike is still one of the leaders in this space.CrowdStrike has a  at approximately 34x earnings. However, the company may be getting to ready to zoom higher as  (NASDAQ:) is now using the cybersecurity company in response to concerns over its security problems.CRWD stock has nearly doubled in 2020 and has shrugged off the effects of the pandemic-induced selloff in March. The consensus analysts\u2019 price target suggests a 12% decline for the stock. However, the analysts that have issued ratings since May 1 have an average price target of $95, with three out of five analysts having a rating of $95 or higher.Source: Shutterstock\n\t\nQualys is one of CrowdStrike\u2019s competitors in the endpoint security sector. Qualys signs up enterprise clients on their platform, consolidates their security and compliance stacks which help those clients cut their overall IT spending.QLYS stock is at an all-time high and may look moderately expensive compared to its peers at . However, the company is on an upward trajectory. The company touts its Vulnerability, Management, Detection and Response (VMDR) tool. Rather than having the customer handle its cybersecurity through a bundle of apps, VMDR handles everything as a single app.But what really seems to excite investors at the moment is the company\u2019s free cash flow (FCF) of over 40%. This helps offset the company\u2019s annual revenue growth that at around 14% is less than some analysts may prefer.And as the economy begins to reopen, Qualys has minimal exposure to three segments (retail, hospitality, and travel) that look like they may lag behind other industries.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\t\nAt first glance, Splunk doesn\u2019t look like it belongs in the category of cybersecurity stocks. Its main function is to help customers analyze data and generate solutions based on that analysis. But that data still needs to be protected, and Splunk has been producing data-driven cybersecurity solutions since 2018. As Luke Lango recently cited, one of Splunk\u2019s  is  (NYSE:).That addition makes Splunk a relevant player in the work from home movement, which should be a catalyst for growth in the near future. Despite multiple years of more than 25% in revenue growth, Splunk is not yet profitable. But that shouldn\u2019t deter investors. The company is forecasting continued sales growth of over 20% over the next few years. As it does, Splunk\u2019s high margins should also increase.By including cybersecurity within its existing portfolio of products, Splunk will be able to hold its own as the cybersecurity sector is  in the near-term. SPLK stock is up over 20% this year and has nearly doubled since the March selloff.Source: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\t\nI get excited about OKTA stock because I appreciate the . The limitation of many cloud-based security systems is that they treat the company\u2019s entire ecosystem as a fortress. The problem is that if the company\u2019s ecosystem is a lock, then its employees are the key. In a world where work-from-home figures to be the new normal, security gets challenging when the lock and the key are separated.That\u2019s where Okta comes in. The company has a solution that essentially makes each employee part of the ecosystem. Wherever they go, they carry their security with them. Okta also crushed its last earnings report. OKTA stock is responding accordingly, climbing about 60% in 2020.If there is any question about investing in Okta, it would be a concern that the company gave a rather conservative estimate for full-year revenue after blowing through their first-quarter revenue expectations. In an earnings season where many companies have pulled full-year guidance, I\u2019m willing to give the company a pass. Any recovery will seem to be U-shaped at best, so a more conservative forecast may be for the best.Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

Its stock rose after the earnings news, hitting a 52-week high of $192.75 on June 3.Given the stock price rise in recent weeks, does it make sense to invest in Splunk? A deep dive into the company can deliver an answer.Image source: Getty Images.Splunk plays in the big data arena. Big data is the term describing the large amounts of data a company collects, usually exceeding the organization's ability to extract insights from that data. Businesses must turn to providers such as Splunk to ingest, analyze, and make sense of the data.Big data is big business for Splunk and others operating in this industry. Forecasts predict its market size to reach $103 billion by 2027 from $49 billion last year.And Splunk has captured its share of clients in the space. At the end of the company's fiscal first quarter, more than 90 businesses in the Fortune 100 used Splunk.The company is transitioning its products to a cloud-based platform with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscription pricing model. This approach allows Splunk to generate revenue on a recurring basis, charging its enterprise customers fees to manage and analyze data.\u00a0SaaS also reduces the seasonal buying fluctuations inherent in its previous model, where clients purchased a perpetual software license for an upfront cost.Splunk's move away from perpetual licensing caused license revenue to drop 27% year over year in the first quarter to $148.4 million. However, cloud services revenue increased 81% to $112.2 million,\u00a0where it's poised to soon eclipse licensing revenue.Splunk's capabilities allow it to do business in growing areas such as IT systems monitoring and security. Technology infrastructures require customer data to be protected yet accessible, and also that IT teams can react quickly to address . Research firm  ranked Splunk first in market share for security information event management, which uses data analysis to identify security threats in real time, and tops in market share for performance analysis, which uses tools such as artificial intelligence.In addition, Splunk possesses a solid balance sheet. Its $1.77 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q1 are expected to cover business needs for the next year.\u00a0Its total assets were $5.2 billion compared to total liabilities of $3.4 billion.Splunk's business experienced double-digit growth in fiscal year 2020, but that streak ended with its 2021 first-quarter results. Splunk's first-quarter revenue rose 2% year over year to $434 million. Last year's first-quarter revenue grew 36% year over year.The sudden deceleration in the Q1 revenue growth rate is understandable. The novel coronavirus pandemic caused a global economic downturn, and Splunk pulled its full-year guidance as a result.Even so, Splunk's offerings are well-positioned for continued growth. The company announced a partnership with 's Google Cloud product in May, making Splunk's cloud solution available to Google Cloud customers along with future plans to integrate with Google Cloud's security services. Splunk has performed some strategic acquisitions, such as SignalFx in October, that strengthened Splunk's monitoring solutions. It also expects fiscal second-quarter revenue to grow year over year to $520 million from $517 million.Splunk uses annual recurring revenue (ARR) to represent the value of its customer contracts.\u00a0Its Q1 2021 ARR of $1.78 billion\u00a0was up from Q4's $1.68 billion\u00a0and the third quarter's $1.44 billion,\u00a0illustrating the company's ongoing growth trend.The combination of the big data industry's growth along with Splunk's ability to capture its share of the market means Splunk has continued revenue upside ahead. While the company operated at a net loss of $305.6 million in the first quarter, it's common for  to operate at a loss. Splunk's free cash flow increased year over year to $31.3 million from $20.1 million, which is a good sign, especially when coupled with its solid balance sheet.Revenue over the next few quarters will reflect the pandemic's economic impact, so it's not a good gauge of Splunk's long-term potential. Instead, continued growth in ARR confirms that Splunk's shift to a SaaS model is working. The lower upfront SaaS costs enable more businesses to adopt Splunk's solutions, and once invested, the switching costs are high, locking in that recurring revenue stream.These factors position Splunk for continued success. I  that Splunk was poised to deliver results for investors, and even with its recent price jump, the stock is still a buy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That\u2019s a saying that\u2019s saved cautious investors a whole lot of money over the years. And it just might apply to  (NASDAQ:) and Splunk stock after its impressive run-up.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\t\nThat being said, there could be more gains ahead for Splunk. Taking profits now might not seem like a great idea if you\u2019re expecting much more upside in the near-term. After all, \u201cbuy high, sell higher\u201d does work sometimes.But the price action doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. To help you make the most informed decision, it\u2019s important to examine Splunk\u2019s fiscal health. Moreover, investors should be aware that the company\u2019s undergoing a shift in its business model.If you\u2019re on board with that, then it could make sense to hang on to Splunk shares even at a relatively high valuation.The novel coronavirus crisis has forced many companies to change their business models or get left behind. Thus, we can\u2019t really blame businesses for doing what it takes to adapt and adjust in the face of sweeping changes in the economic landscape.As\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor Chris Markoch explains,  is \u201cto help customers analyze data and generate solutions based on that analysis.\u201d However, Splunk certainly isn\u2019t the only competitor in the data visualization space.Amid the coronavirus pandemic, businesses need something to differentiate themselves in order to create an economic moat. For Splunk, pivoting to the cloud could provide a competitive advantage as the work-from-home paradigm is likely to persist for a while.To that end, Splunk recently announced  to the company\u2019s current offering of core platform solutions. Thus, the company is rolling out its latest round of enhancements to Splunk Cloud, Splunk Connected Experiences, and Splunk Data Stream Processor.Chief Product Officer Sendur Sellakumar emphasized the need for Splunk\u2019s clientele to adapt, just as his own company is attempting to do: \u201cAs organizations evolve, they face many challenges including the transition from on-premises to the cloud, which increases operational complexity \u2026 With Splunk\u2019s cloud and platform solutions, organizations can minimize those complexities and make the shift to the cloud with high scale and performance in order to achieve business value much faster.\u201dIf you\u2019re invested in Splunk stock now, please understand that you\u2019re taking a stake in a company that\u2019s different than it was a year ago or even six months ago. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but it\u2019s worth noting.On the fiscal front, another important thing to understand about Splunk is succinctly reported by Markoch: \u201cDespite multiple years of more than 25% in revenue growth, Splunk is not yet profitable.\u201dSo what we have here is a company that\u2019s not profitable, but whose shares are trading not just near their 52-week high, but close to their all-time high price. That\u2019s not a combination that\u2019s likely to appeal to value-focused investors.It\u2019s also a fairly compelling reason to take profits on Splunk stock if you\u2019ve already met your profit target. As far as taking a new position goes, it might be better to wait for a sizable share price dip.At this point, a long position in Splunk shares is basically a bet on the company\u2019s cloud business. If you need proof of that, check out Splunk\u2019s revenues from the company\u2019s .The numbers pretty much speak for themselves. The total quarterly revenues were up 2% year-over-year, while the cloud-business revenues were up 81%. Need we say more?Should you plunk down your money on Splunk? And if you\u2019re already invested in Splunk stock, should you stay the course or take the money and run?It depends on your outlook regarding Splunk\u2019s cloud segment and whether it can carry the full weight of the company\u2019s recently evolved business model.

This outsized performance is entirely deserved.Stay-at-home orders in Latin America, where MercadLibre operates,  of the e-commerce platform. During the first quarter of 2020, the company saw a drop in spending for nonessential items. But quarterly spending on essential items surged more than 100% year over year. Triple-digit growth likely means many consumers are giving MercadoLibre a try for the first time, which could be an enduring tailwind.MercadoLibre didn't only record triple-digit growth in e-commerce, but also in its fintech solutions. Total payment volume (TPV) grew 82% in local currency when considering both purchases on MercadoLibre and off. But growth for TPV off-platform was 139%, good for another quarter of .

Image source: Getty Images.Data-analytics company Splunk just reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and total quarterly revenue grew a meager 2% year over year. How can a low-single-digit growth stock make you rich?\u00a0Splunk is transitioning toward a subscription-revenue model. In Q1, annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew a more impressive 52% to $1.8 billion. This mirrors the 54% growth it reported for full-year fiscal 2020. The company is guiding for ARR to grow at a 40% compound annual growth rate for the next three fiscal years. That would put ARR at $4.6 billion by the end of calendar 2023.Recurring revenue presents a challenge for investors. With traditional sales, income and expenses tend to line up on the balance sheet. But with recurring revenue, some expenses are recorded now while the revenue is recorded later. Therefore, you have to drill down a little deeper to understand a company's profitability trajectory. In Splunk's case (just looking at one line item), sales and marketing expenses grew 23% in fiscal 2020 from fiscal 2019, compared to 54% ARR growth. This expense only grew by 14% in Q1.\u00a0As recurring-revenue growth outpaces expenses, Splunk is on a profitable path.With still-developing trends like the  and  driving machine-generated data creation, I'm betting big data will only get bigger over time.

The company had to close many stores, and e-commerce isn't practical for heavy flooring.Floor & Decor has the liquidity to survive this time, and there's evidence of pent-up demand. Management said in the Q1 conference call that there's been a \"surge\" in sales of samples. It suggests that customers are still thinking about updating their floors, and once life returns to normal, F&D's sales will quickly return.This is a company with a history of strong revenue and earnings growth poised to continue. Floor & Decor stock may only be 8% down from its all-time highs, but I believe there's still plenty of enriching upside left for those willing to hold for a decade or more.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The gains have driven by a combination of factors, namely the rate of customers embracing its platform during the pandemic. But expectations are now sky high, or should I say, sky higher.That said, Splunk is no stranger to high expectations. The stock is valued at a forward P/E of 2800, compared to a 19 forward multiple of the rest of the market. Can it live up to expectations? Investors will find out when the machine data analytics company reports 1st quarter fiscal 2021 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. Strong revenue and earnings growth projections are commonplace for the software specialist, which has topped the Street\u2019s revenue and profit estimates in ten straight quarters.The company earlier this month announced a strategic cloud partnership with Google (\u00a0,\u00a0). The venture calls for both companies to roll out new native integrations with Anthos, Google Cloud Security Command Center, and Google Cloud's operations suite. According to the press release, the cloud integration will enable new and existing customers to share data between applications. This is one example of Splunk\u2019s solid partner base, which, among others, comprises the likes of Amazon (), Accenture () and Cisco ().These relationships, where it aims to integrate its products has helped it win new customers, evidenced by the 450 new enterprise customers addd in the fourth quarter. So not only do thee partnerships enhance Splunk\u2019s exposure, particularly among enterprise customers, it stands to be a significant growth catalysts for quarters ahead. As for this quarter, investors should expect similar to higher results heading, which bodes well for the stock.For the quarter that ended March, Wall Street expects the Splunk to lose 54 cents per share on revenue of $442.85 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 2 cents per share on revenue of $424.85 million. For the full year, ending December, earnings are projected to be 13 cents per share, down from $1.88 per share a year ago, while revenue of $2.55 billion would mark a 8% rise year over year.Splunk is benefiting from strong demand for the company\u2019s enterprise, security and cloud solutions. The company understands customer behavior and can assess online end-to-end business transactions. As such, quarterly revenue projections which calls for increase of about 5% seems pretty conservative, given the fact that Splunk added 450 new enterprise customers in the fourth quarter. Another revenue it seems pretty-much a given at this point.However, Splunk's outlook and its billings forecast will be the most closely-watched aspects of the report. The management has steered the business to a recurring revenue model. Investors will be looking for commentary on the progress of that transition. Splunk recently acquired SaaS cloud monitoring company SignalFx, spending $1.05 billion in cash and stock. Analysts will want to know how the company plans to integrate this deal and what type of profits it will yield.\u00a0All told, Splunk has a lot to prove Thursday. While the company has demonstrated incredible growth over the past couple of years, the stock looks fully valued at these levels. Accordingly, Splunk will need to demonstrate why it is better-positioned to capitalize on the growing adoption of cloud, data analytics and how it it is expanding its addressable market.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["y Ambar Warrick and Pawel GorajU.S. stock indexes were set for a near-flat open on Friday as investors weighed hopes of more stimulus to revive an ailing economy against simmering Sino-U.S. trade tensions.China on Friday unveiled details about its plan to impose a national security law in Hong Kong that could see mainland intelligence agencies set up bases in the global financial hub, raising fears of more pro-democracy protests.

[Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Ken Tinsley. Sir, you may begin. -- Great. Thank you, Valerie and good afternoon, everyone. With me on the call today are Doug Merritt and Jason Child. After market close today, we issued a press release, which is also posted on our website. Also note that we have posted supplemental material on the Investor Relations web page as well. This conference call is being broadcast live via webcast and following the call, an audio replay will be available on our website.On today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including financial guidance and expectations such as our forecast for our second quarter as well as duration, revenue mix, full year and long-term ARR and cash flow; and trends in our markets as well as expectations regarding our products, technology, strategy, customers, markets, acquisitions and investments. These statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and actual events or results may differ materially. Please refer to documents we filed with the SEC, including the 8-K filed with today's press release. Those documents contain risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are being made as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements. If this call is reviewed after today, the information presented during this call may not contain current or accurate information.We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the press release and on our website.With that, let me turn it over to Doug. -- Thank you, Ken and thanks, everyone for joining us. In the face of unprecedented volatility and uncertainty, we are focused on remaining a trusted partner to our customers and help them navigate the fundamental changes in how they operate while keeping their data accessible and secure.In Q1, customers continued to prioritize investments in Splunk and drove ARR growth of 52% over last year, while our transition to cloud accelerated ahead of our expectations. This is also the first quarter with our sales force fully shifted from a total contract value, or TCV, sales motion to a more cloud and subscription-oriented annual contract value, or ACV focus, which we believe better aligns with our customer buying preferences and is consistent with our shift toward cloud-based delivery.With that as a backdrop, I'd like to discuss a few patterns that have emerged this quarter and the impacts to our business. First, at this time of remote work, we've seen increased demand for Splunk Cloud, driving our cloud mix north of 40%, the highest ever in our history and well above our expectations going into the quarter. In addition to the faster time-to-value from cloud, our customers also gain business continuity and risk avoidance, higher quality experience with decreased complexity and an accelerated rate of innovation through faster releases and improvements gleaned from real-time cross-customer insights.Second, not surprisingly, customers across all sectors are trying to understand the economic impact of the current COVID-19 business environment. As a result, signed contracts this quarter tended to be shorter in duration, going from 34 months in Q4 to 27 months in Q1. We see this being especially prominent in sectors hardest hit by the crisis like retail, hospitality and travel. The shorter contract duration impacted overall TCV, which is reflected in slower RPO bookings growth and lower total revenue recognized in the quarter. However, when looking at contract value on an ACV basis, which cuts to the noise of changes in multi-year duration, year-over-year growth was actually higher in Q1 than we've seen in the last four quarters.Looking further out. Visibility of the next few quarters is limited, primarily due to the macro environment. Our focus will be to ensure that we're tightly connected to our customers and partners as they work through their dynamic environments as well as taking care of our employees' well-being, enabling their productivity and to continue to optimize our investments.One thing is clear to us, data matters more than ever in this digital world, and every organization is on a journey to bring data to everything. We pride ourselves on being a world-class product company. And we are leaning in on innovation, so we can help our customers bring data to every question, every decision and to every action with a cloud-first mindset.As we continue our aggressive shift to the cloud, we are doubling down on investments in this area, exemplifying our focus on bringing more data to more customers. I hope you saw our recently announced partnership with Google and the news that Splunk Cloud will now be available on Google Cloud. This builds on our cloud-first mindset and offers our customers increased flexibility and choice for real-time visibility across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.In addition, Splunk continues to strengthen its strategic relationship with AWS, working across product, go-to-market and the field. Recently, Splunk and AWS launched the Workload Migration Program to help migrate on-premises legacy Splunk Enterprise workloads to Splunk Cloud running on AWS. We also announced a newly launched AWS service-ready program, Lambda Ready, which recognizes Splunk's proven solutions for customers to build, manage and run serverless applications.In the application development and DevOps space, we recently released our cloud-native SignalFx microservices APM offering, a complete integrated observability solution that provides the world's most robust and scalable way to monitor and manage complex and distributed application portfolios. We are the only Company in this space capable of scaling up to meet needs of large enterprises, and our work was recently validated by our placement in the Visionary category in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for APM.Since the start of this pandemic, one of our key priorities has been helping our customers transition to their new virtual working environment. Splunk's core tenets are about providing near real-time visibility, the ability to act quickly on data and applying Splunk to virtually unlimited use cases across an organization. These tenets have been fundamental to our COVID rapid response efforts.We've rolled out several free trials and offerings to our customers, including our Remote Work Insights, or RWI, which provides customers with dashboards and key metrics to gauge the connectedness and productivity of their IT and cloud infrastructure as they rapidly shift their populations to remote work. The response from our customers have been overwhelmingly positive, and we're continuing to look at ways to enhance RWI, most recently with Zoom usage data.In collaboration with customers and partners, we also developed a public health platform available free of charge to public health agencies. It delivers an end-to-end COVID-19 testing experience, managing online citizen intake, symptom evaluation and appointment scheduling. The platform is now live in Tarrant County, Texas, the 15th largest county in the US. We're excited about the potential of this solution to help state and local governments across the country.We stayed in close touch with our customers to ensure they're getting the support that they need, and we're hearing from them that they continue to value Splunk as a trusted and strategic vendor. We're encouraged by the many customer stories we've heard in the first quarter, where organizations are turning to Splunk more than ever to help them navigate this volatile environment with the power of data.Let me share some of our wins from the quarter. Zoom, the leader in video communications, became a new Splunk Enterprise Security customer. During COVID-19, Zoom has helped keep the world connected. With Splunk Enterprise Security, Zoom will gain an analytics-driven SIM, giving them visibility into potential security threats at machine speed. We're a longtime Zoom customer, and I'm very grateful for their support in helping keep Splunk connected.Longtime customer Allied Irish Banks, or AIB, expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise and ITSI to help provide insights and take action on increased digital transaction data brought on by COVID-19. To help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, AIB has raised their payment threshold for contactless payments, encouraging customers to use their cards and mobile devices versus cash. With increased activity on their systems, AIB leveraged Splunk to ensure a stable and reliable payment experience for customers.The state of Illinois became a new Splunk Cloud and ITSI customer to help them better track and monitor the emergency response to COVID-19 across the state. With Splunk, the Prairie State can ensure that their remote workforce of 30,000 public servants can stay online while also helping them quickly monitor overburden systems that provide critical benefits to citizens. This effort ensures the continuity of critical services to the people of Illinois.Longtime customer Shopify significantly expand their use of Splunk, purchasing the newly launched SignalFx microservices APM platform. Shopify is a leading omnichannel commerce platform, and they selected Splunk to help maintain their high observability standards as they grow in scale and complexity. With Splunk, Shopify can quickly identify and source application challenges in their complex and distributed environment.And Take-Two Interactive Software, a leading developer, publisher and marketer of interactive entertainment for consumers around the globe, including renowned games, Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption and NBA 2K, expand their use of Splunk Cloud to increase their visibility into the security of their environment. Splunk helps ensure that Take-Two's consumers have well run, safe and fun online environments when playing their games.All these great wins with our customers are thanks to the support provided by our committed Splunkers. At the onset of this crisis, we tirelessly analyzed all available data, which was showing us that without action, global healthcare systems could quickly become overrun, and supply chains will be depleted. As a result, we voluntarily closed our offices and froze all business travel well before the government mandates went into effect. I want to thank our 6,000 Splunkers for their passion, tenacity and empathy as we've adjusted to a new normal. They have created a truly unique culture, which I am so proud to be part of.In closing, data-driven decision making matters more than ever and has fueled a very strong quarter for us. We're aggressively pursuing our transition to the cloud and are well ahead of original expectations. I want to thank our customers and partners who have been tremendously supportive during these times. I also want to thank all the frontline workers, those in healthcare who are risking their lives keep us healthy, those in grocery and retail, who are helping us with the essentials that we need, and those in the field of data, who are ensuring their organizations can make decisions based on the most reliable and accurate information available.I'll now hand over to Jason for more color on Q1. Jason? -- Thanks, Doug and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As expected, the environment in Q1 created many challenges, but there were a number of positive signs that indicate our business fundamentals remain strong. As Doug mentioned, we had high customer engagement, and we saw sustained demand for security and IT scale and use cases driven largely by increased work-from-home demands. However, many customers were hesitant to commit to long-term contracts, especially for large orders. This resulted in lower overall average contract duration and total contract value. An unexpected positive has been a faster shift to cloud as customers increasingly turn to our SaaS service given its rapid time-to-value and infrastructure cost avoidance attributes.On our last call, I reported that cloud contributed about 35% of total software bookings last year with a target of over 60% in fiscal '23. We expected that trajectory to be fairly linear. But in Q1, cloud represented 44% of total software bookings, far higher than we had planned. Again, it's likely that this was driven by our customers' response to COVID, but we think we can transition the cloud even faster.As we've said, in a rapidly transitioning term to cloud model, revenue growth is muted as upfront term license revenue is replaced with ratable services revenue over time. A faster transition will create a greater headwind on total revenue growth, as you'd expect. As a result, we are focused on other primary growth metrics to assess the overall bookings momentum in the business. We've highlighted ARR as the optimal indicator of growth because it normalizes the impacts from term/cloud mix as well as contract duration. In addition to ARR, we also track RPO growth as a good indicator of new business momentum versus RPO bookings, which is distorted by a lower revenue growth from cloud/mix shift as well as changes in duration. Until mix stabilizes, ARR is the best measure for durable growth.As volatile and uncertain as the current environment is, we're pleased with our execution in the quarter overall. We ended the period with total ARR of $1.77 billion, up 52% over last year. ARR was comprised of $480 million from cloud and $1.29 billion from term license and maintenance contracts. We ended Q1 with total RPO of $1.72 billion, up 44% over Q1 of last year. The portion of RPO which we expect to recognize in revenue over the next 12 months was about $1 billion at period end, which is up 30% year-over-year. Additionally, we recorded 81 orders greater than $1 million in total contract value during the quarter, up from 46 in Q1 last year, indicating both greater adoption and high strategic value we deliver to our customers.Turning to the P&L. First quarter revenues were $434 million, essentially flat year-over-year. Cloud revenue was $112 million, up 81% over last year. On gross margin, the high growth in our cloud business is driving improving scale in our overall cost structure. Non-GAAP cloud gross margin was nearly 60% in Q1, which is a significant milestone toward our target of at least 70% next year. To highlight the progress of cloud, we are now breaking out cloud revenue and related COGS on the face of the income statement. Total non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 76%, down on a year-over-year basis due to the greater proportion of revenue contribution coming from cloud. Non-GAAP operating margin was negative 26% in Q1, which was in line with plan.Just a few comments on the balance sheet. Our liquidity is strong, and we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and investments. Our accounts receivable turnover was mostly unchanged in the quarter, although some customers have asked for modest payment concessions, which we're evaluating and accommodating on a case-by-case basis. The overall quality of our accounts receivable remains exceptionally high. And at this point, we don't anticipate any material impact to our full year cash collection target.Turning to guidance. There are three items that I want to ensure are crystal clear. First, our fundamentals remain strong. We are confident in our ARR growth target of mid-40% this year, and we continue to expect that our operating cash flow will be consistent with last year.Second, due primarily to cloud acceleration and variability in duration, our revenue and operating margin targets are lower for Q2 than our original plan. Specifically, we expect total revenues of approximately $520 million in Q2, roughly flat year-over-year. Slower revenue growth is directly related to higher cloud mix, which is now expected to be in the high 40% range, the highest ever. This will also put pressure on op margin, so we expect non-GAAP operating margin of negative 10% to negative 15% in Q2.Third, for the remainder of the year, given the unpredictability of our accelerating cloud transformation and variability in duration, we're withdrawing our guidance for revenue and operating margin.In closing, it was a great quarter with strong ARR growth and increasing momentum in cloud. We look forward to updating you on our progress and outlook for the remainder of the year as we gain more visibility.With that, let's open it up for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter, and also I just wanted to say glad to hear that you all are well, and hope all is well with your team and your families. Two things really jumped out to us this quarter. First was just, as you mentioned, just a strength in cloud. I mean, obviously, much higher mix than we were looking for, and obviously, you guys, too. Will you provide some just -- some more color on sort of what you're hearing from customers about why you're seeing that accelerated shift to the cloud?And the other metric was just the number of deals north of $1 million. I mean huge increase year-over-year. I know it was a little easier comp, but just a big number, especially considering you have a shorter duration. So if you can provide some more color as just sort of what's driving that strength in those big deals. Thanks. -- Hello Phil, thank you very much, and glad to hear that you are healthy and all is well as well. Yeah, we were really -- as we said in the very beginning, it's impossible to predict what customers want. We have always focused on offering customers' choice in everything that we do, and we've been hard at work for almost five years now in the cloud offering. So it's been great to see the past couple of quarters, the continued momentum in cloud. I'm really pleased with some of the acquisitions that we've done that are all cloud-based. I think we've got one of the top teams in the cloud spectrum now from an SRE basis all the way through the development team. So it's good to see customers rotating there.It's hard to pinpoint with total accuracy what's driving it. I think the offering is a portion of it. But the other piece that, I'm sure you've seen with other companies that you cover, is in this time, when everyone had to go virtual and the reaction to unpredictable events was like we've never seen before. The ease of use, the reliability, the flexibility that you get from turning to cloud is awesome. And as we watch customers move tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people to remote work virtually overnight, I think the power of cloud becomes a little bit more apparent. So it was good to see.And I agree with you. As we ended the quarter, there are two things that I was unsure of, and one was we were going to have with big deals. I mean you guys have been a lot -- many people have written as they should. With an enterprise sales force, they could be able to do big deals, and to see 81 million plus deals was really refreshing that our customers continue to need Splunk and view Splunk as critical for their digital transformation needs and their response to daily business. -- Great, thanks. I'll get back in queue. Once again, congrats on a great quarter. -- Thank you, Phil. -- Thanks, Phil.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of BoA. Your line is open. -- Hey, thank you very much. I mean this is a terrific accomplishment, guys. I mean you're growing your ARR, 52%. Your cloud transition is accelerating, and you're doing a record number of million dollar deals. This is simply outstanding. I'm curious, Doug, when you look at the leading indicators in your pipeline, it looks like, by most accounts, the month of April saw a big -- bit of a rebound in software activity. Just curious if you can just talk about how the forward-looking pipeline is looking like for you guys post-COVID.And I also am curious if you have any specific thoughts on the combination of SignalFx, Streamlio, Omnition and how material they were to securing cloud wins. Or how is progress, generally speaking, tracking for those three acquisitions? And one, if I could -- if you have the time speak on to this, OK. Difference between ACV. I think you said ACV growth rate accelerated in this quarter versus the fourth quarter. If you can expand on that nuance, that will be great. And congrats again, many congratulations. -- Thank you, Kash. It's an amazing effort across our field teams and the rest of the Company to support them. And really, again, just honored to be serving customers at this time of need. What I said was ACV growth had its strongest performance that we've seen over the past four quarters. So that, again, was -- on the positive front, there are so many things that could happen given that we were over three quarters this quarter during the full COVID pandemic, and you just don't know how people are going to react. And what we saw was as people rapidly transitioned to remote work, and sadly, we've seen a pretty big increase in cyber activity -- negative cyber activity, the importance of Splunk to ensure the resiliency of their existing IT backbone, to ensure the cyber efficiency and efficacy of that was absolutely critical.And then as you said, really positive second quarter now results with the new application developer-oriented observability suite and offering. It's still a low numbers game with that offering, but the growth is really impressive. And even more impressive, I think the speed of integration that we've seen across Omnition, SignalFx and some of the pieces from Splunk come into that suite. And the awareness of customers that once you get to a certain complexity and volume, the only answer really is Splunk's observability suite right now. And we've talked about that huge customer in Q4 that went all in the Splunk.We're seeing other activity around the world right now where people -- obviously, if they're going to respond quickly to COVID, they're going to need to spin up brand new offerings quickly. And I think doing that in an ephemeral cloud-based world is a way that they're doing that, and we're there to help them work side-by-side with them to make sure they're effective.Thank you. Our next... -- Hey, Valerie, next question, please. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Great. Can you guys hear me? -- Yes. We got you. -- Awesome. Congratulations on keeping up the momentum. It's great to see the results. I am just as pleased as Kash. It's -- but maybe I don't express it like he does. He's fantastic. I truly mean that. Let me ask you this. I don't expect, Doug, that you would typically get us into the granular details of the business week by week and host a forecast call with all of us. But just given the time distortion that we've all gone through in the last couple of months, I mean, weeks feel like months, months feel like quarters, can you just maybe give us a sense of what you're seeing at the field level talking to CIOs and CEOs and the investments that they're making? And maybe just some appreciation for the cadence of the business from March to April and even what you're seeing now into early May, that would be helpful. And I've got a follow-up for Jason. -- Sure, Brad. And then I agree with you. I mean there's -- I know, Kash, you'd said post-COVID. I don't foresee a post-COVID world yet. I think there's a lot of volatility still in front of us. What -- so a couple of things that surprised me. We moved to virtual -- or sorry, on-the-road executive briefings two years ago to complement bringing people to headquarters, which I think had been very, very successful. I take eight, 10, 12 people with me, our top development folks, product managers, customer success folks. Susan used to join me, etc. And let's go right to the customer. Our first EBC on the road was supposed to be the last week of March, and we picked it perfectly to be in New York City and Washington, D.C. that week. And I was predicting, especially -- I mean that was right after most shelter-in-place orders went in -- went down that everybody had canceled. And we gave every customer the option to cancel. And not only did we have a full week, but we were oversubscribed for that week.So the resiliency that I've seen with people everywhere, it's just there's so much chaos and craziness and sadness that's happening right now with the pandemic, and there's so much beauty as well with people rising to the occasion and keeping focus to what's important to serve their customers, their citizens, their constituencies. And I've seen CIOs, CISOs, CFOs, CEOs lean in like never before. And our sales cadence, which I think we got one of the best enterprise sales teams in the business, they have stayed on top of the day in, day out drumbeat, and they haven't been deterred at all with the fact that they're going to be on Zooms, they're going to be on phones, they're going to be over email, they could be on Slack channels to make sure that they can drive everything from requirements to proof-of-concept activities to contract negotiations. As the quarter is winding down, we would have 8, 12, 14-person Zooms with different legal departments, different accounting departments and our sales teams, just making sure we got deals done.And so far, what I've seen from our team and talking to us from my colleagues is we know how important it is for people to have a digital footprint and for us, in particular, to be able to get visibility in the chaos with as much data as humanly possible. And people, I think, appreciate that, and that shows through in the strong ACV results and the strong ARR results, and we just have to stay on it. And the first few weeks of May have felt very similar to what we saw in April and the end of March. -- Thank you. That makes a lot of sense. And Jason, I totally appreciate pulling this year's guidance on the income statement just given the lack of visibility on mix of cloud. But as you think about the $1 billion cash flow target out on the horizon, how should we think about the various shapes of the curves that can get us there just given what's going on in the world? -- Yeah. I would -- well, thanks for the question. I would say the driver of cash flow going forward, I think is much more tied to ARR than revenue. And so we gave the -- we reiterated the mid-40% ARR growth that we're expecting to see this year and then the 40% CAGR going out to '23. If you use those numbers, that gets you to an ARR number in somewhere between the $4 billion to $5 billion range. And then if you take kind of the historic cash yield that you've seen us had in the past, I think, for five or six years, we were over 20% cash yield on a revenue basis, you should see a similar yield on ARR as we get out to '23, where we're not going to have the cloud mix shift impacts that we have right now. -- Awesome. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Great job, guys. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Brad.Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Hi, and thank you for taking the question. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. I want to talk a little bit about where you are sort of seeing the momentum coming out of April and May. We're sort of three weeks into the quarter. How sort of pipeline and sort of bookings, any sort of changes in end of April, May versus end of March and April? And then I had a follow-up question for you. -- We haven't seen any material difference in customer interest and activity. There is a lot of concerted effort that the sales teams are driving, along with help with the marketing teams to make sure that we build an adequate pipeline. It's definitely -- as you'd imagine, everyone's got to take different angles to build that pipe. Like many enterprise software companies, the field is responsible for a lot of that pipe gen, and that obviously comes from their activity day in and day out with customers that they're visiting, and now they're visiting virtually.So as you -- I'm sure you've seen with other software and cloud companies, we've got a ton of virtual events. We have -- our campaign cadence remains high. We've shifted the rest of the events that we're participating in through the end of the year to the virtual format. We're seeing really high turnouts so far with people attending different information sessions and ultimately, marketing events. So we're staying on top of serving customers and tight messaging around what's critical for cyber teams, infrastructure teams and AppDev teams to do their job effectively. And you'll see on our website, we're layering in quite a bit of information on line of business use cases from helping people manage workforces, especially for essential workers effectively, helping people to think through with data, how to get a return-to-work profile that works well. We obviously are not an ERP backbone workflow oriented-software product. We are helping on the data side to couple with the efforts that our partners and colleagues that would actually manage the workflow activities of getting people back to work would be engaged with. -- Got it. That's very helpful. And as my follow-up question, I wanted to sort of think through the positioning of the product portfolio. Last year was a big year in terms of boosting a lot of the capabilities with the SignalFx acquisition, Omnition, VictorOps. And I guess my question is in terms of unifying this product portfolio and creating sort of a converged real-time digital operations management portfolio that could potentially take share in a more conservative IT environment. Jason sort of mentioned that we can't sort of see past COVID just yet, and then it's something that we certainly agree with. And so in terms of the ability to take more wallet share in your core markets, in your customer base and potentially with new customers, how far is the product portfolio from being able to execute that vision? -- I think it's there now. There's always more work to do on all factors of an offering. But I think the cloud -- the progression we made in cloud on all of our core data elements, classic Splunk Enterprise in the cloud as well as the complementary aspects, continues at a really nice pace. We are tripling down on the efforts to make sure that every single element from the data platform to the security suite, to the IT op suite, to the AppDev suite are cloud-first, are leading with cloud. And the orientation with Splunk will continue to be and has been making sure that we can integrate with the technologies around us.We've talked a lot about our new Omnition control framework that will officially be shipping at our dot-com. That's a next-generation interface for cyber teams. From the ground up, that was built to provide a really effective UI to help those folks and to integrate the different Splunk offerings, but it also is open to third-party offerings, even those that are similar to the offerings that we have in our own portfolio. I think we recognize that it's a super-heterogeneous landscape out there, and that we've got to be a cooperative player with the other pieces that our customers currently use, so that we can help them bring data to every question, every answer and every action. -- Appreciate the hot [Phonetic], Doug, thank you, and congrats on a strong Q1. -- Thank you. -- Thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy at JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much. I'll add my congrats. Doug, I was curious if you think about aggregate data in just across the customer base, was it more common to see customers trying to reduce their ingest in March and April maybe to preserve their own cash flow? Or was it more common to actually see them increasing ingest to maybe try to protect VPN traffic or otherwise just adapt to this kind of environment? -- Good question. So first of all, we're moving more and more of our customers to an infrastructure-based pricing metric, which gets away from the data ingest piece and seeing some really, really interesting results there. One of our big footprint customers that it's all gated by data for a long time, at the -- toward the end of last year, we got them to a virtual core framework. And they -- I've watched their data volumes go up by 30%, 35%, and they still have additional cores left to throw at the problem. So really positive for them to be able to rapidly ramp as our online demand has gone through the roof, and they can have more and more use cases to be powered by Splunk.What we saw with most of our customers was an increase in the data that they were looking for. We've never seen this degree of VPN saturation as we're all getting to experience now. And now that I've got critical functions, support functions, finance functions, HR functions, manufacturing functions that are working from home, if the connection from endpoint all the way back to the data source and back out is not working, it becomes not just a bad thing but literally a quarter-risking or customer interruption-risking piece. So we've seen new data forms begin to flow into Splunk in higher volumes within most customers so that they can get the visibility that they need. -- Yeah. And Doug, since you mentioned it, I wanted to ask you, how have the sales teams adapted to more of an ACV framework and then digesting the new pricing model? I was trying to understand how much energy they might have put into that during Q1 and why wouldn't that have kind of dragged down your ARR growth or ACV results if they were kind of distracted with that. -- I'm sure that they were -- that many of them were still coming up the curve. Really proud of our sales enablement team under Linda, who did an incredible job of putting together materials for our SKO that, thankfully, we actually got to have in Vegas at the end of February. So we had a whole year of planning that we took advantage of to make sure that we helped the reps as much as possible get comfortable with ACV versus TCV. But honestly, I'm sure that there'll be more and more efficiencies over the course of this year as they really internalize that and really understand what it means for their customers and for how they optimize their own comp plans.The pricing, same thing. I think it's getting better and better. We're getting better at marketing it. The reps are comfortable with there. We have a bunch of training sessions on that, at SKO as well. But I think there's still ways to go to have every customer. And even more importantly, prospects understand the shifts that we've made. Although I can honestly say there are less and less accounts that I now Zoom into, where people give me the blank stare when I say, hey, have you heard about infrastructure-based pricing? which I was getting a ton of up until a quarter or so ago. Now their typical response is, yeah, trying to understand it, trying to digest it. It seems like a good thing. Working with my rep on that, which is good. I'm really happy to see that. -- Okay, understood. Thank you very much. -- Thanks, Mark.Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of BMO. Your line is open. -- Hi, thank you very much. I have two questions that I'll ask, and perhaps I'll ask them concurrently. Jason, to start with you. I was curious on your views on the operating cash flow targets, which doesn't appear have changed. If duration is moving lower -- and understand that revenue is less of a proxy. But if duration is moving lower, why wouldn't that make the transition quicker? Or are you thinking that duration will flex back out, so to speak, and it won't stay compressed or get shorter as we think about those operating cash flow targets?And then, Doug, to ask you a question on the competitive landscape and pricing. Given that a lot of organizations are facing top line headwinds, how are the discussions changing at all regarding pricing? And I know you have a lot going on with infrastructure versus consumption, but how are net-net pricing discussions changing? And is that leading to any tilting, so to speak, of the competitive landscape? And that's it for me. -- Hi. It's Jason. I'll go ahead and start since -- I'll give Doug a breather for a minute. Okay. So in terms of duration, so the duration that we report is the overall contract duration on a TCV basis. And so the cash billing, we actually moved to ratable last year so we're billing every year, regardless of whether or not it's a one, two or three-year contract. So the duration doesn't really have any impact on cash. What could possibly have an impact is then you have more deals. The shorter your duration, the more deals you're going to have to do in future years. The reality is we are really starting to see... -- Yeah. That's what I was thinking. -- Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we have really strong retention. We have really strong net expansion. And so as long as those continue to do well, you're going to see ARR continue to grow as we've forecasted. -- And then on your question as far as competitive and pricing, we didn't see any strong or unusual pricing pressure this past quarter. We definitely had set up a whole structure between our sales team and finance to be able to work rapidly and cooperatively with customers that needed some different payment structure given the various budget and cash needs that everyone's trying to face right now. So pricing seems to have held up, not an unusual discounting quarter or -- and again, I think the ability to lean in with infrastructure-based pricing probably helps because in most cases, it's a much more friendly metric.On the competitive front, same thing. No big change. I know there's a lot of swirling thought out there of, hey, do more people jump into do-it-yourself projects because they're worried about spend? So far, what we've seen for five years is do-it-yourself turns out to be a pretty bad equation on a total cost ownership basis as well as the time to value and time to delivery basis. So for those orgs that are probably under a little bit more of a headcount pressure and a huge time crunch pressure, especially with our new pricing mechanisms and cloud and ACV focus, I would feel badly for them to go down to do-it-yourself piece, because they'll probably get their butts kicked by their competitors that don't. -- Right, right. Okay, many thanks, team. I appreciate it. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. -- Thanks, and thanks for squeezing me in, and congrats from me as well. Two questions on the cloud offering, one for Doug and one for Jason. Doug, can you talk a little bit about -- like you mentioned already, customers were working from home, were focusing a little more on cloud. But like what's driving -- like is that also your sales force pushing? And what makes it possible to move that quickly to like more cloud and driving like your increased optimism there?And then for Jason, the cloud margins are coming up nicely. Can you just talk a little bit about what's driving it a little bit? I mean, obviously, there's a new -- I think there's a new architecture that's helping there. But like what's driving it? And are the next step to get it from like where we are today to like the level that you expect in a couple of years? Thank you. -- Thanks, Raimo. So we've worked with a high degree of focus to have two elements that I think help people with cloud. One is on-prem to cloud transition services, and two is what we call Autobahn, which is our very rapid way of getting people that want to try out Splunk to actually do it with native data sources and native data, so that they get very effective feedback on, is this going to work for me or not. But more importantly, their transition from POC to it's now production is literally just a financial difference, so they get immediate time-to-value.On the migration piece, we've got our own programs, our own consultants, third-party consultants who we trained on helping people move from on-prem to cloud. And then we've got cool things like with Amazon, where we work together to launch and pioneer our Workload Migration Program, where they're number 1 vendor and got awards in that area that helps move Splunk Enterprise footprints to Splunk Cloud-type footprints. So both of those make it a little bit easier for new customers, new use cases or existing customers to get rapid value out of cloud. And then Jason, you're on the margin piece. -- Yeah. On the margin piece, I'd say there's really three things. First, I'd point to moving to stateless architecture was something that really started benefiting us over the last year or so. Most recently, we've moved to -- truly have moved to multi-tenant architecture where you now see a couple of the large public cloud providers. And with the growth in cloud, we're getting bigger. So it's helping us drive better -- just better overall terms, mostly through volume.And then the third and last, I'd say is we're getting much better at elasticity. So we're doing, I think, a much better job in terms of managing workloads across the different kind of use cases, and that allows us to manage cost a bit better. So we still have a long ways to go, but we've made a lot of progress. I think we said last quarter, our plan -- our target is to get to 70% over the next year or so. And we feel like we're on our way. -- Perfect. Congrats. -- Thank you, Raimo. -- Thank you, Raimo. -- Thanks, Raimo.Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Doug, many of your partners are reporting major new catalysts, new starts, probably beyond what you would expect in this environment. But I guess when this kind of settles down, don't you think this is just a major catalyst coming out of this that actually could effectively accelerate the business as things stabilize? -- That's definitely what we are hoping for, anticipating and looking for, that I told you guys that we were setting a target of 60% plus bookings in the cloud by the end of FY '23. We started to think through out to revise those targets internally. I think this is our opportunity to get to 80%, 90% of cloud in that same time period, and we're focusing all of our efforts to get there.And then even with something as wacky as duration, that we'll see over the next couple of quarters where the trend looks like. And is 27% the new normal? Or was it one-quarter blip and it drifts back up in the 30s? It's even hard to have a definitive perspective and whether that's good or bad. The cohort that we've been showing with you guys forever shows that same-store sales turned out to be pretty good for us, and expansion is kind of the norm. So a shorter duration could give us a chance to actually get even better value from customers over a longer -- over a more immediate time period.Obviously, the pressure is on us with term and cloud now being really what we do to make sure that we've got a world-class renewal and upsell upgrade program. And again, the -- Susan, John Sabino and the field teams have been working their butts off to get us there. And they've made some really, really nice progress, and that's definitely going to be front and center for our customers and for us month-over-month into the future. -- Great. Thanks. -- Thanks, Brent.Thank you. Our first -- our next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I'm just going to do a two for here. I'll combine them as one. Can you give us a little more color on the dynamic with the impacted customers? What are the various things they're asking for? And what are you doing for them and with them? And then I'll just toss out the other one. So with the end of perpetual sales, I think it was started in November, how has that changed the sales motion? What are the perpetual customers doing with you? Just more color there would be helpful, too. Thanks a lot. -- Two great questions, Steve. Thank you. So I'll kind of do a high-level flyby. And Jason, you go a bit deeper on the affected industries. But we definitely -- we went through in March and bucketed customers into those who we think would benefit, those are neutral and those that might be affected and started to come up with different visibility and scenarios for how to make sure that we both prepare for those who might be affected and what programs we might be able to help them with.We do see a difference in that portfolio if we look at those buckets, who expanded versus as a class who didn't expand as much. And it definitely ties to, as you expect, to the affected industries, and they've all got a lot that they're working with right now. Through that, what's interesting is, as you imagine, we have virtually every major hotel chain, airline, cruise company, all as customers. And we saw a number of expansions within that category and then a bunch of renewals and consistency as well. I don't think that we've seen anyone cancel contracts or fall off yet. I'd just go back and scrub every single one, but we all were a little bit concerned as what happened there.What we are seeing, which is, I'm sure similar to what you're hearing from other vendors, is a lot of request for, can we -- can you help us in some way with payment terms or discounts or -- and as I said earlier, Jason and the sales team have got a really effective process to be able to field those. And we view this as a long-term opportunity for us. These are great companies. They are going through a lot of hardship. We believe that they've got a bright future long term. And the metal of a partnership is tested when things get tough, and we are there to make sure that they are successful through this with a long-term view. -- Yeah. In terms of just some of the ask by customers, mostly, it's been -- there's been a little bit on some of the payment terms. As you see in Q1, we delivered $46 million of cash flow. So very, I call, de minimis amount of movement in Q1. I expect there to be relatively small changes throughout the rest of the year as well, which is why I reiterated the target. But we have -- we are -- happen to be flexible. And sometimes, if folks want to pay a little later, then we can adjust maybe the discount to reflect that. But overall, it hasn't been -- it hasn't really been significant. It's been relatively small and well managed. -- Got it. And do you guys -- can you comment real briefly just on the -- with the end of perpetual sales? How are you -- what's your go-to-market with those customers? How are you engaging with them as they need new capacity? -- So we -- I think I said a couple of times, there is no, we'll pay you to trade in your perpetual. There's no program to incentivize that motion. For -- what we wind up seeing is obviously one of two motions, either they are frozen and continue to pay their bill and use Splunk, or they layer term or cloud on top of perpetual, or the third motion, they trade in perpetual to go to term or cloud. And there's -- we've got customers all across the map. But we understand that people bought those licenses, and they own them, and we're happy to collect their maintenance dollars, but the growth obviously is going to come from cloud.And we've moved to a cloud-first development approach. We now are updating our cloud on a consistent basis. So over time, our on-prem customers will have software that is increasingly gapped versus what you can get in cloud. So we'll continuing to choose the -- you make the best decision on timing and how you want to deal with the financial aspect of it. Obviously, more time that goes on, you depreciate it and it becomes less of a deal whether you retire that asset or not. -- Got it. Thanks a lot, gentlemen. -- Thanks, Steve. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Yeah. Thanks. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt. I'll echo the congratulations on the call here. Doug, could you dive a little deeper into the newest version of SignalFx, but also just kind of more broadly thinking about maybe how monitoring is changing or increasing an importance in a post-COVID world? Or I guess we don't like post-COVID yet in the current environment and then moving into this new normal? Yeah. -- Yeah. So one of the big announcements that we had this quarter was we released the microservices-oriented APM and really nice native Kubernetes instrumentation, etc. The trajectory that we talked about when we bought SignalFx and Omnition was we saw the rapid convergence of logs, metrics and traces coming together, tracing obviously being mission-critical in these very ephemeral and touch environments in the cloud arena to try and do anything similar to what was once APM-based and the metrics piece being the key drivers for real-time dashboarding and cockpit to make sure that you should -- to give you indication whether you should dive into an APM activity or not.We continue to drive the convergence of those three. I've been really proud of the team and their ability to do the integration work between Omnition, SignalFx and Splunk. And we had a very quick release with what was once Omnition and SignalFx to have that combined trace metrics piece. You'll see some really interesting stuff from us on the log-in front as well. There's really interesting road map and movements on the UI componentry and the, I think, really, next-gen ease of use that we're focused on. There is an Achilles' heel, I think of SignalFx. The UI probably would be that is a different experience, up and running with SignalFx than some of the easy to use but not as scalable alternatives as we have.So our focus is to bring the best, most robust, world-class scaled capability, but to do it with an easy onboarding and low-bar difficulty, so that we get -- the best of both of those worlds. And I think that whole area is just going to continue to increase in importance as all of us are working really hard to delight our customers with new mobile and online experiences. And without something like our suite, I think it's very difficult for any organization to do an effective job with that transition. -- Yeah. No, that makes sense. If I could get one more quick one. This is obviously not the easiest environment for adding new logos. But do you think with the success of Splunk Cloud that maybe you kind of buck that trend and drive higher new customer additions? -- Yeah. I think the -- we hypothesized and then just eventually centered on over the past couple of quarters, is without super-easy onboarding and transaction capability, all cloud-based, we're not going to move the needle beyond roughly 2,000 new customers that we get per year. The -- going back to the importance of UI and experience, I guess, UX, we're just talking about with the observability portfolio. So long term, over the next two, 2.5 years, I do think that, that is the difference maker and starting to see a much higher rate of net new. Our number 1 focus in front of that though, is to make sure that we've got sticky, high-renewal, high-expansion capability for those customers that we do serve. And that winds up helping us with the ease of onboarding over time. But as we talked about, I think, with Phil's question or one of the early ones was renewals and expansion is obviously mission-critical for us as we go forward from where we are now given the term and cloud transition we've been going through. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Matt.Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of UBS. Your line is open. -- Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. I hope you're doing well and staying safe. Just to start with you, Doug. The comprehensive suite that you have for the observability arena, and particularly for the AI use case -- AIOps use case, excuse me, I wanted to begin to as to how you're managing going to market with what are effectively very discrete monetizable areas within observability, but at the same time, balancing that with selling a value and a platform versus effectively nickeling and dime-ing the customer with the modular solution selling. And then I have a follow-up for Jason. -- Thanks, Fatima. So as I think I talked about a couple of calls ago, we did retain the independent sales force as an independent sales force from SignalFx and have added to it pretty dramatically and taking some of our top leaders across Splunk and put them in positions on the sales and pre-sales sides and all the accompanying areas. And this really is our experimentation with, given the difference in buying center and budget and decision-making between the application development teams, the infrastructure teams, the cyber teams and teams outside that, can a one-size-fits-all sales model work, could we -- do we need to get even more focused on specialization. And so far, it's worked out really well. It's a great team. And obviously, the vernacular, the relationships, the day in, day out life of that AppDev team is different than what we see from an infrastructure IT ops team. And I'm excited to see that team continue to grow and continue to do the great job they've been doing in the market.Within the AppDev arena, I agree with you. And there -- the lesson that we've certainly seen over the years is having more SKUs and more choice is not necessarily good. It sounds good on the surface and made the business books talk about multi-product being absolutely critical to long-term success. Yes, I agree, but you got to simplify that multi-product. The paradox of choice is not a good one. So we're trying to take much more of a singular suite with a series of capabilities that you can decide to license or not license without getting into the whole skewer, so that we don't wind up with three, four or five independent sales cycles, the micro groups within a general AppDev team.And again, this so far seems to be working pretty well. We're going to work best when you've got a pretty broad and high-powered set of scrum teams across the landscape. If it's a smaller dev team, then you may not need all the bells and whistles that we've brought together under our observability suite. -- I appreciate that color, Doug. Thank you. Jason, just for you, appreciate that the business is going to be virtually cloud by fiscal '23 based on the 80% to 90% mix guidance that you shared. But in the interim period, how should we think about the cadence of term business first and then the cadence of renewals of term business that you've transacted in the fiscal '18, fiscal '19 period that are effectively going to come up for renewal over the next three years? And I really appreciate stepping through those dynamics with you. That's it for me. Thank you. -- Thanks for the question. I will -- I would just say that Doug said, hopefully, 80% to 90%... -- Yes, yeah, yeah. -- That was not a target. -- Sorry, Definitely not a target. -- That was the brainstorm. Okay. So we'll update you when we're ready to make that a target. I think, unfortunately, your question -- it's a great question. It's the right question. But until we, I think, solidify exactly what the mix shift time line looks like, it's really hard to say how fast term contracts convert to cloud. I think in this environment, it certainly is -- we're certainly finding customers that are in the middle of a term contract, and they're starting to look at cloud. And so that's one of the things, I think, we have to help -- we are going to do whatever customers need. If that's something that customers need to do, then we have to figure out how to make that work.And so I think -- how I think -- how you should think about how those term contracts renew or upgrade or shift to cloud, it's just -- it's hard to say. I do expect the vast majority over time will move to cloud. It's just hard to say exactly what the timing will be. That renewal base that you talked about kind of from the '18 and '19 period when term license growth really started growing, that is a significant base that's growing very large. And that is one of the primary reasons why we have confidence in our ARR growth targets, is because as that renewal base comes online, it just gives us a great base to draw from and convert into even higher ASP cloud contracts. Let's see, you had one more question, I think or did we lose her? -- No [Phonetic].Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. This will be our final question. -- Hi, yes, thanks very much for fitting me in and congrats on a good quarter in a really tough environment. Doug, can you just talk about sort of your discussions with clients about cloud, maybe domestically versus internationally, if there's any sort of difference there in terms of how your clients in the US might be thinking about cloud versus what you're seeing internationally? And then just for Jason, where is hiring, I guess, based on your thought process coming into this year? I'd imagine you guys might have had to rethink that in March. And maybe what's the thought process on that now? Thanks. -- A really good point. And you'll see in the numbers that we released now every quarter, something that we'll actually point to the answer. I forget the exact go-to page. But I think overall revenue internationally was 35%, and cloud revenue was 18%. And the 18% is pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter, which -- and the answer for that is, yeah, international is still, there's probably [Phonetic] more term then they are cloud, and we get recognized from upfront. We are seeing the strongest cloud traction in the US. And if you just follow where AWS, GCP, their footprint, we map exactly. In Australia and the UK, in Canada, very strong cloud. It gets stronger -- less strong but still strong in Germany and France as long as you keep the data resident there, and it falls from there.So going back to my brainstorm that I'd love to see us find a way get to 80% to 90% cloud and say 60%, I didn't say 100%, because I do think that there are still use cases that demand, that product and data sit closer to the customer. And until we can figure out a way to have the accounting not differ, because we've done that, then those will probably be accounted as on-prem solutions. And there are countries that may be slower to move to cloud, countries where we already have customers and are already selling.So it's definitely a very, very strong US. Although my belief is that as this has been a global phenomena, you're going to see a very different perspective on cloud in countries that may have not been as tilted that way because it probably is the only way that they're going to be able to respond the way they need to, assuming that this goes on for another 18, 24, 36, 48 months while we work on therapies and vaccines, and headcount. -- Yeah. Regarding headcount, so yeah, when everything started slowing down in early mid-March, we definitely did kind of put a freeze on hiring and look at what -- to try to get a better sense of what the environment was going to -- how it's going to unfold. It's been pretty clear that underlying growth within our business is very healthy. So we have been opening up hiring related to DQCs, of course, to serve the growth needs that are going to continue. And then also, of course, there's some engineering headcount related to a bunch of the migration work that we're continuing to do with really -- in particular with cloud as well as within cloud, within SignalFx and some of the integration work there.So those areas we're definitely still hiring. Most of the other areas, I think like most companies around, are trying to make sure we're really focused on watching our cost structure closely and make sure that -- especially with us going through a ratable transformation, we need to make sure that our cost structure doesn't outpace the growth revenue or it will take a while for us to catch up. So that's something we're watching very carefully. But again, we are mostly focused on making sure that we're making the necessary hires to manage to our growth targets. -- That's super helpful. Thanks very much. -- Thanks, Kirk.Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for any closing remarks. -- Thank you very much. Thank you all for joining us. Just in closing, I'd say it's a really positive quarter. We've been, I think, very clear that we are focused on both a term and cloud transition but ultimately getting to a renewable SaaS model so we can serve our customers much more effectively. To see that acceleration so consistently over the past three years with acceleration over the past couple of quarters as our offering continues to mature and the market continues to gain more and more appreciation for the criticality of data, they were moved from data being a luxury to data being a necessity in today's world, is very heartening.We know that there's a lot of unknowns in the coming quarters. We're going to continue to focus on the things that we can focus on, which is build awesome product, make sure our team is -- sales teams are empowered. They've got all the tools that they possibly can get a hold of to have those high-value conversations with customers and keep driving relentlessly on ACV, ARR and cloud. And so hopefully, in the coming quarters, we'll have more good stories to tell to highlight the rapid transformation that we're driving. Thank you, all.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. It's Friday, May 8, and we're talking tech and mailbag questions. I'm your host Dylan Lewis and I'm joined by Fool premium analyst Joey Solitro. Joey, it's been a while, man; how are you doing? It's been a very long time. I've been waiting for this moment; I've just been waiting for you to slack me, asking if I'd be on another show, because I'm finally back from paternity leave and I'm just ready to answer some questions. Yeah, you've had an interesting 2020, huh? [laughs] With everything that's going on in the world, and then you also welcome another member of the family. I was trying to tell everybody on Slack, like, I'm sorry, the market is tanking because I'm gone, but I will be back on March 23. And I mean, I was joking the whole time, or was I? But market bottoms on March 23, I'm back, and then it's like, hey, we're ready to rage, let's do this. [laughs] I love it. And we are going to be taking some questions that we've gotten from listeners today. And some of these are touching on companies that you know quite well. So, I had to have you on, and really, I just love chatting with you, Joey. You know, it's been way too long, we haven't seen each other in months, we haven't talked in, it's probably six weeks at this point, so happy to make it happen. Oh, yeah, I'm ready, let's do this. Alright. So, we're in the mailbag and our first question is from David, and he wrote in to ; you can always write there if you want to shoot us questions or comments about the show; David asks, \"I was wondering how you think about individual stocks that align to a broad thesis versus an ETF that represents the same thesis with a larger portfolio of holdings? For example, having watched as cloud security has moved from the IT pages to the frontpage of the news ... \" love that phrasing there, David, \" ... as hacks have shifted from isolated security breaches to takeovers of municipal infrastructure. I bought shares of , \u00a0 and . I'm now wondering, however, whether at three companies in the space, I'm better off just buying an ETF and not worrying about the individual stocks. I know there are no hard-and-fast rules for any of this, but any perspective would be helpful.\"This is an awesome question, because you know, I think, when you start buying multiple stocks in the same space, you're basically creating your own ETF, Joey. Yeah. Exactly. So, I love this question because I think it's one that a lot of people think about, like, \"I don't know how to invest in cybersecurity best, should I buy this?\" In David's case, I would say, absolutely do not buy an ETF because you have three great picks that you're talking about right here with CrowdStrike, Fortinet and Cloudflare.Now, if it's something that you know absolutely nothing about, don't even know where to start, like me with biotech in wanting to buy like the IBB [] or something like that, it would make sense. But if you can dig deep into those ETFs, see what the largest holdings are, do some research on those companies, you can usually find the companies that you really want to own or that interest you the most to kind of create your own David ETF. Yeah, I love that, it reminds me of what Jason Moser does with his baskets. You know, he's got the War on Cash basket that he talks about all the time on the Monday episode of , and that's , ,  and , I think. And you know, there are a lot of other companies that are playing into the theme of cashless society, more and more payments going digital.But I think with these pretty tight baskets that Jason tends to focus on, I think he has one that's called \"Healthcare and Wealth Care\" as well, they tend to be small, they're only about four or five stocks. And I think that what we're seeing here with this question from David, he's looking at a couple of specific companies. Jason has the same approach, because when you buy an ETF, you're not just getting a handful of companies, very often you're getting dozens of companies in that ETF. Exactly. So, what I'd like to say, if you can buy three or four companies, you really only need one of those to be those home runs that outweighs the rest, but if you buy an ETF, I mean, yeah, you've got dozens of companies in there, you could have one of those that returns 10,000% over a couple years, but that ETF might not do much because others are going to come down like the value play. So, when I'm thinking cybersecurity, I own CrowdStrike and absolutely love it, because the growth rates are just absurd and it's just the gold standard of cybersecurity right now. So, that's the company I want the most exposure to.But if I buy an ETF, I'm getting exposure to companies I have zero interest in, like,  or something like that. So, I kind of want to find the vertical or the specific company with the highest growth rate that I think can generate the most significant returns going forward, and having exposure to that. And, Dylan, like you're saying how Jason Moser has his War on Cash, like, those are four companies that are just absolute beasts in their space and they can grow for quite a bit of time.So, I mean, that's not even one where you have to worry about having a massive underperformance out of one of them, but yeah, it's all about picking your horse in the race. And if you can't, and if you're, kind of, like spreading your cash across all of them, yeah, you could win a little bit along the way, but if you want that big winner, I mean, trying to single out the best single opportunity and just pile in. Yeah. And to use the cybersecurity and cloud security space as kind of an example for other listeners that might be thinking through this with other industries. You know, I went and looked, and I'm admittedly not super-familiar with these ETFs, but the ones that immediately popped up. The , that is ticker CIBR; and the , and the ticker is HACK.So, the pros, we talked as before, but you're instantly diversified, if you don't know the space well, you're not going to be wed to one single stock with the outcomes for your money. The cons are, though, with an ETF you're paying expense ratios. And both of these ETFs have 60 basis point expense ratios. So, not outrageous, but you are paying for performance. You're also going to have less control over the buying and selling decisions and the allocation.And just to, kind of, zoom in on allocation, and I think this is an important thing to do with any fund or any ETF you own, David specifically highlighted CrowdStrike, Fortinet and Cloudflare here, and those were the companies that he wants in on, possibly more, but with the ETFs I mentioned, they only own Cloudflare and Fortinet, at least as top 10 holdings, I do not see CrowdStrike in their top 10 holdings. And those two stocks are only about 7% of the portfolio.And so, you're getting exposure to a lot of other companies, companies like , , , , which, you know, if you don't want all of your eggs in one basket, might be a good thing, but you aren't going to get nearly as concentrated benefits from CrowdStrike winning big, because I think it's only about 4% of those ETFs.And so, no matter what you're doing, whether you're investing in ETFs, investing in mutual funds, considering it, it's always helpful to look at what's actually owned in there and the allocation, because that's really what's going to determine your returns, Joey. Exactly. And I always like looking at those top 10 holdings, but usually, so say you took these and then you look at the full portfolios of these. And, yeah, you're talking about 30, 40 companies. Even if you pull up by an e-commerce basket, because you want exposure to the best e-commerce. Well, yeah, you could buy , ,  and those guys, or you can buy this basket and have exposure to a bunch of companies you might not know anything about.So, yeah, where ETFs have their benefits, like, if you have absolutely zero time to research any stocks, but you think cybersecurity is going to be the absolute best industry over the next decade, then hey, ETFs, have at it. And I'd bless that. But if you have the time to dig down or if you're like David and actually know about companies, like, CrowdStrike and Cloudflare, then that's where I'd want to put my money. Yeah. And if you're trying to go the approach of creating your own small baskets, you can look at the holdings for those ETFs and use that as a starter, and say, alright, well, this is going to be my research list, I see that these are the top 10 in this thematic ETF, and start there. But you know, you don't necessarily need to just buy the ETF. Yeah, not having CrowdStrike in the top 10 of that one, that's just disappointing at least in my opinion. Like, Cisco, I don't consider them cybersecurity at all. Like, yeah, they might have a few wings of it, but they do so much.Splunk. Yeah, it has a lot of cybersecurity to it, but there's a lot of data analytics to go with it, so not really a pure play cybersecurity, where CrowdStrike is just cybersecurity through-and-through. Yeah. And it's possible, one thing we didn't mention with ETFs is, it's possible that there are rules around what the ETF will own that prevents it from owning a company like CrowdStrike. You know, this business has not been public for more than a year, and it might be that a fund or an ETF has decided there are a certain rules we're going to be following and we are not going to be picking up shares of anything that hasn't been traded for more than a year or is not fitting within certain market cap requirements. And that might prevent them from owning something that you really, really want exposure to. And at the end of the day, I'm a stock picker, so it's always, like, the challenge, like, if you want to ask me about an industry, I want to have a specific company, like, I want to pick my horse in the race. So, I think that's where I also -- I would personally never own an ETF, but that's just me. But like I said, ETFs would be good investment vehicles for a lot of people, so I'm not going to bash them too hard. Yeah. And I certainly think if you're just getting started, you don't have any exposure to market ETF like a broad-based ETF that gets you immediate exposure to the S&P 500 or something like that, an awesome place to start. It's lowering the cost of admission for the market; it's making things easier. And so, I love them there. I think if you're looking thematic, though, try building your own baskets. Very often you're going to be getting better allocation to bigger winners because you're going to be starting small and you're going to be focusing on the big players that really, truly are dominant. Yeah, build that David ETF. [laughs] The David cyber security ETF. Our second question comes from Marie. Marie writes in, \"Love the podcast, especially the .\" Hey now! look at that. [laughs] \"I have a question about positions. For the everyday investor, what's considered a good position, what determines that? I tend to buy no more than a handful of shares at a time if I can swing it, is that good or too little? If the price is right, is swinging for, say, 10 shares is OK or is that too much at once no matter the share price?\"And this really, Joey, kind of gets at something that we talk about a lot with folks as they're, kind of, getting used to the market and buying shares and investing. And that's kind of the difference between the number of shares and share price and understanding that one of those is really more important than the other when you're looking at your portfolio. This is a very complex issue, and it's actually perfect timing, my very good friend, Lee, just opened a brokerage account a couple of weeks back and he was asking me, how much do I want to put in certain companies, asking what I own, sending him a watchlist. And it was a $6,000 account. And he starts talking about, \"Oh, you know, I have 10 shares of , should I get more?\"And I'm thinking, man, wait, hold on, that is a huge, huge portion of your portfolio already, because I mean Roku is a $130 stock, he's got ten shares, $1,300 out of $6,000. I'm like, man, that is a huge allocation. So, a lot of times, I like to push them toward percentage, like, you don't want all your eggs in one basket, of course, not all your money is going to go into one, unless you're just starting out and you buy the SPY [] index fund, like you were talking about.But if you've got the $6,000 and you want to put it across, you know, 12 companies; maybe that would be too much. I always like to use the percentages saying, you know, no more than 10% if you have a portfolio under $10,000. But if it gets bigger, my personal is I'll never really go beyond 5% as that initial injection of cash.But yet, it's always kind of like a percentage game and you got to figure out the number you're putting in and then kind of the risk profile of the companies you have to determine those allocations. Yeah, I think that's exactly right. And it gets tricky when you're looking at some of the very popular starter stocks. You know, like a company like , for example. Unless you're able to access fractional shares via your brokerage and can get a third of a share of Amazon or a quarter of a share of Amazon, you're going to be paying, you know, $2,000 for a share. And you look at a $10,000 portfolio and you say, well, OK, this is immediately going to be 23% of my portfolio. Sometimes with companies like that, you just need to bite the bullet, buy the shares, but then realize that you should be adding to other positions as you bring new cash in because you already have huge exposure to a company like Amazon.Yeah, some people love those concentrated portfolios, but we generally say, it's better to kind of spread the bets around a little bit. So, you know, you're going to manage something where you have $5,000 or $100,000 very differently, but you can normalize that a little bit by thinking about things in a way of percentages; like you were saying before, Joey.I think too, that percentage-based approach and the mindset of I'm going to buy this multiple times, is super-important, because there's almost this kind of FOMO to getting started, where you're like, \"Whoa! behind the eight ball,\" you know, \"I haven't been investing, I got to put my cash to work right now.\" And you got to start all these positions right now. And often that isn't the best thing to do. And you're kind of speaking to exactly what I've been experiencing the last couple of months. I had a friend, in January he wanted to put a very large amount of money in the market. And he's asking me. \"Hey, what stocks do you own, how much do you own of each?\" And what I always like to do, I don't like to give friends or family specific picks, because you get in the whole thing of, OK, now, it's like, if the stock goes down, I'm the worst person in the world. All I'll do is I'll screenshot my whole portfolio and say, \"Hey, here's what I own,\" just using the CNBC, \"Hey, here's all the stocks I own, if you have questions, like, what they do? Feel free to ask me.\"But it was one of those FOMO, you know, the Fear Of Missing Out, because the market was pushing all-time highs. I was like, \"Oh, yeah, those are all great companies,\" and it was like, \"Oh, I want to get fully invested right away.\" Like, you know, we're at all-time highs, we're in the 11th year of the bull market, you know, a recession is going to come within the next five years, little did I know it was six weeks away from just everything hitting the fan and the world is coming to an end.But it's one of those where, I mean, he got fully invested. And it was an epic meltdown. And I know he did some selling along the way on the way down. So, then the bounce back wasn't as significant as it could be. So, yeah, that scaling and approach, I always like to say, you know, if you got all this money, just think how hard you worked to get it, and you want to be very smart.Buying in thirds is always a great strategy that you'll find all across The Fool that people like to do, because if you love, love, love a company at $50 a share, just because it goes to $55, doesn't mean you missed it. Like, if you think long-term this stock could go up a 1,000% or 10,000%, why are you going to fret over 10%? Like, dollar-cost averaging. And don't worry about trying to catch the bottom.That's the other thing, is I was getting all these texts, \"Oh, man, did I miss it? Did I miss it?\" Like, even right now, yes, the market has rallied so hard, but we're still well off of our highs. And even then, trying to look at something based on the highs and lows, that's just a fool's game. Like, you want to look where do you think the market is going to be in 100 years, you might not be here for it, but caring about where a stock was three weeks ago and where it was a year ago or, like, the 52-week high and low, that's just not a game I want to play. I'm focused on where the company is going over the long-term and where you'll get the best return on your investment. I like that philosophy. And actually, I had a very similar conversation with a friend, not so much related to stocks, but talking about Roth IRA contributions. And this is in February, and you know they were saying, like, \"Okay,\" you know, it's a couple; like, \"We're ready to make our Roth contributions because we have some extra cash. Should we just put it all in?\" And I was like, \"You know, I think it would be better if you took ... \" I forget what the limits are for 2020, if it's like $5,500 or $6,000 or maybe $6,500, but you divide that in three and just spread it out over the course of the year, because you don't want your cost-basis for that one year tied to that one specific point in time. And that's what we talk about with diversification. So much of that is often through the lens of what you own, but you also kind of have to think about it in when you bought it. And being able to purchase overtime, helps you spread that out, you don't have the cost basis tied to one moment in time.That's why 401(k)s are so awesome, is because you are buying in, you know, if you're paid every two weeks, you're buying in 24 times over the course of the year. And that means that none of those are going to be at the bottom, none of them are going to be at the top. You know, you're going to be able to have a nice smooth curve for your cost over time, which helps a lot, and it prevents you from making some kind of painful decisions. And speaking exactly into the 401(k) thing. So, up until recently, my entire 401(k) is a single company which I've told you guys about time and time again, Sea Limited. Just because I think long-term this company has such a significant growth runway. So, ever since I started full-time here at The Fool in March of last year, I've been doing a couple hundred bucks, every paycheck, it's just going to my 401(k) and I just buy, you know, eight to 10 more shares of Sea Limited.Now, of course, that number is going down, because the stock, I think it's doubled since I first started buying it, and it just keeps going up. So, yeah, my average cost of the stock might be $44 now where that original one was $30 or something, but if I think this stock could go to $150 billion market cap, and it's currently sitting at $35 billion or something like that, then I don't care.Yes, and I'm buying slowly on the way up, if it pulls back, hey, great, I get it on sale, but never really worrying about what price you're getting in at. But then, say, the market were to absolutely tank and then you get more attractive entry points.And where you're saying, you know, space it out over the course of the year, I have a friend who is a self-employed realtor, and he can make a specific contribution every single year. And I think it's, like, $9,000. He's like, \"Yeah, I can put $9,000 in on this day.\" And I was like, \"Do you think you could space that out to where you maybe make a quarterly contribution, because then, you know, get some cash to play here and here and here, because that would be a better way to go about it.\" Especially, I mean, imagine if he could put some to work in the first quarter this year, that would probably quadruple by the time he makes his year-end contribution for this year.So, yeah, if you can space it out or if you've got a 401(k) at your fingertips or self-directed 401(k) is always odd. I mean, that's a stock-picker in me saying that, but I definitely think the whole, you know, put money to work slowly, will be the most successful strategy for most investors. And psychologically, it's just such a benefit. You know, if you look at something and you say, OK, I've got $10,000 to invest and you put $3,000 we'll say, to work at once, and you buy a handful of companies. And then the market sells off 10%, you still have several thousand dollars that you can go in and look and say, \"You know what, this is an opportunity, this is a chance to buy up shares at a discount relative to where they were,\" instead of hand wringing and saying, \"Oh, boy! you know, I'm stuck here,\" or having to sell on the way down, unfortunately as some people do.Our third question for this mailbag actually kind of ties into this concept. So, I want to rope it in this conversation, Joey. This is from Jeff on , and Jeff asked, \"I understand that winners win, and the reason for adding to them, however, I hate increasing my cost-basis, how do I deal with that?\"Any psychological advice there, Joey? Okay. So, from a guy that got  at $7.99 and has wanted to add to it so many times, but I don't want to mess up that cost basis, because seeing that percentage return is so great. One of the tricks that I learned is, you can have your cost-basis tool on these different platforms. So, if you love seeing those beefy returns and want to show them off, you can go into the \"my account,\" go to \"cost basis,\" you have to go to your \"unrealized gain and loss,\" because that goes to your current holdings that you haven't sold, and there's a little \"+\"next to companies that you bought several times. So, like, I can click on my holding in  and I see, OK, so my first position is down 15%, ouch, but because I was smart and bought on the way down and I bought at $10.90, was my last purchase, that is up 79.9%.So, you can always go across and you can see. Now, that works when the stock is going down. And say, Etsy, if I would have been smarter and added to it at $16 and $20 and $24, the same menu, you can click on and see, OK, the first time I bought is up 5%; second time I bought is up 3%; up 1%. So, you can, kind of, see how it goes.I'm even looking at my Roku cost-basis, it would've been very smart if I would have just bought and held my original position, it's up 86%, but then it came down a little bit and I bought more, that's up 70%. And I love the stock still so much today, I was buying on the way up, and I bought again at $90, and that's 41%, I bought again at $114, that's 11%. So, I prefer buying stocks on the way up, because it's a great company, it's crushing it, it goes up a little bit more.Buying on the way down is usually, stocks go down consistently over an extended period of time for a reason, and that's where, it's just like, you know, the bag is getting heavier. And you don't want to be that bag-holder. So, it's kind of like catching a falling knife when it comes to value stocks. But you know, don't let that cost basis, I guess, become too much, like, oh, I want to see that huge gain, because there's that cost-basis tool. Like, if you want to show how that first time you bought a company that's up 1,000%, you could still access it. Yeah, I think there's an old axiom, like, don't let perfect get in the way of good. And you know, it might be awesome to have a slug of a stock, a small position, that's up to 300%. But if the market is up 20%, and you have a second position that's also up 80%. That's pretty darn good; it's not perfect, [laughs] but it's pretty darn good, and you'd take it as outperformance.You know, there are also some companies where they are high-growth businesses. And the one that most immediately comes to mind with me with this is MercadoLibre, where it has been just gangbusters if you look over the course of five years. But if you zoom in and you're looking over the past year, I mean, there's a point where shares sold off 40% and that is not an isolated incident. If you go back to 2019, shares sold-off about 20%, to almost 30%. And so, you know, there are some big winners over long periods of time that have had a lot of hiccups along the way. And while it can hurt to see, you're paying slightly more for something, the advantage of spacing those purchases over time is, you know, there are good businesses that miss earnings one quarter and wind up on sale, and it's really nice to be in a position where you can add to them. Exactly. And that's exactly what I was doing with  with my daughter's accounts. Shopify, I mean, I absolutely love that company, I think it's going to be the fastest company to reach $1 trillion market cap from going public. And I mean, that's going to be a long ways away. So, maybe we'll have this quote in 30 years when it hits that.But it's one of those where if I was concerned about this stock has been on such a huge run over the last five years, I shouldn't buy it for my daughters, but I think where would the stock be when they're 20 or 25 when these accounts mature. Buying them 10 shares of Shopify in the high-$200s might have seemed not like the best move at the time, but you know, stocks like that absolutely take off.And now I've got my son, Theodore, where he's got his account. So, far he's only got, what, Pinterest, Sea Limited and Roku in his account. And I just keep thinking, like, OK, I need to get him some Shopify. But of course, now the dollar amount is so high, it's like $700 a share. I'm like, OK, we'll let some cash build up in his account, but I don't care whether the stock is at $700 when he buys it or $600 or $500 or I mean, crap, it could be at $1,000 at the rate it's going right now. But it's just, I want to own a piece of a very, very good business or a great business that I think could be significantly larger over the long-term. And, yeah, don't let that, kind of, mess up where you're going to be. Yeah. Another way to look at it that might be, kind of, psychologically helpful is, you know you buy your first position, and you may know a good amount about a company at that point, but you cover a company, you track a company a little bit differently when you have skin in the game. You know, you're going to follow what's going on with that business a lot more intimately and you're going to be a lot more concerned with their quarterly results.If you wind up seeing that, you know, after owning it for some number of quarters, shares are up 20%, 30%, 40%. And you're like, \"Man, I should have bought more early.\" The other way to look at is to say, \"Well, it seems like my original thesis was probably pretty good and we're seeing that play out over these quarters and now I'm in a position where as long as I still see that thesis intact and the numbers are moving the way that I want to, I have a higher conviction in buying the stock,\" you know, \"It has proven to me that it is worthy of my dollars and while I am paying a little bit more for it, maybe my level of confidence in it is higher as well.\" Yeah. And seeing that performance over time should help you gain more confidence. Using MercadoLibre as another example, my good friend, Jason, he first started investing, didn't have a lot of cash and I think he bought, like, two or three shares of MercadoLibre in the high-$200s. And as he would deploy more cash, he's like, \"Man, MELI has just been crushing it nonstop, I want to buy more.\" And of course, it was like at, say, $500 share and then it runs to, like, $700, then it comes back down, but he doesn't care about where the swoons are, he's just wise beyond his years apparently or just not an emotional investor like a lot of people get.But every time he has capital ready to go, he's like, look, MercadoLibre has just been that one stock that has constantly crushed it for me. And I always tell him, like, \"Yeah, look, it's still only, like, what $35 billion, $40 billion company right now. If you think this has Amazon-like potential of reaching $1 trillion. Like, this is still a very, very tiny company compared to what it could be one day.\" And I think that's what you got to look at it is, is this company mature and is this one that's going to trade sideways over the course of time or do I still believe in it so much that I want to own more? And usually for your big winners, the answer will be, yes. Yeah. And that's why that market cap, kind of, approach can be helpful. It's a lot easier to look at something that's $1 billion business and say, oh, this could become a $10 billion business or a $15 billion business in time, than it is to stare at a share price sometimes, and say, oh, it's gone up a lot, I don't -- you know, like, you lose the context for the size of the business and its operations.And so, over time, I've tried to look a little bit more and say, like, OK, we're looking at some software companies that are sub-$2 billion, are there some examples out there of companies that service similar total addressable markets but have blossomed into $10 billion, $20 billion companies? And if you can say, yeah, the answer is yes. And the financial back it up and the thesis is there, then, you know, it's nice to get shares at $1 billion as a valuation, but if it's going to grow to $20 billion, it's OK to buy them at $5 billion too. Yeah. I would say, if you look back at the biggest winners over the last 10, 20 years, I would guarantee you, you would have more success buying stocks at their 52-week highs and their 52-week lows, because most of the time -- I mean, David Gardner, he says this quite a bit, but, and I believe in it so much, is, winners keep on winning. I mean, usually a stock consistently hits 52-week lows for a reason and it continues lower, while those winners as they keep hitting their 52-week highs, if you were to add stocks at their 52-week highs, you'd probably do much better. Yeah. And I love that we got all these questions. I mean, I love the mailbag episodes that we get to do. And we do them basically when the mailbag gets full. So, Jeff, David, Marie, I'm so happy that you guys wrote in with some thoughts here. Joey and I certainly love taking questions and chatting through things.And listeners, if you want us to talk about anything in particular, write in, IndustryFocus@Fool.com or you can tweet us @MFIndustryFocus to have that conversation.We like getting recipes too. We got some smoker recipes. I gave a shout-out last week for that, but you know, you don't always have to write in with stocks, you can also write in for Austin and Joey, you guys can write in about baseball stuff and they'd love to hear about that. Yeah. And for Austin, if you could write in some alternative meat smoking directions for him to try out, I'm sure he would love that. I'll take the hard pass on that one. [laughs] I just wanted to hear his voice; there it is. [laughs] Yeah. And we're giving love in particular to Tom, who wrote in with recipes for smoked lamb chops and maple smoked salmon, which we'll be giving -- I think Austin was going to try the salmon and I was going to try the lamb chops on the smoker. We'll see when that happens; I got to make sure I can get the cuts and meat for it, but. I think there's a company coming out with some alternative crab meat that we can get Austin to try. I don't know about that, that sounds a little weird.You saw that, right? It's like an alternative meat crab cake or something like that? I did not see that. No, but I believe it though. And, you know, I would toss a sausage on the smoker and see how that turns out. I'm OK with that. Oh, that stuff's good. I think they are very good. I also like the real thing. [laughs] So, I'm not beholden to one or the other; I'm happy to have both. Joey, I know that you're a Beyond bull. Hey, it recently joined some services here. I want to say, I was very early on that one, but I saw the light after I tried it and I think as you see all the issues that these big meat producers are having with COVID just ravaging their plants. And kind of, I don't really trust a lot of these meat companies with the cleanliness of their facilities. So, you see a guy like Ethan Brown just an ultimate class act and plant-based -- it's just something I could get behind. And I got to say, it's worked out well for anybody sitting around me that was listening and bought that stock. Yeah, we kind of have the full spectrum here, because you are the Beyond bull. I'd say, when I grill, I will normally get some Beyond products. And Austin, [laughs] we did a YouTube video together about this and he was not convinced, so a little bit of everything -- ... yeah, I saw the opposite of the light. I tried it and I saw darkness; I'm not going to buy this. [laughs] Yeah, it's good to have some in the freezer. You know, if you have a friend who doesn't eat meat come by. But -- Austin is not within the total addressable market of Beyond Meat. No, not yet, we'll see. [laughs] Maybe they can get him with crab legs. [laughs] On that note, Joey, thanks for hopping on today's show, man. Loved answering these questions with you. Always a pleasure. Alright. Listeners, that's going to do it for this episode of IF.

Uber Technologies\u2019 interest in Grubhub illustrates that, even in the worst of times, management teams will look to the future, trying to buy strategic assets. Picking the companies that might get bought is hard to do, but a few merger-and-acquisition screens are time-tested.\n                Barron\u2019s has identified a dozen stocks to sift through for investors looking at add catalyst-driven ideas to their portfolios. Year to date, more than 100 deals have been announced or completed. That prorates to about 278 for all of 2020. Not bad considering the damage Covid-19 has wrought on the economy. When times get tough, businesses often hunker down and build cash. But there are also deals to be had, and that drives some to be bold and start buying. \n                    https://asset.barrons.com/dynamic-insets/charts/cdc_4a26b26f07849d9f2a15b96e.json\n                The average large deal over the past few years has been about $4 billion. Companies worth less than that are a good place to start. Another place to start is in companies whose stocks have underperformed the broader market and have a long-tenured CEO. It is the proverbial hot seat. Weaker-than-average performance, of course, isn\u2019t always the fault of management, but it is like wounded prey in the jungle that is the stock market. \n                Steel Dynamics shares (ticker: STLD) are down about 10% a year on average over the past three years. The S&P 500 has returned about 8% a year on average over the same span. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has returned about 6%. Steel Dynamics\u2019 returns are actually better than its peers. Steel has been a tough industry for a while. A merger with, say, Nucor (NUE) would consolidate the industry and allay some fears over growing industry capacity. \n                L Brands (LB) might look to do something after Sycamore walked away from its plan to purchase Victoria\u2019s Secret. The stock is down 39% year to date and discretionary retailers may have to combine and cut costs to survive in a post-Covid world. \n                Moog (MOG.A) is an aerospace and defense player. The aerospace industry has been decimated by Covid-19. Demand for new jets isn\u2019t expected to recover for years. When revenue falls, companies will look to increase earnings by cutting costs. Deal synergies can help accomplish that goal. \n                Yelp (YELP) is in the same industry space as Grubhub (GRUB) and its shares have lost investors about 9% a year on average over the past thee years. In light of the UBER deal, Yelp could now be more-attractive to buyers.Wolfe Research portfolio strategist Chris Senyek runs a variety of M&A screens, including companies that are growing in growing industries. Growth is an attractive characteristic for any acquirer. M&A doesn\u2019t always have to be predicated on beaten-up stocks. A lot of the names on his list are in social media, technology and software. That isn\u2019t a surprise. That is where a lot of the growth is. Four that caught our eye are Etsy (ETSY), Splunk (SPLK), Pure Storage (PSTG) and II-VI (IIVI). All four are loved by Wall Street, relatively speaking, with much higher than average buy-rating ratios. About 55% of analysts rates shares in the Dow Buy. Another screen Senyek runs is unloved stocks in consolidated industries. Industry consolidation can lead to higher pricing, and better profits, assuming regulators approve deals. Four names on this list include: Corteva (CTVA), Reliance Steel & Aluminum (RS), Flowserve (FLS) and Woodward (WWD). Corteva caught Barron\u2019s eye because we have written positively about the agricultural seed and chemical company. Flowseve is similar and one of the beaten-up oily industrials we highlighted as oil prices plunged. Benchmark crude prices are off about 60% year to date. Reliance is a steel-service center and falls into the Steel Dynamic category. Finally, Woodward was doing a deal with Hexcel (HXL) that was called off after the commercial-aerospace downturn arrived in 2020. Management might be amenable to other deals in the near future. Picking winners and losers requires maintaining a delicate balance. It takes two to tango. On a basic level, stocks can\u2019t be so beaten up that management isn\u2019t willing to sell. And they can\u2019t be so expensive that no one wants to touch them. It is hard to know whether this list will prove prescient over the next 12 months. At least each stock has some other catalyst, such as growth or low valuation, to fall back on. \n                Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com\n            The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at , one standout is the First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (Symbol: CIBR) where we have detected an approximate $158.2 million dollar inflow -- that's a 11.4% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 48,300,002 to 53,800,002).

The stock went on to generate massive returns over the years and is trading at $102.14 as of this writing. It had previously touched an all-time high of $176.31.So how much would an investor have if they invested $1,000 in the IPO? An investor could have purchased 58 shares for $986, and that position would now be worth $5,924, yielding six times the original investment. Even buying in after that first day surge, shareholders would still enjoy a nearly 200% gain, easily outperforming the broad market as you can see below.\u00a0Data by .Splunk is one of the more dynamic and innovative players in big data and provides tools enabling enterprises to make better decisions with real-time visibility. Splunk is fast making its presence felt in the data analytics space.The company's platform helps clients simplify and modernize information technology for critical functions to increase uptime, which further provides them with a competitive advantage. Companies can monitor or troubleshoot across cloud, virtual, and physical infrastructures.Enterprises cannot afford to let IT systems fail, as such roadblocks can impact the top line. By leveraging Splunk's solutions, clients can now monitor and measure performance and response time for mission-critical applications.In case you have workloads running on clouds, Splunk has an analytics solution to get visibility into cloud costs and help forecast demand. The company can help customers monitor a variety of applications, gain valuable insights, and improve several aspects of the application lifecycle.In fiscal 2020 (ended Jan. 31, 2020), revenue rose 31% to $2.36 billion, while adjusted earnings were up 41% to $1.88 per share. Annual recurring revenue rose 54% to $1.68 billion, and the company's shift to a subscription-based model is almost complete.\u00a0In 2019, Splunk announced it would move to a \u00a0(SaaS) model. Such a move would enable the company to generate a stable stream of recurring subscription sales, thus helping it offset cyclicality and economic downturns.Image Source: Getty Images.While Splunk's top line in fiscal 2021 is likely to be impacted by COVID-19, its long-term prospects remain strong given the company's expanding addressable market and increasing customer base. The company  at $62 billion, and this has doubled since its IPO.In fiscal 2020, Splunk managed to expand its customer list with additions like McLaren Racing, one of the largest players in the motor-racing space. Splunk's data-to-everything platform will help McLaren improve customer engagement and capture data across the organization., the media and\u00a0television company, will leverage Splunk Cloud to gain insignt into the customer-streaming experience. The streaming analytics data provided by Splunk should help Discovery improve the viewership experience, which will increase the company's customer-retention rate.Several existing customers, such as the , are also expanding their use of Splunk's services, and this is driving overall revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, Splunk managed to record 221 customer orders with an average contract value (ACV) of over $1 million, up from 179 in the prior-year period. It also landed 35 deals with an ACV of greater than $10 million, up from 24 last year.Splunk shares will be range-bound in the next few months as investors try to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 on the company's top line. Furthermore, its shift to a SaaS-based model will also result in near-term cash flow disruptions.The company ended perpetual licensing with most of its customers and shifted them to renewable contracts. In a perpetual licensing business, revenue is realized immediately when a contract is signed, while in a SaaS business, it is realized over time.Management expects revenue to grow just 6% year over year in the fiscal 2021 first quarter and by 10% in fiscal 2021 overall. This will put pressure on the company's profit margins and cash flow metrics.Splunk is asking investors to focus on its annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth, which is expected to fall in the mid-40% range in fiscal 2021. The company is optimistic about sustaining ARR growth of around 40% through fiscal 2023 and reaffirmed its  of $1 billion for that year.Splunk should continue to  as it will benefit from the exponential . Its sales guidance for 2021 is tricky due to , but the renewal of previously booked contracts will boost revenue growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond.In terms of profitability, Splunk expects a negative operating margin of 25% in the first quarter and breakeven for fiscal 2021. However, it aims to increase the operating margin to 20% by fiscal 2023.\u00a0Splunk has a forward price-to-sales valuation of 6.2, which is reasonable considering its estimated growth rates.  such as ,,, and are all trading at higher forward price-to-sales multiples with Shopify hitting 20 times.Long-term investors can look at the 40% pullback in Splunk stock as a buying opportunity.

To some investors, that might suggest the easy money has been made.That\u2019s not the case. Splunk stock still sits well below recent highs.

Splunk\u2019s software can identify service problems that are leading to customer losses. It can detect evidence of fraud, or highlight potential gaps in marketing campaigns.That flexibility and breadth means Splunk isn\u2019t just for tech companies. Clients include  (NYSE:),  (OTCMKTS:) and, as recently announced, the .And Splunk\u2019s capabilities have driven impressive growth. Revenue rose 31% in 2019.

Results for Q4 were in line. But the company\u2019s outlook for fiscal 2021 (which ends Jan. 31) appeared to be .Revenue guidance of $2.6 billion suggests only about 10% revenue growth year-over-year. Wall Street was expecting a 22% increase. Investors initially dumped SPLK stock on the news, believing that the business was decelerating.But as chief executive officer Doug Merritt explained to Bloomberg, that\u2019s . Rather, the company is shifting to cloud-based offerings from license agreements with fixed terms. Revenue from cloud agreements is recognized on a more delayed basis, which pressures the reported top-line figure.Splunk thus reports ARR (annual recurring revenue), which adjusts for the varying recognition schedules of different contracts. And that figure shows how well the business is performing.ARR grew 54% in the fourth quarter. And Splunk expects the metric to grow at a 40% annualized rate through the next three years.That\u2019s one of the best growth rates in the entire market. But at a little over 7x revenue, SPLK stock is not valued as one of the market\u2019s best growth stories.Again, some investors are figuring that out. But there\u2019s little reason why the rally in SPLK has to stop at this point.As always, there are risks. Competition is intense, with  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:) among the better rivals. And SPLK stock looks expensive on an earnings basis: it trades at 81x next year\u2019s consensus earnings per share estimate.But those risks are worth taking. The market is large enough for multiple winners. (In fact, both ESTC and DDOG look intriguing after their own sell-offs.) And near-term earnings don\u2019t capture the long-term potential. As growth companies should, Splunk is investing now to attract \u2018sticky\u2019 long-term customers.Only a few weeks ago, investors were taking the long view and rewarding the companies that made those investments.

Since the end of January, most of these stocks are down substantially. Sea has lost less than 5%, but Zscaler, Splunk, and MongoDB have shed around 30%, and BlackBerry has lost nearly 40%.The selling pressure has been largely due to the stock market sell-off, although lofty valuations may be playing a role.

With adjusted EPS of $0.08 expected by analysts this year, the price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 47. The company's growth has been solid, with revenue up 23% in the fiscal third quarter, but that hasn't been enough to prevent a steep stock decline in the past few weeks.While Zscaler stock is up over the past year, shares have been tumbling well before the coronavirus panic. The stock is now down about 54% from its 52-week high, which was reached in late 2019. A string of weak guidance from the company appears to have given investors second thoughts about its growth prospects. Most recently, Zscaler guided for third-quarter adjusted EPS between $0.01 and $0.03, below the analyst consensus of $0.04.Sea Limited stock has seen the least impact from the market panic so far. Earlier this month, the company reported results that beat expectations across the board. Adjusted revenue was up 133.5% to $909.1 million, beating the average analyst estimate by $35 million. Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.53, ahead of expectations by $0.05.

Riding the wave of interest in data analytics as organizations around the globe update their operations for the 21st century, the company added hundreds of new customers and made a big $1.05 billion acquisition in cloud computing monitoring outfit  last August. As a result, sales for the year once again grew north of 30% -- total revenue was up 31% to $2.36 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 41% to $1.88. Perhaps it comes as a surprise, then, that the stock has retreated some 17% since the company released this latest report card. No, coronavirus can't be the sole scapegoat here. As good as the top-line momentum was, it seems that Splunk's own transition to cloud computing-based services is going to cause a hiccup in growth during the first quarter -- to the tune of 6% growth year over year. You read that right, just a single-digit percentage increase. Add in an expected adjusted operating profit margin of negative 25% on revenue of $450 million, and growth seemingly falling off a cliff looks like reason to panic. But before I convince you to go and sell all of your Splunk stock, let me point out that this situation is likely to be a temporary one. If you originally purchased -- or plan on purchasing -- this stock for the long haul, there's little reason to worry.Image source: Getty Images.In a move to update its business model to meet current trends, Splunk started transitioning to term and  contracts for its customers -- which offer greater flexibility in software use and cost rather than the perpetual licensing it was previously using. In fact, demand for term and cloud was so strong that Splunk eliminated perpetual software licenses altogether and reported that 99% of its revenue bookings were under one of these renewable contracts. With the stated goal of moving away from perpetual complete, the case is closed on this success story, right? \u00a0Not so fast. While new licensing standards are a good thing for customers, they cause headaches for Splunk shareholders. That's because there's a difference between how term contract and cloud contract revenues are recognized. As CFO Jason Child explained on the : \u00a0The bookings mix between term and cloud becomes an important balance to understand, so it too can have a meaningful impact to the financial statements. Going into [fiscal year] 20, the year we just closed, we expected cloud would contribute about 25% of software bookings. Turns out that cloud demand was significantly higher, and ultimately 35% of total software [total contract value] was from cloud, most of which came in the second half of the year. And because revenue recognized from a cloud contract is fully ratable, even a large cloud contract on a [total contract value] basis will yield significantly less revenue than a comparably-sized term contract. \u00a0In layperson's terms, when a term contract is signed, most of the revenue is recognized immediately. For a cloud contract, revenue is recognized over time. Splunk is continuing to emphasize cloud contracts and is targeting 60% of revenue to be cloud-based by fiscal year 2023 (up from 35% in fiscal 2020). Put simply, the fast cloud migration will look like slower revenue growth (up 6% in the first quarter and an expected 10% increase for full-year 2021) than what is actually occurring. To compensate for the transitioning revenue recognition, Splunk management is telling investors to focus on annual recurring revenue (ARR), which counts the growth in cloud subscription and term sales and offers a better view of the services Splunk is actually delivering to customers. Splunk's fiscal 2020 ended with ARR of $1.68 billion, up 54% year-over-year -- made up of $442 million of cloud licenses and $1.24 billion from term licenses. And even though recognized revenue for the year ahead looks dismal, management said it expects ARR to increase in the mid-40% range and then grow at about 40% each in fiscal 2022 and 2023. If successful, that would equate to $4.6 billion in ARR by fiscal 2023 compared with the $1.68 billion just delivered. \u00a0Those are some incredible growth rates Splunk's cloud transition is expected to yield, but what about the bottom line?Just as revenue growth will likely trough this year as the company continuously favors cloud, so too will adjusted operating losses. Though a negative 25% operating margin looks dismal for the first quarter, management forecasts break-even for the full-year period. And by fiscal 2023, the long-term outlook for at least $1 billion in operating cash flow (a roughly 20% margin) was also reiterated. \u00a0Not being able to recognize revenue upfront is thus going to wreak havoc on Splunk's cash flow for the short term, but the proof better times are ahead can be seen from the recent past. Before going all-in on cloud transformation, Splunk's free cash flow was positive and rising as the software analytics firm grew and got more efficient. Once weaned off term contracts, the free cash flow situation is likely to recover with a vengeance.\u00a0Data by .In a nutshell, Splunk's outlook was far better than it looked.

The fact that the index recovered slightly to close down \"only\" 19% below its previous high, therefore, may give nitpickers enough wiggle room to argue that we didn't actually achieve bear market status on Wednesday.But hey! There's always Thursday, right?Kidding aside, the fact that the Dow (and the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500, and the Russell 2000...) have fallen umpteen percent in a matter of a couple of weeks is bound to get some investors thinking that now might be a good time to start bottom-fishing for bargains in the stock market -- official bear market or no. In fact, amidst all the market turmoil Wednesday, one brave investment banker began doing just that: Sifting through the rubble, and searching for bargains.Here's what Rosenblatt Securities' analysts came up with yesterday:Rosenblatt's  offers up GoDaddy stock as the banker's first tech pick of the day. The Scottsdale, Arizona-based domain registration company has been hard hit in the tech rout, falling 25% in share price over the past three weeks. And yet, Zgutowicz argues this now leaves the stock \"attractively-priced in both absolute and relative terms.\"Why are these analysts so optimistic? GoDaddy maintains \"dominant positioning with over 19M customers,\" explains Zgutowicz, and its \"refreshed global brand\" positions the company to develop \"more and deeper customer engagements with high margin products\" including \"Websites + Marketing\" and \"Managed WordPress\" going forward. Leveraging its existing client base and selling them on these new products, Zgutowicz could conceivably grow its profits 30% this year (to $0.99 per share), and then grow them another 25% in 2021 (to $1.25 a share).Furthermore, the analyst believes GoDaddy\u2019s upcoming April 2nd Investor Day should be a catalyst for the shares. \"While \u201920 guidance was provided on the 4Q , we expect the company to provide a new LT growth forecast, perhaps by segment, which may alleviate some questions about moderating domain and hosting growth. In this regard, we would not be surprised to see a floor put in place for both domain and hosting LT growth, which we believe will provide a nice stabilizer for the stock,\" the analyst opined.In Zgutowicz's estimation, this is fast enough growth to justify a \"buy\" rating on GoDaddy stock as well. From a Wednesday closing price just above $58, he predicts these shares could rise as high as $88 over the next 12 months -- a near 52% return. (To watch Zgutowicz's track record, )Interestingly, this prediction is almost precisely what other analysts have valued GoDaddy at. Among of the eight analysts who've ventured an opinion on GoDaddy in the last month, each and every one of them a \"buy\" rating by the way, the overwhelming consensus is that GoDaddy shares are worth about $88.88 per share. So, the message is clear: GDDY is a Strong Buy. ()Let's continue with Boston-based PTC. The software and services company behind the \"Creo\" suite of product design software has been hit pretty hard by the coronavirus-inspired tech selloff, losing about 33% of its market cap in the last three weeks. In a note Wednesday, Rosenblatt analyst  observed that investors seem to be reacting to PTC's \"relatively large exposure\" -- about 30% of its revenues -- to industrial clients in the retail and airline sectors, which could suffer in a coming recession.That being said, Kim believes that the company's \"recent transition to a ratable revenue model,\" where more of the business derives from recurring revenue from existing customers, should insulate PTC somewhat from any economic turbulence.\"ARR growth,\" says Kim, \"is more driven by the sustainability of [PTC's] churn rate\" among existing customers rather than by acquiring new customers. And last time America faced a recession, in 2009, the company \"didn't experience any deterioration in its churn rate.\" Moreover, here today PTC is says its churn rate has recently \"modestly improved,\" and management believes that \"it can grow its ARR at least in the low-teens for the current F2Q even without any new business bookings for the rest of the quarter.\"Kim is predicting that despite the current economic troubles, PTC will successfully grow its profits as much as 40% this year (to $2.30 per diluted share) and a further 12% in 2021. If he's right about that, Kim thinks the stock could be worth as much as $105 a share -- as much as 76% above where it trades today. (To watch Kim's track record, )All in all, cautious optimism circles this software maker, as TipRanks analytics exhibit PTC as a Buy. Out of 9 analysts tracked by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 5 are bullish on PTC stock, while 4 remain sidelined. With a return potential of nearly 50%, the stock\u2019s consensus target price stands at $90.22. ()Next up from Rosenblatt is another pick by Mr. Kim: San Francisco-based real-time operational intelligence software provider Splunk.Down 31% from where it traded three weeks ago, Splunk stock looks like another bargain to Kim, who values the shares at $200, even -- about 66% above where they trade todayWhy is it a bargain? Once again, Kim's analysis focuses on ARR, \"the key metric that reflects the company's actual business momentum.\"\u00a0 Annual recurring revenue, explains Kim, was up 54% in Q4 2019, accelerating from the 50% growth rate Splunk was showing a year ago.Management at Splunk is forecasting \"mid-40s\" ARR growth this year -- and not only this year, but 40% average growth rates all the way through fiscal 2023, numbers that \"we believe will be received positively by investors,\" understated the analyst. Furthermore, Kim confirms that, in his view at least, \"SPLK's ARR growth guidance is highly achievable.\"While other investors are worrying about the short-term effects of coronavirus, Kim argues that Splunk is forging ahead and \"emerging as a de facto standard in the infrastructure and security management platform market, which positions the company well for the next stage of growth.\"Other analysts share a similar enthusiasm with Kim when it comes to the data analytics giant. TipRanks data shows out of 23 analysts, 20 are bullish and only 3 are sidelined. With a consensus price target of $179.55, the potential upside here stands at nearly 50%.

Its GAAP loss per share for the fiscal fourth quarter was $0.15 compared to a positive GAAP income per share of $0.01 the year prior.\u00a0This is a reason for concern, but it's not uncommon for  to run at a loss for years, and in Splunk's case, there's a method to the madness.Splunk unveiled a new product, its Data-to-Everything platform, in September. CEO Doug Merritt admitted the product was a \"multi-year, multi-billion dollar commitment.\"\u00a0The company tackled the project to execute its vision of helping customers more easily unlock business insights contained in the data being collected. It positions Splunk as one of the few data analytics organizations that assist clients in making sense of massive troves of data. As a new product, it's still too early to tell if the investment will pay off.\u00a0Moreover, Splunk does not shy away from . It purchased SignalFX, a cloud monitoring company, for\u00a0$1 billion in cash and stock. The company also scooped up\u00a0start-ups Omnition, operating in a specialized area of the software monitoring space, and Streamlio, which processes and stores data streams in real-time. These costs ate away much of Splunk's once-hefty cash assets of nearly $1.9 billion in the year-ago quarter, now down to $779 million.\u00a0\u00a0Still, there are many reasons for investors to consider Splunk. Data collection is growing, and with it, the business needs for Splunk's strengths in data analytics. Its products are designed for the red-hot  space.In addition, the company transitioned to a true  offering by switching to a subscription-based pricing model. This allows Splunk to tap into a recurring revenue stream, one of the strengths of a SaaS business model. (Previously, Splunk priced its products on a perpetual license basis, having customers pay up front for the software license with the right to use it indefinitely.)Before the switch to a subscription-based pricing model, its hefty up-front cost was the reason my company passed on Splunk, so the new pricing opens up increased revenue opportunities as evidenced in its 2020 full-year results, where total annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $1.68 billion, up 54% year over year.Moreover, Splunk anticipates revenue to continue growing.\u00a0\u00a0Its full-year revenue guidance for fiscal year 2021, ending January 31, 2021, is for revenue to increase to $2.6 billion, up from $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2020. This fell short of analyst expectations of $2.8 billion, causing the stock to drop.Even so, Splunk believes it will achieve operating cash flow (OCF) of , thanks to its switch to a subscription-based pricing model.\u00a0To throw out\u00a0an OCF target three years into the future is an encouraging sign of the management team's confidence in their business.With continued growth for Splunk's products and its switch to subscription pricing, the company is well positioned to continue driving value for investors.

These tech stocks were set up to plunge because of their lofty valuations. Splunk and Zen are trading at more than 90 times forward earnings estimates, and MongoDB isn't even expected to turn a profit over the next year, making it impossible to measure that stock's value by price-to-earnings ratios.

At the start of the week, the  was down 14% from the previous seven trading sessions, and other indexes such as the S&P 500 are also trading below record highs.The fears over fallout from the growing novel coronavirus outbreak have investors concerned. The coronavirus strain known as SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19. As of March 4, this virus has claimed at least 3,250 lives and infected over 95,000 people in more than 80 countries.This outbreak has triggered the recent sell-off in global equity markets. Tech stocks have moved lower as several companies have cut forecasts for 2020. While this is most likely a short-term weakness, several stocks are now trading at relatively cheaper valuations.Here three tech stocks that have strong fundamentals, impressive growth forecasts, and expanding addressable markets, making them solid bets for long-term investors looking to hold onto a stock for the next decade.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Shares of   went public at $14 per share on March 14, 2017, and have since increased by about 930%. So, a $1,000 investment in Alteryx IPO will have ballooned to $9,340 today. In the last year, shares have gained 116%, easily outperforming broader markets. The stock is, however, trading 9.6% below record highs due to overall market weakness.Alteryx is a market leader in the data analytics space. The big data vertical remains one of the fastest-growing globally, and Alteryx stands to benefit from this rapid advance.Alteryx offers a  where users without any coding experience can use it to create robust models and workflows, making it extremely user-friendly.In 2019, the company increased sales by 65%, driven by strong customer retention and customer acquisition metrics. Net customer expansion for 2019 was 130%, which means existing customers increased spending by 30%. The company also added 474 customers, increasing its total customer base to 6,100. This includes 36% of the Global 2000 companies.Though revenue growth is decelerating, it continues to expand at a stellar pace. Wall Street analysts expect sales to touch $564 million in 2020, $730 million in 2021, and $968 million in 2022, making it one of the top growth stocks to buy and hold in the long term.Another company that is betting big on the data analytics space is . Company shares have gained over 700% since its IPO in March 2012. But there is a lot of steam left for long-term investors.Splunk has managed to grow its sales from $950 million in fiscal 2017 to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019. For 2020, the consensus revenue forecast stands at $2.35 billion.

Another reason why Splunk is a solid bet is the company's shift to a subscription-based model for its cloud-based products.In 2019, Splunk moved to a software-as-a-service model, which will help the company generate a stable stream of recurring revenue. This will also help decrease cyclicality and ensure robust growth in cash flow, driving the stock price higher.\u00a0Canadian e-commerce heavyweight  has been another winner for early investors. The stock has gained a staggering 1,700% since its IPO in May 2015. However, driven by the market weakness, the stock is currently trading 13.7% below record highs.Investors are betting big on Shopify due to massive growth opportunities in the e-commerce segment.

A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the press release and on our website.With that, let me turn it over to Doug. -- Thank you, Ken, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. It was a great quarter and year-end for Splunk. I'm very proud of our results and our team, and I'm grateful for the trust and commitment of our customers and partners. We ended the year with annual recurring revenue of $1.68 billion, up 54% over last year. I'm happy to report that this is ahead of what we forecast last quarter when we introduced our transformation metrics of ARR and operating cash flow.Our shift to a renewable model is 99% complete as customers are now predominantly opting for term and cloud contracts. The flexibility and predictability of our new Data-to-Everything pricing options have made it easier to do business with us and for customers bring data to every question, decision and action. And now we're focusing squarely on cloud as a driver of our next phase of growth.Cloud-first has become our mindset from both the business model and product strategy perspective. 35% of our software business was cloud this past year, and we expect cloud to ramp at a strong pace over these next few years, reaching over 60% of our total software bookings in FY '23.I'm extremely excited about the opportunity we see ahead of us, and I'm confident in our ability to navigate another successful business model transformation, as Jason will elaborate shortly. Stepping back, what we know for sure is that digitization or digital transformation is becoming a real tangible and critical global initiative. Digital security has become a Board-level discussion for global enterprises to start-ups planning to go public. And there is an increased focus on digital technologies to help solve some of humanity's biggest challenges. This makes it clear that over the next five years, every organization must become a digital organization, and data is the fuel powering a digital organization.At Splunk, we're empowering customers with capabilities they simply can't get anywhere else at the time that they need it the most. We see tremendous opportunities across our core markets of IT Operations, Security Operations and application development. And we're investing in products and technologies that extend Splunk's value and relevance to all of our customers' decisions and actions, regardless of whether the data they need sits in the Splunk index or somewhere else.Capabilities such a stream processing, ensure customers can access massive amounts of data in real time than learn, refine and adjust that data as it moves across the stream. Our federated search capability searches across Splunk deployments and non-Splunk data sources to provide users a holistic overview of their entire data landscape at much higher speed and scale than before. Event management, orchestration, automation help our customers proactively remediate issues and take action on the insights and analysis we're capturing. And by focusing on new user interface frameworks, like consumer-grade design, collaboration, mobile and natural language processing, we're working to ensure that everyone in the organization can get value from their data regardless of how skilled or technical they are.Our vision to bring Data-to-Everything is resonating with our customers. As an example, I'm proud to report that we recently completed our largest order in Company history. Thanks in large part to the value that data stream processing signal effects on our mission brings to our portfolio, plus the combination of streaming, traces, metrics and logs combined with unparalleled scale and enterprise capabilities. That portfolio enabled us to beat 16 competitors, while our new pricing give this customer the confidence and clarity needed to commit to a massive enterprise scale order. This customer win demonstrates the power of our Data-to-Everything portfolio and most importantly, our reputation for delivering huge value to our customers.A few more highlights of customer wins in the quarter include McLaren Racing, a prominent technology innovator and racing team, who purchased Splunk Enterprise to capture data across their organization, including racing analytics as well as our infrastructure, network and server environments. Splunk's Data-to-Everything Platform will help McLaren Racing improve customer engagement on and off the racetrack.Discovery, Inc., provider of television brands, including Discovery Channel, TLC, HDTV, Food Network and more, expanded their use of Splunk Cloud to gain real-time visibility into their consumer streaming experience. Splunk is the central, investigative and monitoring solution for their video delivery platform. And the streaming analytics powered by Splunk, improve the global view and experience and provide faster mean time to resolution when IT or application issues occur with direct-to-consumer offerings.Macquarie Government, the cloud security platform trusted by over 40% of Australian governmental agencies, purchased Splunk Enterprise, Enterprise Security, Phantom and UBA to gain real-time visibility, monitoring and response into the agency's future security state. Splunk is a key player in Macquarie Government's multi-year transformational data journey, and will be used to support the agile nature of the Australian Taxation Office, as well as help protect their IT environment from security threats, harmful code, fraud and spam.Earlier, I mentioned that in Q4 we saw momentum build for our new pricing programs. As more customers turn to Splunk for an increasing set of use cases, we've answered their call from our flexible and predictable pricing options, including those not based on data ingestion. This is making it easier for our customers to bring even more data into Splunk and find faster value from that data. This quarter I've had so many customers tell me that our new pricing options have unlocked adoption within the business, which has given them the overall confidence, predictability and the right total cost of ownership to standardize on Splunk as their data platform across their organizations.Although it's early days and awareness is still building, let me give you a few examples. Long-time customer Washington Post, expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise for deeper insights and analysis for all post properties and for their fast-growing digital content management system platform Arc Publishing. Leveraging our flexible pricing programs, The Washington Post uses Splunk for real-time monitoring and data insights to help improve their overall customer experience.Splunk is also used to improve information security and threat detection. Another example, NHS Digital who significantly expanded their use of Splunk this quarter through dynamic pricing, adding Splunk Data Stream Processor and Splunk Enterprise Security to help strengthen and secure their networks. NHS Digital already uses Splunk for security and operational monitoring of England's National Health Systems. This includes e-referral services, health and social care network and spine, which indexes over 1 billion messages a month across 23,000 healthcare IT systems and over 20,000 organizations across NHS. With Splunk, NHS Digital can enhance security defenses helping them to securely deliver important health services to patients across England.In summary, it was a milestone quarter with our cloud bookings more than doubling Q4 to Q4, and it was a strong finish to FY '20. I'm so proud of the entire Splunk team. We're uniquely positioned in Data-to-Everything and we're now a 100% focused on capturing the tremendous opportunity ahead. We're investing for scale, growth and innovation. We adopted a cloud-first mindset. And most of all, we're committed to helping our customers exploit their massive Data-to-Everything opportunities.I'll now hand over to Jason to walk you in more detail through the quarter and fiscal year results. Jason, over to you. -- Thanks, Doug, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Q4 capped a very strong year for us, highlighted by a faster shift to cloud than we expected. We ended the period with total ARR of $1.68 billion, up 54% over last year. ARR was comprised of $442 million from cloud and $1.238 billion from term license and maintenance contracts.As we outlined last quarter, because customers have been opting for term and cloud contracts over perpetual faster than we anticipated, we discontinued new perpetual license offerings. As a result, in Q4, 99% of software bookings were either term or cloud and our transition into a renewable model is complete. Our focus now shifts to the move to predominantly a cloud model.The bookings mix between term and cloud becomes an important balance to understand, so it too can have a meaningful impact to the financial statements. Going into FY '20, the year we just closed, we expected cloud would contribute about 25% of software bookings. Turns out that cloud demand was significantly higher and ultimately 35% of total software TCV was from cloud, most of which came in the second half of the year. And because revenue recognized from a cloud contract is fully ratable, even a large cloud contract on a TCV basis will yield significantly less revenue than a comparably sized term contract. As we've said, because ARR normalizes bookings activity irrespective of cloud or term, ARR is the most appropriate metric to evaluate overall momentum of our business.We ended Q4 with total RPO of $1.8 billion, up 43% over Q4 of last year. The portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months, was $1 billion at period end, up 23% year-over-year. RPO bookings were $1.145 billion, up 23% from Q4 last year, and full-year RPO bookings were $2.9 billion, up 28%.The accelerating cloud contribution in Q4 led to a slower pace of growth in current RPO bookings compared to total RPO bookings. This is due to the out years of a multi-year cloud contract being classified as non-current, whereas the majority of a term contract is captured in current RPO bookings immediately. Again, ARR normalizes for this mix shift.In Q4, we recorded 221 orders greater than $1 million in total contract value, up from 179 in Q4 last year. Over the course of the year, we booked 35 orders greater than $10 million compared to 24 in the prior year. Recall that several large federal government contracts with five-year term skewed overall duration in Q3. As expected, weighted average duration reverted to prior period levels of 34 months in Q4.Now onto the P&L. Fourth quarter revenues were $791 million, up 27% year-over-year, and full-year revenues were $2.359 billion, up 31%. Cloud revenue was $99 million, up 86% over last year. Full-year cloud revenue was $312 million, up 82% from fiscal '19. Q4 software revenues, which is the total of license and cloud were $617 million, up 33% year-over-year. On a full-year basis, software revenues were $1.686 billion, up 40% over last year.On margins, which are all non-GAAP, Q4 gross margin was 86.7%, down slightly on a year-over-year basis due to a greater proportion of cloud revenue contribution. Full-year gross margin was relatively flat at 85%. Operating margin was 24% in Q4 and 14.2% for the full year, both in line with our plan. Finally, operating cash flow was negative $288 million for the year, also in line with our expectations following a mid-year shift to annual invoicing.Looking forward, we are confident in the continued acceleration of customer adoption and high-growth trajectory, and we maintain our guidance for mid-40% ARR growth this year, fiscal '21. Looking further out, we expect to sustain a 40% ARR CAGR through fiscal '23 and we reaffirm our $1 billion operating cash flow target for FY '23. Revenue guidance for this year is a little trickier, given the high variability that comes from cloud mix and related ratable revenue. With current expectations that cloud will contribute to a substantially higher proportion to overall bookings in fiscal '21, it follows that revenue growth will flatten this year, even as software bookings and ARR continue at high growth rates. As we begin to benefit from the renewal of previously booked contracts in FY '22 and '23, revenue growth should rebound sharply.So, we expect total revenues in Q1 of about $450 million and full-year revenue of $2.6 billion and will follow our normal seasonal pattern of 40% front half and 60% in the back half. With anticipated revenue snapback starting in fiscal '22, we expect annual revenue growth in the high-20% range in both FY '22 and '23. With this revenue trajectory, it follows that operating margin will trough in fiscal '21 before rebounding at '22 and '23. We expect a negative 25% operating margin in Q1 and roughly breakeven for the full year and a long-term target of 20% by fiscal '23. At our upcoming Analyst and Investor Meeting, we intend to provide a framework on how varying degrees of cloud mix will translate to revenue on profitability metrics over time, and we look forward to walking you through more details of this transition and our next phase of growth.In closing, it was a strong finish to the year and we're entering fiscal '21 with excellent momentum as the cloud business is poised to ramp rapidly. With that, let's open it up for questions.Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Congratulations on the forward-looking guidance. It looks absolutely terrific and significantly higher than what we expected. So, I want to get this right. So what you're saying is in the fiscal '23, we're poised to doing about $4.6 billion. So just take your numbers and your guidance of CAGR 40%, its about $4.6 billion in ARR we're talking about in calendar '22 timeframe. And revenue growth, it looks like based on your guidance for high-20s, if I were to CAGR the fiscal '21 guidance into fiscal '23, that's about 35% compounded revenue growth rate. And you're reiterating your operating cash flow guide for about $1 billion. It looks absolutely stunning.It looks like the -- some similarly to the Autodesk model transition, which I think was well received. My question for you is with respect to the total RPO bookings, is there some seasonality because it was up about 42% in Q3? We got a lot of them to thinking that it could be up massively again. I know Jason you talked through some of the mechanics of the shift toward the cloud. But total RPO bookings that number was up 22%. Could you shed a little bit light there? And also with respect to the revenue guidance for next year, what are your assumptions in the $2.6 billion? Clearly, everything else looks even better than expected. Congratulations again.These are terrific numbers, forward-looking numbers. -- Thanks, Kash. This is Jason. So, I guess, just to first tackle the RPO booking question. So yeah, it was 42% in Q3, but also recall that we added -- we had signal effects into the quarter. So, when you normalize for that, we grew 35%. That said, it is a deceleration. The reason for that is because on -- RPO bookings, obviously, it's revenue plus change in RPO, and so there's a number of things that move.The reality is, RPO bookings is a bit volatile and you see this, if you look over the last four quarters, you've seen a couple -- you kind of seen it go up and down, up and down. And the reason why is because it's really the combination of the timing of when deals close, and as we get larger we have a larger number of larger deals that could actually cause that volatility. And then also, of course, it depends on what we're comping against in prior period. And because of the lumpy mix kind of RP -- of when deals hit, it moves around a bit. I actually think looking at RPO bookings on a TTM basis is probably the best way to look at it, because it's kind of what do we add into the quarter, now -- in terms of new deals.Now the best metric as you've heard me say is ARR. And the reason ARR is better than RPO bookings is because it's going to cut through timing of when a deal closes, it's going to get through whether it's revenue -- or whether it's on-prem or whether it's cloud. It's just going to show what is it that we're actually delivering in the next 12 months. And so that's the number. And then you see the ARR growth has actually accelerated for I guess now six quarters in a row from when it was 46% from the first quarter reported in Q3 of a year ago and then now it's kind of been stepping up every quarter.So, we're really excited about the ARR growth and that's the number I'd focus on. -- It looks fantastic. Doug, what made Splunk win that mega deal against 15 companies? And what makes Splunk win in this market that seems like a little crowded? Why should Splunk win in the long term? That's it from me. Thank you. Congrats. -- Thanks Kash, and thank you for that softball question. So there is just -- was a... -- I can ask hardball too. -- I know. -- They look good. -- [Speech Overlap] because it -- we are really, really proud of that deal. We've obviously been making a ton of investments across the portfolio in all the buying centers, security ops and the app-dev/observability area, we've been adding things like data stream processing and federated search. And this was, I think, a testament to what we've been driving across the portfolio.The prime use case of this large customer was app-dev and the next-generation DevOps model, but like all customers, they also want to leverage the offerings for security, overall data center management in the infrastructure side. And what distinguished it is when you paired the incredible throughput and scale the capability of DSP to even further enhance the automatic metrics, extraction and dash boarding of signal effects and then the, I think, the strong synergies of tracing and what we've done with distributor tracing with signal effects on our mission with the underlying log management platform from Splunk.There was nobody that could even get within literally miles of the scale and fidelity and enterprise features that this customer rightfully demanded. They're a massive, massive organization that powers huge chunks of dollar transactions around the globe. So, it really was the investments we've been making in high-scale, high-fidelity, high-capability enterprise class functionality from everything, from logging to metrics to streaming to tracing that came together for this customer. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks so much guys. And I echo Kash's congrats on a strong finish, especially the large deal performance and a lot of the wins that you talked about. I don't know if I can do that as nice as Kash does it, but I am as enthusiastic. So I guess, maybe my first question, Doug, I know the budget for what you offer is very high priority across just about all verticals, but I have to ask the question. Is there anything you're seeing real time in terms of the demand environment just given global health concerns out there that factors into your outlook for the business right now? -- The forecast we gave for Q1 and then for the subsequent three-year outlook, FY '23 outlook, was based on everything that we have available to us today. Right as of this moment, we are not seeing any immediate impacts from all the reactions to COVID and the other volatility we see in the market. Like every other company, we're monitoring and literally on a multiple time per day basis. What I can -- what I am super excited about and happy that we're able to pull off as we did have our sales kickoff last week in Las Vegas.I know a lot of companies are reevaluating whether that is something they're going to do or not. I think that's an absolutely pivotal event for every company. It's so difficult to ensure your entire go-to-market organization is aligned with your product organization, especially in a year where we are leaning in hard on annual contract value versus total contract value and the cloud has got a lot of dynamics to it and we've got a brand new observability suite and the pricing that we're communicating is so important.So the part of that forecast was built on talking to roughly 2,500 people over the course of five days and a lot of the forecast calls we've been driving on a daily basis as well. -- Thanks, Doug. And Jason, maybe just for you, as we look out past fiscal '21 to get to your '22 and '23 guidance. How should we think about what you're embedding from a maintenance conversion perspective? Are you -- and are you expecting any uplift upon renewal of term licenses as customers transition to cloud? -- Yeah, it's a great question. I would say, last quarter, I gave the metric that, I think it was 5% of the perpetual installed base had converted to either term or cloud. That metric hasn't moved much, but I think, I'm going to -- we're going to provide a more helpful metric for you within the next quarter and that is to look more at net expansion rate because we're doing very, very well against that metric.So, in terms of the expectations, there is a -- there is definitely -- we know exactly kind of what the renewal cycles look like, which is why we are confident in the ARR growth and that's why I was able to say that we have a 40% ARR CAGR from now through FY '23. So that will certainly be a big part of growth. We also -- certainly, there is going to be continued new logo growth as well. But overall, I think the best way to look at growth today is of course ARR.I think shortly we'll give you some expansion rate metrics as well. The combination of those two will help support the guidance that we gave. -- And you can really see with that 5% number that there was nothing that we were doing special incentivize, either within the customer base or the sales force to try and drive that to a different number. And there is nothing we're doing this year and there's nothing I can conceive of doing in any other year to pay for that conversion. We are more than happy to have customers layer term or cloud on top of perp, something they'd paid for and they rightfully own.We're happy for those maintenance dollars. But as Jason said, what we're really focused on is the overall expansion and success rate of this term and cloud contracts and that's where all the core growth is going to come from. -- Great. Thanks so much guys. Congrats again. -- Thank you, Brad. -- Thanks Brad.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks. I'll echo my congrats on the ARR outlook. I think that's a lot better than pretty much any of us were thinking. Two questions. One, last quarter you guys talked about 50 customers that have converted to sort of more predictive pricing and you'd really seen a dramatic sort of increase in their footprints. I know it's still early and there's another quarter. I wonder if you could give us an update on sort of how that's progressed sort of the conversions. -- Yeah. We -- actually, we've got a very focused pricing group that in pair with the marketing team is driving high visibility on making sure that our customers have the new pricing, whether it's predicted pricing bans on data volume, or whether it's infrastructure-based pricing exposed to them at scale. My keynote heavily focused on, hey, this pricing is really important and I expect each of you to bring it to your customers and Susan reechoed that and then Sendur, Head of Product, reechod that, and then Kristen, the Head of Global Field, reechoed it over the course of three days.So, we are seeing a lot of positive signs. There is not a customer that we have encountered yet that doesn't feel that this is a big advantage to them. Virtually every customer that has looked at the new pricing and digested it has, one, they've made decision that's right for them. Some people looked at infrastructure and then went back to a predictive pricing data volume based piece, and others went the other way. But they really went back to the use cases they had and what was the highest value return equation for them. But a consistent feedback I've gotten is, all right, got it, thank you, now I can focus what I want to focus on, which was value and number of use cases, and making sure that I'm driving the change I want across the company.So, as I said last call, we are extremely focused on making sure that from an awareness perspective, a tooling perspective, so customers and reps know how to evaluate the pricing and make the best decision, and our customer satisfaction perspective, that we are extending this to every customer out there. -- That's great. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. I know there's always been a debate with you guys on the land versus expand. I know we want both and there's obviously a large expansion opportunity in the base. But with the new -- with the new pricing, Doug, I'm wondering, if as we move forward, say, the next couple of years, would we expect new customer adds to perhaps accelerate from kind of the 400 customers to 500 customers you guys have historically been adding per quarter? -- I am still deeply expectant on that movement. When I look at what have we done over the past three years since we laid a bunch of metrics on what do we -- how we're going to try and convert the overall Company, we really impressively over-achieved on what we thought was a relatively decent lean forward, we predicted $2 billion in revenue, we just closed $2.359 billion. We exceeded to upper end of our op margin target. We gave a 12% to 14% range, we are at 14.2%. We said we'd move renewable from less than 50% to 75%, we just ended at 95% for the year, 99% for the quarter.We said deals over $1 million would hit 300, we just delivered 494 for this year. The overall cloud percentage of software bookings, we thought we are being super aggressive at 26%, we just finished at 35%. Cloud revenue predicted $250 million, we just ended at $312 million in cloud revenue. So the -- what all that tells me is there has been so much momentum within the customers that understand the value, that no matter what we do to try to entice people look at net news, that has with one metric of all the metrics we gave this kind of stuck.And I think our cloud offerings, they have to help, because it's much easier to get up and going in cloud. But we just need the reps and the partners to find ways to pay attention to new customers. And as long as current customers are expanding at the rate they are now, I know there's going to be a constant tension push for us to achieve. -- Well done. A lot to be excited about. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Matt.Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter and outlook. Two questions. First one for Jason. On last quarter's deck, you gave an operating cash flow chart that showed the trajectory from '20 to '23. In fiscal '21, you essentially guided to a negative operating cash flow, effectively in line, maybe a little bit lower than fiscal '20. Has that changed at all? Or maybe just directionally give us a sense? And then one quick one for Doug after that. -- Thanks, Phil. So first on cash, what we said last time and I'll stick with it, was or I'll reaffirm it, and that is that Q or that last year FY '21's cash should look the same and -- as FY '20. So we were minus $288 million, so that's a good forecast for this year. That snapback starts to occur in the middle of '22, so we'll flip to positive then. And then we will be approaching $1 billion in '23. So no change to the cash guidance. -- Great. So no change in the past. Right. And then, Doug, a question on the data stream processor. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in [Indecipherable] and as well as just our follow-up conversations with customers. Wonder if you could give us your perspective now that the DSP has been out there for a bit, what you're hearing from customers? -- Yeah. I think a lot like our -- the observability suite, really positive indicators with a quarter an a month of observed buying patterns. It was included a number of deals in Q4. The big -- the biggest transaction in the Company history that we talked about, including in the customer, that I can stay with assurance that would not have happened without DSP.This customer processes more transactions per second than I think just about any customer in the world. And DSP was key to be able to have a high fidelity transport and metric extraction across the millions of metrics per second that they drive. So, I think we made the right investment. Streaming is, I think, a very important and critical complement to data at rest [Phonetic]. And that's -- it's absolutely something we will track over the course of the year.I think the real traction will be what we just saw with this big deal, which is attaching DSP to specific use cases and app-dev is a key one because the volume of data that is happening across that next-generation environment that we see the same thing with AI ops and the IT ops landscape and certainly trying to get real-time bead on events and incidents in the current system's security is an important component to that as well. -- Awesome. Thanks guys. -- Thanks Phil. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Let me echo Kash's excitement about the numbers. Quick question on the cloud transition that we see this year, that's a huge change and a huge momentum. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in term, in terms of the salespeople pushing it? But I'm also surprised to see that kind of much of a shift, because you still have data gravity as well on the locking side. And so can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? That's pretty amazing. -- Yeah. It was -- why we were reluctant to give guidance for FY '21 was, you really need -- we need to see a full-year pattern with FY '20, even have the beginnings of a model for FY '21. And the one thing that Jason and I will stand behind is we're probably wrong with the FY '21 model, because it's really hard to predict. But it did -- it was the largest spike that we've ever seen in Q4. And the interesting -- even further interesting thing that surprised me is we had a little bit of a decelerant on cloud this past year in the sales force.The value of a cloud contract tends to be higher than term, because we are providing a service and consuming infrastructure. And despite the fact that there was a difference in commission credit between cloud and term, we saw a push through at the highest rate we've ever seen in Q4. And the Q1 forecast, on a deal-by-deal basis, has it -- had an equivalent level to Q4. So that just tells me that, one, the health and quality of that offering has continued to progress and we've done a lot of really interesting things that are I think unique in the industry from this program that we call Audubon where you actually get to preview exactly what your production estimates looks like as part of the PoC and when you buy you just instantaneous flip on to some of the interesting pricing and option characteristics that we're providing on rich features within cloud.But I think the underlying piece is, customers want to go to cloud. They see a really rapid return to value. Despite that, that means that 65% is on-prem and I've said for 5.5 years, 6 years that I can't foresee us ever being 100% cloud. There are workloads and use cases where a public cloud is probably not going to be the right thing at least the next five years to 10 years. So if we -- our target now is we think we'll get to 60-plus-percent cloud by FY '23, which is driving some of that immediate impacts on revenue, but some of the benefits, as we begin to lap in FY '22, FY '23. But I don't think there will -- that that number will get to 95% to 99%. -- Okay. Perfect. And then one follow-up for, Jason. If I look at the operating margin situation for FY '21, it's like what's the -- obviously, we had a change in revenue and that's kind of obviously impact. But in terms of your investment focus and cadence like, was there any change or is this just what we see in terms of operating margin guidance just a reflection of the revenue situation? -- It's a reflection of revenue. Revenues coming down because of the cloud shift. The reason why we guided to a target of 20% by FY '23 is if you're kind of going to layer in the 200-or-so basis points improvement that we've been targeting, you get to 20%. So, it's purely kind of a GAAP effect of the cloud transition. -- GAAP income statement effect. -- Yeah. Yeah. -- Okay. Perfect. Congrats. -- Thanks Raimo.Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Doug, now that you tease us with the largest deal ever, I think everyone wants to hear if you could help just quantify maybe not the exact size, but help us ballpark it. And for Jason, there is a lot of questions around how the existing installed base will migrate, and also the pricing change and how you factored that into the guidance for this upcoming year? Thank you. -- Thanks, Brent. So my hidden internal goal has been -- we've obviously been excited to share a seven-figure deals. We had now have been sharing eight-figure deals with you guys, which have gone from one -- it's the $10 million plus in '17 to $35 million in FY '20, which was a nice move. My internal guide post, I want to see a nine-figure deal. And this biggest deal ever was getting us close. It was trying to tune up to be a nine-figure deal. So very proud of that. And it's not so much the required number, it's the implication of what that means as far as the importance to the business. And for organizations that are fully digital and their entire business is online, then having a unified architecture that allows you to manage everything from security to your data centers to your app-dev portfolio, and then ideally the line of business requirements as well. I mean that when you're a billions and billions of dollar online company, a 50[Phonetic] $100 million, $150 million contract feels like that is reasonable ask. -- And in terms of the other -- the second question on the kind of the assumptions on the perp installed base transition as well as pricing impacts that we baked into the ARR guidance, I would say, as I said in one of the earlier questions, the perp installed base that's a -- it's a relatively small percentage that have moved thus far. We've been -- we've had that motion for about three years, so it's something that moves relatively slowly. There is of course folks who are expanding as they're adding new contracts or expanding on top of a perp contract. And so that's why I think the better metric to look at going forward is probably going to be an expansion rate. So I'll be providing that, let's say, within this quarter.And then in terms of the pricing impact, we actually sort of tested that back last summer. And so we've been able to kind of see how that impacted, I think, the field's ability to actually kind of digest that and then help the customers understand it, and then see exactly kind of some of the elasticity impacts, all -- that's something that we've actually been kind of watching closely for a while. So, we kind of baked in what the experience we've seen thus far has been and feel pretty confident about the forecast that we provided. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Brent.Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. I think that the risk of beating a dead horse, kind of some more clarification with Brad and Brent's question. Can you just tell us for the 50%-plus growth in ARR this quarter and the 45% next quarter, how much of that is from migration so we really know what is the sustainable rate in ARR? -- And by migration, you mean customers are moving from perp to either term or cloud? -- Correct. And both the [Indecipherable] inorganic impact of that and then the expansion impact at there. I think that's increasing ASPs. -- So why we provide that 5% number, if we look at all perpetual licenses. 5% transition turned in their perp license and turned in for a term or cloud license. We're still at 5% as it's below the 1 percentage point metric between Q3 and Q4. Going back to where -- we are not incentivizing, there's no benefit for sales reps to do it. There is no benefit for a customer to do it. So when a customer -- those 5% that moved, looked at the offering and say, I want a single contracting vehicle. I get where you're trying to go, give me all cloud, I'll give you my perp license and get back.And so it's a very customer-driven decision. For our Q1 and for FY '21, we've factored zero perp customers trading in their licenses for term or cloud. They're all organic purchases of term or cloud. And some of those have come and will come from existing perp customers, but there is no program to have them -- to pay for them to get there. -- Okay. So zero perp is in the guide, in other words, just to be clear, there is de minimis or zero impact from migration from perp into your ARR forecasts? -- Yes. -- Okay. And just one clarification on RPO bookings. We know what signal effects was last quarter. What was the inorganic contribution from it this quarter? -- We -- so last quarter we disclosed it, because it was the first quarter and we actually absorbed it partially through the quarter. At this point, we've integrated the offering, so we're not breaking it out. -- Okay. All right. Thanks Jason. Thanks Doug. -- Thanks Michael.Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani from UBS. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I have one for you, Doug, and one for you, Jason. Doug, just coming off the heels of your sales kick off and how you're sort of putting pedal to the metal on the cloud software transition, I'm wondering if you can talk to us about what sales incentive changes and the magnitude thereof you're planning to roll out within the sales organization in both two partners as well?And how the new pricing structures, which I imagine, have now officially rolled into the price books in the partner channels? How the sales force is responding to that? And I'll follow-up with Jason. -- Great questions. So the excitement at SKO was palpable. The -- with -- I guess, you're going to have half years, especially if you're the CEO of the company, but I have -- most people that ever have had come up to me expressing both clarity of vision and then ultimately excited about the comp plan and how we simplify the business.I think the core of the excitement comes from, we've finally been able to move to an ACV compensation structure. TCV is so tricky because you're trying to guess are you going to a perp license or a term or cloud. You could do a one year, two year or three year, and it's a very inexact science and it is frustrating for everybody and from the sales reps all the way up to me.And ACV is simple and clear. And so it's a straight line of sight for them for the year. Last year, we had a decelerant on cloud that gets full commission credit for cloud deals because the size of cloud tends to be larger than term where we're trying to neutralize term and cloud. This year we took that decelerant up, so it's a 100% credit, whether it's term or cloud, which I think will have them leaning into cloud, because the size of the deals tend to be larger.And when I also look at the infrastructure-based pricing, the Splunk virtual core within a cloud environment, I think that is a really advantageous architecture to cloud discussions. It makes more native sense to the buyer than a data volume based metrics since they're already used AWS Azure or TCP infrastructure usage charges.So, I think when you're talking about a cloud deal, the SVC is a very tight fit for them, although we've seen cloud customers choose predictive data volume pricing over SVC depending on the use case. And all of that is just [Speech Overlap] to the partners as well. -- Fair enough. And then just using that as a jumping-off point, Jason, for you, appreciate that the operating margin compression on a year-over-year basis is just a mechanical output of the revenue moving lower. But as we think about this transition to cloud and cloud software bookings mix shift, how should we think about the trajectory on the gross margin front if you can help us with that? Thank you. -- Good question. So what we said last quarter was that the gross margin in cloud, which is where the compression will come, obviously the on-prem business has been in the kind of 90-plus-percent gross margin range and don't expect that to change. The cloud gross margin obviously has come up substantially from being in the 30s last year.Last quarter, we gave the milestone update that it had achieved 50%. We are -- I think we said we were going to get to 65% to 70% over the next few years. Our expectations, we would expect to see cloud get into the 60% gross margin range by the end of this year and then probably be approaching the 70% range by the end of next year.So then the question is on the overall gross margin, what's your mix assumption. So, you can kind of flow through. And if you assume 60%, you can take 60% of that 70% gross margin or somewhere around there. And then the rest at the 90-ish-percent gross margin and get to a number of that. I think you can see where it comes. So it's still going to be -- to be able to hit that 20% gross margin, then, obviously, we have to see some further kind of efficiency gain across go-to-market, R&D and G&A, and we do expect that to happen as well. -- That's super helpful. Thank you so much. -- Thanks Fatima.Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thank you. I also had two. On the total RPO bookings, Jason, could you talk about how the migration the cloud over the next 12 months is going to impact the growth rate? I heard Doug say the deals tend to be larger than, say, the term deals. And I'm just trying to understand really how does the growth rate of the ARR, which I know you're pointing us to. But just trying to see if there is any call-outs to how you'd want us to think about the RPO bookings -- the total RPO bookings over the next 12 months? And then I've a follow-up. -- It's a good question. I mean RPO bookings, honestly, is a little harder to forecast because duration plays such an important piece of that. And as we are -- we've now got our sales team completely aligned on the kind of more of the ACV versus TCV model, so focused on really making sure we're driving the right ARR growth that -- again, we're confident in our forecast. And so because of that duration is going to move around. And so -- and then of course timing, as I said, is already volatile.So as a result, I would expect that you will see the numbers probably -- they probably will not look unlike last year, where you might see some volatility across quarters and then overall growth rate. I have to decide if we're going to start duration adjusting things. It makes it more complicated, but if there's going be a lot of focus on it, you kind of need to look at it that way. So, that's something that I will probably talk about at Analyst Day. -- And the duration of cloud is shorter than term, right? So it will... -- Well, so today, and I think we'll determine the view -- we'll see if we can create a little more clarity. The one thing I would just make absolutely certain of is, the reason we gave the ARR CAGR kind of guidance for the next three years is because that's effectively what's going to translate to whatever the duration is. And so whatever you see in RPO bookings ultimately what we're going to deliver is what's an ARR.And so the reason I wanted to -- the reason I wanted to give that ARR guidance is to make sure that regardless of whatever volatility you see in RPO bookings, you're focused on comparing that to ARR, because ARR is the one that's more durable, more stable and what actually relates to what we're delivering.And regardless of the timing of when multi-year duration deals hit or -- all of that complexity, it really -- it can create volatility that honestly does not translate to -- ultimately to revenue and ARR. And so that's why you're going to hear us continue to push on focusing toward ARR. Once we're all ratable, this won't be -- it will be less complicated, but we're obviously in a period of transition. -- Well, let me ask my second question before Ken cuts me off rudely. You talked about -- you gave a '21 margin and you talked about a snapback in '22. I just wondered if you wanted to sign any -- business operating margin, I'm referring to. Just give any kind of dimensions on how you're thinking about that word snapback against your longer-term targets. -- It totally relates to -- it completely relates to the speed of the cloud transition. So if this year goes incredibly well, we'll have an even higher cloud mix than our current plan, which would be outstanding and fantastic for the business, it will make the GAAP metrics more confusing and then snapback shorter. So I -- the reason I'm focused on '23 is, I don't know how -- it's just hard to say how fast it's going to go, because we're not going to tell our customers what they should consume, they're going to tell us.And so as a result, we're very confident about where we're going to be in '23. But where we're at on the halfway point at the -- in '22 is a little harder to see. So that's why we gave the guidance for what we did. -- All right. Fair enough. I will see the floor. Thank you. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Yes. Thank you, Doug. Following up on -- an earlier question. You had said that you recently closed your largest order in company history. So just wanted to clarify. I'm presuming that that was in fiscal Q4, but is there any chance that that are part of that was in Q1? And then I think you were -- you sized it up in terms of TCV? Can you help us at all to try to roughly understand the ARR size of that and then I'll have a follow-up? -- Yes. So the transaction itself closed in Q4, in January, which again looking at the volatility this environment and it was a nice testament that despite already some craziness and overall global markets that this customer is willing to lean in at the size of the transaction they did. It's -- it being a very, very large TCV deal, you can imagine that may be an eight-figure ARR deal, annual deal, but we are not going to -- we won't disclose the dynamics of that specific deal, other than -- then the purpose why I brought up was, it was a portfolio by and it reemphasizes that the three years focus we've had on trying to bring DSP to market and DFS to market and doing the SignalFx mission acquisitions, not in Phantom of the security fold and that that drove the outcomes that we are looking for, which is enterprise grade features from security to IT ops and infrastructure management to app dev and DevOps. -- Okay, understood. As a follow-up on the topic of the coronavirus what actions are you taking with respect to your own employees to try to safeguard them, just for example, are you pulling out of conferences, are you restricting travel and if you are doing the latter. Is there any reason to think that some of the on-site implementation work could be impacted at some point, if the problem continues to grow? -- Yes. It's like again assuming many other companies, our employee and customer health is our number one priority. And so, we have issued guidance internally to our employees or managers that we value health and safety, number one, that please restrict business at any travel to business critical travel. If someone is feeling uncomfortable, there -- they get to choose even if it's business critical, we'll find -- we'll honor the employee and/or the customer and make sure that we are keeping health and safety top of mind. For non-critical internal meetings, we have begun to move some of those to be virtual. For external conferences so far we have not deemed that we need to retract. And again we're. I guess we're probably lucky enough on our SKO timing that it happened before some of the latest walls within the United States, where we've got to really good Safety and Security Group and their issuing updates multiple times per day. We're staying as on top of this as any other medium to larger sized company can be.In Asia Pacific, we've rotated a lot more of our professional services work to virtual work, wherever we possibly can, wherever it makes sense to the customers. There is a possibility there and other locations around the world that if everything move virtual, we all know there are some things rack and stack of hardware that customers usually do but that might gate our ability to deploy Splunk. And again we've got daily calls with our head of customer success and it's something that we're going to keep as on top of as we possibly can, given how dynamic the environment is. -- Thank you very much. Appreciate that. -- Thanks, Mark.Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi, gentlemen. Thanks. One financial question and one quick product question. On the financials, the ARR metric is key and that's really helping us understand the business. We do keep getting surprised with some of the other metrics, and I'm just wondering, so that we can calibrate going forward. Can you share with us or give us some understanding of what you're planning for the cloud mix this year? Should it be like a linear progression toward that 60% and what's the impact on revenue. I don't know per point of mix shift or how do we think about modeling that? -- So we're going to have our Analyst Day I think in 20 days. So we're going to -- we'll probably shed a little more light on exactly what -- how to kind of think about those things. I mean, I'll just say high level, we went from 26%, 27% in '19 to 35% this year. I expect it to be certainly into the 40% plus range next year. And so in terms of how linear that's going to be, I'd say stay tuned, because it is again it's customers that are choosing and so it's hard to -- it's a little hard to predict. And that's why the ARR metric is really the one that's most important to focus on. -- Got it. Okay. Thanks, Jason. And Doug for you. On the cloud adoption, can you, maybe just give us a little color on what kinds of use cases, how much of the data is being forwarded from prem and it's being used as the deployment option versus de novo cloud apps and kind of how does the mix due between IT ops, apps security, does it kind of mirror your premise mix. So, just some understanding of what it's being used for? -- Yes. A few three years ago, I would say that security was definitely a smaller component and IT and other use cases were larger. The big shift that I've seen in the past 24 months is the comfort, even with some relatively conservative, excuse me, regulated industries and companies with moving to cloud. And with that, the growth -- we've seen a growth in security data going into cloud and then the deployment of enterprise security and Phantom to complement that. What I would say three years ago, probably the higher majority of the data was cloud-based data, but again as people become more comfortable with cloud and they're moving more workloads and it's cost of hybrid environment, we're seeing it depends on the use case but a healthy mix of on-prem data into cloud as well as cloud data being gathered either within the cloud, if you're very center in AWS or having your sales force in Okta and Workday data go into to come and go with the other data. -- Got it. Great. Thanks very much guys. -- Thanks, Steve. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our last question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for fitting me and maybe two for Doug on this cloud mix. Doug, as you see a larger mix of Splunk deployed on cloud. One would assume that your competitive set might change such that you might start seeing customers evaluate Cloud Native alternatives such as Microsoft, Azure sense and all. I'm just wondering if in fact you're seeing that and as a result, how does your pitch in the field change? And then I'll ask my second one of all the Splunk on cloud, Doug, can you comment is the bulk of it occurring on AWS or are you starting to see some Splunk on Azure or Splunk on some other clouds? Thank you. -- Absolutely. So maybe I'll take your last one first. Just as context and will go back into what does our cloud growth mean overall. So, our SaaS offering, our cloud offering, which is now 35% of revenue that is -- that as wholly on AWS. We have architected that solution. So we could begin to spread to other clouds besides AWS, but I would foresee AWS being our Tier 1 strategic vendor for as long as I can see out, given the relationship we have between the two organizations. But as we all know customers have a growing bias on whether that offering is housed in AWS or in Azure and GCP, and we want to be able to play across all the clouds.From a -- how does that change the dynamics? Even when companies are going hard at cloud, but I've certainly seen for the Global 5000 is 90% of them have a multi-cloud strategy. I think so many of us have been on this road before. I'm trying to be an IBM only shop or HP only shop or Microsoft only or Cisco and that doesn't tend to work out super well for the IT department and for the company overall. So I think this time, especially given the even more complete control and value that the cloud providers are delivering and people are really, really tuned to I better find a way to make sure them spreading the workloads around across the clouds and I'd better be smart about where I'm storing my data, because egress costs can be ridiculous, which I think is a good value for Splunk. If you store within Splunk and we've got some interesting stuff that we have on the roadmap, we're going to help you ensure that the data is yours, that it's masked from anybody. I mean that that data will be portable for you.When I look at higher order offers. If I go above the data as a service landscape to something like Sentinel. Last year at RSA, there is a lot of discussion about, hey what's going on with Microsoft and Google and others as far as security offerings? I think after a year of evaluation, we've heard over and over at this year's RSA was very little discussion about Microsoft or anybody else on the security front, almost no discussion about open source. I think the maturity are, obviously this was last week, so we've already got some of the effects of coronavirus and people being concerned about the volatility of the economy and last week told me as people are kind of circling the wagons and making sure that they have vendors they can trust that the value is super clear on what they're actually working with. And if this goes with any patterns we've seen in past economic disturbances, the companies are very, very customer-centric and have a track record of value and delivery point of doing pretty well and that my view is in a heterogeneous cloud world, you better have vendor that's going to be able to spend all those clouds and non-clouds and ideally provides you an insulates you from the lock in that customers are afraid of. And I think we've got a very strong value prop there. -- Got it. Okay. Thank you. -- Thanks, Karl. -- Thank you, Karl.Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Tinsley, Corporate Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. -- Great. Thanks. We appreciate your help today, and thanks everybody for joining us.

Since then, I have not found another business not already in the Foolish universe worthy of such an assertion. Until now!For only the second time since that discussion in 2017, I've come across a stock -- this time,\u00a0 -- that is one of the very best businesses not appearing as an active recommendation in a Motley Fool service.Why do I have such a high opinion of the company?To help explain, I pulled together a list of important questions I think investors should be asking about the company, and then went about answering them for readers on ! In a way, I'm having a conversation with myself about CDW. Here's what I had to say.CDW specializes in B2B computer equipment sales. Image source: Getty Images.CDW was founded in 1984, and its stock went public the first time in 1993. It currently generates about $18 billion in revenue, has about 10,000 employees, and has a market valuation of about $18 billion as well. CDW originally stood for Computer Discount Warehouse, but today the official name is CDW Corporation. In the early 2000s, CDW mainly sold desktops, laptops, and printers.Today, it still sells the latest computer and device hardware, but also sells products for data centers, networks, cybersecurity, mobility, virtualization, collaboration, automation, the public/private/hybrid cloud, and software as a service. CDW's cloud practice is large and growing. It offers services from over 70 public cloud vendors, and CDW generates about $3 billion in cloud revenue. When breaking down its sales, roughly 80% are from hardware and 20% from software and services.CDW is a value-added reseller of a variety of technology products and a provider of business-to-business information technology solutions. Those products and services come from a wide range of companies, including\u00a0, , , , , , and\u00a0. It also serves as a sales and solutions provider for companies like , , , , , , and .Image source: CDW Corp.Investing in CDW is a way to benefit from the growth of many of the most innovative companies in the world without paying elevated multiples of 10 or 20 times sales -- and sometimes higher. (I'm OK paying those multiples for small bets, but this is just another way to get exposure.)CDW's success is not tied to any one technology product or tailwind. Instead, it offers a range of products and services from some of The Motley Fool's favorite companies. And unlike some of those early stage, rapid-growth companies, CDW is a highly profitable growing business. Also, unlike many tech darlings, CDW is not subject to disruption risk. Rather, CDW is technology agnostic, and technological disruption and innovation drive its business!Information technology (IT) is getting more complex and more integral to businesses across industries as they adapt to the digital revolution, so I'm confident that CDW's service offering will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future. If you want to invest in the latest and greatest technologies but feel like they are outside your circle of competence and you are afraid of disruption risk -- but you still want exposure to technology -- then CDW may be right for you!\u00a0Image source: CDW Corp.CDW operates in a large and growing market. It currently has a 5% share of a $360 billion total addressable market and is consistently growing its share. In the span of 2009-2019, CDW grew sales at 1.8 times the market rate (or by 4.4% compounded annually).CDW's above-market growth is driven by three things:And here's where it gets exciting: Even though it only has 5% share, CDW is by far the largest player in this highly fragmented market with tens of thousands of smaller competitors, so there is a very long runway of attractive top-line growth from market share gains and occasional acquisitions. All in all, a pretty awesome elevator pitch, eh?Image source: CDW Corp.I've long been aware of CDW because I report on (and own stock in) two other leading digital IT service providers,\u00a0  and . If you know me, then you know that Accenture and EPAM are two of my very highest-conviction investments. I was aware that CDW had a different business model, but that it was still a high-quality growing business. I followed the company from a 30,000-foot view but never got closer because I tend to prefer businesses with net cash and high free cash flow (FCF) margins, among other things (more on that later).But then I read an excellent investment thesis on CDW by David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners, in his third-quarter 2019 letter to investors. Ever since, I've been analyzing CDW (equity research takes time, Fools), and I really like what I've learned! My investment thesis is very similar to Rolfe's because my research has led me to agree with everything he said.CDW has shifted from selling discrete technology products to selling integrated technology solutions to include technology road-map planning (advisory),\u00a0design, installation, ongoing maintenance and support, and then eventual renewal. In other words, CDW provides support across the entire IT life cycle, and by doing so it creates long-term, sticky customer relationships. To support this business model shift, CDW has increased its hiring of technology engineers and specialists to provide these higher-margin services.The business model shift, while ongoing, has been a huge success and has helped cement CDW as a leading IT solutions brand. In 2019, it was ranked the fifth-best solutions provider out of 500 by  (CRN).CDW was acquired by a private equity firm in 2007 and had a second  in June 2013. The company's fundamentals have improved dramatically since year-end 2012 (the year before it went public). Today, the company has lower debt ratios, higher interest-coverage ratios, and higher returns on invested capital (ROIC). The company's high-single-digit top-line growth (more on its growth below) is almost all organic since CDW has only made three acquisitions in the last 10 years. Its former chief legal counsel, Christine Leahy, became CEO on Jan. 1, 2019. Since then, she's made two of those three acquisitions, so it's possible that she will prioritize acquisitions more than her predecessor. But that remains to be seen.CDW acts as a middleman between technology vendors and customers. It does not manufacture products, so it spends very little on capital expenditures and nothing on research and development. A significant portion of its advertising expense is reimbursed by vendors through cooperative programs, so CDW only spends an average of about 1.2% of sales on advertising. Its two biggest areas of investment are working capital and people. Of its 10,000 employees, two-thirds are customer-facing.It sells over 100,000 products from more than 1,000 vendor partners to over 250,000 regular customers. Vendor partners include OEMs, software publishers, cloud providers, and others. CDW adds between 50 and 75 new partners each year to ensure its product/service offerings remain relevant and innovative, to maintain long-term growth, and to future-proof the business. In addition to procuring products directly from its vendor partners, it also buys from third-party wholesale distributors. It primarily sells to customers with fewer than 5,000 employees.Vendors want access to CDW's 250,000 customers (especially the smaller ones where the OEMs don't have a long-term relationship) as well as its sales force and distribution footprint, installation, service, and support staff. This is why CDW is typically the first- or second-largest channel partner for OEMs in North America (and often in the world).Customers want the large product selection and availability, and the ease of buying hardware, software, and services from one reliable IT provider. They also appreciate that CDW is technology agnostic so they know it's providing them with unbiased advice. This is why the average customer has been working with CDW for 11 years.It has diverse revenue streams selling its products to corporations, governments, and education and healthcare organizations. CDW primarily serves customers headquartered in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, with roughly 88% of 2019 revenue generated in the U.S. But those customers have locations all over the world, so CDW is indirectly serving 150 countries across the globe.Traditional competitors include  ,  , and  . Relative to its peer group, CDW is multiples larger, growing faster, more profitable, and more attractively priced based on dividend yield and free cash flow yield.Data is current as of Feb. 19. Sales, net income, free cash flow (FCF), return on invested capital (ROIC), and FCF yield are all trailing 12-month totals. Sources: S&P Global and New Constructs.CDW is starting to offer more consulting services, so it does compete with Accenture and EPAM from time to time. But the big difference is that CDW is a value-added reseller that carries inventory on its balance sheet and has distribution centers to house that inventory and speed fulfillment. The other difference is that CDW mainly works with small and medium-size businesses so, for example, it would likely not be hired to do an enterprise resource planning implementation at a Fortune 500 company.While we're on the topic, CDW does hold inventory, but it also has drop-shipment arrangements with vendors and distributors so that it doesn't have to hold that portion of inventory at its warehouses. Roughly 50% of CDW's sales come from these drop-shipment arrangements.CDW was previously owned by private equity firms (through a leveraged buyout) so it has significantly more debt than I am typically comfortable with. By the company's own account, it has substantial indebtedness.\" It has $3.2 billion in net debt and $951 million in trailing FCF, according to the website\u00a0, so its net debt to FCF is about 3.4 times.I typically don't want to see the net debt/FCF ratio higher than 2, meaning that the company could pay off all its net debt with two years' worth of FCF. In CDW's case, it would take almost four years of FCF to pay off all its net debt. But since CDW's 2013 IPO, it has reduced its leverage ratios significantly, and according to , CDW has improved its interest coverage ratio (EBIT/interest expense) from 2 times in 2013 to 7 times at the end of 2019. The average maturity on its debt is over six years, and its weighted average cost of debt is only 4.3%.I'm also comfortable with CDW's financial leverage because it does not also have a fixed-cost business model with a lot of operating leverage. (It's when companies have both debt leverage and operating leverage that they are more likely to get into trouble.) Instead, CDW has a variable cost structure. That means if sales slow, the company can immediately respond by reducing compensation expense and working capital (working capital is the company's biggest capital investment, and if business slows it can easily cut investments in inventory). This ensures that there is enough operating income or cash flow to service the debt. Importantly, CDW is capable of generating even more cash flow than normal during a recession because it could dramatically reduce working capital.CDW has a target net-debt-to- ratio of 2.5 to 3. It's currently slightly below its target. I think the debt is used to support its capital allocation plan (see below) and to boost return on equity (ROE) to fantastically high levels. According to S&P Global, CDW's five-year average ROE is 55%, and its trailing ROE is 76%.Image source: CDW Corp.CDW is operating with lots of business momentum because of solid execution, its business model shift, and the digital revolution. From 2014-2019, this was CDW's five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in various metrics:FCF grew slower than net income during this time period because in 2014, the starting year for these calculations, FCF was so much higher than net income. Regardless, FCF still grew at almost double the rate of revenue.In 2019, CDW's sales grew 11%, GAAP-diluted EPS increased by 19%, and adjusted diluted EPS increased by 18%. Of the 11% top-line growth in 2019, roughly 1% came from acquisitions and a little less than 1% came from the devices-as-a-service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau. CDW is leasing smartphones and tablets to enable 500,000 field workers to take the census. This will also add about 1 percentage of incremental revenue growth in 2020, but the census project will end this year (so this is a significant but nonrecurring revenue stream).At the same time that CDW is generating stable and strong organic revenue growth, its ROIC is consistently rising. The combination of strong or rising organic revenue growth with strong or rising ROIC is investors' nirvana because it indicates that CDW is creating lots of business value.It's a growing business with a growth mindset. In fact, the company recently created a new role of chief growth and innovation officer to address that fact.Long-term growth should come from a conversion-to-digital tailwind and continued market share gains. Additional growth could come from acquisitions and continued international expansion. CDW has a growing presence in Canada and the U.K. and recently set up legal entities in the Netherlands and India. That's the first small step to setting up larger fulfillment operations in those countries over time. This is an exciting growth story, Fools.Its revenue growth is somewhat tied to customer headcount growth, but CDW has been able to generate slight operating margin improvements as it shifts to higher-margin services and from leveraging technology and automation internally. Below the operating margin line, CDW's net income also benefited largely from deleveraging (paying down debt reduces interest expense) and from corporate tax cuts. Almost 90% of its sales are generated in the U.S., so it benefited greatly from corporate tax reform.As a reseller, CDW is a low-margin business. Its gross margins are stable in the 16.5% to 17% range, and its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) margins are less than 5%. It has a long-term goal to generate free cash flow margins of about 4%.But, according to New Constructs, it was still able to generate a trailing 12-month ROIC of 17% and a return on tangible invested capital of 53%. CDW's return on tangible capital is so much higher than its ROIC (which is also high) because lots of goodwill was added to the balance sheet during the leveraged buyout. That return-on-tangible-capital figure shows the truly awesome profitability of the underlying operating business.Impressively, its ROIC has increased for the past five consecutive years, and we can use a  to see that the increase was driven by higher NOPAT margins and higher invested capital turns. Basically, the company is becoming more efficient at managing its working capital and other assets on its balance sheet. This means CDW is , or invested capital turns, and its improving margins are boosting returns as well. In my experience, it is somewhat rare to find a business whose ROIC is getting a boost from both higher returns  higher margins, and I think this is an indicator that the company has been firing on all cylinders.Image source: New Constructs. WACC = weighted average cost of capital.Image source: New Constructs.One of the benefits of operating under private equity ownership is you get very focused on aggressively managing working capital and cash conversion very quickly because those cash flows are needed to service the large debt load. Today, CDW's balance sheet is much healthier, but it is still operating under its tougher efficiency guidelines, especially with regards to monitoring the cash in and out of the business. It's just built into this company's corporate DNA now.Image source: CDW Corp.We've talked about revenue growth and ROIC, which are important because they ultimately drive free cash flow. CDW is a low-margin business, but its FCF is pretty strong because its average capital-expenditures-to-sales ratio is only 0.5% (that's really low) and because the company is very efficient at managing working capital and its cash conversion cycle. As I said earlier, CDW's FCF grew at a 5-year CAGR of 16%. CDW generated more FCF than net income in each of the past four years (2016-2019), and it has a long-term goal to generate an annual FCF margin in the 3.75% to 4.25% range.From 2018 to 2019, CDW's capital expenditures increased a whopping 174% (from $86 million to $236 million) as it dramatically ramped up spending for the contract with the Census Bureau. But this is a one-time project that will end in 2020. This means that CDW's capex will return to its normal level of about 0.5% of sales, and that the 2019 boost in capex will turn into depreciation (which is a non-cash expense that is added back on the cash flow statement). Expect that the company's FCF will remain strong and continue to grow at least in line with its organic revenue.CDW's moats include its long-term relationships with both vendors and customers, the scale and scope of products and services offered and distribution capabilities, and unique insights gained from being a key partner to both customers and IT vendors. The company sits in the middle of the tech supply chain offering attractive value propositions to both customers and vendor partners (OEMs, software companies, and the like). CDW says that it acts as both \"an extension of its customers' IT staffs\" and \"an extension of its partners' sales and marketing resources.\"What truly makes CDW unique is its multiple sources of interlocking competitive advantages. Of those, I'm most impressed by its scale and scope relative to its peers. Its size allows it to invest heavily in its sales force and engineering teams, own three distribution centers, and make sure that it gets its fair share of inventory from vendors when there are supply shortages. This means that CDW will have the inventory that its customers require.This is similar to the competitive advantage question, but it goes a step further. I won't recommend a company that isn't truly differentiated and doesn't have differentiation that shows up through superior corporate financial performance.CDW is unique because it has multiple sources to reinforce its moat. I especially like that it is the single largest player in an attractive industry and has a scale and scope that is multiples larger than its peers. This provides the company with negotiating leverage, innovative product offerings, multiple levers of profitable growth, and an attractive workplace for top tech talent.I also think it's unique because it provides an equal amount of value to both its vendor partners and its customers and is run by a CEO who is committed to taking a stakeholder approach to drive sustainable profitable growth. This second point is of grave importance and will contribute as much (or more) to long-term business value growth than anything else.It is CDW's  and stakeholder approach to growing the business sustainably over time that provides the company with its most enduring moat, while providing investors with a CDW's capital allocation priorities are (in order):CDW paid a $0.17 per share annual dividend in 2013, and the current annual dividend is $1.52 ($0.38 quarterly). That means it has increased the dividend nearly ninefold (or 794%) since its June 2013 IPO. It most recently increased the quarterly dividend by 29%. Its goal is to maintain a payout ratio of about 25% and to grow the dividend in line with earnings. If you like dividend growth stories, this company has one!Although its first priority is to increase the dividend, CDW actually spends more on annual share repurchases than it does on dividends. It has historically reduced the diluted share count by about 3% per year. Given that CDW is currently operating below its target leverage ratio, it intends to return more than 100% of FCF to investors in 2020 (as it did in 2019).Regarding acquisitions, CDW looks for product relevance and innovation, strategic and cultural fit, international expansion, and attractive financial returns. I like that CDW is not overly aggressive with acquisitions (it's only bought three companies in the last 10 years) and that this is not a roll-up story. Its ROIC has actually improved despite the acquisitions, which is a key indicator of success.Image source: Getty Images.I'm going to say no, for now, because it doesn't increase prices annually and doesn't have recurring revenue that we'd see from companies with long-term contracts or that sell use-once-and-dispose consumables, or that sell subscription services.CDW's contracts are not long term (with customers or vendors), but only 12 months in length. Its managed-services contracts are longer (and therefore recurring), but managed services are a small part of its business. Managed services provide basic infrastructure hosting for things such as database management, break/fix support and patching, and performance and capacity monitoring and reporting.Pricing at CDW is actually set by the account managers (sellers) because they have the closest relationship with the customer. The sales force is given a price minimum and a price range, and then picks the best price based on its knowledge of the customer and the competitive environment. Sellers are compensated based on a percentage of gross profit, and this model clearly works because of CDW's (already referenced) very stable gross margin profile. More than 50% of CDW's sales are generated from account managers who have been working at CDW for at least seven years. This long-tenured sales force helps to build those long-term, sticky customer relationships.It's also important to note that a great business generates high ROIC and has opportunities to reinvest at high returns to drive organic revenue growth and strong FCF over a long time. Pricing power and recurring revenue are two paths to high ROIC and consistent growth, but not the only paths. CDW generates high and increasing ROIC and has demonstrated a long record of above-market organic revenue growth.The lack of pricing power is more than made up for by its unique business model of providing a real value proposition to both its vendor partners and its customers. It also helps that CDW has a CEO with a stakeholder approach to sustainable profitable growth.Christine Leahy has been CEO since Jan. 1, 2019, and has worked at CDW since 2002. According to S&P Global, she owns $11 million worth of its stock, which is not bad for only holding the CEO position for about 15 months. In her first letter to shareholders, Leahy stressed CDW's :We will never take for granted our reputation with our customers, co-workers, partners, shareholders and communities where we employ, live and have impact -- a reputation that has been built over 35 years through relentless commitment, dedication, hard work, philanthropic contributions and complete integrity. I assure you that every single day during my time as the leader of your Company and as your fellow stakeholder, CDW will continue to never allow for complacency regarding our business performance or anything less than the full commitment to serving our customers and enhancing the value of our shareholders' investments and the lives of our stakeholders. The means will be as important and non-negotiable as the ends. This is my commitment to you.I admire several of the company's corporate governance policies, including having a clawback\u00a0policy, a separate CEO and chairman, majority voting, no executive perquisites, diversity on the executive committee (six of 13 execs are women) and board (four of 11 board members are women), and strict stock-ownership guidelines. Board members are required to own five times their annual cash retainer in stock, and the CEO is required to own six times her annual base salary in stock.I also love that the company's executive compensation plan is partly based on both market share gains (which drive organic revenue growth) and free cash flow (which is the driver of intrinsic value growth and what we are ultimately after as investors). Would I like to see CDW add an ROIC metric to its incentive compensation plan? Yes, of course, because ! But this is a management team that clearly understands the drivers of business value and the importance of return-based metrics, so I'm agreeable with this comp plan.I also applaud that the company is transitioning to an annual election of directors starting in 2021.CDW sells a wide assortment of computer equipment to consumers and businesses. Image source: Getty Images.This is an important question, so we need to spend some quality time discussing it. One thing I really love about this management team is its . In her first annual report to investors, Leahy mentioned the phrase \"profitable growth\" at least four times.Later in that same report, it becomes clear that Leahy and her management team understand the vital link between reinvestment, proper incentive compensation, and profitable growth, when she says: \"We have built a strong sales organization and deep services and solutions capabilities over time and expect to continue to invest to enhance these capabilities, which we believe when combined with our competitive advantages of scale and a performance driven culture, will help drive sustainable, profitable growth for us today and in the future. ... Our strong, execution-oriented culture is underpinned by our compensation system.\"Then on the , an analyst asked CDW management if the company is \"underearning a little bit because of the investments?\" CFO Collin Kebo's response (which I absolutely ) was:... in your question, are we underearning? I guess, the flip of that is, are we overinvesting? And I would say, no. We feel like we have the right balance between investment back into the business that allows us to continue to create differentiation in the marketplace that enables the sustainable outperformance versus the market. So could we pull back on investment in the short term? Yes. Absolutely. Would the margin float up? Yes. But I think that 200- to 300-basis-point premium that we've consistently been able to deliver [referring to the 2% to 3% in annual market share gains], over time, you would see that get chipped away. So we think we have the right balance between investing in the business and growth in margin.Earlier on the same call, Kebo said: \"... our fourth-quarter and full-year results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business that build on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth, and return cash to shareholders.\"On the earnings call, Leahy explained why the company created the new role of chief growth and innovation officer:We're really focused on scaling sustainable growth. So this is about focus for growth. And in particular, when we think about our customers, our partners and products and the channels and platforms that we use [and] sell, and the technology and digital capabilities that underpin those, the connective tissue between them is becoming more and more important. So this role is really intended to help align and focus our efforts and investments around driving the connectivity there. When you take a step back, CDW has historically delivered meaningful profitable growth. And we've done that through continual innovation and continual investment, disciplined investment, and focus on investing where the growth is. So when I think about growth and innovation and bringing that team together, it's just another natural step in the way that we think about growth in the future.As a long-term, business-minded, quality-growth investor, this is exactly the language I love to hear from a corporate management team that I'm thinking of partnering with.Competition for tech talent these days is intense. CDW has a workplace culture that's performance-driven (I already discussed the incentive programs for sellers and executives) and highly engaged. It runs an engagement survey of employees every two years and pulse surveys in off years. CDW has a 96% participation rate in the surveys, and actions to come out of them include expanding paternity leave, improving automation, and offering ongoing career training.Leahy has a 93% CEO approval rating on Glassdoor.com, and CDW is on Glassdoor's 2020 list of Best Places to Work. CDW scores a perfect 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, is ranked in the top 100 Best Places to Work in IT, according to Computerworld, and is ranked as a \"best place to work\" for military veterans and for women.The company is also on ' 2020 list of America's Best Employers for Diversity, and CDW has several groups to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace and has a \"be Green\" environmental initiative. The company would be well served to set stricter environmental goals and to share the progress against those goals by publishing annual sustainability reports.Possible near-term risks are that CDW is unable to get enough inventory because of supply constraints brought on by the novel coronavirus outbreak or that customers cut back on spending due to uncertainty in a U.S. presidential election year. These are wild cards to be aware of.Another risk is vendor concentration. Products from  and  account for 25% of CDW's overall sales. And products from its seven largest vendors account for 60% of sales.But a potentially larger long-term risk to the stock is if we experience a broader economic downturn in which customers may temporarily cut their IT spending. CDW's diversified revenue clientele may help mitigate what could be significant cuts (for example, government or education spending may remain healthy even though corporate spending is cut). It also helps that, as the world has digitized, technology has become more integral to organizations than it was during the Great Recession.On the other hand, a recession scenario could actually present an opportunity for CDW. A neat thing about its business model is that cash flow actually has the potential to be stronger during a recession because the company would significantly reduce working capital, which is its single largest capital expense. This strong FCF would allow the company to continue to increase the dividend, buy back discounted stock, and (hopefully) make acquisitions that allow it to come out of the recession even stronger.CDW held up fairly well during the global financial crisis with sales decreases of only 1% in 2008 and 11% in 2009. Then sales quickly rebounded 23% in 2010. An awesome showing, considering it was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But earnings did not hold up so well. The company reported losses in 2008 and 2009, largely because of impairment charges to write down some of the goodwill from going private. But those were noncash charges in 2008 and 2009, so cash flow from operations was still positive.CDW is a people business and thus has a variable-cost structure. This means if sales slow, the company can immediately respond by reducing compensation expense and working capital to make sure there is enough cash flow to service the debt, increase the dividend, and invest aggressively during the downturn. Today CDW is in a much more favorable financial position than it was during the last recession. It entered the last recession leveraged at 10 times EBITDA. In fact, CDW's management says that whenever the next recession occurs, it will be ready to make acquisitions on the cheap.The market downturn in late February has brought the stock price down more than 20% from its 52-week high of $146 a share. When evaluating whether a stock is a bargain, a lot of investors focus on the , so let's start there. CDW's forward P/E is currently hovering around 17, compared with a past average of about 15 since its 2013 IPO. The stock has clearly re-rated higher because:What precise P/E does it deserve? I don't know. But I'm very confident that an appropriate P/E is closer to 18, 19, or 20 (or even higher) than it is to 15. CDW has developed into a high-quality growing business with excellent management and exposure to long-duration tailwinds.According to market research firm IDC, global IT spending is projected to grow at a roughly 4% CAGR through 2023. But U.S. IT spending (CDW's largest market) has historically grown at an average of 5% per year, and CDW's core markets are projected to grow at 5% annually over the next four years. Let's assume long-term market growth of 5% and that CDW outgrows the market (i.e., takes market share) by 2% to 3% per year which is its goal. Based on that, long-term organic revenue growth would average around 7% to 8%.CDW outgrew the market by 2.9% annually from 2006 to 2019 and by a whopping 4.4% from 2009 to 2019. And from 2009 to 2019, CDW's revenue grew at a 9.7% CAGR. To be fair, 2009 was in the depth of the financial crisis, so that calculation is starting from a low base. But from 2009 to 2010, CDW's sales rebounded 23%. If I start the CAGR calculation in 2010, its sales still grew at an annualized rate of 8.3% from 2010 to 2019.In addition to the projected 7% to 8% top-line growth, it would be fair to factor in slight margin expansion as the company shifts to selling higher-margin software, services, and solutions and continues to reduce the diluted share count by about 3% per year. That suggests that EPS and/or FCF per share could grow about 10% to 11% per year. Add in the dividend yield of 1%, and investors can expect total annualized shareholder returns of about 11% to 12%, assuming that the P/E ratio does not change (to be conservative).Here's another way to think about it. According to New Constructs, CDW trades at a 4.7% FCF yield. That by itself is relatively attractive because it is more than four times higher than the 10-year U.S. Treasury note (a proxy for the risk-free rate), which yields an all-time record low of nearly 1% as of this writing.Add CDW's almost 5% FCF yield plus an expectation that the company can grow FCF per share by about 10%, and I calculate that CDW can provide investors with an expected annualized return of roughly 15%.When you combine these two methods, you can estimate that CDW will provide investors with expected annualized returns in the 11% to 15% range. Those should be market-crushing returns, Fools.I plan to buy a starter position as soon as The Motley Fool's trading restrictions allow.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It seems even tech stocks with seemingly little exposure to the coronavirus are being swept up in the market uncertainty. Last week, Splunk stock lost 9.2% compared to the  7.6% drop.\tEven with the market volatility, Splunk is outperforming the broader market.

And the company posted negative earnings per share (EPS) of 38 cents.In its most recent earnings report, data-analytics-software maker reported revenue of $603 milion which was a 30% YoY increase. It also posted earnings of 60 cents per share. At that time, Splunk was projecting $780 million in revenue for the fourth quarter. This would be approximately 5% above the consensus estimate.In January, my InvestorPlace colleague Luke Lango made the case that . At the time Lango wrote his article, the shares were up about 10% from its price as of this writing ($150).However, Lango also predicted the stock would move higher in spite of those concerns.

Of course, I understand the basic concerns about not wanting to hold the bag. But with the convergence of paradigm-shifting technologies, there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no better time to invest in transformative names like  (NASDAQ:). Leveraging big data across a variety of applications, Splunk stock has a very viable runway.\tBut perhaps the best way to explain Splunk is to reference a classic board game: chess. For centuries, aristocrats used the game to match wits against each other. Eventually, it evolved into a sporting league, with chess masters competing for global dominance and recognition.Now, chess appeals because of its emphasis on strategy and cunning, not so much on brute-force reactions and athleticism. Thus, the game casts a wide net, which later included .Initially, digital chess players were outsmarted by their human counterparts. However, in 1997, \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NYSE:) Deep Blue defeated then-world champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match. Then, in 2006, a program called Deep Fritz bested world champ Vladimir Kramnik.Today, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no longer unusual for a machine to defeat man in his own backyard. Advanced artificial intelligence protocols can run multiple permutations in seconds. And when the variables change, AI platforms can rerun the permutations, staying well ahead of mere mortals\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 intellectual capacity.In other words, the processing of big data sparked a breakthrough in the game of chess. In a similar fashion, Splunk wishes to do the same for the  of modern business: IT operations, security, internet of things and analytics. This has resulted in massive interest toward Splunk stock, and it will likely continue.In prior generations\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 use of AI, applications were limited. Although Deep Blue laid the groundwork for what was possible, most businesses had no use for a chess-playing computer. More to the point, the game has strict rules and sequences. Comparatively, the algorithms back then were simplistic.Fast forward to today, technology firms are increasingly using AI platforms for multiple, dynamic purposes. What makes Splunk stock stand out from this crowded space, though, is that the underlying company emphasizes actionable insights. Stated differently, SPLK makes digitalization practical for its clients.One of the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s most powerful services is its business analytics division. Before the integration of big data analytics, companies could only rely on historical data to determine whether their initiatives were resonating with their customers. However, Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s platform allows clients to understand what\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s occurring in real time.For instance, if a social media campaign is running flat, SPLK clients can better determine causes, and adjust as needed. In addition, the company offers a \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cData-to-Everything Platform,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d which allows clients to understand how complex and disparate parts work together to create certain results.Here, Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s pattern recognition algorithms can parse the granularity, providing critical insights into human language. This gives managers clear signals to where inefficiencies lie, facilitating better streamlining of resources for superior outcomes.What really drives the case home for Splunk stock is that every company nowadays relies on data. Therefore, many of SPLK\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s clients aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t tech firms, but cut across multiple industries.  (NYSE:) is a Splunk client, as is airplane manufacturer  (OTCMKTS:) and automaker  (OTCMKTS:).While these companies are unrelated, they all have customers. And they respond to certain initiatives better than others. Splunk helps find what those initiatives are, ultimately boosting the bottom line.As my readers know, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve pounded the table on the 5G rollout and its positive implications for investors. Although the headline narrative focuses on wireless speeds, 5G is much more than rapid-fire uploads and downloads. Instead, this innovation creates a springboard for other technologies: We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re talking AI, IOT, self-driving vehicles and smart cities, to name but a few.Naturally, 5G will create an explosion of data. But data alone isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t what will move society forward. You must have some way to convert this data into meaningful, actionable advice. Again, this is at the heart of the investment thesis for Splunk stock.Plus, any new technology invites bad actors to exploit it \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s just human nature. But even here, Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Data-to-Everything Platform presents an effective solution. With algorithms constantly on the prowl for aberrant and therefore potentially threatening patterns, Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s clients can proactively respond to risks rather than merely reacting to them.Essentially, SPLK is a one-stop shop for all your data needs. With such simplicity and effectiveness, I predict a long upside pathway for Splunk stock.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 by getting them into the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

Matt does not directly own the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Cloud stocks are back, and with good reason.Over the past six months, the  (NASDAQ:) has rallied more than 20% to all-time highs amid signs that enterprises are re-accelerating spending on their cloud transformations. That is, a number of cloud computing service and parts providers have said that, after flat-lining for most of 2019, demand and spending in the cloud industry has come roaring back in late 2019 and early 2020 amid easing U.S.-China trade tensions and an improving economic environment.That said, this should continue for the foreseeable future.In 2020, U.S.-China trade tensions will continue to ease. Mostly because the U.S. doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to upset the applecart in an election year, while China can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t afford to do the same amid the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, interest rates across the globe remain at or near record lows, and central banks everywhere are injecting further stimulus through asset purchases. Also, at the same time, global labor markets are healthy, consumers are confident and stocks are rising.In other words, the economic environment in 2020 will be perfect for enterprises. There will be geopolitical stability, low spending costs, tons of liquidity and strong demand. Against that backdrop, enterprises will continue to re-accelerate spending on their cloud transformations.And as they do, cloud stocks will move higher.With that in mind, let\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s take a look at five cloud stocks to buy for big gains in 2020.\tFour things will push shares of big data analytics platform  (NASDAQ:) to all-time highs in 2020.First, sustained low rates will support Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s extended valuation. Splunk is a big growth company with a promising future in big data capture and analysis. However, SPLK stock also features a very rich valuation.In a high interest rate environment, that rich valuation would be a problem. But in a low interest rate environment, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not because low rates boost growth valuations by lowering the discount rate on future profits. Therefore, as long as Splunk keeps firing on all cylinders, the stock should go higher.Second, enterprise software spending trends  in 2020. This acceleration creates a favorable backdrop for Splunk to continue growing its customer base and revenues at a robust pace.Third, Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s migration from a legacy license model, to a cloud-based business model through its  will continue in 2020. As it does, the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s pricing power and margins will improve \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 providing a tailwind for both revenue and profit growth.Fourth, the commercial 5G boom in 2020 will spark exponential growth in the volume of data and data-generating devices in the world. In turn, this will spark exponential growth in enterprise demand for data analysis tools like Splunk. Making SPLK one of the top cloud stocks for potential investors to look at.\tMuch like Splunk, four catalysts will push shares of programmatic advertising platform  (NASDAQ:) to new highs in 2020.The first reason is similar to Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s top catalyst. The Trade Desk is a big growth company, with a big growth valuation. Therefore, low rates throughout 2020 will provide support for that extended valuation.Second, digital ad spending trends will accelerate in 2020; Mostly because ad spending levels are tethered to economic strength. At the same time, U.S. digital ad spending will get a boost from the 2020 presidential election.Third, digital ad real estate will expand significantly in 2020. This is because new cloud gaming and streaming TV platforms will launch and gain mainstream traction. For the most part, those platforms at least partially employ ads. Also, for the most part, those platforms are open to programmatic demand-side platforms (DSPs) like The Trade Desk. Consequently, The Trade Desk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s usage should rise in 2020 with the proliferation of new programmatic advertising opportunities.Fourth, open internet initiatives will continue to gain traction in 2020. This will come as big tech giants like  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) feel increasing pressure from regulators and consumers alike to break down their walled gardens. As that happens, The Trade Desk will have an opportunity to penetrate into those ad sales \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 which could provide a meaningful boost to the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s top-line.\tAlongside Splunk and The Trade Desk, identity access management (IAM) platform  (NASDAQ:) is another member of the cloud stocks that should rally to new highs in 2020.The reasoning is fairly simple. Enterprise software spending trends will pick up in 2020. As companies spend more here, they will especially spend more on cloud security platforms because cloud transformation and cybersecurity are two of the  for companies this year.Furthermore, there has been and will continue to be exponential growth in the  in an enterprise ecosystem, underscoring the necessity for new cloud security solutions to be IAM solutions.In other words, 2020 is shaping up to be a big year for cloud IAM adoption \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 and\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0Okta is the  in this market. In turn, as more companies turn to cloud IAM solutions in 2020, most of those companies will look to Okta.With that, Okta\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s revenues and profits will continue to march higher. As they do, OKTA stock will march higher, too, because low rates will provide support for the stock\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s extended valuation. So, maybe now is the time to add Okta to your list of cloud stocks to buy.\tA big pivot towards elevated spending on customer experience (CE) software will benefit cloud computing giant  (NASDAQ:) dramatically in 2020.We all know Adobe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bread-and-butter is in the media world. This is where the company offers a plethora of best-in-class creative and document capture and editing solutions, which are trusted by individuals and enterprises of all shapes and sizes across the globe. This business is a very good one that runs at 80%-plus gross margins, with minimal competition and stable demand drivers.However, the upside in ADBE stock in 2020 is all about the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s ability to leverage its creative media solutions expertise, and create an equally robust CE software solution \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 which the company dubs the .Overall, CE is everything these days, as consumer-facing companies are finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish themselves in a crowded landscape, and as consumers increasingly value the experience attached to a service or product. So, if a consumer-facing company wants to succeed, they need to have a strong CE. What defines a strong CE? A lot of things. But, because consumers process and retain visual information far better than they do text information, almost all good CEs have strong visuals.Who is the best in the world at making strong visuals? Adobe. Therefore, it only makes sense that as companies look to improve their CEs with strong visuals, they turn towards Adobe and their Experience Cloud to do so.That said, this trend is just beginning. In 2020, it will gain serious momentum as enterprises increase their investment into CE. Adobe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s growth rates will move higher, profits will keep roaring higher and ADBE stock will .\tThe bull thesis for  (NASDAQ:) stock in 2020 is fairly straightforward.For a long time, the ultra-valuable and massive public cloud infrastructure market has been a two horse race between  (NASDAQ:) and Microsoft \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 with the former being the clear number one, as Amazon Web Services controlled about 50% of the market in 2017.However, Microsoft has been gradually chipping away at Amazon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dominance for several years now. And, in 2019, they landed a  win over Amazon, in a move that signaled maybe it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s time for Microsoft to become the new number one player in the cloud infrastructure market.The Pentagon contract was widely watched by everyone in the industry. Therefore, everyone in the industry knows that one of the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s most trusted organizations picked Microsoft over Amazon for cloud infrastructure services. Does that make Microsoft better than Amazon? No. But, does it make Microsoft better than Amazon is the eyes of the pubic? To a lot of enterprises, yes.This public sentiment shift will enable Microsoft to win over more contracts in 2020. This, in turn, will accelerate its cloud growth narrative \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 especially against the backdrop of rising cloud spending trends.History shows that as goes Microsoft\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cloud business, so goes MSFT stock. So, as Microsoft\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cloud business roars higher in 2020, Microsoft stock should follow suit; Making it just another part of the cloud stocks to consider for the future.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long TTD, FB, and ADBE.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["  was one of 2019's most successful IPOs. Shares were priced at $27 but ended their first day of trading at over $37 per share. Today the stock is up over 20% from where it closed that first day, and up over 40% from where the IPO priced. Considering the company's third-quarter 2019 revenue grew 88% year over year, it's easy to understand why Wall Street loves this company.Investing is always a forward-looking activity. And looking five years into Datadog's future, business should still be booming.Image source: Datadog.Datadog's full-year 2019 revenue is expected to come in at $350 million to $352 million -- good for 77% to 80% growth over 2018.\u00a0This mind-blowing growth demonstrates how important its product is. Companies these days use many cloud products, from cloud computing services like 's\u00a0AWS, to communication apps like . The diversity makes enterprise technology complicated, but Datadog, calling itself \"cloud agnostic,\" integrates everything to provide a centralized real-time monitoring platform.Before it went public, Datadog operated at a smaller loss than it does right now, and was even profitable some quarters. But in the year leading up to its IPO, expenses from research and development outpaced revenue growth, as did sales and marketing expenses.\u00a0Although this spending makes the company unprofitable, we'll see why it's actually money well spent.Image source: Getty Images.Datadog, while currently unprofitable, isn't burning through an exorbitant amount of cash. Free cash flow in Q3 was negative $3.7 million, and negative $10 million through the first nine months of 2019. However, the proceeds from its IPO put Datadog in a well-capitalized position. The company has $771 million in cash on the balance sheet and no long-term debt. In short, Datadog can pursue its opportunities over the next five years.According to , sponsored by data-storage company , 175 zetabytes of data will be created in 2025.\u00a0Enterprise is expected to create 80% of that data. Not all data will be stored or tracked, but enterprise will certainly see a growing data pile needing to be addressed from a variety of angles, including what Datadog offers. So, the relevance of its service is only increasing.Further, Datadog still has many potential enterprise customers to pursue. When it went\u00a0public, only around 35% of Fortune 100 companies used Datadog, and it still has low market penetration overall.\u00a0The company estimates its current addressable market at $35 billion -- roughly 100 times Datadog's revenue. Therefore, the increased spending in sales and marketing is a solid choice.Also, Datadog is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company. When , it's crucial to examine the dollar-based net retention rate. This metric tracks existing customer spending. Datadog is constantly introducing new products, which boosts the dollar-based net retention rate as customers upgrade. When Datadog went public, the dollar-based net retention rate was 146% -- quite high. Not only does this demonstrate how much Datadog's customers love it, it also shows why the increased spending in research and development is another solid choice.While Datadog obviously has a great product and opportunity, investors should . Specifically,\u00a0  recently announced a $1 billion acquisition of SignalFX -- an application-monitoring company similar to Datadog. An impressive 90 of the Fortune 100 companies are already Splunk customers. As SignalFX integrates into Splunk, those customers could just choose to use Splunk's application monitoring rather than go with Datadog.Not winning over enough new customers, or even losing customers to the competition, would slow Datadog's revenue growth. And that would likely be devastating to Datadog's stock. It currently trades at 44 times sales -- one of the highest price-to-sales ratios out there. For comparison, Splunk trades at around 12 times sales, but its revenue is only growing 30%. The market justifies Datadog's higher valuation because of its 88% revenue growth. But if the growth rate slows significantly, Datadog's valuation would get adjusted.That said, competition goes both ways. While investors should assess the risk of Splunk and others, Datadog could likewise introduce products to steal business away from Splunk. The company introduced 15 new products and functionalities in Q3 alone. So it's possible this company will keep punching above its weight class.The stock isn't without risk, but there's reason to believe Datadog can keep growing at a very high rate. Enormous data creation will keep its product in demand. Low market penetration gives it the opportunity to keep growing. And high net-dollar revenue retention shows\u00a0current customers like it enough to expand the relationship -- suggesting more companies will like Datadog if they try it.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new March 6th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $152.50 strike price has a current bid of $6.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $152.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $146.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $156.56/share today.\n\nBecause the $152.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

The thesis? Enterprise software spending trends will pick up over the next few quarters, and as they do, most enterprise software stocks will head higher, too.For the record, I 100% agree with this thesis. Corporations hit the pause button on robust enterprise software spend in 2019 for two big reasons. One, they spent a lot on enterprise software in 2018 (spend rose nearly ), so there wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a glaring need to up spend further in 2019. Two, rising trade tensions created immense economic instability, and companies didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to spend big against that backdrop.Consequently, enterprise software spend rose just 8.8% in 2019 \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 one of its weakest annual growth rates in recent memory.But, in 2020, corporations will re-accelerate their software spend, also for two big reasons. First, they didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t grow spend as much as normal in 2019, so there is ample room to re-up spend growth in 2020. Second, trade tensions are easing, stability is being injected back into the global economic environment, interest rates globally remain low, and corporate spending conditions broadly remain as favorable as they\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve been since 2017.As such, it should be no be surprise that Gartner projects global enterprise software spend to rise , up about 2 points from 2019\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s growth rate.Against that backdrop, enterprise software stocks will rally. Here are my favorite picks in the group.\tOne enterprise software stock which Wells Fargo raised their price target on and which I think is a long-term winner is cloud giant  (NASDAQ:).In the big picture, there are a lot of things to like about Adobe. The company dominates in the creative and document cloud worlds, runs at sky high gross margins, has been growing revenues at a steady 20%-plus clip for several years, and is a cash flow and profit machine. But the upside bull thesis in ADBE stock is all about the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s new growth potential in the enterprise cloud.Specifically, everything in the enterprise world is pivoting towards a focus on the consumer experience, or CE. At the same time, CE is becoming increasingly visually-focused, because visuals do a much better job at immersing a consumer than words. Broadly, then, enterprises are putting more money into creating visually powerful CEs.When they do that, they are trusting Adobe to do it better than anyone else. Why? Because Adobe has long been behind the market\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s best-in-class media creation and editing tools, and is now leveraging its expertise in creative media to built robust media-based CEs for enterprises of all shapes and sizes.This trend is just beginning. In 2020, it will gain serious momentum as enterprises increase their investment into CE. Adobe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s growth rates will move higher. Profits will keep roaring higher. And ADBE stock will .\tWells Fargo really likes shares of\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) software giant\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:). They hiked their price target on ADSK stock to a Street-high $240. ADSK stock presently trades around $195.But, can ADSK stock \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 which is already up 140% over the past three years \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 rally another 25% over the next twelve months?I think so. Autodesk dominates the AEC software vertical with widely-used and largely unparalleled solutions such as AutoCAD (used for 2D and 3D modeling) and Revit (used for Building Information Modeling). This dominant positioning means that as AEC firms up their software spend in 2020 \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 and they will, because AEC markets were among the hardest hit by trade issues \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 most of them will up spend on Autodesk services. Autodesk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s revenue, margin, and profit trends will consequently remain healthy over the next several quarters, and that will provide support for continued gains in ADSK stock.It also helps that valuation isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t that much of a problem for Autodesk. Realistically, this company is looking at over $6 in earnings per share by fiscal 2022 (current Street estimates sit around $6). Based on a 35-times forward earnings multiple, which is average for application software stocks, that implies a fiscal 2021 price target of at least $210 (keep in mind, Autodesk is almost at the end of fiscal 2020).So is $240 achievable? I think so, mostly because as Autodesk keeps beating estimates, forward estimates will move up, and fiscal 2022 earnings per share estimates will shake out somewhere well north of $6 when all is said and done.\tWells Fargo also upped its price target on cloud giant (NASDAQ:) and reiterated its \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009coverweight\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d rating on the stock. I like this call, too, mostly because accelerating enterprise cloud momentum will support huge growth at Microsoft in 2020.Long story short,  (NASDAQ:) has long been the king of the cloud infrastructure market with Amazon Web Services. But, Microsoft\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cloud infrastructure offering, Azure, has been rapidly gaining on AWS for several years now. This culminated in late 2019, when the two services went head-to-head in a competition for a multi-billion dollar Pentagon cloud contract. Microsoft won.It was a surprise victory from a company that has historically placed second in the cloud infrastructure market. And, it marks a critical pivot wherein Microsoft\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s days as second place are coming to a close. In 2020, I expect multiple enterprises of all shapes and sizes to take note of Microsoft\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s big Pentagon cloud contract win, and choose Azure over AWS as their public cloud infrastructure provider. The more this happens, the more momentum Azure will gain.That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s great news for MSFT stock. Over the past few years, as goes the cloud sector, so goes Microsoft stock.\tPerhaps the boldest move from the Wells Fargo team in its recent software stocks update was upping its price target on big data company  (NASDAQ:) to a Street-high $200, calling for another 30%-plus upside in shares over the next twelve months.Can it happen? Yes. Mostly because the data boom is just starting.In a nutshell, Splunk helps enterprises of all shapes and sizes turn their raw machine data into valuable and actionable insights through their Data-to-Everything platform. Three big trends will promote increased adoption of this platform over the next several years.First, the volume of data globally will surge higher thanks to a proliferation of data-generating devices, like smart watches, smartphones, smart appliances, smart cars, etc. Second, the ability to generate valuable insights from that data will get better and better, thanks to things like machine learning. Third, enterprise data-driven decision making will go from luxury to necessity, as companies that don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t do it will be left behind the curve.Broadly, then, Splunk projects to go from a niche data analytics platform today, to a must-have data-driven decision making companion by 2025. This transition will power sustained long term gains in Splunk stock.Of note, in 2020, SPLK stock will be pushed higher by: 1) increased enterprise software spending trends, 2) continued migration from a legacy license model, to a cloud-based business model, and 3) a 5G boom accelerating the data growth narrative.Overall, Splunk stock looks good both for 2020 and into 2025.AS of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE.\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["When it comes to growth investing, the prospect of creating significant wealth is more than enticing.

During that stretch, Splunk stock has essentially tripled, thanks to accelerating enterprise demand for the big data capture, monitoring, and analysis tools that Splunk offers.\tThe good news? Demand for these tools will continue to accelerate higher. Splunk will sustain strong operational momentum for the next several quarters. And, the long term outlook for Splunk is very positive, with enough promise, visibility, and opportunity to realistically support Splunk stock at much higher prices in the future.The bad news? Splunk is very richly valued here. Even under aggressive long term growth assumptions, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s still tough to warrant a bearly $160 price tag. So, fundamentally speaking, Splunk is overvalued at the moment.Where does Splunk stock go from here?Probably higher, mostly because valuation friction alone won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be enough to derail the SPLK rally, especially in a world dominated by low interest rates and momentum investing strategies. In that world, sustained strong operational momentum and an increasingly bullish long term outlook will keep pushing Splunk stock higher.In the big picture, Splunk is the right business, at the right time, with a ton of visibility to sustain huge growth over the next five to ten years.At its core, Splunk is about turning data into action. Through its Data-to-Everything platform, Splunk offers various services and tools which enable enterprises to seamlessly capture, aggregate, monitor, and analyze data from various sources, with an endless number of end-applications, including security, consumer experience, product development, marketing, etc.Gradually, Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s big data tools are morphing into a \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cmust-have\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d for enterprises in today\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s increasingly data-driven world. Long story short, there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a ton of data out there and all that data contains a ton of valuable information that can improve processes across every major enterprise vertical.Extracting all that information from all that data used to be a luxury. Now, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a necessity for the enterprise, because if a company doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t do it, they will be left behind on every single front.So, over the next several years, demand for Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s big data services will broaden out to encompass almost every enterprise out there. At the same time, current customers will up their spend on Splunk, because the volume of data these customers are generating is growing exponentially with the rapid proliferation of data-collecting smart devices and apps.Net net, over the next five to ten years, Splunk will turn into a necessary big data analytics tool for enterprises, on which enterprises will spend a ton of money to extract all the information they can from all the data they have. Ultimately, these secular trends imply that Splunk will stay on a huge growth trajectory for a lot longer.The numbers are pretty easy to follow. Thanks to the aforementioned secular trends, the global big data market is expected to grow at a  over the next decade or so.According to those numbers, Splunk presently controls about 5% of the global big data market. Their market share has been gradually expanding by roughly 30 to 50 basis points every year.This expansion is expected to persist. According to consensus Wall Street estimates calling for $2.9 billion and $3.5 billion in revenue in each of the next two years, Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s big data market share should expand by about 40 basis points in each fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.This cadence of annual market share expansion should slow with scale. Consequently, my long term model assumes that the company can expand market share at a cadence of roughly 30 basis points per year into 2030. Assuming so, Splunk projects as 15%-plus revenue grower over the next decade.Gross margins should continue to improve with scale, improved priced power, and higher platform usage. Operating margins should improve doubly thanks to economies of scale and reduced marketing spend (scale sells itself).Under all these optimistic assumptions, my modeling pegs Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s 2030 earnings per share potential at about $10. Based on a 35-times forward earnings multiple \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 which is the medium-term average for application software stocks \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 that implies a 2029 price target of $350.

But, those valuation risks aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t big enough to derail the rally. That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s especially true considering the world we live in today, with rebounding enterprise software spending trends and record-low interest rates.All in all, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not chasing this rally. I think a better buying opportunity will present itself in the future.

It's not possible. Suffice it to say, we produce a lot of information, and big-data analytics -- the process of turning all of that data into a usable and actionable form -- has become big business.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.  has emerged as one of the more innovative and dynamic players in the space, helping businesses capture, store, analyze, and curate the information generated. Over the past year, it has  bullish analyst revenue estimates, but changes to its business model caused doubts about its ability to produce positive cash flow, resulting in its stock plummeting 10% in the second quarter.It rebounded sharply in November after management reiterated its belief it will be able to produce some $1 billion in operating cash flow (OCF) for fiscal 2023. But is that a realistic scenario or  that ignores some of the realities of its business?\u00a0Let's look at what's at play.There's no doubt Splunk's business is growing. Even in the second quarter, when it caused Wall Street bulls to get wobbly, revenue grew 33% to $517 million, well ahead of analyst forecasts of $488 million. It followed that up in the third quarter as revenue rose another 30% year over year to $626 million, and again ahead of projections of a $600 million gain.Splunk is forecast to grow 26% in the fourth quarter to a consensus $783 million, while management has offered conservative guidance of $780 million. It's worth noting that the data analytics specialist handily surpasses its own guidance on a routine basis.But it was Splunk's sudden reversal on OCF for fiscal 2020, which ends at the end of this month, that originally caused consternation. It had reported $296 million in OCF at the end of fiscal 2019 and had forecast $350 million this year. But in the second quarter, it surprised everyone by saying it now expected the year to end with OCF of negative $300 million, a $650 million reversal from just six months prior.Even from the first quarter's outlook, where Splunk had eased back guidance to positive OCF of $250 million, it still caught everyone by surprise that things looked bad all of a sudden. But management did have a seemingly valid explanation for the change, though it took the company three more months to reassure everyone that $1 billion in operating cash flow was still an attainable goal.As mentioned earlier, Splunk is changing its business model, or rather how it bills customers for its business. Beforehand, it offered perpetual licenses for its , having customers pay up front for the software license with the right to use it indefinitely. But now it's changing to a subscription-based model, billing customers for the license that allows the software to be used for a specific length of time.The latter is obviously a better model for Splunk because it gives it recurring revenue streams, but the changeover tends to be a bit chaotic.\u00a0When Splunk was forecasting positive OCF for fiscal 2020, it had expected the changeover to happen more slowly, and that by the end of the year, 15% of its business would still be on a perpetual-license model. In the second quarter, however, it realized the pace of conversion was occurring far more rapidly than anticipated, and it now said just 1% of its business would be perpetual.Since the average contract lasts about 33.5 months now, the transition is having a disproportionately negative impact on OCF during that time frame. Management is able to expect it to grow to $1 billion by fiscal 2023 because that is when the billing situation will have normalized.Splunk stock is not cheap on traditional metrics, trading at 65 times next year's earnings estimates and over 10 times sales. But the market also says it's worth about 23 times its $1 billion operating cash flow target, which makes it more reasonable, and it certainly seems the data analytics specialist ought to be able to hit the mark when the time comes.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What started out as little more than a buzzword among techies has grown into a massive industry, hauling in hundreds of billions of dollars a year worldwide. A quick look at the  , which tracks an index focused on the accelerating cloud computing industry, shows that cloud stocks are collectively up 200% since the fund's inception in July 2011.In spite of their fast rise, though, cloud stocks will likely continue as a prominent driver of investment returns in the next decade, serving as a key ingredient in the \"digital transformation\" of many organizations as they update operations for the 21st century. This guide will help get you started selecting the best of the many dozens of pure-play cloud companies available to invest in.Image source: Getty Images.So what is this high-in-the-sky technology term actually referring to? In simple terms, the cloud is a global network of data centers. These remote servers are used to deliver a service or complete a task for a user via the internet or other network. Functions of these data centers are diverse: They store data, run applications like email and business software, operate social networks, and deliver services like streaming TV. Generally, there are four methods by which the cloud is delivered to end users.Organizations are making use of the cloud in myriad ways, but no matter the type of data center, all of them are still on the rise after a decade of busy construction activity.The concept of services being stored remotely and available on demand is nearly as old as the concept of the internet itself, but it wasn't until the 1990s that the term \"cloud\" actually came into use in the tech world. An early pioneer of the concept was , which was founded in 1999 and was the first software application developed from scratch to run in the cloud. In 2002,  quietly launched its cloud service, dubbed Amazon Web Services, or AWS. The e-tailer hit on the concept of renting out its excess computing power to businesses and quickly became a leader in the cloud movement as a result.Since the late 2000s, a flood of cloud businesses has come online. However, the marketplace is dominated by several big players, such as Amazon's AWS, 's  Azure, 's  Cloud, and 's   Google Cloud. Across the Pacific,  and  are leading the charge in  and are also an important part of the conversation.Just like different layers of the atmosphere, there are layers to the cloud, too. Generally, cloud services are split into three tiers. Some companies offer just one tier of service, while larger companies often span two or all three.The first tier and the base for all cloud offerings is infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). IaaS provides the nuts and bolts for a business wanting to operate in the cloud. An IaaS provider offers the actual server space for storage, computing, networking, and security. Notable IaaS companies include Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and . Companies that don't operate their own cloud infrastructure host their services on another company's IaaS.Many tech companies tout their software \"platforms.\" Sometimes this is a generic term for their overall suite of software, but as it pertains to the cloud, a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) enables software developers to build, manage, and deploy applications. PaaS is built on top of an IaaS service, and many of the abovementioned IaaS providers also operate as a PaaS as well. Some software providers, like Salesforce for example, offer a PaaS in addition to SaaS (see below), as they allow developers to custom build apps using a set of tools. Another notable example of a PaaS is communications company  .Built on top of IaaS and PaaS is the end result of the cloud, the applications themselves. Companies that operate and sell software applications are known as  providers. SaaS outfits build and provide ready-to-use apps for a wide variety of both business and consumer tasks. Often the most visible part of the cloud to everyday consumers, notable SaaS apps many people run daily are Netflix and  for entertainment and Microsoft Office 365 and Salesforce on the business productivity end of the spectrum.The cloud has grown to epic proportions in relatively short order and has become a driving force behind technological advancement. According to researcher , global public cloud spending should come in around $266 billion in 2020, up from $228 billion in 2019. When considering the entire realm of cloud computing, research from Statista and  expects general global cloud spending to top $400 billion in 2020.Digital transformation -- a phrase describing the wave of businesses and organizations using data center-based computing to update their operations -- is expected to fuel double-digit growth in cloud spending for the foreseeable future. Gartner's report expects global spending to increase by 13% a year in both 2021 and 2022. Fellow researcher IDC thinks spending will more than double by 2023 and top $500 billion.Image source: Getty Images.Business analysts and economists generally think the 2010s were the first half of the cloud's development and that the 2020s will be phase two of the computing concepts' rapid global deployment.As it gets bigger, though, it is playing a role in the advance of other technologies. Edge computing, for example, is the move to push computing from the cloud to locations closer to the end user -- either at smaller localized data centers or within devices themselves. Edge computing is quickly becoming a new category for cloud providers as they try to speed up the computing and data delivery process and is on its way to being worth tens of billions of dollars a year. The cloud is also powering applications like artificial intelligence as businesses use data centers to train and then deploy AI-based systems. Over the next decade, these could be powerful investment trends to watch that the cloud is making possible behind the scenes.For those who want a comprehensive cloud portfolio, IaaS and PaaS providers are the place to start. Incidentally, even though IaaS and PaaS are already covered by some of the largest stocks around -- Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet's Google, Alibaba, even  and its PaaS for advertisers -- these building blocks for cloud-based services are expected to be the fastest-growing segments of the cloud. Gartner expects annual IaaS and PaaS spending, which came in at $40 billion and $32 billion, respectively, to nearly double by the end of 2022. As large, diversified tech giants, these companies can make up the core of an investment portfolio.Not to be forgotten, though, are the hardware companies that make cloud infrastructure and platform services possible. Hardware must exist before applications can be built. Arista Networks and NVIDIA are two of the largest companies in this space, but investors who want to broaden their search even further should look for companies categorized as \"network hardware, storage, and peripherals.\" The best bets will have business segments labeled as \"cloud\" or \"data center\" revenue, with those segments at least keeping up with the double-digit average growth forecast.Now on to the software itself. SaaS is the largest portion of the cloud pie, making up nearly half of annual spending in 2019 per Gartner. As the largest chunk, it is also, on average, the slowest-growing segment, expected to \"only\" increase 50% by 2022 and top $150 billion a year.Within this massive subset of the industry, though, are an overwhelming number of options. For every nontech company, there is a SaaS that can help (or disrupt) the industry -- from retail to finance to healthcare. Here are a few examples by sector.Image source: Getty Images.There is no shortage of cloud stocks to choose from, but choosing which ones to own is the real trick. For the well-established, large, and profitable cloud companies, traditional valuation metrics still apply. For smaller firms operating at little or negative profitability, some business and revenue growth metrics are the best indicators to consult.Many investors look at  (the stock price divided by earnings per share from the last 12 months) when selecting a stock, but that metric only tells part of the story. In the high-growth cloud computing industry, the  can be more helpful, as it accounts for elevated price-to-earnings multiples by comparing to expected growth rates.Another profitability metric to weigh is price to . Free cash flow is revenue minus cash operating expenses and capital expenditures. Unlike basic earnings, free cash flow excludes noncash items like depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation and thus provides a clearer picture of a company's true profitability profile. For example, Salesforce currently has a sky-high price-to-earnings ratio of 173.8, but price to free cash flow values it at 39.6. Using price to free cash flow makes quite the difference here and would indicate Salesforce isn't all that bad a deal for a company that has consistently been able to grow over 20% year-in and year-out.Traditional methods of  often break down when evaluating the cloud industry -- especially the fastest-growing  providers. When a company is expanding fast and sees ample opportunity ahead, profits are often foregone in lieu of reinvestment for rapid growth.Fortunately, business growth metrics provide an alternative method. Growth in total users or customers can be telling. Is customer count accelerating? Then quickly rising expenses might be an acceptable situation. Is customer count decelerating? If so, expense growth should also be falling.Another key component is the dollar-based net expansion rate, sometimes called the revenue retention rate. This metric shows investors how much money the average existing customer is spending on a cloud service. A rate of less than 100% implies the average customer is spending less than a year ago (not good), while greater than 100% implies they are spending more. If customer count is decelerating, a dollar-based net expansion rate over 100% means a cloud company can afford to add customers at a slower pace. For example, cloud communications firm Twilio reported dollar-based net expansion of 132% in Q3 2019, implying existing customer spending jumped an impressive 32% higher compared to the year prior.All of those business metrics ultimately feed into revenue, the headline figure that investors watch when it comes to the cloud. Increased revenue, however, is only good if it translates into increased profits -- or at least the promise of an eventual bottom-line payoff.Whatever your findings may be when searching for high-growth cloud companies, it's important to remember that stocks such as these tend to be very volatile -- both up and down. Therefore, diversify your holdings, keep individual positions small, and add to them periodically -- monthly, quarterly, or on the dips, perhaps whenever a stock dips by a certain percentage (like 10% from recent highs). Consistency is key, as is some patience with small companies that are in expansion mode and tend to bounce around a lot in value.Above all, remember that investing in the cloud is all about the long game, whether the companies owned are large or small. The industry has had a lot of success, and there's plenty more to come. The 2020s should provide more strong returns for the cloud, so don't get too hung up on what happens in the short term, and remember that investing results play out over years -- not days, months, and quarters.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And   produces composite-decking materials for customers looking to upgrade their outdoor spaces. All three of these stocks have more than doubled over the past three years.Fortunately for investors, all three still have plenty of room to grow and are worth buying today.Data by Planet Fitness went into 2017 with 1,313 locations, 8.9 million members, $378 million in trailing 12-month (TTM) revenue, and 40 consecutive quarters of comparable-sales growth.Since then, the company has grown tremendously and now has 1,899 locations, 14.1 million members, $625 million in TTM revenue,\u00a0and has extended its comparable-sales growth streak to 51 straight quarters. It's no wonder the stock has nearly tripled over this time span.Even approaching 2,000 locations, Planet Fitness still has plenty of growth opportunities. The company currently has around 1,000 locations in the pipeline to be opened over the next three to five years. At that point, the U.S. market may start getting pretty full. But it still has barely tapped into markets abroad, and a recent  demonstrates that it's ready to seize international markets as well.\u00a0Image source: Planet FitnessAs data is created at an incredible pace, more businesses need Splunk to help make sense of it all. At the start of 2017, Splunk had over 13,000 customers and $950 million in TTM revenue.\u00a0Over the last three years, its customer base has grown almost 50% to over 19,000 customers. And TTM revenue has more than doubled to $2.2 billion.\u00a0The company has also shifted more toward a  model with cloud-based products, which makes tracking annual recurring revenue (ARR) important. In the third quarter of 2019, Splunk reported ARR of $1.4 billion, up 53% year over year.Splunk's total addressable market (TAM) just keeps growing. Its most recent estimate placed the TAM at $62 billion -- up nearly 100% from when the company priced its IPO in 2012.\u00a0This growing market is a compelling reason to like the stock going forward. It's investing in industry trends such as enterprise cloud migration, like when it acquired SignalFX for $1 billion in August 2019. SignalFX is a cloud monitoring company, and it extends Splunk's lead in the space as the trend toward the cloud continues. Trading at over 24 times , or 11 times sales, the stock is far from cheap, but Splunk has the quality growth to support such a valuation.At the start of 2017, Trex had $480 million in TTM revenue, earning it $68 million in net income. Over the last three years, that top line figure has grown over 50% to $721 million.That's impressive enough, but this company truly shines when you look at its bottom line growth. Net income has nearly doubled over the same time span to $134 million.\u00a0The stock currently trades at 33 times forward earnings, which may seem like a rich valuation, but as the chart below shows, it's just a little higher than the five-year average.Data by Trex has a terribly efficient management team that consistently grows the bottom line faster than the top. Charts over various time frames bear this out, including the five-year chart displayed above.And there's reason to expect that trend to continue over the next few years. In the third quarter , management stated that new production lines were coming online in 2020 and that production capability will be 70% higher in 2021 than it is today.\u00a0One driver for Trex's increased demand will be commercial products. Over the past nine months, only 7% of sales came from commercial, the rest from residential.\u00a0And commercial demand has been weaker than expected in 2019.But management believes commercial customers have merely been delaying purchases, which means that it's only a matter of time for this segment to provide a revenue boost. Now, the company currently has some start-up costs with the commercial lines, but those current costs are future opportunities to continue driving earnings growth.To be clear, I've included these three stocks, because I believe they're all worth buying, but if you have to pick one, my favorite is Splunk.The big-data tide is rising so fast that I can't imagine Splunk's ship not rising with it. Consider that according to , 175 zettabytes of data are expected to be created in the year 2025 alone. If you aren't sure how big 175 zettabytes is, it's 175  terabytes.For comparison, estimates place 2018 data creation at 33 zettabytes. And over half of the data in the 2025 forecast is expected to be machine-generated data, which is Splunk's bread and butter.Past success, coupled with an exploding opportunity, is a compelling reason to make this one of your  today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Analysts would (theoretically) have settled for earnings near $0.54 per share on revenue in the vicinity of $604 million, but Splunk also set its fourth-quarter sales guidance $12 million ahead of the then-current Wall Street view. That was a welcome break from three straight in-line guidance updates.Image source: Getty Images.This company is not only growing its top line quickly, but the portion of these sales that qualifies as recurring revenue under long-term contracts is also expanding. That leads to stable and predictable results -- not only on the top line but cascading down the entire income statement. Moreover, Splunk's flexible data analysis tools are relevant and helpful to lots of use cases on a massive scale.\"We believe data is the answer to many of the world's most pressing problems and its greatest opportunities. It also represents a necessary strategy for all organizations to thrive, let alone survive, in this new paradigm,\" said CEO Doug Merritt in the . \"From improving corporate performance, to optimizing government responsiveness, to fighting crime, to medical research, to firefighting or to the rollout of 's\u00a0new electric car, we believe every problem is a data problem, and our customers think so, too.\"When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After all, it\u2019s impossible to know the right market moves without knowing what\u2019s happening behind the scenes of potential equity investments. Rosenblatt\u2019s market research arm delves into the depths, finding out what makes stocks tick, so the firm\u2019s clients can make the best-informed decisions.Today, we\u2019ll look at Rosenblatt\u2019s annual report, entitled \"Our Top Core Holdings Ideas to Celebrate Rosenblatt's 40th Anniversary,\" to outline the firm's \u2018top picks.\u2019 These stocks picked out by top-rated analysts and investors should take note.Specifically, we'll take a look at three stocks that are more purely tech-oriented, that have changed the game in their particular niches, and brought impressive gains to investors. Adding to the good news,  shows that each has racked up enough analyst support in the last three months to earn a \u201cstrong buy\u201d consensus rating.Let's take a closer look and see why these stocks truly are top picks:As if to underscore the importance of data analysis, Splunk is first on our list here. This San Francisco-based software company offers products that monitor, search, and analyze the machine generated big data, indexes and correlates the results, and makes the whole available to customers through a browser-style interface. In short, Splunk makes it easy for its customers to use all of their accumulated information. In recent years, Splunk has also begun offering software products for security analytics and Internet of Things applications.Businesses need Splunk\u2019s products, and that need has powered Splunk\u2019s success. The company\u2019s EPS, at 58 cents, beat the estimate by a significant margin and was also 52% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues were strong, too, and at $602 million showed a 29% year-over-year gain. With fast growth rates like those, you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that SPLK is up 44% in 2019.5-star Rosenblatt analyst  reviewed SPLK and came away deeply impressed. In a list of reasons to own shares in the company, he wrote, \u201c[Splunk is the] emerging de facto enterprise standard in IT, along with the likes of CRM, ORCL, SAP and MSFT... It is at the foundation of the current data-driven digital transformation secular trend\u2026 We also note that SPLK closed 24 $10M+ deals last year and 10 such deals two years ago, indicating more of its customers are adopting SPLK as its enterprise standard.\u201dA growing industry consensus that Splunk is the way forward for data aggregation, combined with an increasing number of major sales, led Kim to give SPLK a Buy rating and a $200 price target \u2013 suggesting an impressive 32% upside. (To watch Kim's track record, )Kim\u2019s bullish stance on Splunk is in line with Wall Street\u2019s view. SPLK has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on no less than 25 Buy ratings set in recent weeks. Shares are trading for $149.37, and the stock\u2019s recent strong gains have pushed that price close to the average price target of $158.43, leaving a modest 6% upside. If Splunk continues to perform, expect the analysts to adjust the target upwards. ()PayPal\u2019s impressive growth has been powered by its domination of the payment processing niche. The company has turned digital payments into the preferred method for online transactions, helping move along the dramatic expansion of e-commerce in recent years. The rewards have been substantial: in fiscal 2018, PayPal saw more than $15 billion in revenues, and over $2 billion in net profits. For 2019 the stock has gained 28%, even after slipping from its peak price in July. This gives PayPal a 3-point advantage over the S&P 500\u2019s year-to-date growth.A look at the company\u2019s Q3 report will show some details of the growth. Total payment volume, a key metric of the value of transactions put through PayPal\u2019s system, rose to $178.67 billion, growing 25%. Revenue was up 19% to $4.38 billion, and EPS showed an 8% year-over-year gain to 39 cents. But the best news for investors was the revision to full-year 2019 EPS. The company bumped it up to $3.07, 3.3% higher than the Street\u2019s expectations. Growth in every metric, and plenty of share price appreciation make PYPL a winner for investors.5-star Rosenblatt analyst  sees room for an additional 18% upside in PYPL shares. Hill points out several of PayPal\u2019s positional advantages: \u201cBest-in-class, two-sided ecosystem with PayPal\u2019s and Venmo's more than 275mn active Consumer accounts and 24mn Merchant accounts\u2026 Clear path ahead to increasing Venmo monetization from Pay with Venmo and Venmo Debit/ Credit, in addition to Instant Transfer\u2026 Long-term potential to be a first mover in Asia\u2026 complimenting efforts in Europe and Latin America\u2026\u201dHill sees PayPal with a strong competitive advantage, and puts a $128 price target on the stock to compliment his Buy rating. (To watch Hill's track record, )Wall Street generally agrees with Hill. PayPal\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 22 Buys, and only 3 Holds. The average price target, $125.86 suggests that PYPL still has room for 16% growth. ()The emergence of cloud computing has brought sea-changes to every imaginable niche in the business world. RingCentral has connected it to the world of communications, providing software solutions to combine office computer and telephone systems. The company\u2019s core product, RingCentral Office, is compatible with other popular applications like Salesforce, Outlook, Google Docs, and DropBox, while providing unique features in call forwarding, multiple telephone extensions, video conferencing, and screen sharing. In short, RingCentral lets customers link and control all of their office communication systems.In Q3, RingCentral posted EPS of 22 cents, beating both the analyst consensus and the year-ago number by 15%. The company\u2019s stock has surged in recent months, bringing its year-to-date gain up to 108% \u2013 RNG has more than doubled in value in 2019, and the year\u2019s not over yet. A couple of additional numbers from the recent quarter make it clear why RNG has gained so much. The company\u2019s software subscription increased 33% year-over-year, to reach $210.9 million, while revenues grew to $233.4 million. And while the company was posting this growth, it was also boosting R&D expenditures by 30%.Analyst  wrote up Rosenblatt\u2019s note on RingCentral, summing up the bottom line in a clear, bullish stand. He wrote, \u201cWhile RingCentral\u2019s products are strong and arguably the best in the industry, we are most impressed with RingCentral\u2019s commanding go-to-market strategy and execution. The company has built an industry leading team... RingCentral is the largest UCaaS vendor in the market and has continued to take share, growing revenues faster than all of its major competitors.\u201d Koontz was especially cognizant of RingCentral\u2019s new strategic partnership with Avaya, a leader in contact center technology. The joint endeavor was announced this past October and has generated great excitement in the industry.Koontz puts a $210 price target on RNG shares, implying a 22% upside to the stock. Wall Street is in general agreement with his stance, although more conservative on the price target. RNG\u2019s Strong Buy analyst consensus is built from 14 Buy ratings and a single Hold, while the $186 average price target is 8.6% higher than the current $171 share price.

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Slow and steady wins the race, as the old adage goes. But slow and steady can be a bit boring. Investors looking for stocks to buy, as a rule, should focus on high-quality, and preferably, lower-risk issues.Still, there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s room in any investor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s portfolio for higher-risk, higher-reward plays \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 as long as those risks are understood.In that vein, here are nine stocks to buy that offer potentially significant rewards \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u00a6 and almost as much risk. None of these stocks should be a core part of a portfolio, and all have the potential to blow up in your face.But\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0taking those risks also creates the possibility of a major reward. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s likely at least a few of these stocks will wind up big winners going forward.\t\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NYSE:) isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t having a great time, down more than 40% over the last year.Teva has too much debt and too little growth. Its key drug, Copaxone, which treats multiple sclerosis, is facing generic competition from \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:), among others.Bankruptcy likely isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a near-term scenario but the current trajectory suggests it could occur down the line. In short, TEVA is a classic contrarian, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cbuy when there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s blood in the streets\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d type of play. And there are reasons TEVA is one of these great (if risky) stocks to buy.While pressure has persisted on generic drugs, but it won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t last forever.The company has sold assets to clean up its balance sheet, which has de-risked the story somewhat. In my opinion, Teva is a better version of Valeant, but with an easier path back to normalcy, .It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a risky path, but if it works TEVA\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0could gain another 20%-plus simply by reaching a higher multiple and removing bankruptcy fears.\tThe story already has played out somewhat at \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is up more than 30% from a year ago. But the growth story isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t necessarily over.Only a few years ago, Scientific Games was a sleepy, low-growth provider of lottery tickets and terminals. But that changed in quick succession.SciGames acquired slot machine manufacturers WMS Industries and Bally Technologies, the latter coming only months after Bally bought equipment maker and gaming table designer Shuffle Master. Scientific Games became the dominant supplier to the casino industry worldwide: a \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cone-stop-shop\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d for casino floors.It also became one of the most indebted companies in the U.S. markets and still is. The combination of that debt and careful cost controls at casinos, particularly in the U.S., kept SGMS stock suppressed.But it now looks like the long-awaited \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009creplacement cycle\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d of slot machines is arriving and that could be hugely beneficial for Scientific Games and its smaller, similar rival  (NYSE:). And considering how much leverage is still on the balance sheet, there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a case for SGMS to clear $100 \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 yes, $100 \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094 if its profit growth accelerates.That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not a guarantee, obviously, but\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the nature of highly indebted companies. Leverage is a weight when those companies struggle, and it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a springboard when they grow.\tIn the case of  (NYSE:), leverage has been a weight. After optimism about stable energy prices and Chesapeake\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s improved balance sheet boosted CHK stock in 2017, it was nothing but downhill in 2018.CHK now trades down\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0 61% since this time last year and continues pushing multi-year lows.I think CHK is the best, if riskiest, of the stocks to buy on higher energy prices.Chesapeake is a risky play, but the combination of debt on the balance sheet and leverage from higher energy prices mean that with a couple of changes, CHK could soar.\t (NASDAQ:), on the other hand, isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t the cheapest stock in its space or anywhere else. The high-flying \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009coperational intelligence\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d software provider trades up nearly 35% year over year.The valuation alone shows the risk in SPLK, which suffered from wild peaks and valleys last year, as investors give the company time to grow into its valuation.Meanwhile, Splunk continues to be a likely acquisition target. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:) was  in September and \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NYSE:) long thought to be a logical acquirer.Splunk is a classic growth stock in that it, too, is high-risk and high-reward. But it looks like one of the better growth stocks to buy in what might be an over-aggressive market at the moment.\tThe shipping space generally has been a \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBermuda Triangle\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d for investor capital, but \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NYSE:) might be the exception to the rule.There\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s likely to be some near-term volatility and Ship Finance\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dividend, which currently yields 9.62%, could be at risk, but it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s still one of those great stocks to buy if you can handle the risk.But this also remains one of the best plays in shipping, available for a modest premium to book value and at low-teens multiple to earnings. The industry alone, and a heavily leveraged balance sheet, both show the risk.But if Ship Finance can make it through some choppy waters over the next few months, there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s likely a nice return for shareholders on the other side.\tThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no sector of the market more boom-and-bust than biotech and drug development.\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:) doubles down on that volatility by developing its drugs from marijuana.But GW Pharmaceuticals isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t one of those fly-by-night penny stocks to buy based on legalized weed. Which is why . It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a $4.14 billion pharmaceutical company with a legitimate lead product candidate in Epidiolex, aimed to treat Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.Sativex, used to treat multiple sclerosis spasticity, already is on the market. And another compound has potential uses to fight epilepsy and treat autism spectrum disorders.Like most drug development plays, GWPH is high-risk. But there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a reason for investors to hold long-term optimism toward the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s pipeline. Success in getting those drugs to market likely would make GWPH an acquisition target at some point suggesting a significant upside from current levels. If it happens, analysts see GWPH stock surging near 30%.That in turn, would suggest significant upside from current levels for GWPH stock.\tConsidering that solar power actually is gaining an increasing share of the U.S. market, in particular, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s surprising that solar stocks including \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:) actually haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t done all that well.SolarCity had to be rescued by \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:). \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NASDAQ:) is down from multi-year highs.There are risks for CSIQ, in particular: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009ccommoditization\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d and price pressure could hit margins. Still, demand for CSIQ equipment is growing, and the stock isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t terribly highly valued.Solar stocks are likely to stay choppy for a while, but CSIQ should have some room to run if it can get through the second half of the year.\t\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0(NYSE:) is on the move again. Shipments of the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s aluminum wheels hit a record last year and it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s starting to pay off.Auto parts stocks as a whole have had trouble, driven by  in the space. Superior itself has had a couple of missteps that impacted margins, and profits. And with SUP one of the more indebted companies in the sector, both factors have had an amplified impact on Superior\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s share price.But there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a reason to see a reversal as well, which is what makes SUP one of the smart stocks to buy. Near-term auto sales may be coming down, particularly in the U.S.Last year\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s acquisition of European supplier UNIWHEELS improved Superior\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s position overseas. And there is room to improve execution, and hopefully, margins, going forward.SUP does have potential downside risk, particularly if global macro concerns arise, pressuring auto sales and\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0dropping SUP earnings further. But for contrarians who think the auto parts selloff is overdone, SUP is one of the more intriguing plays.\t (NYSE:) is another of the growth stocks to buy with a high valuation and a big opportunity.The company began as an online textbook rental company. But it wound up outsourcing that business to another provider and since has focused on becoming the dominant digital platform for U.S. college students.And Chegg is having some success. Revenues are growing and adjusted EBITDA has turned positive after years of losses. The company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s tutors and study services businesses are growing rapidly, and it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s becoming a fixture in the college landscape.There are risks here beyond valuation. Like so many companies, Amazon is a potential competitor down the line, given its efforts to offer free Prime services to college students. But at this point, it might simply be easier for Amazon to buy Chegg, rather than\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0expend the resources to try and fight it.With each passing quarter, Chegg gets more and more entrenched. And that only serves to strengthen the bull case for CHGG stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["fter an ugly slide during the last few months of 2018, the stock market has done well in 2019. With just a few weeks left in the year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 20%, the S&P 500 is up by about 23%, and the NASDAQ has gained nearly 30%.However, that rising tide has pushed some stocks to expensive valuations, and increased the likelihood of a correction. \"We still think the greatest risk in the equity market remains in growth stocks where expectations are too high and priced,\" Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Michael Wilson stated recently.Investors should think twice before investing in steeply overvalued stocks, and these are some of the most expensive tech stocks in the market today. is a cloud-computing company that has achieved  in recent years, rising from $1 billion in sales in 2015 to more than $2.6 billion in revenue for 2018. The company is on track to reach a top line of well over $3 billion this year. Its\u00a0market cap has ballooned to $50 billion -- up more than 50% so far this year.The problem, however, is that although ServiceNow has made significant progress in terms of its bottom line\u00a0 -- shrinking its annual net losses from $198 million in 2015 to just $27 million in 2018 -- it has yet to reach the breakeven point for a full year. However, it has been making headway it has recorded a profit of $35 million on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis.\u00a0In three of the past five quarters, ServiceNow was able to record a profit, but the problem is that its margins have been razor-thin. In its recently reported Q3, the company generated $41 million in earnings on revenue of $886 million, for a net margin of just 4.6%. But that was still a big improvement from the prior-year quarter where ServiceNow earned just $8.4 million in net income.\u00a0Image Source: Getty Images.Despite its recent profitability, the reality is that ServiceNow stock is terribly expensive now. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over the past 12 months is a whopping 1,500, largely due to the minimal nature of its profits during that time.But even looked at through the lenses of ratios more friendly to unprofitable or just-profitable businesses, the picture isn't pretty. ServiceNow is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 16 and a price-to-book (P/B) multiple of 36.By comparison,\u00a0, which offers cloud-based applications for businesses, trades at a P/S of 11 and P/B of 16.\u00a0, another ServiceNow competitor is also more modestly priced with a P/S of 10 and P/B of 12.\u00a0 offers its customers a software platform to help analysts and data scientists conduct analytics. With companies increasingly focused on efficiency, demand for these types of products and services is growing, especially among larger organizations. And that trend is certainly consistent with Alteryx's rapid pace of top-line growth. Its sales of $254 million in 2018 were nearly triple its 2016 revenue of $86 million.\u00a0In its most recent quarter, its top line increased a whopping 65% to $103 million from $63 million in the prior-year quarter.Unfortunately, Alteryx, too, has struggled with profitability -- it's only been in the black for two of the past five quarters. Its trailing-12-month net income of $13 million was just 3.7% of the company's $351 million in sales.\u00a0With its\u00a0share price up more than 80% this year, it now has a P/E of more than 500. Its P/S of 20 is higher than ServiceNow's, while its P/B of 18 is about half. Although its rapid growth has been impressive, that's not enough to justify its $7 billion market cap.

In this age of mobility powered by smartphones and cloud computing, businesses have to protect an increasingly decentralized workforce that could be accessing data and operating systems from anywhere. The explosion in mobile devices -- known as \"endpoints\" in industry parlance -- and rise of cloud-based operations has led to a shortage in cybersecurity talent for many IT teams.That's where services like SOAR (security orchestration automation and response) and SIEM (security information and event management) come into play. The systems automate the gathering of data to help detect and respond to threats from cyber-based baddies, using things like machine learning (a branch of artificial intelligence) to help security teams keep up.It's been a small but fast-growing segment of cybersecurity, and global spending on SOAR and SIEM services is expected to grow by low- to mid-teens percentage rates on its way to topping a few billion dollars spent annually in about five years' time. Thanks to a  a couple of years ago, big data analytics firm   is a leader in SOAR and SIEM. To that end, the always conservative but still fast-growing  recently announced it acquired security automation platform CyberSponse for an undisclosed sum. One of the best ways to invest in cybersecurity, this is a smart move on Fortinet's part.Image source: Getty Images.CyberSponse is a small outfit. According to Crunchbase, the company has raised just $7.6 million in funding, with the last investor plopping money down back in 2016. Thus, Fortinet's purchase price is likely very small (especially considering it's done $2.05 billion in sales over the last 12 months). That's not a bad move, though, and is in keeping with Fortinet's growth strategy. SOAR is still a small industry, and Fortinet already offers SOAR and SIEM through its various security offerings -- like Fortinet Security Fabric, which covers all the bases for an organization's complex needs. Plus, CyberSponse was likely a good fit as it was already a partner firm on the Security Fabric platform. Flying in the face of its spend-happy peers, Fortinet's measured and calculated response to automation is likely to yield rich results for shareholders. The security industry has been undergoing rapid change and consolidation, and many incumbents have been forced to \u00a0on acquisitions to maintain mixed growth results. Small cloud-based upstarts have been winning market share as cybersecurity has evolved, but most of them are unprofitable as they .Fortinet stands apart as a unique investment in the security space. It is a firm rooted in cybersecurity principles of yesteryear, but has successfully rolled with the punches by mostly innovating in-house. Along the way, those innovations haven't been offsetting losses elsewhere, but rather have continued to fuel respectable growth. Sales through the  are up 19% from the same period in 2018. Even better is that, due to its disciplined expense management, earnings per share are up 41% this year. \u00a0With the takeover of CyberSponse, investors can expect more of the same from Fortinet: It won't be the fastest-expanding name in the industry, but it will likely be one of the most profitable ones. Shares are up 48% year to date in 2019 as of this writing, so I'm not buying any more shares right at the moment. Nevertheless, I still maintain this is one of the best plays in cybersecurity investing. If it isn't already, it deserves to be on your radar.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Sure, third-quarter earnings per share dropped more than 2% year-over-year. But, trade war pressures and slowing economic activity were supposed to cause an even steeper slowdown. Indeed, about three-fourths of S&P 500 companies reported Q3 profits that were above expectations.Meanwhile, revenues largely came in above expectations, too, and rose about 4% year-over-year. Management teams also sounded a cautiously optimistic tone that profit margins would improve going forward with easing trade tensions. Consequently, the outlook is for this earnings slowdown to end soon, and turn into big profit growth in 2020.Because of all these positive developments, stocks have surged higher this earnings season. Companies started reporting third-quarter numbers around early October. Since then, the S&P 500 has rallied 6% to all-time highs, marking one of its most impressive earnings season rallies in recent memory.Which stocks led this earnings season rally? More importantly, which of these winners can continue to grind higher in 2020?Let\u2019s answer those questions by taking a closer look at seven strong stocks to buy that won big this earnings season, and will keep winning big into 2020.\tOne stock which had a particularly good third-quarter earnings season is U.S. general merchandise retailer  (NYSE:).In late November, Target reported impressive Q3 numbers which topped revenue, comparable sales, digital sales, margin and profit expectations. Management also hiked its full-year 2019 guide, while providing an above-consensus holiday quarter guide. In sum, the report affirmed that Target is not a \u201cone hit wonder.\u201d Instead, this company is leveraging strategic growth initiatives to sustain big growth and margin improvements.All of this will persist into 2020 for a few reasons. First, the macroeconomic retail backdrop is improving. Trade tensions will ease. Consumer confidence will rebound. Spending trends will pick up, while tariff pressures will back off. Second, Target\u2019s e-commerce business is still relatively small, while omni-channel buildout is still in its early stages. In 2020, both of these verticals will sustain strong growth through geographic expansion. Third, Target\u2019s new smaller format stores are running at much higher gross margins than the larger format stores, and Target plans to open a bunch of these smaller format stores in 2020. Fourth, wage pressures should be offset by technology investments.Target will sustain big revenue growth and margin expansion in 2020. As it does, TGT stock will sustain its upward momentum, because shares remain reasonably valued at less than 20-times forward earnings.\tShares of data analytics service provider  (NASDAQ:) surged in the third quarter after the company reported strong numbers which broadly underscored that the company\u2019s new Data-to-Everything platform is in the first innings of a big growth ramp.Long story short, Splunk recently launched its Data-to-Everything platform. It is basically an all-in-one enterprise ecosystem where companies can turn data of all sorts into actionable insights. Splunk hopes that this new platform will become a must-have service in every office. Early demand trends support that dream. In the third quarter of 2019, strong early demand for the Data-to-Everything platform powered above-consensus revenue and profit growth.Considering the world we live in today \u2014 one which is flooded with data and dominated by data-driven decision making \u2014 it is highly likely that Splunk\u2019s Data-to-Everything platform continues to grow rapidly in 2020. Rapid growth from this platform will power a string of double-beat-and-raise earnings report in 2020.The sum of these strong earnings reports, coupled with broadly bullish investor sentiment thanks to easing U.S.-China trade tensions, should keep SPLK stock on a winning path.\tTarget wasn\u2019t the only retailer that reported strong third-quarter numbers at the end of November. Electronics retailer  (NYSE:) did, too.Specifically, Best Buy\u2019s third-quarter revenues, comparable sales, margins and profits all came in above expectations. Management also raised its full-year guide and delivered an above-consensus fourth-quarter guide on both the revenue and margin fronts. Of importance, Best Buy appears to be sustaining strong revenue growth momentum thanks to ever-increasing demand in the consumer electronics space, while simultaneously keeping costs down and turning that strong growth into healthy profit margin expansion.This favorable dynamic should persist in 2020. Over the next twelve months, the consumer electronics space will boom thanks to a plethora of tailwinds. You have the big 5G push, and the launch of several new 5G smartphones, including a 5G iPhone. You also have the introduction of , and the release of a new generation of Xbox and PlayStation consoles. There\u2019s also a big streaming push unfolding with  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:) all entering the streaming wars. This push will naturally increase demand for streaming devices, which can be found at Best Buy.All in all, 2020 is shaping up to be a pretty good year for Best Buy. Healthy revenue growth and margin expansion should persist. As it does, BBY stock should keep climbing higher, especially since shares remain dirt cheap at just 13-times forward earnings.\tGlobal\u00a0internet giant\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:) reported third-quarter numbers in late October that breezed past expectations and underscored that this stock can (and will) head way higher over the next 12 months.Third-quarter revenues and profits topped expectations. User growth trends remained healthy, with the user base sustaining 8%-9% year-over-year growth. Revenue growth trends also remain healthy, with revenues yet again rising in the 30% range. Expense growth moderated significantly. Operating margins, which have been getting wiped out by big data-security investments, dropped just one point year-over-year.Zooming out, Facebook\u2019s third-quarter numbers underscored that this company is past the scandal, and that the company survived that scandal largely unscathed. User engagement, ad demand and revenue growth all remain robust. The only casualty? Profit margins. And those are already bouncing back.In 2020, everything will only get better for Facebook. Ad revenue growth will remain strong behind advertising real estate expansion on Messenger and WhatsApp, as well as heavier ad usage in Instagram and Facebook Stories. The e-commerce business will gain strong early momentum behind Facebook Pay and Instagram Shopping. Margins will improve as big data-security investments phase out, and big revenue growth drives positive operating leverage.Facebook will get back to 20%-plus revenue and profit growth in 2020. As it does, FB stock \u2014 which trades at just 23-times forward earnings \u2014 will run higher.\tThe hottest and perhaps least well-known stock on this list is small department store operator  (NYSE:). But, investors shouldn\u2019t be intimated by the stock\u2019s 630% year-to-date gain (yes, you read that right). Nor should they be scared by the company\u2019s small size and relative obscurity.Instead, Stage Stores\u2019 third-quarter numbers confirm that investors should both embrace the recent red-hot rally in SSI stock and the fact that not many people know about the huge transformation playing out here.Long story short, Stage Stores has been getting killed by  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:), Target and a plethora of others, because the company has lacked the resources to compete in the full-price channel with these deep-pocketed retail giants. Amid this slaughter, Stage Stores bought off-price retailer Gordmans in 2017. It was a footnote that didn\u2019t stop the bleeding. But, management started to notice that while their full-price Stage Stores locations were struggling, their off-price Gordmans locations were doing quite well.So, in 2019, management committed to turning Stage Stores into an off-price retail giant. That is, they are closing some underperforming Stage Stores locations, and converting the rest to off-price Gordmans locations, so that by the end of 2020, the entire store portfolio will be off-price.Early data from this transition is promising. In the third quarter, Stage Stores converted 17 department stores to Gordmans off-price. Not coincidentally, comparable sales rose a whopping 17%.This transition is still in its early days. By year end, Stage Stores projects to have 158 off-price locations. By the end of 2020, it will have 700. Thus, the bulk of the transition won\u2019t happen until 2020. That means the bulk of the financial benefits won\u2019t show up until 2020 or 2021. Considering SSI stock still trades at a rather lousy 0.1-times trailing sales multiple, that also means that the bulk of the SSI stock rally is still to come.\tShares of global digital payments platform\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:) soared this earnings season on strong third-quarter numbers which broadly underscored that this company\u2019s growth narrative remains as robust as ever.Specifically, in late October, PayPal reported yet another double-beat earnings report. But, that wasn\u2019t the impressive part. The impressive part was that PayPal sustained huge growth across all of its important metrics, despite the slowing economic backdrop. Total payment volume growth yet again exceeded 25%. Account growth again exceeded 15%. Engagement growth hit nearly 10%. Revenue growth was roughly 20%, and operating margins expanded \u2026 again.In other words, everything at PayPal is firing on all cylinders, despite slowing economic growth. In 2020, that slowing economic growth will turn into rebounding economic growth, as trade tensions ease and capital spending trends rebound. This rebound in economic activity will add more firepower to an already red-hot PayPal growth trajectory. So will further ramp in Venmo, which is quickly turning into a must-have consumer payments ecosystem.The result? PayPal\u2019s volumes, accounts, revenues, margins and profits will all sustain big growth in 2020. As they do, PYPL stock \u2014 which  relative to its growth prospects \u2014 will run higher.\tConsumer technology giant  (NASDAQ:) had a strong showing this earnings season, and that strong showing added credibility to the idea that the company could be in store for a big 2020.The story at Apple has been a simple one. For the past decade, the company has been hyper-focused on selling hardware products to consumers around the globe. That hardware business has been slowing because of market saturation issues. In order to combat that slowing growth, Apple has built out a series of subscription software businesses to more deeply monetize its huge install base.In other words, Apple has gone through eras of big hardware growth and eras of big software growth. But, the company has yet to experience an era of both big hardware and big software growth together.Until now. Apple\u2019s most recent earnings report showed that the software business remains hot, while revenue declines in the hardware business are moderating. That red-hot software business will get even hotter in 2020, as new services like Apple TV+ and Arcade gain mainstream traction. Meanwhile, the stabilizing hardware business will start growing again, sparked by big upgrade demand, lower-priced new iPhones and a 5G iPhone in late 2020.In the big picture, then, Apple is entering a golden era in 2020 wherein both its software and hardware businesses will grow together. This collaborative growth should continue to power AAPL stock to new highs.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BBY, T, FB, SSI, WMT, PYPL and AAPL.\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Looking back on the past decade, the 2010s have been a spectacular decade for stocks overall. But, of more importance, the 2010s were an even more spectacular decade for tech stocks.The internet went global. Everyone got a smartphone. And a smartwatch. And a smart tablet, smart car and smart appliances, too.E-commerce became a thing. So did streaming services. Digital advertising took over the ad world. Cloud took over the enterprise world. Artificial intelligence, automation and self-driving all became realities.Because of all this growth, the technology sector became an increasingly important part of the global economy. And as it did, tech stocks roared higher. The \u00a0(NYSEARCA:) rose 322% during the decade \u2014 a 135 point outperformance of the broader market.Will this big growth for tech stocks continue next decade?Yes, without a doubt.Throughout the 2020s, all of the preceding decade\u2019s most important technology trends will persist. There will also be some new technology trends which will only add more firepower to the tech sector\u2019s growth narrative.Above all, tech stocks will stay on a winning trajectory in the 2020s. But which ones look best in this rising tide? Let\u2019s take a look at a few of my favorite tech stocks to buy for the next 10 years.\tOne of the best tech stocks to buy for the next decade is enterprise software company  (NASDAQ:).Overall, the rationale for buying SPLK stock is surprisingly simple. Data is the future of everything. Splunk is where data goes to become useful. Thus, as businesses increasingly pivot towards data-driven decision making, they will increasingly turn towards Splunk to help them make use of their data.This is already happening today, and it will happen in greater frequency over the next decade. As it does, Splunk\u2019s revenues, profits and stock price will all march higher.Breaking this thesis down further, Splunk operates what management calls a  platform. That approach does exactly what the name describes. It helps businesses turn their machine data (like transaction data or web traffic data) into useful insights of all sorts.This includes insights for better product creation (according to the data, your customers like red shoes more than blue shoes), better marketing (according to the data, your customers resonated more with the beach ad than they did with the mountain ad) and so on and so forth.This is called data-driven decision making, and it is the future of business, because it turns decision-making into a science. Splunk is turning into the backbone of this data-driven enterprise decision making market. In theory, almost every business has a need for Splunk\u2019s tools; Yet, very few do.This disconnect implies a huge growth opportunity for Splunk over the next decade as data becomes the center of the business world.\tThe 2020s bull thesis for streaming device maker  (NASDAQ:) is pretty straightforward. Everyone talked about cord-cutting in the 2010s; But, not many people actually did it.Most U.S. households , packaging their cable TV packages with some streaming services because there is a lack of content supply in the streaming world.That will change in the 2020s. Everyone from  (NYSE:) to  (NYSE:) is launching a streaming service. And come 2025, there will be enough content supply in the streaming TV world to get consumers to actually cut the cord.As the majority of consumers make the full transition from linear to streaming TV in the 2020s, they will increasingly need a centralized, streamlined platform to access all their streaming TV services; Like a cable box for the streaming TV world.Roku is that.Because Roku has big incumbency in this market, consumer desire for consistency and content provider desire for optimal reach should work together to keep Roku the big dog in this space for a lot longer.With that, then, Roku will adds tons of users over the next several years as consumers pivot into the streaming TV channel. Linear TV ad dollars will follow those consumers into the streaming channel. As a result, some of those ad dollars will wind up in the Roku ecosystem. Ultimately, then, big user growth will be accompanied by big revenue growth, and big profit growth, because ad revenues are high-margin.Big profit growth will power ROKU stock materially higher throughout the 2020s.\tThe biggest tech stock on this list \u2014  (NASDAQ:) \u2014 looks exceptionally strong heading into the 2020s for four big reasons.First, over the next decade, Facebook will leverage digital ad real estate expansion to sustain huge growth in its core digital ad business. That is, Facebook owns four digital platforms with one billion or more users \u2014 and two of them, Facebook and Instagram, are loaded with ads. The other two, WhatsApp and Messenger, aren\u2019t.In the 2020s, Facebook will inevitably roll out ads across those other two platforms. Due to this, the company\u2019s dominance in the secular growth digital ad market will grow, and Facebook will sustain huge digital ad growth rates.Second, Facebook\u2019s huge push into e-commerce will yield huge returns. Facebook just started down the e-commerce path recently, with the launch of Instagram Shopping and Facebook Pay. In the 2020s, Facebook will more aggressively turn these budding growth initiatives, into huge, revenue-generating verticals.Why will they be successful in doing this? Because Facebook\u2019s platforms are a already a place where consumers are constantly sharing products and services with their social networks. Layering \u201cBuy Now\u201d functionality on top of that dynamic seems natural, seamless and destined for sizable uptake.Third, Facebook\u2019s margins will meaningfully improve next decade. This used to be a 50% operating margin company. Then,  hit. Facebook had to up data-security investments. Profit margins got killed. This dynamic is temporary. In the 2020s, revenue growth rates will remain big. Expense growth rates will not. And margins will roar higher, adding another tailwind to profit growth.Fourth, Facebook stock isn\u2019t priced for the big profit growth that will happen in the 2020s. Shares trade at just 22 times forward earnings, for what will be 20%-plus profit growth for the first several years of next decade. That\u2019s just too little of a multiple, for too big of profit growth.\tProgrammatic advertising platform  (NASDAQ:) looks really good going into next decade because of three big trends.The first is the most obvious \u2014 the continued rise of digital advertising. Long story short, consumer engagement is only becoming more digital. Ad dollars follow engagement, so over the next decade, more and more ad dollars will make their way into the digital channel.With that, ad spend through The Trade Desk will rise because this is a demand-side platform (DSP) for digital ad buyers.Second, automation will go mainstream in the 2020s.Over the last few years of the 2010s, the world started to see what automation actually was \u2014 self check-out kiosks, self-driving, etc. But, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. In the 2020s, automation tech will get better and become more integrated in the global economy.This includes programmatic advertising, which is the automation of the digital ad transaction process. The top dog in the programmatic advertising space? The Trade Desk, meaning that as the automation wave gains traction next decade, ad spend through The Trade Desk will rise.Third, the digital ad world is becoming decentralized. That is, the global digital ad industry has historically been a duopoly controlled by  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) and Facebook, and those two ad giants ran their ad businesses like a walled garden, sealing off all DSPs.But, the rise of digital advertising on platforms like  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:) and others has . Simultaneously, there has been tremendous regulatory pressure on big tech to open up their walled gardens. One way they can do that? Let in DSPs to make the digital ad transaction process fairer. This opening up of the big-tech-walled garden should enable The Trade Desk to become a far more important player in the digital ad space.Comprehensively, a continued surge in digital ad spend, a rise in programmatic advertising and a shift towards open-internet policies will all help TTD stock be a winner next decade.\tLast but not least on this list of the best tech stocks to buy for the next decade is e-commerce solutions provider  (NYSE:).There are two big trends powering the Shopify growth narrative, and both will persist into next decade. The first is a secular pivot towards e-commerce.For Shopify, the important implication of this pivot is that the internet is the new mall. Ten years ago, a retailer needed a storefront in a mall in order to gain brand awareness, drive sales and survive. Today, that storefront is digital \u2014 in the form of a website.However, creating a website can be a tough and daunting challenge, especially as the e-commerce world becomes more and more competitive. Thus, retailers are increasingly turning towards pros to optimize their websites.Shopify is the best in the game at doing this. And, as e-commerce becomes a bigger piece of the retail pie, Shopify\u2019s reach and relevance across the retail world will grow.The second big trend here is that the retail world is becoming increasingly decentralized, as the internet has democratized the retail world.Before, the biggest stores won all the sales, because time-constrained shoppers only had enough time to visit a few places. Today, shoppers have nearly unlimited time, since popping between websites takes a second, and so they are increasingly shopping across a wider variety of stores.This decentralization implies big growth potential for Shopify. The likes of  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:) have the resources to run their own digital operations, while small-to-medium sized merchants don\u2019t.Those smaller guys are the ones turning towards Shopify, and the more they gain momentum, the more sales will happen through Shopify websites.Big picture \u2014 the future of the retail world is direct and decentralized, and Shopify is the backbone of that retail model. As this pivots towards direct, decentralized retail plays out in the 2020s, SHOP stock will roar higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SPLK, T, FB, TTD, PINS, SHOP, and WMT.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at options trading activity among components of the Russell 3000 index, there is noteworthy activity today in GrubHub Inc (Symbol: GRUB), where a total volume of 28,737 contracts has been traded thus far today, a contract volume which is representative of approximately 2.9 million underlying shares (given that every 1 contract represents 100 underlying shares).

In some way, it hovers above the rest of the vast pack of equities.With the depth and breadth of the U.S. market, there are always a few standouts. For this week, let's take a look at two good ones, and see what made them rise confidently above the average.Image source: Getty Images.One big winner among  over the past five trading days was data analytics solutions provider  . Posting a solid, estimates-trouncing quarter will do that to a stock.Late in the week, , which topped analyst expectations not only for this quarter, but also for Q4. Revenue came in at $626 million, which was up by 30% on a year-over-year basis. Non- (adjusted) net profit was just over $91 million ($0.58 per share) for a sturdy 58% improvement.On average, analysts had only been estimating $604 million on the top line and an adjusted per-share net profit of $0.54. And the company's revenue guidance for Q4 assumes $780 million, comfortably above the $768 million modeled by prognosticators.Splunk's robust growth is an encouraging mix of both organic revenue improvement, and . A shift toward recurring revenue also contributed. Investors like the recurring variety, as it makes future results a bit more predictable and tends to bring in more cash over the long term.Splunk is well-positioned for more growth as enterprise clients require deeper and more useful means of sifting through increasingly higher piles of data. Although the company's nearly 18% rise in share price over the week might give some pause, the stock remains cheap given the company's still-strong potential. Investors should consider buying this stock.Another outperformer this week was next-generation financial services provider  .

The question on some investor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s minds is, will the stock continue to climb or are many of the gains of the stock already priced in?\tFirst, a word of caution. Splunk is profitable in terms of its free cash flow (FCF). However, the company has yet to post positive full-year earnings per share (EPS) and that has some investors concerned that the stock may be overpriced.It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s certainly not cheap. But value often comes down to how much an investor is willing to pay. So far in 2019, investors are willing to pay an increasingly higher price for Splunk. There are a couple of reasons for this.One reason for investor skepticism over the past year was that Splunk, like many software companies, was transitioning from perpetual software licenses to a Software as a Service (SaaS) model.Splunk . The amount of data being collected by companies is rising exponentially. This was creating a situation where customers limited the amount of data that Splunk would analyze to avoid ballooning costs. Moving to a subscription service allows Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s customers to increase the amount of data they allow Splunk to analyze.Think of it like this. Most smartphones plans have data limits. But the emergence of home WiFi has made the data limits virtually irrelevant. Customers are online all the time so there is less concern that they will blow their data in a month.This is causing some analysts like Goldman Sachs\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 Christopher Merwin to upgrade the stock to \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cbuy\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d from \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cneutral.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Merwin also increased Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s price target to $180 from $147.So far, that transition is looking to be successful. And that is turning a potential negative into a catalyst for the stock\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s growth. Going to a subscriber model is .In the third quarter, Splunk received  from customers who have signed long-term subscription deals. This was up nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis and almost double the number it reported for fiscal year 2018.And the company is also changing its renewal policy to annual from multi-year. This, combined with the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s recent reporting of FCF is generating optimism that the company will be able to weather any short-term liquidity concerns.Splunk has acquired SignalFX, an acquisition that should provide a significant boost in revenue in 2019. For Goldman Sachs\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 Merwin, this provides a context for concerns about Splunk being overvalued.The stock currently trades at 63-times forward earnings estimates and 10.4-times trailing sales. But, if management is correct, they could easily see a growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in the mid-40% range. This would make the company much less of a risk when compared to other software companies with smaller growth rates.Two of the biggest headwinds for Splunk stock are the risk of recession and the ongoing trade war with China. Splunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s business is not affected by trade concerns and the move to a SaaS model helps to mitigate potential impacts from a slowdown in the business cycle.The market wants what it wants. Right now, the market wants growth and that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s good news for momentum stocks like Splunk. The company may feel a little overpriced at the moment. That may be evident in the fact that the stock is mostly flat since its sharp rise after its earnings report.However, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see that as a reason for investors to get scared off. The fundamentals that underpin the business model look great, and analysts are in love with the stock.

It's been a wild ride as the big data firm has been spending heavily to maximize its potential, and a projected dip in free cash flow (money left over after operating and capital expenses are paid) sent the stock down earlier in the year. Now that Splunk's sporting a 28% return during the current calendar year, those worries seem to be in the rearview mirror as the company continues to solidify its position in the booming data analytics industry. \u00a0Revenues in the fiscal 2020 third quarter (three months ended Oct. 31, 2019) were up 30% year over year to $626 million, topping what Wall Street analysts were expecting as well as the company's own guidance for $600 million during the  release. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.8% was also better than the 16% management had forecast before. A single quarter doesn't tell the whole story, though. After growing its , the company is building on that success, as it is well on track to reach its goal of over $2 billion in total revenue during the 2020 fiscal year.\u00a0Data source: Splunk.\u00a0Pp = percentage point. \u00a0\u00a0The good headline figures are a testament to how busy Q3 was. Splunk closed its $1.05 billion takeover of SignalFX, a real-time monitoring software suite for cloud infrastructure; the company unveiled new flexible pricing tiers to help customers focus more on driving business outcomes rather than worry about the volume of data they're running through the Splunk platform; and the $150 million Splunk Ventures Fund was launched to provide funding for data start-ups and access to the Splunk software ecosystem. Image source: Getty Images.One of the big data company's objectives this year was to transition to renewable contract-based billing (versus perpetual software licenses), and that transition was expected to contribute to free cash flow dipping into the red. That has transpired, with free cash flow running at negative $282 million so far this year -- including a negative $162 million in the third quarter alone. \u00a0It will take some time for that metric to recover, but CEO Doug Merritt said that the switchover to renewable licensing is nearly complete. That bodes well for Splunk's profitability headed into the new fiscal year in a couple months. In the meantime, Splunk's  in things like real-time data monitoring, , and IT operational management is helping this large-cap technologist maintain fast-growing momentum. Fourth-quarter sales are expected to be $780 million, a 25% increase from last year.\u00a0One thing to bear in mind is that shares aren't exactly cheap. No unadjusted profits (at the moment) means investors are left with imperfect means of valuation like the price-to-sales ratio. But, at 9.7 times the last 12 months sales, it isn't totally unreasonable, either. There are plenty of , with lower gross profit margin and without a plan to get profitable.\u00a0\u00a0Put simply, there was a lot to like in the Q3 report.

This is the million-dollar question for investors. Well, we say million, but that\u2019s possibly for millionaires. For us mere mortals, it is probably the \u2018few thousand-dollar question.'We all know by now that 2019 has been a record-breaking year, with the S&P 500 breaking its own record multiple times, so it gets harder to know which stocks offer good value after such a sustained rally.TipRanks\u2019  is one way to get the lowdown, as it has a variety of filters, including upside potential, analyst consensus, and investor sentiment in which to gauge the market\u2019s sentiment about any given stock.So, we put our virtual detective hat on, and using the tools at our disposal dug out 3 Buy-rated stocks, all with potential for some serious gains ahead. Let\u2019s take a closer look.Things are looking up for Ooma, the free internet phone service provider. The Sunnyvale, California based telecom company offers Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calling using an Internet connection for small businesses, homes and mobile users.Ooma took the Street somewhat by surprise with its FQ3 earnings report, beating the estimates on several metrics. Along with revenue and EPS beats, year-over-year revenues grew by 21%, with its business service leading the way with 67% growth. Ooma also reported positive FQ4 guidance, which the company thinks will be around $40 million, $1 million higher than the Street\u2019s initial estimate.The communications platform recently launched Ooma Office Pro, a small business phone service offering various premium features. This comes alongside Sprint\u2019s launch of its cloud-based commercial phone service, Omni, which is powered by Ooma Office. Sprint is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in the United States.B.Riley FBR\u2019s  thinks these developments are significant, with the 4-star analyst noting, \u201cWe believe these new offerings represent a significant opportunity for Ooma to expand its addressable market by leveraging Sprint\u2019s large sales network and increasing ARPU through Ooma Office Pro premium pricing. Ooma is seeing success with the large business customer secured in F2Q20 and management expects to add a significant number of users in 4Q with the potential for the cadence to continue into FY21.\u201dNichols reiterated a Buy rating on OOMA stock, while slightly raising his price target from $20.50 to $21.50. This implies ample upside potential of 60% from its current price. (To watch Nichol\u2019s track record, )All in all, TipRanks shows the bulls are on Ooma\u2019s side. Out of the 6 analysts that issued ratings in the last 3 months, 4 are bullish and rate it a Buy, compared to 1 Hold and 1 Sell. Significantly, the 12-month average price target of $18.88 suggests over 40% upside potential. ()Transport disruptor Uber has experienced one hell of a face melting ride down the charts since its May IPO. Losing almost 30% of its value and dealing with negative investor sentiment concerning whether the ride sharing pioneer has what it takes to make its business profitable in the long run. All this was exacerbated by the recent end to the lock up period \u2013 the date when early investors can finally sell their shares - which exerted further downward pressure on Uber\u2019s share price.One person who evidently thinks the company has the wherewithal to flourish is CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who recently purchased 250,000 shares at a price of $26.75. Uber share price\u2019s record low is $25.58, so Khosrowshahi possibly thinks the bottom is in, or at least, very close to it.SunTrust Robinson\u2019s 5-star analyst  thinks so too. Citing Uber Rides, in particular among the growing Uber portfolio, as \u201ca great business\u201d. Noting its strong category position (first or second in most markets where the service is available), secular tail winds powering growth, and robust margin profile as among factors to drive the company forward.Squali said, \u201cWe believe Uber is a compelling growth story, built to compound at scale over the next decade and beyond. We see powerful, enduring secular trends driving robust growth across Transportation-as-a-Service segments. We believe Uber\u2019s industry leading scale, technology and platform approach will enable it to capture and defend a disproportionate amount of the associated financial benefit.\u201dTo this end, the top-rated analyst reiterated a Buy on Uber along with $56.00 price target, which indicates almost 90% upside from its current price. (To watch Squali\u2019s track record, )Is the bottom in for Uber? The rest of the street seems to think so. 21 Buy ratings and 5 Holds received in the last three months amount to a Strong Buy analyst consensus. Alongside the positive sentiment, its $46.35 average price target puts the upside potential at almost 58%. ()The onomatopoeically named Splunk, is a big data analytics company, providing businesses with the tools to get insights from masses of data. Companies can then use the data to make better business decisions to improve and streamline their operations.Although there are several other operators in the field, part of Splunk\u2019s modus operandi has been to acquire other fast evolving companies like itself, specifically ones which suit its game plan. The fast -growing tech company has been on a shopping spree over the last few years, and only last month completed the $1.05 billion acquisition of cloud monitoring service, SignalFx. The company has steadily evolved from one offering big data services into one providing full-on IT modernizing tools, comprehensive business analytics, and cyber security solutions.Still, all the growth hasn\u2019t come without growing pains. Following a disappointing F2Q, Splunk\u2019s share price took a beating. The underwhelming results were partly due to the costs involved with shifting its business from a license-based model to a subscription based one. The turnaround, though, has been impressive. Following strong F3Q results which easily beat estimates, the data cruncher has now raised its revenue guidance for Q4 from $780 million versus the Street\u2019s $768 million estimate.The optimism is reflected in the Street too, as Splunk\u2019s share price has risen nearly 30% in the last month.The growth has not gone unnoticed by 5-star Rosenblatt analyst , who wrote, \u201cIn our view, SPLK is emerging as a de facto standard in the infrastructure and security management platform market, which positions the company well for the next stage of growth. As the infrastructure and security software market becomes increasingly data-driven, we see accelerated adoption of SPLK\u2019s data-driven platform within large organizations to better manage and secure increasingly complex hybrid IT environments with disparate technologies. We expect its large deal activity to show faster growth, as more organizations adopt SPLK as their next enterprise standard in IT.\u201dAccording to Kim, there is still more room for growth. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on SPLK along with a price target of $200, implying an increase of 35% from SPLK\u2019s current price. (To watch Kim\u2019s track record, )It seems the Street is on Kim\u2019s side with this one. 24 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell assigned in the last three months to Splunk add up to a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 consensus. Its $158.56 average  indicates 7% upside potential.

Furthermore, management forecast operating cash flow would reach $1 billion by fiscal 2023 -- ending in January 2023 -- which would be a huge improvement compared to the currently negative cash flow. Given the company's solid results, this goal seems realistic, but it doesn't take into account some significant costs that moderate this apparently massive profitability.During the third quarter, revenue increased to $626 million, up 30% year over year. And remaining performance obligation (RPO), a leading indicator of revenue, jumped to $1.45 billion, up 52% year over year.\u00a0Compared to competitors such as  and  -- which grew their quarterly revenue by 27% and 88%, respectively -- Splunk's growth wasn't that impressive. But if you take into account Splunk's larger scale by a factor of more than four based on revenue, its high-double-digit growth shows the strength of its business.Besides the rising demand for Splunk's products, which is related to the ever-increasing amount of data its customers must deal with, the company's better-than-expected performance this quarter was due to its strength in its public sector business. And since Splunk Cloud -- cloud-based analytics and monitoring solutions -- received a FedRAMP certification one month ago, the company should keep on expanding its footprint\u00a0in the U.S. public sector.Image source: Getty Images.Despite these solid top-line results, management expects negative  of about $300 million this fiscal year. In contrast, the company had posted positive operating cash flow over the last several years.This operating cash flow deterioration isn't worrying, though. Splunk has shifted from a perpetual license model, which consists of receiving immediate up-front cash, to a ratable model where the company gets annual smaller payments. And since its average contract lasts about three years , this transition will have a negative impact on the company's operating cash flow during that time frame. But\u00a0management expects operating cash flow to grow to $1 billion by fiscal 2023, when the billing situation normalizes.There's another aspect you should consider, though. As is the case with many ,\u00a0the company's share-based compensation (SBC) represents a significant cost to shareholders. But since SBC isn't a cash expense, it's excluded from operating cash flow.\u00a0SBC decreased as a percentage of revenue from 40% in fiscal 2017 to 24.5% in fiscal 2019. However, given the company's strong revenue growth, SBC actually increased from $378.0 million in fiscal 2017 to $441.9 million during fiscal 2019.\u00a0The contrast between Splunk's profits under generally accepted accounting principles () and its non-GAAP results illustrates the impact of SBC. Since the beginning of the year, the company posted non-GAAP earnings of $140.0 million. But GAAP net income was negative $313.9 million, mostly because of $378.9 million in SBC.\u00a0The market currently values Splunk at 21.7 times its forecast fiscal 2023 operating cash flow of $1 billion,\u00a0which seems reasonable when you take into account the company's strong revenue and RPO growth.Yet since SBC will still represent a significant part of the company's expenses over the next several years, you should keep in mind Splunk will continue to post GAAP profits well below its operating cash flow. For instance, extrapolating $500 million of SBC deducted from the expected $1 billion of operating cash flow, profits would reach $500 million in fiscal 2023. With its current  of $21.68 billion, the valuation of 43.3 times those estimated profits becomes much less attractive.Thus, prudent investors should ignore management's symbolic goal of $1 billion of operating cash flow by fiscal 2023 and focus instead on revenue growth and GAAP profits.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Strong revenue and earnings growth projections are commonplace for the software specialist, which has topped the Street\u2019s revenue and profit estimates in ten straight quarters.As such, Splunk is broadly expected to report another top- and bottom-line beat Thursday. However, the company\u2019s outlook and its billings forecast will be the most closely watched aspects of the report. The stock has been under pressure recently, falling about 12% one the past six months. It seems despite the fact that the company understands customer behavior and can assess online end-to-end business transactions and deliver strong revenue growth, investors have shifted their focus on the company\u2019s tough comparisons from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.But not everyone is worried. Citing \"increasing clarity from a shift to a recurring revenue model,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss recently upgraded Splunk from Equal-weight to Overweight and boosted his price target from $140 to $169. Weiss believes the focus on recurring revenue can lead to more than 25% in annual-recurring-revenue growth. Adding, \"Top-line growth is more durable than it appears,\" while boasting about the company\u2019s competitive product portfolio.Based on Splunk\u2019s current price of around $124, Weiss\u2019 $169 target assumes additional premiums of 36%. For that value to be realized Splunk on Thursday will need to demonstrate why it is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing adoption of Cloud, data analytics and how it it is expanding its addressable market. And that\u2019s in addition to delivering not only a top and bottom line beat, but also strong Q4 guidance.For the quarter that ended October, Wall Street expects the Splunk to earn 54 cents per share on revenue of $602.24 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 38 cents per share on revenue of $480.98 million. For the full year, ending December, earnings are projected to rise 42.8% year over year to $1.90 per share, while revenue of $2.31 billion would mark a 28.4% rise year over year.In the most recent quarter, Splunk beat on both the top and bottom lines. Not only did Q2 revenue surge 33% year over year, the company beat profit expectations by a whopping 17 cents, reflecting an incredible 275% rise compared to Q2 quarter of 2018. The improved operational metrics were driven in part by a 46% surge in software revenue growth which reached $350 million. Just as impressive, the company provided upside revenue outlook, suggesting it is either taking market share from its competitors or growing its addressable market.During the quarter, Splunk acquired SaaS cloud monitoring company SignalFx, spending $1.05 billion in cash and stock. On Thursday, aside from plans to sustain its level of performance, analysts will want to know how the company plans to integrate this deal and what type of profits it will yield. The Street is forecasting full-year 2019 earnings to grow by 44%. Overall, Splunk has demonstrated incredible growth over the past couple of years and investors should expect similar to higher results heading into next year, which bodes well for the stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["  released significantly better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter 2020 results on Wednesday after the markets closed. Shares of the operational-intelligence platform company are up around 6% in after-hours trading as the company demonstrated the fruits of , the addition of hundreds of new enterprise customers to its already massive base, and its rapid -- albeit nearly complete -- shift toward a renewable revenue model.Let's take a closer look at what Splunk accomplished over the past few months, starting with how its top and bottom lines fared relative to the same year-ago period:Data source: Splunk. *For the quarter ended Oct. 31, 2019. GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles.First, keep in mind the above  results include the impact of items like stock-based compensation and acquisition expenses. Adjusted for those items, Splunk generated (non-GAAP) net income of $91.1 million, or $0.58 per share. Trending toward that bottom line, adjusted operating margin was 16.8%. For perspective, in August Splunk  calling for significantly lower revenue of $600 million, and for lower adjusted operating margin of 16%. And most analysts were modeling adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share on revenue closer to $604 million.Digging deeper into Splunk's , license revenue grew 33.6% year over year to $373.7 million, while maintenance & services revenue climbed 25.5% to just under $252.7 million. Within those totals, Splunk says its software revenue increased 40% to $454 million this quarter.\"Splunk continues to show the world how our Data-to-Everything Platform is uniquely positioned to bring data to every question, decision and action,\" said Doug Merritt, Splunk's president and CEO. \"Whether through our groundbreaking innovations like Splunk Data Fabric Search and Splunk Data Stream Processor or aggressive acquisition strategy, Splunk is transforming the way our customers around the world turn data into doing.\"The proof is in the pudding: Splunk added 440 new enterprise customers during the quarter, with new and expanded relationships including the likes of  in Germany,  Cruise Lines, , , , and the U.S. Census Bureau.But Splunk also continued to burn cash this quarter, generating negative operating cash flow of $135 million and negative free cash flow of $162 million. Note, however -- as  in each of its previous two quarterly reports -- this was an , given the negative impact on the timing of cash collections spurred by Splunk's far faster-than-expected transition away from perpetual licenses and toward a cloud-based, renewable model.\"With the shift to a renewable model largely complete, momentum in our term license and cloud offerings drove 53% growth in total [annual recurring revenue] during the quarter,\" elaborated Splunk CFO Jason Child.For the fourth quarter, Splunk says it expects revenue of roughly $780 million (roughly $12 million above analysts' consensus models), with adjusted operating margin expanding to 23%.As such, Splunk raised its full fiscal-year 2020 guidance to call for revenue of $2.35 billion (up from $2.30 billion previously), and reiterated its target for full-year adjusted operating margin of 14%.In the end -- at least now that the market has come to terms with Splunk's temporary cash flow headwinds -- there was little not to love about this quarterly beat-and-raise performance. And I think investors are right to bid up Splunk stock in response.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Splunk wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: The Motley Fool.\u00a0Q3 2020 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Splunk Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Ken Tinsley, Corporate Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. -- Great. Thank you, Catherine, and good afternoon, everyone. With me on the call today are Doug Merritt; Jason Child; and Chief Technology Officer, Tim Tully.After market closed today, we issued a press release, which is also posted on our website. Also note that we have posted supplemental material on the Investor Relations web page as well. This conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. And following the call, an audio replay will be available on our website.On today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including financial guidance and expectations, including our forecast for our fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2020; duration, revenue mix and long-term cash flows; and our expectations regarding our products, technology, strategy, customers, markets, industry acquisitions and investments. These statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and actual events or results may differ materially. Please refer to documents we file with the SEC, including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release.Those documents contain risks and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are being made as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements. If this call is reviewed after today, the information presented during this call may not contain current or accurate information.We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the press release and on our website.With that, now over to Doug. -- Thank you, Ken, and thank you all for joining us. We had a great Q3. Our execution was excellent, and our results were strong. I'm particularly proud of our 40% software revenue growth, 30% total revenue growth and 78% cloud growth. We completed three strategic acquisitions. We welcomed over 11,000 of our customers and partners to our user conference in Las Vegas. And we unveiled the industry's first Data-to-Everything platform, our expanded vision for bringing data to every question, decision and action.With the rollout of our Data-to-Everything platform, we introduced a new pricing approach so customers can focus on the value that data brings to their organizations. Our new pricing options, predictive pricing, infrastructure-based pricing and rapid adoption packages meaningfully expand our opportunity worldwide, while simultaneously making it easier to do business with us. Customer feedback so far has been extremely positive.In addition, Splunk Cloud received FedRAMP certification, a strategic acknowledgment of the importance of our technology and a critical step in positioning us to serve our public sector customers as we power digital transformation across the US government. With the authorization, we can now offer a single solution capable of solving IT, security and the mission challenges for agencies where data-driven decisive actions matter for the success of the mission.As you know, Splunk is prosecuting massive opportunities across IT operations, security operations and software development operations. Data has emerged as the strategic asset as more and more enterprises and government agencies around the globe are investing in data-centric digital strategies. We believe data is the answer to many of the world's most pressing problems and its greatest opportunities. It also represents a necessary strategy for all organizations to thrive, let alone survive, in this new paradigm. From improving corporate performance, to optimizing government responsiveness, to fighting crime, to medical research, to firefighting or to the rollout of Porsche's new electric car, we believe every problem is a data problem, and our customers think so, too.For example, one of the best new stories I heard about at .conf19 was how Domino's Pizza has revealed their secret sauce, Splunk, to more teams across their company. Over the past couple of years, Domino's has driven a prevalent culture shift. They simply do not make any business decision unless they can support it with data. The global pizza delivery leader uses Splunk to help them manage IT operations, protect their customers and their brand from security threats, as well as improve their marketing, communications and their trademarks, speedy and high-quality customer experience, all with data.Ultimately, with Splunk, Domino's can ask questions and act on data in realtime to keep their business thriving. Airbus Defence and Space expanded their longtime partnership with Splunk in order to improve business efficiency and overall security. Splunk enables Airbus to better protect and monitor the IT landscape throughout Europe, which ensures end-to-end visibility across global devices, more reliable systems and reduced operational incidents and team workloads. And longtime customer, Anaplan, significantly expanded their use of Splunk Cloud and Enterprise Security.With Splunk, Anaplan can take action on IT data across the business to resolve issues within seconds before it impacts their customers. Anaplan is also using Splunk across sales and marketing to help further drive customer adoption of their products, a great example of a customer who has truly embraced Data-to-Everything.Splunk is the only company enabling customers to investigate, monitor, analyze and act on massive volumes of diverse and disconnected data. Why is this so important? According to IDC, digital transformation investments are projected to reach over $1 trillion in 2019, and they're expected to reach $6 trillion in four years. Splunk is well positioned to be the data foundation for this digital transformation. We are already the strategic provider to over 90 of the Fortune 100. And our 19,000 customers represent every industry, every size of organization and every function.In order to serve our growing customer base and the growing number of use cases, we are investing in products and technologies that extend Splunk's value and relevance to all of our customers' decisions, regardless of whether the data they need sits in the Splunk index or somewhere else.Building the Splunk Data-to-Everything platform has been a multiyear, multibillion-dollar commitment. Through a combination of internal development and strategic acquisitions, we've invested in excess of $2 billion over the past couple of years to help the world turn data into doing. While our focus is to use these technologies to further strengthen our IT and security use cases, we are also expanding our market for the long term. Splunk's ability to access more data and analyze it faster allows us to appeal to new users and solve new use cases.In summary, I'm proud of our Q3 results. And I want to thank our customers, partners and our Splunkers for their commitment to turn data into doing.Now I'll turn it over to Tim Tully, our Chief Technology Officer, to take you through our product and technology strategy. -- Thank you, Doug. It's my pleasure to be on the call. Splunk is bringing innovation to everything via three highly focused initiatives: build, buy and invest. This was clearer than ever in Q3 when we announced more innovative products, acquisitions and programs than ever before and to Splunk beyond the index for the first time in our history.As of the end of Q3, Splunk had over 450 issued patents and over 650 pending patent applications. Over the past two years, we've more than doubled the size of our R&D team. And today, we have 12 global R&D sites. We've closed the acquisition of eight new companies since September 2017. And as we announced during our September Data-to-Everything launch event, Splunk has committed a $150 million venture arm to invest in the wider data ecosystem.We hosted our biggest .conf ever, both in attendance and product innovation. Whether you're a tech nerd, data nerd or design nerd, there were dozens of amazing things to see during our user conference. Since I'm all three of those, every day of .conf was off the charts. Over 11,000 people came from around the world to Las Vegas to attend over 420 keynotes and breakout sessions. Over two days, we announced 20 new releases in beta products, including the general availability of Splunk Data Stream Processor, Splunk Data Fabric Search and Splunk Enterprise 8.0 and the beta release of several new products, including Splunk Mission Control. I couldn't walk far without being stopped by excited customers and partners.Within our innovation strategy to build, buy and invest, Splunk is focused on building products that enable unbounded machine learning and realtime processing, while offering indulgent design, which fits the product form to function in a beautiful way. Furthermore, we are bringing Splunk everywhere you are, through mobile and collaborative capabilities to our products.In Q3, we merged these priorities as we announced products enabling customers to innovate on Splunk Enterprise and beyond the index. First, we announced the general availability of Splunk Data Stream Processor, a real-time stream engine, which sits outside the Splunk index and is powered by our industry-leading unbounded machine learning, which uses adaptive learning in realtime and sub-tunes with no volume or cardinality limits. We are convicted in our feeling that the future of machine learning is in the stream, not in the batch world, and Splunk is positioned to be the industry leader in this space.We also released Data Fabric Search, which supercharges the speed and scale of Splunk Enterprise by an order of magnitude or more in addition to adding federated search capability across Splunk deployments and non-Splunk resources.And finally, this quarter demonstrated the ways we're leading in consumer-grade design with collaborative features through our new user interface frameworks. This was on full display at .conf, where we announced two new products that reside on our multi-tenant cloud-native platform.The first was Mission Control, the hybrid cloud SaaS product for the security operation center that connects to and brings together our on-premises Enterprise Security, UBA and Phantom products into one single beautiful pane of glass. The second product delivered on the new cloud platform was Splunk Investigate, a cloud-based product based on workbook style investigation flows to search and analyze data collaboratively and in real-time. DevOps and DevSecOps customers are those new to Splunk, where smaller datasets can use Splunk Investigate for easy data onboarding, root cause analysis, incident management, troubleshooting production issues and much more.Next, I'd like to talk about our acquisition strategy that both enhances the product portfolio and helps deepen our roots in the Open Source community. Through our acquisitions of Omnition and Streamlio, Splunk is positioned as a top contributor to OpenTelemetry in the Apache Pulsar. This week, we announced additional contributions and donations to help make OpenTelemetry the standard for data collection and to advance the observability initiatives of the project's community.Our investment in OpenTelemetry is important. Making data collection open and accessible to everyone is a key imperative for Splunk. We are 100% behind OpenTelemetry as the new standard for the observability world. This new investment comes in addition to our existing commitments to Open Source projects such as Apache Kafka, Flink, Spark, Kubernetes and more, which are already at the heart of our products.Consumers have welcomed our embrace of Open Source to enhance ease of use, validating that we are building the products our customers want and which transform their organizations. With our purchases of SignalFx and Omnition, Splunk has the best solutions for real-time monitoring of infrastructure, microservices and applications, combining the three pillars of observability, logs, metrics and traces. We are laser-focused on integrating SignalFx and Omnition into Splunk for a unified observability experience.As I mentioned, the third piece of Splunk innovation is our investment strategy. In Q3, we introduced Splunk Ventures and two inaugural funds to introduce the next generation of data analytics. Splunk Ventures is complementary to our existing operations and provides portfolio companies with a variety of benefits, including access to Splunk technology, go-to-market support and engagement with Splunk leaders. Through the Splunk, we designed our inaugural funds with a focus on outcomes. We established a $100 million Splunk Ventures Innovation Fund for early stage start-ups, transforming data into business value, and a $50 million Splunk Ventures Social Impact Fund to invest in start-ups using data to create social good.We have already made a number of investments. And at .conf '19, we were proud to announce our first Social Impact Fund investment in Zonehaven, a start-up developing technology to help fire departments get ahead of wildfires. Splunk Ventures' goal is to fund companies that will continue building the product ecosystem surrounding the Splunk data platform. Splunk Ventures will in turn help accelerate new technology in the data ecosystem to achieve world-changing outcomes.When we say we're bringing innovation to everything, we mean everything. Whether we're building, buying or investing, our intent is to enable our customers to bring data to every question, decision and action.Thanks again for joining us. Now over to Jason. -- Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Appreciate you joining us today. Q3 execution was solid, highlighted by strength in our public sector business. Third quarter revenues were $626 million, up 30% year-over-year. Cloud revenue was $80 million, up 78% over last year. In Q3, software revenues, which is the total of license and cloud, were $454 million, up 40% year-over-year.As we outlined last quarter, customers have been opting for Term and Cloud contracts over perpetual faster than we anticipated. As a result, we've accelerated the completion of our shift to a renewable model and discontinued new perpetual license offerings effective November 1. In Q3, 92% of software bookings were either Term or Cloud, slightly lower than Q2, due to some customers making a final perpetual purchase. We maintain our expectation that we'll exit this year with renewable mix in the high 90s and reach nearly 100% next year and beyond.With the shift to a renewable model largely complete, we've taken a fresh look at which operating metrics are the most relevant to our go-forward model. With the diminishing contribution from perpetual licenses, we believe an annualized metric on Term and Cloud better reflects the underlying growth of business. Today, we're providing total ARR, or annual recurring revenue, which we define as annualized value of Cloud, Term license and maintenance contracts as of the last day of the period. Note that, ARR excludes all perpetual license and nonrecurring professional services. As you'd expect, this metric is intended to provide a view into normalized bookings activity for the period.For the quarter ended October 31, total ARR was $1.44 billion, comprised of $368 million from cloud and $1.07 billion from term license and maintenance contracts. This compares to total ARR of $939 million in Q3 of last year, representing 53% growth year-over-year. For your benefit, we've included a five quarter look back at ARR in the slides published with today's release. Our initial outlook for next year is for ARR growth to be in the mid-40% range.We ended Q3 with total RPO of $1.45 billion, up 52% over Q3 of last year. The portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months, was $862 million at quarter end, up 42% year-over-year. RPO bookings was $839 million, up 42% from Q3 of last year. In the quarter, we recorded 134 orders greater than $1 million in total contract value, up 21% from 111 last year.In our public sector business, we had a strong third quarter, booking several mid eight figure orders with US government agencies. These agencies can require a contract term that's greater than three years and in many cases, up to five years. With orders of this magnitude and their extended duration, our overall duration skewed to 36 months this quarter, up from our recent levels of around 33 months. We believe this was specific to pub-sec momentum stemming from the federal fiscal year-end in Q3 and will revert to prior levels in Q4.On margins, which are non-GAAP. Q3 overall gross margin was 86%, up slightly on a year-over-year basis due to scale in our cloud business. Q3 operating margin was 17%, slightly better than planned, driven by our solid top line performance.Turning to guidance. We expect our high-growth trajectory to continue for the remainder of the year. Q4 revenues should reach approximately $780 million, with a non-GAAP operating margin of 23%. For the full year, we are now expecting total revenues of $2.35 billion, up from $2.3 billion, and we maintain our non-GAAP operating margin target of 14%.Looking further out, we intend to walk you through our updated long-term model at our Analyst Day in spring, but we think it's important to get a view into future cash flows relating to the shift from perpetual to ratable invoicing for Cloud and Term contracts that we discussed last quarter. To reiterate, the billing change to one year is a cash flow timing consideration only and is driven completely by customer preference and market trends.Today, we are reiterating the full year operating cash flow target we updated last quarter and expect roughly the same level for next year in fiscal '21. As billings from previously booked multiyear contracts begin to contribute more meaningful -- meaningfully to cash collections, cash flow should turn positive in FY '22 and approach $1 billion in FY '23. Again, we're providing this for high-level visibility and we'll detail other growth and operational targets at a later time.In closing, it was an excellent quarter, and we're looking forward to a strong finish to the year.With that, let's open it up for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question and congratulations. Doug, I had two quick questions. So Doug, can you talk a little bit about the reception you got from the customer base around the pricing changes? You obviously gave us like bandwidths for what people want to pay on ingestion and then on from a compute usage as well. Like what was the feedback? Do you see any kind of early indications of which way people are thinking? Thank you. And I have a follow-up. -- Thanks, Raimo. Yes. So as you would guess, I've been on the road pretty much consistently in the past two months with our strike event .conf and then our continued customer visit series, and one of the top things we talk about is pricing. What I've seen universally is a high enthusiasm and almost a sigh of relief from customers as we talk about, both the broadband for a data volume-based approach or an infrastructure component for people who just want to get away from data volumes altogether.One of my favorites is a couple of visits, two visits with a large European bank, who -- clients who crisply talked about a wildfire of use cases that are spreading across the bank again, because they moved to infrastructure-based pricing and could focus on the value being produced from these cases instead of worrying about the volume of data. So really excited about it.That said, we have to lean in hard on marketing, communications and sales enablement, so every customer hears about it, as there are still many customers that I talked to where it's new news or not entirely understood by them. So a lot of work for our teams to do to ensure that all customers get the understanding and the value that has come in with what we're doing with the Splunk portfolio. -- Perfect. And Jason, thanks for the extra disclosure, that's really, really helpful. Can we talk on AR? So obviously now, you kind of still have like the effect of more subscription coming through there. Is there an idea at what time should we see like normalized ARR? Is that like -- is it the next year's story or a two year story? How do I have to think about that? So it's obviously, it's a new number, and we all need to get our heads around that. -- Yeah. I would say, first, we've provided the five quarter trend just to try to make it a little easier for you guys to try to predict it. I'd say, second, the most -- I think probably the most important thing to think about is, ARR is -- we think, the most durable growth metric to think about how this business is actually performing annually. And if you think about the kind of customer base, only about 5% of our perp customers have actually converted to Term or Cloud. And so there's a lot of growth to come.So in terms of normalization, I don't know -- we don't expect there to be a significant deceleration. And that actually brings me to my third point. We did give an early view of what next year looks like. And I said mid-40% range is kind of a good place to start from at this point, and we'll certainly update you further in the future. -- Perfect. Very, very helpful. Thank you. Congrats again. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from And our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you so much and congrats guys on a great quarter. I've got one for Jason and one for Doug and a follow-up. Jason, if we look to slide 14 with the $1 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal '23, and I appreciate you said you'll share more at Analyst Day and as we move forward, but what are the assumptions that get you there? And more specifically, perhaps, what are the most sensitive assumptions that can cause you to end up above or below? -- Sure. So first, thanks. We feel great about the quarter. I would say the sensitivities, when it comes to cash, there's a lot. The first thing is why is this taking kind of three full years to snap back. And you've probably looked at companies that have gone through kind of transformations more than I have. But we're, in short, going from collecting the vast majority of the cash upfront, to now moving into ratable billings. Since our average duration is three years, we're effectively moving from -- it's going to take us about three years to kind of get through that transition to when you'll see the cash flow as a percentage of revenue or top line flow through.And so I feel very confident where we're going to be in '23. The movement between them is going to move a bit, depending on a bunch of variables. So what's the cloud mix versus on-prem? What is the ramping of deals? How much in year one versus two and three, et cetera. So those are the reasons why I have to be a little more opaque through the transition. But again, very confident on where the numbers will be post transition, which will be in 2023 -- or I'm sorry, fiscal '23, which is '22, I guess. -- Excellent. That's great context. I appreciate it. And just my follow-up, it's great to hear Tim speak about the commitment to OpenTelemetry. Can you talk about the impact you think it will have in leveling the playing field in the observability space, how it benefits customers and what it means for Splunk and its competitors? -- Yeah. I think moving to an Open Source framework to collect data is really the best move for the customer. What it helps them do is not feel like they're trapped by any one particular vendor and gives them a common substrate upon which to operate. Ideally, that one vendor is Splunk, but we're always trying to do what's best for the customer and best for the user. And we think that some of the donations that we made to OpenTelemetry is really what's in the best interest of the power Splunk user. -- Okay. Thanks. -- Thanks, Brad.And the next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and really nice quarter. So you've seen a lot of real strength in those current RPO bookings numbers and the ARR numbers. So that's really nice to see flowing through the model. I wanted to ask about a couple of kind of the new pieces of the equation. Probably the one that kind of really peaked our interest was SignalFx and sort of getting more fully into their cloud monitoring and observability space. Any kind of initial read that you could give us in terms of customer interest, how we should be thinking about the timing of that kind of ramping up within in your business over the next year? -- Thanks, Keith. Yeah, we are, as you guessed, we're super excited about SignalFx, but also our Mission, Streamlio, the release of Data Stream Processor. Streaming is an amazing complement to what we do with the index, and what we're doing with the combination of that portfolio is really exciting. Tim has been talking about unbounded learning and our completely unique approach within Data Streaming Processor of applying machine learning to streaming data rather than data at rest.But the interest that we've seen since the SignalFx announcement as kind of the edge of the wedge and the entire basket of capabilities is very exciting. It's clear in high tech, in any online business, that moving to a next-gen DevOps model is critical for their success than having a fully agile CI/CD backbone is key to how they move forward. And I think the portfolio that we now have is heads and tails above anything else in the industry on a feature function scale and role capability perspective.Tim, do you have any thoughts based on all the customers you've been interacting with? -- Yeah. The customers have been really positive. They recognize sort of the scalability of what SignalFx provides, especially compared to other vendors. They know that SignalFx is an upmarket product that blends well with our customer base. The other thing they've been really excited about is our acquisition of Omnition. There -- a lot of our customers are starting to cross into all sort of facets of observability around logs, metrics and traces. And they really appreciate what Omnition brings to the table in terms of tracing products. And it gives you a much better view of your application that lives on the microservices-based architecture. And it's much easier to consume for the user as opposed to traditional tracing solutions which are sort of this wall of text. So they're really buying into the story around the power of the combined Splunk SignalFx and Omnition portfolio.And then the last thing I'd add around that is I was really pleasantly excited to see that customers have figured out what was sort of my walking hypothesis, which was that our Data Stream Processor products would be a perfect marriage with the observability suite. And our customers have really already figured out that if they can move DSP together with SignalFx, the data platform story that they're building with our products is just amazing. So I've been really pleasantly surprised to see that. -- And Tim, why? What is the DSP? -- Yeah. A lot of customers, they have logs sitting around and they want to get to a place where they have logs, metrics and traces together. And so they're using our Data Stream Processor product to take those logs, ingest them into the stream inside of DSP and convert it to metrics. And that's what they use to ingest data into SignalFx. And it's been a really powerful thing to see. And what's going to happen is they're going to take that sort of recipe and build out other use cases on top of the platform. So we're really excited. -- Okay. And that sounds really exciting. And maybe one quick one for Jason on the gross margin side of the equation. With cloud scaling so rapidly, I've been expecting that number to be coming down, but you're still seeing year-on-year increases in the overall gross margin. I'm assuming this isn't something that we should be modeling on a going-forward basis, but it probably should be at some point declining, right? -- Over time, yes, because cloud margins today are in the mid-50s. They -- as of right now, my view is over the next couple of years, they probably get up to 70%. So as you see the mix of cloud grow, it will come down, since on-prem, we're obviously in the high 90s. But I would say Q3 was a little higher more because of mix. You saw a really strong pub-sec business that is all on-prem because our -- or largely on-prem since our certification for FedRAMP actually went through late in the quarter. So -- but I would expect to see it start to get closer to the 70s percent range as our cloud mix grows. -- Excellent. Thanks so much guys. -- Appreciate it Keith. Thank you.Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys. Thank you guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. And Jason, thank you for all the new metrics. I just wanted to dig in on Data Stream Processor. The feedback that we got at .conf was very positive on this. I know you touched on it earlier, but how are you positioning DSP versus some of the other streaming products that are out there on the market sort of on a stand-alone and then in the context of the Splunk portfolio? And then also the Streamlio acquisition. I mean I've heard people talk about sort of Pulsar being copped at 2.0, and obviously, Kafka and Flink are part of your existing capabilities. How do you think about Pulsar and Streamlio in the context of those two? -- Yeah. So the first part is a lot of customers are playing with DSP-like things. Mostly, we see a lot of people who have Kafka sitting around. And for the most part, the use cases we see there are around using Kafka more as a staging device or a message to you to sort of place data before there's later processing happening.Nothing lot of sort of processing in the stream itself as of yet. So I think that's where sort of some of the confusion starts to lie. DSP is actually a superset of all that. We actually use Kafka itself underneath the hood. That's part of our solution, and we actually vendor it as part of the solution.So we're much more than just a staging area for data. The stream processing, in general, allows you to do realtime unloading, monitoring, alerts, realtime aggregation, dimension lookup, PII masking. But most importantly, it allows you to route data to multiple Splunk deployments or even non-Splunk data sources, if it can do that. So customers are really seeing the extension of the data platform story that Doug and I have been talking about for close to two years at this point. And I think customers really understand that DSP is a key piece of that equation.In terms of Streamlio, yeah, we are really great to see you picked up on that acquisition in the fact that Apache Pulsar is underneath the hood there. With that acquisition, it's a fantastic team of amazing technologists at the core. That team is ex-Twitter guys and ex-Yahoo! guys who have been doing this for quite some time. And for us, largely, it was sort of additive to what we're trying to accomplish with Data Stream Processor, and it brings a wealth of talent and expertise to the equation. And we think that Pulsar is an amazing piece of technology and really interesting, and we're looking for ways to leverage it inside the product potentially. -- And if I go back, Phil, to the four pillars of investigate, monitor, analyze and act, what you've seen, and what, hopefully, our investors and our customers see is, we've been rallying around that framework for almost four years now to guide our organic-and-build approach as well as partner-and-purchase approach. And something like extremely on Pulsar, I think, is one of those lean-forward orientations. And we love what we've done with DSP. We purposely have built it in a way so that as new iterations of technology come forward, Open Source, in this case, are the product progresses, customers get a stable experience, and yet, the underpinnings of the product then will advantage of whatever next-generation enhancements or advancements come out in the community around us.So hopefully, all you guys are noticing we are actively embracing Open Source. We're contributing back to the Open Source community. The backbone of the overall engineering group continues to be augmented with talent from all around the world so that we can be a leading edge to serve our customers. -- Great. Thanks, guys. -- Thanks, Phil.Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. And Tim, nice to see you have a cameo on the call today. I have a question for Doug and a question for Jason. Doug, I'll start with you. Within the context of the pricing constructs and the new models that you've introduced, you mentioned sales enablement as a key focus area. So along those lines, at a high level, I was wondering if you would be able to share your perspectives on how these new constructs will impact incentives and compensation structures for your sales organization who are clearly used to filling in a different model for a very long time and then equally, within your indirect and in channel partner distribution ecosystem. And then I have a follow-up for Jason, if I may. -- Sure. So I think the -- when we look at data volume, that is a proxy for infrastructure, and that's why I think the initial founders came up with that metric. So from a shift to the sales force, banding data volumes, I think, just simplifies our life and makes our communications more crisp with customers. Where I think the enablement does come in is the translation on virtual CPU or virtual core, is something where that rep needs to spend time with the customer or understand what is their use case and from an infrastructure basis, what they're going to need to bring that use case to life.In the past, it was -- data was a proxy. Now as we all know and have been talking about with the customers, data is still a proxy, but what you do with the data, are you excessively accruing the data, are they high-cardinality queries or not or find to be having a meaningful decision factor for those customers on whether they're going to get an easier translation of value by leaning on an infrastructure metric, or are they going to get an easier translation of value by having this elegantly banded tiering solution? So that the -- we remain customer success as our number one priority, and that's why we offer two options. And I've seen that I can never predict exactly, going into a deal, which one the customer is going to lean on. And I think that optionality is going to be something appreciated by our customer base. -- I appreciate that color. And Jason, for you. You mentioned that only about 5% of your perpetual customer base has actually transitioned and/or migrated over to Term or Cloud form factors. So on the one hand, that's certainly an opportunity for you to convert the base. On the other hand, I'm wondering how we should internalize, just from an accounting perspective, how you would manage around horse trading between an erstwhile perpetual contract, moving to Term, and in some of these newer pricing models that are kind of working through the system. So if you can help put some guardrails around that for us from an accounting standpoint, that would be really helpful. Thank you. -- Well, I guess just to clarify, the approximately 5% of perp installed base, those are folks that are currently in our renewal subscription stream -- I'm sorry, in our maintenance renewal subscription stream. And so what those folks will either do is continue that maintenance stream or they will decide to upgrade into Term or Cloud. And when they upgrade, on average, they're upgrading at somewhere around three times or higher. So I would think of it as either they're going to remain and we have a very high retention rate, or they're going to upgrade into a higher dollar amount. Does that answer your question? -- Yes. That's very helpful and clear. Thank you. -- Great. Thanks, Fatima.Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. -- Thanks, Doug. You mentioned the new pricing is meaningfully expanding your opportunity. I know it's really early, but if you could give us your thoughts on what's surprising you the most in terms of new case studies that are coming to the platform from a case study, or is there a geo or some other area that you're seeing maybe perk up that you hadn't before? Thank you. -- Thanks, Brent. As we've talked about for a while, the variety of use case is always blown, I think, all this way around Splunk. And as more things are being censored and more departments are getting a bit more aware of how data can play a role in driving their logistics for, to the manufacturing forward or marketing or sales or HR or finance, I think we're seeing that expansion of use case across those.And at .conf, something like the keynote where Porsche and the execs from Porsche and the Taycan walk through why Splunk is integral to the rollout and successful servicing of the Taycan, I think is one of those examples that could have been true two or three years ago. But with the augmented reality capability that we've introduced, with things like DSP to make sure that you can filter and stream that data and maybe even learn from it real-time as it's flowing across the stream, that provides much more enhanced capability for those use cases.What I really see the impact with pricing being is, when I get above a 0.5 terabyte or a terabyte or 5 terabytes. That's when the light bulb usually goes on with these accounts, have, Oh my gosh, I've got a true Data-to-Everything Fabric here for use. And this could be a 100-terabyte or a five petabyte backbone. How do I make sure I can manage those costs? And that's where I've seen customers with either option, the unlimited banded option on a term basis or the virtual infrastructure option, be able to now have the feeling of control and not feel like the data volume is going to be something that overwhelms them on a lack of predictability or escalate -- too rapidly escalating price basis.So that's the virality that I think I mentioned with that European bank was based on. Oh my gosh, I've got control of infrastructure. I don't care whether we go to 50 terabytes or 150 terabytes. It will be maybe a performance factor I'm going to have to pay attention to, but I'm not going to be gated from these use cases. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Brent.Thank you. And our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hey, thank you very much. I've got a deep cash flow question for Tim and a digital stream processor question for Jason. Relax. That's not really what I wanted to ask you. .conf was just absolutely fascinating. It looked so upbeat. Doug, a question for you, high level. It could be a very long complicated question, but I'm just going to dumb it down. In what investors consider to be a crowded landscape of DevOps, more broadly speaking, what does it take to win, and why do you think Splunk is going to win, especially given your acquisitions?And for Jason, I do have a cash flow question for you, though. If you can just help us understand why the turn in cash flow is a little bit longer than what we might have expected, maybe that was incorrect. I would assume that since the renewable stuff has been running relatively high in the last four quarters, I would have thought that you started to switch to ASC 606 Q1 of calendar '18. So about the time we get into calendar 2021, you should start to see the full free cash flow conversion. So obviously, that's not happening. But can you just level-set us with the details on why you expect the turn to happen in calendar '22 and not in calendar '21? Thank you so much.Awesome. I will start, Kash, with just the intro. I'm going to hand it over to Tim for the observability piece. What we saw in our due diligence, and I think I said this when we announced the acquisition of SignalFx, that we looked at every single entity in the marketplace and usually, two or three time as far as engineered, engineer conversations. And why we were so excited about SignalFx and then the addition of Omnition and how we can deal with Apache Pulsar and Streamlio for DSP is the viral nature, the complexity of this next-generation development environment. You think public cloud makes it simple. In some sense, it does, but it also provides a lot of optionality and a ton of complexity as everything becomes ephemeral and short-lived potentially, creates a lot of streaming issues and a lot of potential noise.And we feel that the split, that ultimately, any company that is successful in that arena is going to get to volume and insight demands that someone like Splunk and the portfolio we have is geared to be able to handle. Tens to hundreds of teams trying to interoperate together, hundreds of terabytes to petabytes of data on a continuous streaming basis, that's a very, very challenging environment to actually operate effectively in. And we've distinguished ourselves through the years as being easy to use, but go to the corner case of scale and performance. And that's a key component of what we've been evaluating, thinking through and driving our observability platform around. And Tim, you probably can add better color than that high-level framework. -- Yeah. Doug mentioned the fact that we took a survey of the landscape and sort of looked at all the traditional vendors. And one of the reasons I'm so confident and really excited about what we have is, I think we've built the world's most scalable observability platform after buying SignalFx. And what we did is, we then took on the Omnition and built what I saw as being the best tracing product in the entire world. It's just far more easier to use as I sort of indicated on one of the earlier questions.And so what we did is we took what I saw has been the best metrics and traces solutions in the world and married it together with what's already the best logging platform, which is us. Obviously, that's Splunk. And so I think those three together are just a fantastic recipe for that DevOps user who wants an integrated solution, and that's certainly what we're laser-focused on for the next further months here, is making sure that metrics and traces, which is already part of SignalFx, come together with Splunk. And that's my number one focus.And then the last thing is, I just -- you probably heard me at other places talk about the consumerization of the enterprise. I'm just really excited about what we're doing on the user interface front and making these products easier to use and much more consumable and adding mobility to the equation as much as possible. That piece to me is really, really important for the DevOps or DevSecOps user in the future. They're going to want to sort of be on the top of all that, wherever they are, whenever they want. And so, that combination of the platform, the scale and just the user interface, I just think, makes it an unbeatable equation. -- On the cash flow question. Okay. So let me just kind of break it down into three pieces. First, I'd say, you mentioned 606. So 606 doesn't have any impact on cash. It's just on the revenue recognition. And that's why I tried to talk about absolute dollars and not as a percentage of revenue. So to try to just keep those apart. I would say, second, if you look at inflow, inflow is going to be -- of course, was driven by the change to this ratable billing approach, which we really have been moving a little bit, but we kind of completed that move in earnest middle of this year. And so while that is not necessarily a huge percentage going from, what, last quarter was 58% to 33%, when you're growing, those percentages make a significant difference.Then I would say that ties to the second point, which is -- or part of the second point, which is, we also have an increased amount of ramping bills. So a lot of the big deals that we're doing, because they're paying on either ingestion or vCPU, they want to pay as they're utilizing. They will pay a smaller amount in year one and then bigger in year two and then bigger in year three. And so when you add that on top of going to ratable billing, it pushes more cash out. It takes a little longer for this transition to work itself through.And then the very last piece, I'd say, the third piece is outflows. Our outflows are going to continue where they've been. And that is, while we are growing our OpEx, we've been growing it less than revenue, we are going to still continue to grow in a relatively aggressive fashion as we invest into further technology, as Tim and Doug have talked a lot about on the call, as well as, of course, building out the go-to-market function to be able to sell all those technologies.So the fact that we're not cutting back on OpEx to try to show cash earlier. So that's why it really will take us three years to get to the cycle. But when we come out, we will have stronger cash flow that we've ever had, more than three times, one of our best years been in the past. -- Thank you so much. Very clear. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Kash.Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Yes. Thank you. I'll add my congrats. Jason, you had mentioned several mid eight figure orders with government agencies. I just wanted to clarify. I'm assuming those are, for instance, $50 million total contract value over three, four, five years. And am I interpreting that -- part of that correctly? Or is that inaccurate? -- That's the -- no, they're not that big. I mean they're -- when we say mid eight figure, not mid- between eight and nine. But no, so they're definitely, I would say, closer to the $10 million to $20-ish million range rather than the $50 million range. -- Okay. That's great. Thank you for clarifying. The second question is I'm -- I guess I'm a little surprised you're guiding ARR growth to the mid-40s. Next fiscal year, I would have guessed maybe you'd start out something closer to 30% just because it's such a big number, and you're guiding that five quarters out. So I'm just curious, are you seeing something unusual in the pipeline, or is it being lifted? Is that forecast being lifted a bit by this public sector performance? Or is there something else going on that's kind of providing you that level of confidence going out that far? -- Well, no, it's just very strong growth. And the way ARR works is it's a kind of a layer cake, if you will, of -- for us, our average duration is about three years. So you have the contracts we sold this year, what we sold a year ago and what we sold two years ago. And so we know that, next year, roughly about two-thirds is going to be sold going into next year. And we also feel good about what is going to happen next year. And so that actually gives us pretty good confidence into the pipeline and the ramp that we expect to see next year.So yes, so I appreciate that the numbers are large. But it's really -- I mean, honestly, it's just the business has been performing extremely well for quite a while. And I think my -- I've only been here six months, but my view would be, there hasn't maybe been complete understanding. And I think maybe 606 made it a little confusing since you're pulling forward the license revenue on-prem, and so it made it hard to figure out what was really kind of the annual consumption. And so hopefully, this will provide a better view for just how strong we have been performing and how strong we expect to continue performing. -- Okay. Well said. Thank you very much. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Mark.Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Good evening. It's maybe a question for Doug and Jason together. On the amount of business that's still on maintenance, you talked about -- and Tim had mentioned this in terms of migrating over to Term or Cloud. How much of a contributor to ARR is that? Is that a meaningful driver for that ARR growth? And just to come back, I think you said that it was three times. Did you mean that's three times like you go from 25 in maintenance, to 75 in annual ARR? -- You want -- sorry, I was confused at the very beginning of the question. -- So I just want to know if the migrations from maintenance to Term or Cloud is part of that driver for ARR. -- Got it. Got it. Yeah. So that's what I thought you're saying. I want to make sure it's in the same page. So why I think Jason is leading with that 5% number is there could easily be a perception that, that strong ARR growth was us just converting our perpetual contracts to term contracts and not expanding our footprint within accounts, not forming new use cases and not forming new customers. And that -- of the ARR number, only 5% of our perpetual customers have transitioned off of perpetual into term.And for me, just going back to what Jason just said and as a response to, I think, Kash's question, that's the indicator of the core strength of the underlying business. We are continuing to help our customers find new use cases, penetrate new departments and continue to ensure that the new customers we bring on have that same great cohort analysis that we've seen. And I think that's why he leaned in on that number to make sure that people were not confused or that they got the purity of that ARR number. -- Right. That's exactly right. Doug gets it. Yeah. No, I guess I would add to the -- I mean if you kind of break down the $1.45 billion -- roughly $1.45 billion, and we said about $369 million of it is cloud, the remaining 1 point -- kind of $1-ish billion or so of that, about 35% of it or so is maintenance. And so -- and then a portion of that is term and a portion of that is perpetual. So there's -- I don't know if that helps kind of provide the magnitude, but that's how it breaks down. -- Okay. And then, Doug, when the customers that have seen the new -- that have adopted new pricing, I know it's early stage, but do we have some sense for the elasticity there? In other words, when we're going to what's essentially a lower unit price, is that driving more consumption such that you're getting an increase in total contract value? -- Yes. It's a good question. So the way that our price curve has always worked is the higher volume you get, the lower per-gigabyte fee there is. And what we've done with a banded pricing versus infrastructure pricing is really extend that curve out much more visibly all the way to an unlimited framework. So there's always been an advantage to continue more data. What we -- the key thing with the banding was, term helped people feel like it was more affordable because we were stretching out payments basically for higher volumes over three years. So we saw, as we converted from perp to term, people are now feeling more comfortable moving from 100 gig to 500 gig.I think what the banding does, and that's just a figurative example, I think the banding does is make you feel more comfortable to go from 1 terabyte to 20 terabytes, which correlates back to the volume of data and the volume of use cases that are out there. So that what I have seen with the -- not -- it's not prolific yet, so we have few data points, probably less than 50 customers total that have converted to either infrastructure or the new predictive price framework, is that a lot like our cohort as they consume in a new way, they are dramatically increasing their footprint with Splunk. I haven't seen anyone stay flat or go down yet. -- Great. Thanks. -- Thanks, Michael.Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks very much. The first question I'll throw out there is on the RPO side. Both the current and the total RPO had a pretty meaningful snapback. And I just wanted to see if there's anything you wanted to call out. And/or is there anything that we should be thinking about for both RPOs as we think about Q4? -- I'll take that. This is Jason. I would say the -- well, RPO, at 42%, RPO bookings at 42% up versus 17% prior period -- or I'm sorry, 19% total of 17% current RPO bookings. On the 19%, remember, that was roughly 400 basis points of this kind of onetime impact, so it was really more like 23%. This quarter, at 42%, if you took out SignalFX, which we acquired last quarter and therefore consolidated into RPO, that would have taken it down to about 35% on RPO bookings.Now still very strong growth and still a pretty significant acceleration from last quarter. The one thing about RPO bookings. It is what we're selling within the quarter. We're now so -- we have a lot of large deals. We talked about the eight figure deals. Those can move -- just one or two deals that shifted one quarter versus the next can cause some lumpiness in RPO bookings. And that's why I think it's a good number to look at, but not to overreact too much one way or the other. That is why I really like ARR as the durable growth metric that is going to even out some of that volatility that you'll see with RPO bookings. -- Okay. Fair enough. And thank you. Doug, the last one for me for you is similar to the previous question. But as you've gotten more data, what do you think the impact on the pricing changes are to Splunk? Because in many ways, if you're going from consumption to core, they are highly correlated. And have you had any more incremental thoughts, not even out talking to customers about what your opportunities to upsell are during this process of transition or potential transition, I should say? -- Yeah. I think that upsell motion really did start two years ago, that the Splunk Enterprise indexing upsell motions started two years ago when we leaned in much more aggressively with Term and Cloud, again, because the ease of expansion, I think, went up. First of all, we have a perpetual motion. What I've seen consistently in all of my customer conversations is -- which is, again, why I think there's been so much sensitivity around the volume, data volume-based pricing, is that there is so much opportunity and appetite for data out there.Now the interesting thing about the portfolio. So there's a very purposeful pricing to make it easier for people to get very high volumes of data in the index and not feel like they were out of control on the costs that will go with it. But what's interesting about the portfolio and what Tim and I have been talking about for two years now is the data at rest and the index is really important and very valuable. But it's got to be complemented by -- if you want to be a Data-to-Everything platform, you need the complement of being able to add value to streaming data and being able to go after a wide variety of data at rest and not just data that has to be in the Splunk index. And then you add in the automation orchestration response capabilities, so that act pillar that centered around the Phantom acquisition.And that, really, when I think out the next two, three years, the activity of expansion of Splunk Enterprise index is awesome, and our reps are doing a really good job there. And I think there's a lot of value for customers when that happens. And then we begin to add in DSP, DFS, orchestration, automation and then some of the apps on top, like the developer portfolio with SignalFx, Omnition, et cetera, revamped ITSI, the Mission Control, plus CS, plus Phantom, plus UBA. That's really the multiproduct, high-attached, continued growth lever journey that we are looking forward to and you guys should be taking a look at as well. -- Okay. Thanks, Doug. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you, and congrats on the nice quarter. I just wanted to ask you a question on, I guess, international revenue looked like it modestly decelerated. Was that just Brexit-related? Or were there any execution issues in the region? -- It's the major -- the major driver of that was the overperformance of public sector, which is, for us, that we have -- we sold to governments around the world. That public sector number is the US government and which those goes back into the US number versus international.And then we are very focused on continued execution capability and cadence internationally, both in EMEA and APAC. And as we've all talked about in that mid to high 20s, there's no reason that can't be mid to high 30s or mid to high 40s. So there's a lot of work that we've got to do to make sure that, that happens. But the opportunity across the rest of the world is that data is a neutral player. Governments, commercial organizations, companies located in every country need to take advantage of data. So there is ample opportunity. Everywhere we set them, we've got to make sure that we can pursue that effectively. -- Okay. And then last one for me. Obviously, current RPO was very strong. And I know you get a lot of eight figure deals, but the new logo adds, I guess, were down on a year-over-year basis. And given your sales capacity is likely higher now versus last year, I was wondering why would that be down and whether that might be attributable to your licensing changes you announced? Thanks. -- I don't think it's attributable to licensing changes. It's obviously something that we've been very focused on, and we have -- and as I've talked about, I'm frustrated by how stubborn it -- that metric is. We have not seen the exponential growth that we know exists. What Susan and Christian, her global head of sales and I keep circling around is, there's so much opportunity within the accounts where there's clear momentum, that on a time and attention basis, so reps would end up spending much more time there than they do prospecting. We did carve out in that new team. Those -- they have been here for two quarters now, two plus quarters. They're starting to get ramped. We are doing a whole multitude of different acts, including portfolio enhancements, easier consumption through cloud, et cetera, to move that number. But I don't think there's nothing that any of us can find that's foundational other than time and attention and some of the deliveries that we've been focused on that will eventually go there. -- Okay. Nice job. -- Thank you.And our final question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Okay. Thanks very much. Do you mind just updating us where you are in the process? I know it's still very early, but the process of integrating SignalFx, do you plan to bring to market a fully integrated solution when you start to try to cross-sell that with the existing log products? Just curious on any updates there. Thanks. -- Yeah. This is Tim. So in the short term, what you're going to see is we're taking the Omnition acquisition and folding it directly into the SignalFx user experience. And so you're going to see a combined metrics and traces product in the observability suite in a very short term here, early -- sometime in Q1. And then the sort of advancements around pulling together the rest of logs from Splunk with the rest of the observability suite will be sometime in middle of next year. That being said, that would be the collapsed user interface. We will already be there with the linking between the two. So you're just a link click away from really going back and forth between the two products. -- Okay. Great. Thanks very much. -- Thanks, Chris.Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Ken Tinsley for any closing remarks. -- Great. Thank you, Catherine. I appreciate your help today.

Investors are eager to put the uncertainty surrounding trade between the U.S. and China in the rearview mirror.White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said that the two countries are \u201cgetting close\u201d to reaching a trade deal. \u201cIt\u2019s not done yet, but there has been very good progress and the talks have been very constructive,\u201d Kudlow said on Friday at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations. That was enough to send the Dow up 222 points. His comments came after reports earlier this week suggested both sides were struggling with some of the terms in the phase-one agreement.The market decided to ignore the fact that Kudlow has made that type of proclamation before. On Friday the Dow added 222.93 points, or 0.80%, to close at 28,004.89, its highest close of the year. This was the blue-chip index\u2019s eleventh record close of the year and its first 1,000-point milestone since July. The S&P 500 jumped 0.77% to end Friday\u2019s session at 3,120.46. Notably, this was S&P 500\u2019s sixth straight week of gains, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which notched its seventh straight week of gains, added 0.73% to 8,540.83.Some analysts are skeptical, however. \u201cWe quickly went from the consensus thinking we were on the cusp of recession and investors being very, very cautious, buying up the quintessential safe havens, to a much more risk-on, bullish economic view,\u201d said Douglas Cohen, portfolio manager at Athena Capital Advisors, in a\u00a0\u00a0interview. \u201cIn the short term, that\u2019s gone a bit too far and sets us up for at least a pause, and my guess is in 2020 sentiment will start to become more fragile and volatile.\u201dIn other words, for these gains to continue into next week, investors will want to see further signs of progress on the U.S.-China trade front, which can come as early as Monday. Analysts will also want the strong Q3 earnings, which we have seen so far, continue as more retailers and techs are set to report their results. Here are this week\u2019s stocks to keep an eye on.Wall Street expects Bilibili to lose 14 cents per share on revenue of $248.77 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when it lost 11 cents per share on revenue of $150.28 million.What to watch: Shares of the Chinese video sharing website, which has risen just 14% year to date, compared with the 24% rise in the S&P 500 index, has not performed as well as investors expected. While the company only does business in China and has suffered amid the recent trade tension, Bilibili has demonstrated a potent combination of growing its user base and keeping them engaged for long periods of time. What\u2019s more, there is now speculation the company can become profitable in a much quicker timeframe than analysts anticipated. The management on Monday will need to outline its path towards profitability and sustained revenue growth to re-energize investors.Wall Street expects Home Depot to earn $2.52 per share on revenue of $27.52 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $2.51 per share on revenue of $26.3 billion.What to watch: The home improvement giant has established a strong track record for beating consensus estimates, while profits have topped analysts\u2019 forecast during every quarter over the past five years. While it\u2019s true, home-price growth has slowed for the last several months as existing home sales has also moderated, Home Depot should still benefit from the from\u00a0increased spending from Millennials as well as from the investments it has made in technology and fulfillment. With the stock up nearly 40% year to date, analysts on Tuesday will focus on the extent to which Home Depot can deliver not only strong same-store sales growth, but also positive guidance.Wall Street expects Target to earn $1.19 per share on revenue of $18.48 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.09 per share on revenue of $17.59 billion.What to watch: The consumer is strong and remains the driving force of the U.S. economy. Just as important, big-box retail is not dead, as evidenced by the\u00a0\u00a0and forecasts just delivered from Walmart. Aside from the impressive bottom line beat, Walmart raised its full-year same-store sales forecast in the U.S., affirming the level of confidence it has despite concerns about trade war. Can Target keep up the pace? Target has been one of the better performers in the retail sector, with its shares up 70% year to date, thanks to the company\u2019s e-commerce initiatives. It will need strong top- and bottom-line results, solid digital growth and upside holiday quarter guidance to keep Wall Street excited.Wall Street expects Intuit to earn 25 cents per share on revenue of $1.12 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 29 cents per share on revenue of $1.01 billion.What to watch: Quickbooks' parent company Intuit has seen its stock climb nearly 50% this year and growth doesn't appear to be slowing down. Intuit's fourth quarter revenues grew 15% over the year to $994 million, topping Street expectations of $961 million. The company is benefiting from 33% growth in subscribers for QuickBooks Online, which drove 16% growth in Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenues. The company\u2019s guidance calls for Small Business revenue to grow in a range of 12% to 14%, while Consumer revenue is to grow between 9% and 10%. Will this be enough to drive the stock, which has risen 35% year to date, even higher?Wall Street expects Splunk to earn 54 cents per share on revenue of $604.24 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 38 cents per share on revenue of $480.98 million.What to watch: The machine data analytics company has seen its stock price fall about 12% over the past six months. While the company understands customer behavior and can assess online end-to-end business transactions and deliver strong revenue growth, investors have shifted their focus on the company\u2019s tough comparisons from last year\u2019s fourth quarter, making its Q4 guidance even more important. In Q2 Splunk acquired SaaS cloud monitoring company SignalFx for about $1.05 billion in cash and stock. Analysts will want to know how the company plans to integrate this deal.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Over the next 12 months, almost 80% of companies who employ a chief information officer expect to increase their use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to further their corporate goals.\u00a0According to Fortune, , and none expected to scale back their use of artificial intelligence.\u00a0\u201cAs a whole there are massive opportunities to adopt new [A.I.] technologies,\u201d Ronell Hugh, the product marketing lead for (NASDAQ:)\u00a0Experience Platform, told Fortune. \u201cCloud infrastructure was a first step, now there is a lot of innovation in AI and how to use data in real-time for your business.\u201d\u00a0We\u2019re not just talking about the Amazons (NASDAQ:) of the world.

Splunk does. That\u2019s because it uses AI and machine learning to help businesses cut to the chase.InvestorPlace\u2019s Tom Taulli recently sat down with Splunk CEO Doug Merritt to discuss the company\u2019s strategy. Merritt threw Taulli a curveball, suggesting that . What Merritt was trying to point out is that many forms of artificial intelligence exist, but they don\u2019t tie into one neat package.\u00a0\u00a0Splunk happens to focus on machine learning. Other companies, as Taulli suggests, focus on deep learning, natural language processing, and so many different forms of AI.\u00a0Merritt believes that all of these forms of AI could operate as one within 50-100 years.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, Splunk shareholders should be satisfied with what it\u2019s doing to help customers like Nubank, a Latin American financial technology company, manage its reams of data in a simplified and efficient manner.\u00a0Splunk went public in 2012 at $17.

That engineer can then use an AI algorithm to detect a surgeon\u2019s pre-operative preferences based on their history.\u00a0By using AI to come up with a surgical plan, surgeons can reduce the number of corrections that need to be made to the plan before surgery.\u00a0\u201cAI works by learning how to solve problems without being explicitly programmed on how to do so,\u201d . \u201cWe saw this could be useful for planning total knee arthroplasties (TKA), in which sections of the knee joint are replaced by metal implants to help patients suffering from osteoarthritis.\u201d\u00a0As Materialise continues to grow around the world, not to mention become more profitable, shareholders will see its share price rise to $20 and beyond.\u00a0You can thank AI later.\u00a0\u00a0\tMicrosoft (NASDAQ:) announced Nov. 13 that Harry Shum, the head of the artificial intelligence and research group, was .

While they were good,  for the fourth quarter didn\u2019t quite meet analyst expectations, sending TWLO stock down 15% on the news.\u00a0It has since regained most of those losses, but is still well off its 52-week high of $151, a price it hit in late July.\u00a0A couple of days before Twilio reported its earnings I suggested  to take advantage of its post-earnings pop. In hindsight, we know such a pop didn\u2019t occur. One of the reasons for its failure to launch was its dollar-based net expansion rate. Analysts were expecting 138% growth. Twilio delivered 132% growth.\u00a0Long-term investors shouldn\u2019t fret about the third-quarter results. Long term, TWLO stock is a winner. A big reason why it will win has to do with artificial intelligence and the way it\u2019s able to use bots and interactive voice response systems to help companies communicate with their customers more effectively.\u00a0The number of industries that can benefit from Twilio\u2019s application of AI is seemingly endless.\u00a0That\u2019s what makes .\tIn a 2018 Wired article, Pinterest\u2019s (NYSE:) former CTO Vanja Josifovski suggested that \u201cat its core, .\u201d\u00a0Although Josifovski moved on in March 2019, I\u2019m sure the social media platform\u2019s relatively new head of engineering, Jeremy King, would agree with the sentiment.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Big data analytics platform  (NASDAQ:) is set to report third-quarter earnings after the bell Nov. 21. For a variety of reasons including sustained big data market tailwinds, recovering business confidence and Splunk\u2019s new Data-to-Everything model, I think those numbers will be pretty good.\tAlso for a variety of reasons \u2014 including that shares appear fundamentally undervalued here and haven\u2019t gone anywhere since the last earnings report \u2014 I think those good numbers will spark a nice post-earnings rally in SPLK stock toward $140.The investment implication? Buy SPLK stock ahead of earnings.Here\u2019s a deeper look.Splunk\u2019s third-quarter earnings should be good for a variety reasons.First, big data market tailwinds remain alive and well, and that should provide nice support for Splunk\u2019s business. Splunk is in the game of turning data into actionable insights. Further, it is the best in the game at doing this today. Thus, so long as demand for turning data into insights remains robust, Splunk\u2019s numbers should remain good.At present, it appears that demand for doing this is as robust as ever. Simply consider that  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) acquired  (NYSE:) recently almost purely for data, or that  to prep for matches or that the real estate industry is similarly  to become more efficient.Second, business sentiment is recovering, and this recovery should provide a boost for Splunk. In a nutshell, Splunk sells big data solutions to businesses. Thus, when business confidence is low, Splunk\u2019s customers aren\u2019t spending as much. When business confidence is high, Splunk\u2019s customers are spending a lot.Right now, we appear to be transitioning from an era of low confidence to high confidence, thanks to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and an improving global economic outlook. This transition should provide healthy tailwinds for Splunk both today, and for the foreseeable future.Third, Splunk\u2019s recently launched Data-to-Everything model is likely seeing healthy early adoption, mostly because it is the first platform of its kind serving a valuable purpose and equipped with a unique and personalized pricing model.As investors know, good earnings don\u2019t necessarily equal a post-earnings rally. But, in SPLK\u2019s case, good third-quarter numbers should lead to a nice rally in SPLK stock.SPLK stock hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since its last earnings report. Meanwhile, the  has roared to all-time highs. This relative underperformance means that sentiment isn\u2019t overly bullish on SPLK stock. Instead, it\u2019s rather bearish, and this means there is plenty of dry powder for sentiment to improve and drive a nice post-earnings rally in the event that Splunk\u2019s numbers are good.Also of note, SPLK stock appears fundamentally undervalued heading into the print. You can go through my numbers in-depth . But, the big idea is that thanks to the reality that data is the future of everything and Splunk is at the frontier of the business data analytics movement, Splunk reasonably projects as a 20%-plus revenue grower over the next several years. Further, this is a high gross margin business with plenty of room for positive operating leverage, so profit margins have visible runway to increase by a considerable amount.Modeling that out, Splunk has a realistic opportunity to hit $6 in earnings per share by fiscal 2025. Based on a 10% discount rate and a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 35, which is the average for application software companies, that equates to a fiscal 2020 price target for SPLK stock of over $140.SPLK stock is a long-term winner that is going through some near-term turbulence. A strong third-quarter earnings report which confirms that the company\u2019s new Data-to-Everything platform is gaining traction could put an end to this era of near-term turbulence.If it does, then SPLK stock has runway to $140-plus prices in the wake of its third-quarter earnings report.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SPLK.\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["\u00a0 shares have struggled since August, falling 30% from the stock's all-time high of approximately $205. The marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) software company's latest dip followed its Nov. 5 announcement of its Q3 earnings, despite reporting a 33% revenue increase and results that exceeded analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company forecasted $181 million in revenue and earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.42 for Q4. Analysts were expecting $0.44 earnings per share for the next quarter, which caused some weakness.These were mostly positive results that were a pleasant surprise and\u00a0, which has averaged 41.2% over the past three years. Even the perceived bad news was relatively modest. In an\u00a0, company management discussed some delays in hiring and the future effects of annualizing price increases in late 2018. Both are minor, known issues that the company is addressing. Even the disappointing Q4 forecast is only modestly lower than analysts' expectations, and it represents the shortest possible time frame for forecast results.\u00a0Image Source: HubspotIt's easy to label the stock's slide as an overreaction that departs from its past performance. But it could very well be a predictable, deeper issue that's inherent in growth stocks \u2014 aggressive valuations and high expectations are more sensitive to bad news and market downturns.\u00a0Hubspot carries a forward price-to-adjusted-earnings ratio of 88.5, which is exceptionally high.\u00a0Even adjusting for bullish growth outlooks, the stock still has a 2.05\u00a0\u00a0ratio. It also trades at more than 80 times its free cash flow\u00a0and nearly ten times its book value. The company has operating losses, negative\u00a0, and does not pay a dividend, so it can't even be evaluated on metrics related to those fundamentals.\u00a0These figures are noteworthy compared to other large application software companies, such as\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0, that have much more modest growth outlooks and correspondingly modest P/E and PEG ratios.\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0may be noteworthy examples of comparable enterprises with similar growth trajectories and cheaper valuations, but these companies also have different capital structures and solve different problems than CRM and marketing software firms.\u00a0However, Hubspot's valuation seems more reasonable when it's compared directly to competitors with similar growth outlooks, such as  and\u00a0\u00a0, which have forward P/E ratios of 52.6 and 131.5, respectively. Along with those two,\u00a0\u00a0 has a PEG ratio above 2.5. To gain exposure to enterprise software companies with Hubspot's growth outlook, investors should generally expect to pay a premium that's at least as high as Hubspot's.On a growth adjusted basis, Hubspot might very well be the most attractive valuation in its niche. However, this valuation assumes continued exceptional growth for the CRM and marketing software industry as a whole, with Hubspot maintaining or even growing its share. It's a crowded marketplace with dozens of formidable smaller niche players, as well as giants like\u00a0,\u00a0,\u00a0, and\u00a0. All of these companies offer solutions that compete directly with Hubspot's\u00a0.It is hard to claim that salesforce.com and Zendesk are clear, superior substitutes, but there are cheaper, broader application software names at both the high and low end of the growth spectrum. Hubspot bulls are betting on the company's outperformance in a very competitive landscape, as well as the sustained explosion of marketing software. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that conviction, but this stock has clearly demonstrated the downside volatility risk that will creep into the picture if growth outlook sours or market conditions deteriorate. Shareholders should be aware of that risk.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Management also expressed its confidence in reaching $1 billion of revenue by 2023. But significant uncertainties remain on the way to this ambitious goal.Over the last several years, New Relic's strong revenue growth was due to its application performance monitoring (APM) solution. However, the company's year-over-year revenue growth has been decelerating from 113% in 2014 to 27% over the last quarter. The higher revenue base explains a part of this growth deceleration, but intensifying competition also contributed to the negative trend. For instance, rival   has developed an integrated broader monitoring offering that includes logging and infrastructure monitoring in addition to APM capabilities.In May, New Relic released its New Relic One platform to catch up with its competitors. The platform integrates the three key monitoring components (infrastructure, logging, and application), and its programmability allows customers to develop their applications based on New Relic's solution.As a result, fiscal second-quarter revenue increased to $145.8 million, up 27% year over year and above the high end of management's guidance range. Besides the contribution from new customers, the increase in dollar-based net expansion rate from 109% during the previous quarter to 112% indicates existing customers' consumption of New Relic's products is increasing faster than the previous quarter, which was not the case one quarter ago.Image source: Getty Images.With the strong second-quarter results, management indicated the company would reach the symbolic threshold of $1 billion of annual sales in 2023, which corresponds to 19.2% annual revenue growth, based on the midpoint of the fiscal 2020 revenue guidance range of $590.5 million.This multiyear revenue forecast seems strong, but it remains below the revenue growth some competitors have been reporting. For instance, during their latest quarters, Datadog and  grew their revenue by 82.2% and 58.4%, respectively, compared to the year before. Given its much lower revenue growth, New Relic is unlikely to gain market share against these competitors even if their revenue growth decelerates over the next several years.Besides, New Relic's competitors aren't idling. For example, Elastic announced last month its expansion into the endpoint security market, and  entered the APM market in August with its acquisition of SignalFx.Also, New Relic's improved net expansion rate of 112% compared to the previous quarter still pales in comparison to its competitors. Elastic and Datadog have reported expansion rates above 130%, which indicates New Relic is not capturing the full growth potential from its existing customers.In addition, New Relic's fiscal second-quarter  -- a leading indicator of revenue -- came in below expectations, up 22% year over year but down 9% sequentially. During the , management explained some customers were reluctant to pay one year in advance for the company's services, which contrasts with previous three-year contracts. Despite management's confidence in retaining these customers anyway, this development reduces incentives for them to stick to New Relic's solutions.Based on the last 12 months, New Relic's -to-sales ratio of 6.6 seems low compared to Elastic's and Datadog's ratios of 17.3 and 36.7, respectively.Even taking into account New Relic's lower revenue growth, the company looks cheap compared to its competitors. Yet given its challenges, investing in this  at this price remains risky. Besides, the company has yet to post a profit under generally accepted accounting principles (). And during the last quarter, its GAAP losses increased from $5.5 million one year ago to $16.9 million because of its increasing sales and marketing and research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue.Management will provide more details about the company's long-term potential during its analyst and investor day on Dec. 12.

It has since been updated and republished.]Slow and steady wins the race, as the old adage goes. But slow and steady can be a bit boring. Investors looking for stocks to buy, as a rule, should focus on high-quality, and preferably, lower-risk issues.Still, there\u2019s room in any investor\u2019s portfolio for higher-risk, higher-reward plays \u2014 as long as those risks are understood.In that vein, here are nine stocks to buy that offer potentially significant rewards \u2026 and almost as much risk. None of these stocks should be a core part of a portfolio, and all have the potential to blow up in your face.But\u00a0taking those risks also creates the possibility of a major reward.

Teva has too much debt and too little growth. Its key drug, Copaxone, which treats multiple sclerosis, is facing generic competition from \u00a0(NASDAQ:), among others.Bankruptcy likely isn\u2019t a near-term scenario but the current trajectory suggests it could occur down the line. In short, TEVA is a classic contrarian, \u201cbuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d type of play. And there are reasons TEVA is one of these great (if risky) stocks to buy.While pressure has persisted on generic drugs, but it won\u2019t last forever.The company has sold assets to clean up its balance sheet, which has de-risked the story somewhat. In my opinion, Teva is a better version of Valeant, but with an easier path back to normalcy.It\u2019s a risky path, but if it works TEVA\u00a0could gain another 20%-plus simply by reaching a higher multiple and removing bankruptcy fears.The story already has played out somewhat at \u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is up 45% so far this year.

But that changed in quick succession.SciGames acquired slot machine manufacturers WMS Industries and Bally Technologies, the latter coming only months after Bally bought equipment maker and gaming table designer Shuffle Master. Scientific Games became the dominant supplier to the casino industry worldwide: a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for casino floors.It also became one of the most indebted companies in the U.S. markets and still is. The combination of that debt and careful cost controls at casinos, particularly in the U.S., kept SGMS stock below $20 to start the year.But it now looks like the long-awaited \u201creplacement cycle\u201d of slot machines is arriving and that could be hugely beneficial for Scientific Games and its smaller, similar rival  (NYSE:). And considering how much leverage is still on the balance sheet, there\u2019s a case for SGMS to clear $100 \u2014 yes, $100 \u2014 if its profit growth accelerates.That\u2019s not a guarantee, obviously, but\u00a0it\u2019s the nature of highly indebted companies.

But there\u2019s a reason for investors to hold long-term optimism toward the company\u2019s pipeline.

Amid that mess,  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:), and  (NYSE:) have come under pressure, too. The .So what does that make Splunk stock?While Splunk stock is getting caught up in the selloff, it\u2019s worth noting that its  as other tech stocks. While many of the names getting hit have price-to-sales (P/S) ratios north of 20, SPLK stock does not. Shares trade at roughly 7.9 times this year\u2019s revenue estimates.Analysts expect sales to grow 28.3% this year to $2.31 billion. In calendar year 2020, estimates call for the growth rate to slow to about 22%, but that still equates to more than $2.8 billion in revenue.On the earnings front, analysts expect 43.5% growth this year to $1.91 per share. Admittedly, estimates for fiscal year 2021 do call for a slowing growth rate. However, they still expect earnings to grow 24.5% to $2.38 per share.Estimates are just that \u2014 estimates. They can be wrong. They can be adjusted higher or lower depending on how the company does. For Splunk stock, 7.9 times this year\u2019s sales and 58 times this year\u2019s earnings may not be cheap compared to  (NYSE:) or  (NYSE:). That said, these companies are not growing revenue at more than 25% or earnings at more than 40%.SPLK stock does have about $1.67 billion in long-term debt that it added to its balance sheet this year. That\u2019s roughly in-line with its cash holdings and about 65% of its cash and short-term investments.While Splunk does have positive FCF (and had decent growth), it will actually generate a FCF deficit this year due to a change in its billing process. Because of the way SPLK is now invoicing, the cash isn\u2019t received in the same manner as before. That\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s not the same as being FCF negative as a business.Splunk stock has been under constant pressure since topping out in late July. Since then, it has put in a series of lower highs, highlighted by purple arrows on the chart. It also has very well-defined support and resistance.Range resistance has come into play near $140, which has been in place for months. Range support is down near $107. The way I see the charts, Splunk stock has a few major downside zones.The first is range support near $107 and the 38.2% retracement at $106.61. Below that zone and the 2019 low of $99.49 is on the table. Just below that mark is the 23.6% retracement at $97.95. The fear is that, should range support fail to hold, SPLK stock will go on to make new 2019 lows.Should both zones give way \u2014 the $107 and $99 areas \u2014 then the last zone of support is near $90. This is where SPLK stock put in a triple bottom in Q4 2018.Just because we\u2019re mapping out these potential downside targets, doesn\u2019t mean Splunk stock will fall that far. But it\u2019s something investors should consider being a possibility.On the upside, I would love to see Splunk stock start to put in a series of higher lows off of this range support area. Back over the 200-day would be ideal, although that\u2019s a fair bit further from here. If range support holds, aggressive investors interested in the stock can start to get long.Otherwise, some investors will feel more comfortable either waiting for lower prices or for cleaner price action. Given the FCF change and the fact that it\u2019s caught up in a cloud selloff, it\u2019s hard to disagree with those that prefer to wait.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter .

Its revenue increased 41% in fiscal 2017 and jumped 38%+ in the following two years. Its sales are expected to\u00a0 increase roughly 28% in FY20.Meanwhile, as noted earlier, SPLK stock has stalled out, trading sideways for the last 13+ months. That performance, combined with the company\u2019s revenue and profit growth, has caused the multiples of Splunk stock to fall. And bulls would argue that some of the relative weakness has come from a misunderstanding surrounding the company\u2019s cash flow guidance.After all, Splunk stock fell after its Q2 results partly because of its cash flow guidance. Splunk\u2019s guidance went from $250 million to -$300 million, a seemingly huge change. But bulls would argue that the shift was caused by the company\u2019s transition to a subscription model. That transition creates uneven sales growth, meaning the guidance change indicates little, if any, alteration of Splunk\u2019s long-term cash flow.That guidance overshadowed a strong report, as SPLK\u2019s software revenue jumped 46% year-over-year. The bull case is that the company\u2019s growth outlook remains intact, while short-term concerns have moved SPLK stock to a lower and more attractive valuation.Wall Street analysts seem to agree; their average price target on SPLK stock is about 25% above its current price. Last month, Raymond James said the company\u2019s could boost Splunk stock in the near-term.The bull case on SPLK is intriguing, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see SPLK stock break out at some point. But the shares pose some risks as well.For one, SPLK might well be cheap on a relative basis,\u00a0 but that doesn\u2019t guarantee that the shares will rise. Eight times revenue, even with Splunk\u2019s attractive gross margins, still prices in quite a bit of growth. Moreover,\u00a0 Splunk stock lost about a third of its value during last year\u2019s Q4 stock-market selloff. If the stock market tumbles again, SPLK stock will fall further.The other considerable risk is on the competitive front. Splunk is the leader in log management,\u00a0 but it has some tough competitors.  (NYSE:), for example, offers an open-source ELK Stack which allows customers to build their own log management systems, as opposed to buying them from Splunk. (NASDAQ:), which recently launched its IPO, is another competitor. Datadog offers a unified platform that includes log management, but also infrastructure, cloud, and application-performance monitoring. DDOG is trading at roughly 20 times its revenue, suggesting that investors are bullish on its outlook.Both Datadog and Elastic have posted stronger revenue growth than Splunk of late, although both are doing so from lower revenue bases than SPLK.For software-as-a-service (SaaS) investors, then, SPLK probably is at the top of the list. Its valuation might be questionable, but it is quite attractive relative to what investors have been willing to pay for growth stocks in recent years.But I\u2019m not sure Splunk stock quite gets to the point of being compelling for those investors who aren\u2019t focused on growth stocks.SPLK is facing risks. The shares probably can grow into their forward price-earnings multiple of 40+. But it only takes one earnings miss for competitive risks to move to the forefront of investors\u2019 minds.Given the performance of Splunk stock over the past 12+ months, it does seem worth staying on the sidelines and hoping for a better entry point. SPLK probably is cheap, but it\u2019s a little too cheap. And there are reasons why it could get even cheaper.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t's easy to see the appeal of buying so-called growth stocks, whether they come in the form of disrupting existing markets, taking market share from competitors, or carving out an entirely new niche.But  is easier said than done. So to help you get started, here are three top growth stocks I think investors should consider buying this month.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.  made its name by effectively disrupting the way consumers access valuable real estate data through its websites and apps. But shares of the online real estate platform are down a whopping 42% from their 52-week high as of this writing -- a precipitous drop that mostly came on the heels of Zillow's  in August.The culprit? Zillow handily beat consensus estimates for its top and bottom lines in Q2 -- revenue grew 84% to just under $600 million, or around $15 million above expectations -- but it also offered guidance that left the market hungry for more, driven partly by monetization changes meant to promote  for its core Premier Agents business. Meanwhile, bearish investors are concerned about the high overhead required to fund the rapid ramp of Zillow's new Homes segment and its related Zillow Offers program. After expanding to seven new, large metropolitan markets in Q2, Zillow bought 1,535 homes in the second quarter. But it also technically lost a little more than $2,900 on each of the 786 homes it sold during its most recent three-month period.Nonetheless, Zillow is powering forward toward its longer-term target of buying 5,000 homes per month. Before the benefits of that scale become evident, I think investors should consider taking advantage of Zillow's recent pullback.  stock has similarly fallen hard after each of its past two   -- but I think this is another case of the market getting it wrong. To be sure, Splunk handily beat its guidance on revenue in both quarters, most recently achieving a 33% increase in its top line to $516.6 million.However, Splunk also massively reduced its cash flow guidance, last time calling for  operating cash flow of $300 million for all of fiscal 2020, blaming a combination of a new pricing structure and the significantly faster-than-expected pace of its shift away from perpetual licenses and toward cloud-based, renewable subscriptions. For perspective, while Splunk previously anticipated renewable licenses would account for around 85% of its total by the end of the year, after last quarter it became apparent the figure would be closer to 99%.Make no mistake, while that accelerated shift hurts Splunk's cash collections in the near term, over the longer term it will mean more  as long as Splunk's loyal, growing customer base (it added more than 400 new enterprise customers last quarter alone, including , , and ) maintains its appetite for turning unstructured machine data into actionable intelligence.Finally, consider  , a tiny financial holding company that currently focuses on billboard advertising and surety insurance, though it also has smaller stakes in various businesses including a homebuilder, a regional bank, and a real estate services firm.But perhaps most exciting for investors today is that Boston Omaha follows a similar method for building shareholder value to what Warren Buffett employed with . That connection is no coincidence. In late 2017, Boston Omaha shares rallied after   that one of its co-CEOs is Buffett's grandnephew Alex Buffett Rozek.Of course, the same article was quick to point out the older Buffett does not own Boston Omaha shares and has nothing to do with its daily operations. But the Oracle of Omaha did say he \"think[s] the world of Alex,\" adding that his younger kin has a \"very good mind [and] good values.\"Still, Boston Omaha remains in the earliest stages of its long-term story.  last quarter on a year-over-year basis, to just over $10 million, mostly driven by  and the expansion of its surety insurance operations.With shares trading at a reasonable 1.36 times book value today, I think investors who buy Boston Omaha now could be in for staggering gains as it continues to grow in the coming years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Let me explain.(NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:), (NASDAQ:), , (NYSE:), (NASDAQ:) \u2014 they\u2019re mega-caps which have made their names and impact on businesses and consumers alike with game-changing technologies in recent years. And in our ever-connected and data-driven world, they\u2019re also big-time players influencing these new technologies once considered the stuff of science fiction.With this market area expected to see global spending more than double to over $100 billion in the next several years according to research from , that\u2019s growth investors should be interested in buying. But the buck for big profits in your portfolio shouldn\u2019t stop there when it comes to big data stocks.For investors interested in finding the next big investment within AI, machine learning, and big data stocks, AYX, SPLK and MDB are making their own marks and shaping up for purchase on their price charts.Alteryx is the first of our big data stocks to buy. This software outfit allows business analysts to locate answers amid today\u2019s sea of data that\u2019s at our fingertips. It also helps end-users obtain a visual and contextual understanding of the information. To say the least, AYX stock\u2019s place in big data is important and growing to the tune of more than 50% in year-over-year revenues.With a market capitalization of less than $7.0 billion AYX certainly has the opportunity to grow despite an incredible rally in excess of 600% since going public a couple years back. And now, following a fairly ordinary but much needed corrective pullback of just more than 30%, shares of this big data stock are nearly ready for buying.AYX stock confirmed a weekly chart pivot low this week as shares raced above $113.15. That\u2019s the high of last week\u2019s doji candlestick. With shares signaling an oversold stochastics and having retreated beneath this entry and back inside the reversal pattern, the plan is simple.Buy this big data stock on a second confirmation move through $113.15 as long as the current low remains intact. Set a stop-loss below the pattern and take initial profits at 2x the accepted exposure.Splunk is another lesser-known name with the world of big data stocks that\u2019s on the radar for buying. SPLK stock is an innovator in systems used to analyze machine data and help other companies gain , as well as find solutions in the Internet of Things or IoT.This big data stock has a market cap of nearly $18 billion, sport sales growth of 33% over the past year and a forward P/E of 50. The reasonable pricing for this well-positioned company looks all the more attractive when considering SPLK\u2019s monthly price chart. AYX stock is nearing a confirmed completion of a double-bottom formation. As part of a larger base-on-base, AYX\u2019s current pattern finding support above the 2014 all-time-high and stochastics in oversold territory, there\u2019s plenty of technical evidence for buying this big data stock.Buy SPLK through the September pivot high of $123.76. I\u2019d suggest using a weekly close beneath $110 for containing risk on the downside. And for reeling in exposure on the upside, taking initial profits in-between $145 \u2013 $150 as this big data stock stages a breakout looks appropriate.MongoDB is the last of our big data stocks to buy. This $7.0 billion company is a relational databases provider which meets the needs of today\u2019s complex big data requirements.

With year-over-year quarterly sales growth of nearly 67%, a slightly outsized corrective pullback of 39% supported by an intact weekly trendline and a confirmed bottoming candle, this big data stock is ready to buy today.Buy MDB stock today as shares rest near last month\u2019s high of $132.15. I\u2019d recommend respecting the candlestick low for closing any losses if needed. That amounts to risk of around 15%. It\u2019s a bit more than what I\u2019d accept in larger market leaders.

Nevertheless, even a fast-growing company isn't exempt from stock-market turmoil, and , , and  have all sold off from all-time highs in recent months. Here's why shares in these three stocks could soar higher once again and benefit investors who held on or bought in.The Trade Desk is a cloud-based platform for digital advertising buyers. Rather than the walled garden offered by the likes of 's\u00a0Google, , or even , The Trade Desk's platform allows advertisers to launch campaigns across a range of digital formats and devices and it integrates those campaigns with other data partners and publishers. As far as how it works, think of it as a stock exchange, except advertisers are bidding on and purchasing ad slots targeted at certain demographics, time slots, and digital outlets. \u00a0Image source: Getty Images.This \"programmatic\" type of ad buy accounts for a small fraction (less than 5%) of the over $700 billion global advertising industry. But CEO Jeffrey Green, citing reports from Magna Global, says that programmatic ad spending is expected to grow around 20% in 2019. The Trade Desk also maintains its view that the vast majority of advertising will be digital in the near future, and most of that will be done programmatically -- versus a general campaign that isn't targeted. \u00a0The company's revenue is growing fast -- 42% in the second quarter of 2019, building on a 41% increase in Q1 and a 55% increase in 2018. Those are big numbers, especially for a company tracking to top $500 million in total sales this year. The best could be yet to come, though, as  and music are gaining in momentum and are a leading driver of new business for The Trade Desk. Lots of new services are getting ready to go live, giving this technology outfit a clear outlet to go after new dollars spent on its platform. It's still early in the game for The Trade Desk, and the company is barely free-cash-flow positive (money left after operating and capital expenditures are paid for). It's running at just under $60 million in free cash over the last 12 months. As with the other two companies on this list, though, it's all about maximizing sales right now and worrying about profit later. With business momentum still going strong, picking up this stock after it dropped 34% from its all-time high in late July could pay off big down the road. Instead of reinventing software programs, Twilio allows developers to utilize a cloud-based set of existing apps and other integrative capabilities (an application programming interface, or API). The tools available are geared toward enabling new means of communication via a company's app or website, things like web-based chat and texting, email management, voice calls, and account login authentication. \u00a0While many consumers have never heard of Twilio, it's likely they have  when interacting with a business. That's because Twilio has a big and fast-expanding list of customers that use its platform. Some notable names include , Trulia, Airbnb, and ,\u00a0to name just a few. According to tech researcher IDC, Twilio is the leader in , almost solely responsible for creating the industry since its founding in 2008. That's high praise, but the numbers back it up. Second-quarter 2019 revenue was up a sizzling 86% year over year to $275 million, building on the 63% increase for full-year 2018. That puts the company on track to exceed total sales of $1 billion this year as demand for its next-gen communications capabilities soars. Twilio operates at a loss as it too is maximizing its revenue growth potential and will worry about the bottom line later (free cash flow was negative $56 million over the last 12 months). Twilio has ample cash to fund its expansion, though, reporting $1.88 billion in cash and equivalents on the books at the end of June 2019. Shares are 26% off all-time highs as of this writing. If Twilio's momentum continues, the current slump could be a distant speck in the rear-view mirror. One of the benefits of the new digital economy is the large amounts of available data -- specifically, increased visibility on what's happening with an organization's operations. But having the data is one thing; turning it into an actionable insight is another altogether. That's where data analytics software comes in. It's an industry that has been in the limelight in 2019 thanks, in large part, to a few  made by \u00a0and Google.Splunk is a leader in the space. The software provider helps businesses organize and analyze data that is locked up in old legacy computer systems, as well as newer operations deployed in the cloud. The analytics engine is good for a broad range of uses, from monitoring equipment connected to a network to payment processing activity to coordinating cybersecurity efforts. \u00a0Splunk is the largest company on this data analytics list, hauling in $517 million during Q2. There's still plenty left in the tank, though, as the revenue figure represented 33% year-over-year growth. The company has come under a bit of pressure lately because of its aggressive expansion plan. While free cash flow over the last year is positive $51 million, that number is going to slide into negative territory -- primarily due to  and the company switching to renewable software licensing contracts. The stock is down 17% from its highs in late July and has leveled off a bit in the last year as investors digest the company's recent activity. Thus, with shareholder sentiment lackluster and Splunk making some adjustments for further growth, now looks like a good time to buy in for the long term.

This shift resulted in negative cash flow from operations of $129 million.But when I look at what SPLK is doing to ensure data integrity, specifically as it relates to blockchain technology, I know they\u2019re investing in what promises to be the future of data storage.In the 1980s, the book Megatrends coined a word that continues to define the technologies and trends that transform our lives. One of the megatrends today is big data. In the early 1980s, few people could imagine how the digital revolution would change our lives. Having the ability to do all of our Christmas shopping from a computer was a foreign concept. Having that computer in the palm of our hand was like something from The Jetsons.But those predictions have come true and then some. My local library has become not much more than a Starbucks without a barista. The only patrons I see are using computer workstations to check the internet. It didn\u2019t take long for libraries to adapt to a new reality. All the information found in the encyclopedias and reference materials on their shelves were now available to patrons with just a few keystrokes.But as society has begun to collect volumes of information on our mobile devices, we need a place to store that information, and a place to analyze that data. This is the idea of big data. It\u2019s the idea that technology can replace all the available knowledge if it resides in a single \u201cplace\u201d and if algorithms are written to analyze the data. That place started as huge server farms and is rapidly moving onto the cloud.Splunk is one of many companies in the \u201ccloud computing\u201d space. Splunk estimates that  than in 2009. And that there will be three times the number of connected devices by 2021. But Splunk is taking a bold approach that involves making investments in the future of cloud computing. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about Splunk stock.For all the benefits of big data, there is one overriding concern: how secure is the data? In recent years, data breaches have affected consumer data at institutions we once thought were impenetrable.We traded our personal information for access to information. And we\u2019ve found the hard way that no matter how many times we change our password or correctly identify the pictures that have traffic signs for Captcha, our information is not really secure. And as corporations are looking at their business models, they are ranking security from data tampering as their most relevant threat.But if a company is already working with a third party to house their data, they can find it\u2019s too big to move. And it can also be incredibly expensive to store additional copies. That\u2019s where the blockchain comes in.Blockchain is changing the narrative surrounding artificial intelligence and its effect on big data. Blockchain uses distributive ledger technology to restore data to its originators. Further, it incorporates that data horizontally and inter-operatively across what technology visionary .In the blockchain world, security \u2013 not information \u2013 is the first order of business. Instead of having information in centralized locations, the blockchain promotes decentralization.Splunk is using blockchain technology to allow customers to securely store their data. And they can do this without sacrificing their ability to analyze it and without moving it.From Splunk\u2019s own blog:As Splunk indexes data it . If any of the indexed data stored in Splunk is corrupted or tampered with, it will no longer match what is on the distributed ledger. Voila, now you can prove your data hasn\u2019t been tampered with \u2014 while maintaining the ability to analyze it \u2014 without moving it.Splunk is demonstrating that they understand that corporations place importance on data integrity. Their numbers are showing it. Splunk\u2019s quarterly renewable software bookings came in at 95%. Plus, the company is seeing that number rise to 99% by the fourth quarter.Splunk is also continuing to project robust software revenue and is increasing the number of new customers being brought on. In fact, Splunk CEO says that the company is well on track to reach its goal of 20,000 total customers by the end of 2020.Splunk will also be completing its acquisition of  in late 2020. This will further move the company into the realm of distributive ledger technology. Splunk stock is off its high from earlier this year.

The industry is growing fast as digital transformation sweeps across the globe, and investors in the companies that work to protect all the data that lives online have been richly rewarded over the past few years.However, the torrid growth of  and other digital transformations have left the door open to disruption, and numerous upstarts have taken the opportunity to win business at the expense of older security firms. There's no denying that the landscape for cybersecurity investing looks much different today than it did a decade ago, and it will likely look very different in another 10 years.\u00a0Blindly investing without knowing the underlying dynamics can be disastrous.It's a complicated picture populated by both\u00a0 (many of them young companies) and the larger firms that provide cybersecurity as part of a larger suite of services. This guide aims to simplify the matter and point you toward the best cybersecurity investments right now.Image source: Getty Images.Cybersecurity is the science of keeping digital data safe and only in the hands of, and in front of the eyes of, those who should have access. Traditionally, cybersecurity consisted of a piece of hardware called a firewall as part of a business' server. A firewall monitors and decides what data is allowed in and out of network and what gets blocked. Think of it like the security check at the airport, monitoring luggage hiding dangerous items.But the script has changed.  -- data storage, apps, and computing processes done remotely at a centralized data center and accessed via the internet -- has altered both the workplace dynamic and the way companies do business with customers.Employees can now access business apps from anywhere and from any number of devices, making a complicated mess of security and rendering a firewall in an office building useless. And customers are putting more and more data online as they do business with companies. \u00a0The amount of data online is increasing, a lot. And so is the need to protect all that data.Research from  Insights says that the total cybersecurity industry will grow an average of 12% a year and reach $300 billion by 2024 and within the broad category are niches that can be growing even faster, including identity, authentication, and access management (IAAM) and security information and event management (SIEM).Lots of cloud-native security start-ups -- offering software started and solely based on centralized data centers -- have popped up in the last decade or so to take on the new challenges presented by doing business in the cloud. Older firms slow to the punch have lost business at the hands of these upstarts, while others have been doing OK.For example,  -- which got its start offering internet security and website performance services -- recently had its . The decade-old company hauled in $193 million in sales in 2018, and grew at a 48% year-over-year rate through the first half of 2019. With growth that high, Cloudflare is outpacing the industry average, which implies the small outfit is taking market share.\u00a0 There are other firms, like , that act as cloud-based software web gateways to better protect modern business operations on the internet. Privately held and -backed  plays in the same sandbox. Rather than hardware-based security that only takes care of the office, cloud web gateways dwell in the cloud and thus follow users' devices, scrubbing and encrypting data in transit to and from the data center to ensure compromised information never makes it to the end user. While not investable yet, iboss CEO Paul Martini said in an interview that an IPO is in the works.\u00a0Keep an eye out for that one in the years ahead. As new players take the stage, older ones face change. , for example, founded back in the early 1980s, just had its . The remaining consumer-facing security unit is drawing interest from private equity firms. With the old guard in retreat and newer outfits taking the reins, here are the top places to invest in the fastest-growing segments of cybersecurity. \u00a0Image source: Getty Images.When it comes to disruption, some of the first outfits to displace the oldest segments of the industry were  and . The companies got their start making hardware-based and software-based firewalls and antivirus tools (they were founded in 2005 and 2000, respectively), but have steadily expanded into other areas of the security market. The two firms now rank among the largest cybersecurity pure-play stocks on the market.\u00a0 Once the disruptors, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet have recently been facing disruption from upstarts. The cloud was barely in its infancy at the companies' founding, and newer cloud-only security businesses have been outpacing the two companies. That isn't to say they are dead in the water. On the contrary, they have both continued to put up solid double-digit growth for years, all while progressively adding new services like cloud firewalls, IAAM, endpoint security (for laptops, tablets, smartphones, and IoT devices), and SIEM. Palo Alto, in particular, has been aggressively expanding within the industry. It has been  for years and bolting them on to its existing suite of products, a strategy that has yielded sales growth but nonetheless been met with criticism as it eats into the bottom line in the short term. CEO Nikesh Arora defends the strategy and says customers he speaks with have too many security vendors and are frustrated with the number of choices. Thus the need -- from Arora's point of view -- to create more of a one-stop shop. The acquisitions will therefore continue, and management has said it fully expects  over the next few years. \u00a0As for Fortinet, its founder and CEO, Ken Xie, expects his team's more conservative approach to expansion to yield lower-double-digit sales gains, but profit growth is expected to average well into the double digits for the foreseeable future. With both of these cybersecurity companies well established and successfully making the cloud and niche security product transition, they're a great place to start for investors looking to get in on the industry's growth. \u00a0My next top cybersecurity stock, , didn't start out as a security company at all. The company is a big data analytics business, helping organizations turn massive amounts of unusable data into actionable insights. If it's an electronic system, it can be \"Splunked.\" Everything from manufacturing facilities to call centers to payment processing systems generate data -- lots of it -- and Splunk helps businesses analyze the data to figure out what is happening and how to make improvements in operations. \u00a0As it turns out, the ability to gain insight on operations and monitor digital systems in real time lends itself particularly well to cybersecurity. After making , Splunk turned its big-data-parsing software into a full-blown security outfit -- one that has put up sizzling growth figures ever since. Specifically, the system harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning -- a branch of AI discipline -- to manage and automate the security process for IT teams at large organizations. Known as security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), Splunk bought its way into a leadership position in one of the fastest-growing segments of the antihacker industry.  In fact, according to Gartner, 30% of IT teams larger than five people will utilize SOAR tools by the end of 2022. As of this writing, the estimate is that only 5% of IT teams put the technology to use. It's a potentially huge growth driver that  and big-data business. Image source: Getty Images.As cloud-native platforms, Zscaler and  are much newer to the cybersecurity game. The two firms were founded a mere decade ago in 2008 and 2011, respectively. Nevertheless, they have quickly grown into two of the largest cybersecurity stocks on the market -- although they bring in far less revenue than either Palo Alto or Fortinet. That could change in the years ahead, though. Zscaler, which provides secure web gateways and went public in 2018,\u00a0 saw a 60% jump in revenue for the year ended in July 2019. Management has indicated it will keep its foot on the gas and maximize growth as the cloud continues to expand. Estimates vary as to how big the cloud market will get in the next few years, but the consensus is for hundreds of billions of dollars spent every year. With so much business computing getting moved off-premises and into remote data centers, it doesn't seem so farfetched that Zscaler anticipates its own sales growth to grow by double digits every year, too. There have been concerns that the competition is heating up, though. Palo Alto Networks has been boasting fast progress with its new cloud products, and Arora and Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry even\u00a0 about displacing each other when customer account renewals come up. For now, there should be plenty of new opportunity to go around. Zscaler, the previously mentioned iboss, Palo Alto, and others are using web gateways to take care of data in transit, but there's another cloud business of securing the devices themselves. Because data-center-driven computing enables data and app access anywhere, the movement overlaps with the IoT (or ) boom -- the millions of new devices every year getting hooked up to the internet. \u00a0That's where CrowdStrike comes in. CrowdStrike offers a platform for endpoint security, which protects the devices themselves that hook up to networks. Estimates again vary, but some analyst expectations are for the number of connected devices to increase by several billion over the next decade. It's an obviously huge opportunity for CrowdStrike and the myriad other cybersecurity plays in the game. Palo Alto and Fortinet, for example, have added endpoint security to their suites of software.\u00a0\u00a0Before it went public in July 2019, CrowdStrike opened its books to investors to show that revenue had at least  to its debut. That trend of doubling has thus far continued since the IPO, with CrowdStrike  with the security firm as time goes on. That's due to businesses adding new connected devices. With a long runway ahead of it, this endpoint security stock looks intriguing for investors interested in high growth.\u00a0 Let's finish out with IAAM, which ensures that an organization's data and apps are only accessible to those on a need-to-know basis. Obtaining login info is a big win for the bad guys, so keeping credentials on lockdown has become a top priority in recent years as businesses transfer operations and information onto the web. Two main components of IAAM are privileged account management (PAM) and identity access management (IAM) -- the former protecting specific, highly sensitive accounts (like logins for upper management) and the latter geared toward providing access to business systems to employees. \u00a0The two are often paired together to create a comprehensive system of tiered access to an organization's systems and processes. In fact, , which focuses on PAM, and , which focuses on IAM, can integrate their services with one another if a customer chooses to do so to create a well-rounded IAAM security strategy. The two firms are the leaders in their respective niches. IAAM hasn't looked like a niche service in recent years, though. Global Market Insights is calling for identity management to grow an average of 17% a year through 2024 into one of the largest subdisciplines within cybersecurity. Though CyberArk has been around since 1999, it has had its  in recent years, and management foresees the trend continuing. Okta, which was only founded in 2009 and is one of those cloud-native companies, has quickly grown into a , as measured by market cap (price per share multiplied by the number of shares outstanding), with sales growing over 50% a year the first couple of years after its 2017 IPO. Okta's team has similarly . In fact, CyberArk founder and CEO Udi Mokady  highlighted on a recent earnings call that IAAM is growing so fast because identity-based breaches at businesses are on the rise, and government regulators are cracking down with big fines. Some of those levies have tallied to nine digits. It's not exactly the kind of negative-reinforcement-driven behavior anyone wants to see behind a growth trend, but it nevertheless illustrates why identity management can keep growing so fast for so long.\u00a0 \u00a0Cybersecurity is a fast-growing area within the greater technology movement. Companies are spending and it's obvious that investors want in, but a few notes of caution are in order.Most of the aforementioned cybersecurity stocks are aggressively maximizing sales growth, purposefully keeping profits to a minimum or using up cash on the balance sheet to do so. Aggressive growth stocks like this can be especially volatile, with huge double-digit swings -- either up or down -- par for the course. Only investors who can stomach the volatility should buy in and it makes sense to keep cybersecurity plays balanced in your portfolio with less volatile investments.Another risk is that, because of the changing tech landscape, dozens of new cybersecurity outfits are springing up to constantly challenge the incumbents. That creates risk for investors if the new competition means existing cybersecurity plays aren't able to meet their sales goals. Eventually, a period of industry consolidation will ensue, and to an extent that has already begun (like in the endpoint security space where  purchased Cylance and  took over ). Put simply, no one can say for sure which companies will remain standing in a few years' time and which will perform the best.Thus, the best strategy is to buy a little bit of all of these top stocks and add to the positions -- like on a recurring monthly or quarterly basis, or . This helps mitigate the risk involved with buying highly erratic company shares. For a more in-depth look at .\u00a0In summary, cybersecurity is a fast-growing industry, but one also undergoing big changes. Investors would be best served buying into the disruptors leading the charge, and then strapping in for the long haul. No matter what happens, at least one thing seems certain: Cybersecurity will be a much larger market 10 years from now than it is today, and patience is sure to be rewarded.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I would anticipate that there will be more [acquisitions] in the future. ... We see so much opportunity -- we're truly at the beginning innings of this data era. So whatever it takes, organic or inorganic, to make sure that our customers' needs are solved and they can actually turn data into \"doing,\" and not just be overwhelmed by it, is something that we're committed to.To be clear, regardless of its negative cash flow and lack of sustained profitability under , Merritt is saying Splunk will continue to acquire complementary businesses as it sees fit. And depending on the size of those future acquisitions, I suspect Splunk shareholders will be in for more knee-jerk reactions from the market as they come to light.Splunk is\u00a0not\u00a0making these acquisitions from a position of weakness.During its most recent quarterly conference call last month, Merritt elaborated on its stance by describing the two kinds of merger-and-acquisition transactions: \"consolidation deals in troubled market categories,\" and \"acceleration deals in growth categories.\"In particular, he insists that Splunk's acquisitions belong firmly in the latter category -- that is, it makes its purchases not to prop up a fledgling business, but rather to complement its existing product portfolio and accelerate its market leadership in (as Merritt put it in the Bloomberg interview) these early stages of the data era.To be clear, accepting Merritt's view takes a certain level of trust in management and a belief that Splunk's platform will sustain the enviable momentum it's enjoyed in recent quarters.But consider Splunk's habit of underpromising and overdelivering with its quarterly results for each of the past several years -- and note that the platform's shift to a renewable, cloud-based model is currently happening far faster than any industry watcher has anticipated. Based on those two factors, I tend to want to give the benefit of the doubt to management's strategy for extending market leadership and sustaining\u00a0. As the effectiveness of this approach becomes more evident to Splunk's skeptics, I continue to think the pullback will prove to be an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But its impressive performance comes with a lofty valuation that the company's competition could damage.Datadog sells products that monitor and analyze every element of cloud-based and in-house IT (Information Technology) infrastructure.\u00a0According to studies, the infrastructure monitoring and application performance management (APM) markets in which Datadog competes will grow annually by 6.6% and 11.84%, respectively, over the next several years.\u00a0In contrast, Datadog grew its revenue by 96.6% and 79.5% year over year in 2018 and during the first half of this year, respectively.The company's low revenue base -- $266 million over the last 12 months -- favors its fast growth.\u00a0In comparison, Datadog's\u00a0SaaS competitors \u00a0and \u00a0 posted revenue of $512 million\u00a0and $2 billion, respectively. \u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Datadog's unique offering also contributes to the company's growth.For instance, public cloud giants such as \u00a0with Amazon Web Services (AWS) each offer their own monitoring capabilities.\u00a0Many other legacy tech vendors don't propose a single integrated monitoring solution, either. For instance, since\u00a0 partnered with Splunk to enhance its monitoring portfolio, Cisco's customers must manage different tools to monitor and analyze their IT infrastructure.\u00a0But Datadog's customers can monitor their different cloud and legacy-tech deployments with one single product, instead of having to deal with a different monitoring solution for each vendor.\u00a0Thanks to its competitive offering, Datadog has generated higher revenue growth compared to other fast-growing SaaS vendors, with lower sales and marketing expenses (see table below).The company's annual retention rate of 146%\u00a0shows existing customers are willing to increase their consumption of the company's products, and existing customers may involve reduced marketing efforts. Since 40% of the company's customers use more than one product,\u00a0cross-selling opportunities may lower the company's sales and marketing expenses as well.\u00a0In any case, Datadog's market cap around $10 billion\u00a0\u00a0and corresponds to a lofty TTM  of roughly 37 In comparison, the market values Crowdstrike, which reported similar revenue growth, at a lower -- but still elevated -- price-to-sales ratio of 25.2.Besides, excluding $5 million of one-time\u00a0tax-related benefits, Datadog posted a loss of $18.44 million during the first half of the year.\u00a0The company's sales and marketing expenses, albeit lower than its competitors, remain too high for the company to post a profit.Thus, given Datadog's high valuation, investors expect the company to keep on generating strong revenue growth over the long term while improving its margins.\u00a0But Datadog is exposed to intensifying competition, and the attractiveness of the company's integrated platform may wane as competitors develop similar offerings.For instance, following its recent agreement to acquire SignalFx, Splunk will enter into the APM business. Cisco is also developing its monitoring portfolio. After its $3.7 billion acquisition of AppDynamics in 2017,\u00a0Cisco recently reinforced its partnership with Splunk.\u00a0Given its cross-selling opportunities with its IT portfolio and its scale with its $51.9 billion of TTM revenue, Cisco's potential to build an integrated monitoring solution constitutes an increasing threat to Datadog.Besides, Datadog's ability to stay competitive with a much lower R&D budget than some of its competitors represents a significant risk. The company's TTM R&D expenses of $78.7 million represented 29.6% of its revenue. In contrast, Splunk's and New Relic's R&D represented only 24.8% and 22.8% of their respective revenue. But thanks to their bigger scale, these two companies dedicated a much higher amount -- $507.6 million and $116.6 million, respectively -- for their R&D.\u00a0Datadog's high valuation compared to other fast-growing SaaS companies constitutes a real danger, as CrowdStrike's recent situation illustrates. Despite better-than-expected results and lifted guidance, . Crowdstrike'selevated price-to-sales ratio above 57\u00a0before its earnings is my only explanation for the negative market reaction.Even with Datadog's strong performance, buying into in the company at a price-to-sales ratio above 35 remains a risky bet for investors \u2013 especially given its exposure to extra competition.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It has since been updated and republished.]Slow and steady wins the race, as the old adage goes. But slow and steady can be a bit boring.

Its key drug, Copaxone, which treats multiple sclerosis, is facing generic competition from \u00a0(NASDAQ:), among others.Bankruptcy likely isn\u2019t a near-term scenario but the current trajectory suggests it could occur down the line. In short, TEVA is a classic contrarian, \u201cbuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d type of play. And there are reasons TEVA is one of these great (if risky) stocks to buy.While pressure has persisted on generic drugs, but it won\u2019t last forever.The company has sold assets to clean up its balance sheet, which has de-risked the story somewhat. In my opinion, Teva is a better version of Valeant, but with an easier path back to normalcy.It\u2019s a risky path, but if it works TEVA\u00a0could gain another 20%-plus simply by reaching a higher multiple and removing bankruptcy fears.The story already has played out somewhat at \u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is up 16.4% so far this year. But the growth story isn\u2019t necessarily over.Source: Shutterstock\n\tOnly a few years ago, Scientific Games was a sleepy, low-growth provider of lottery tickets and terminals. But that changed in quick succession.SciGames acquired slot machine manufacturers WMS Industries and Bally Technologies, the latter coming only months after Bally bought equipment maker and gaming table designer Shuffle Master. Scientific Games became the dominant supplier to the casino industry worldwide: a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for casino floors.It also became one of the most indebted companies in the U.S. markets and still is. The combination of that debt and careful cost controls at casinos, particularly in the U.S., kept SGMS stock below $20 to start the year.But it now looks like the long-awaited \u201creplacement cycle\u201d of slot machines is arriving and that could be hugely beneficial for Scientific Games and its smaller, similar rival  (NYSE:). And considering how much leverage is still on the balance sheet, there\u2019s a case for SGMS to clear $100 \u2014 yes, $100 \u2014 if profit growth accelerates.That\u2019s not a guarantee, obviously, but\u00a0it\u2019s the nature of highly indebted companies.

The shares of the developer of Splunk Enterprise, a data analysis solution, have dropped amid worries about its acquisitions and concerns about its cash flow.\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\tHowever, by buying Splunk stock at these levels, traders may get something they do not expect from data and cloud stocks today: a discount.Many of the stocks in those sectors seem to do nothing but move higher. Given the performance of many of Splunk\u2019s peers, one might think that all of the stocks in the sector, including SPLK, keep making 52-week highs and have achieved outlandish price-earnings (P/E) ratios.However, many data and software-as-a-service (SaaS) firms such as (NYSE:) and (NYSE:), have fallen below their 52-week highs. But those companies have not fallen as far as Splunk stock. While CRM stock has dropped by about 9% and SAP has retreated around 15%, SPLK stock has tumbled more than 18% below its 52-week high.One reason for the decline of Splunk stock was concern that its acquisition of  would dilute the shares. That feeling likely worsened after SPLK\u00a0 announced earlier this month that it would also buy  There is some uncertainty as to how these deals\u00a0 will affect the cash, debt, and shares outstanding of SPLK.Moreover, like (NASDAQ:) in recent years,\u00a0 SPLK has begun to switch from a permanent license model to a subscription\u00a0 revenue model. Although the change should result in SPLK generating more revenue over the long-term, such a decision usually leads to a temporary reduction of cash flow.In the wake of fears about its acquisitions,\u00a0 Splunk stock has tumbled from its $143.70 per share high in mid-July to about $116 per share today.However, I see the moves made by SPLK\u00a0 as positive. Many commentators will often criticize firms for putting their short-term profits ahead of their longer-term needs and those of their shareholders. In this case, in an effort to improve its offerings,\u00a0 SPLK has bought other companies. It also switched to a subscription revenue model\u00a0 that should increase its cash flows over the long-term.Still, instead of rewarding the company, traders briefly took SPLK stock into bear-market territory. I believe that the unjustified decline of Splunk stock has created a good buying opportunity.The forward P/E ratio of Splunk stock may look high, compared to the average forward P/E ratio. Still, given\u00a0 the high expected growth of Splunk\u2019s future earnings,\u00a0 the forward P/E ratio of Splunk stock, which currently stands at 49, looks reasonable. For fiscal 2019, analysts, on average,\u00a0 expect Splunk\u2019s\u00a0 earnings to jump 43.6%. In FY20, analysts, on average,\u00a0 predict that its profits will surge nearly 25%.Moreover, yesterday SPLK stock rose by more than 2% after JPMorgan\u2019s  the shares to an \u201coverweight\u201d rating. Thanks to the reduction in the stock price, he sees Splunk stock as attractive. Murphy has placed a $130 price target on SPLK.Like Murphy, I think there are reasons why Splunk\u2019s rapid growth should continue. For one, all things cloud are still growing almost exponentially.

JD is the largest direct retailer and second largest e-commerce player in China after  . Unlike Alibaba, JD takes on inventories and runs its own fulfillment and logistics services. That business model is more capital-intensive than Alibaba's, but it's better shielded from counterfeit products.Image source: Getty Images.JD seemed to be in deep trouble last year, as its growth accelerated, its costs rose, and it struggled to remain profitable. A rape allegation against CEO Richard Liu and the escalating trade war exacerbated the pain.The criminal charges against Liu were eventually dropped, and JD's latest quarter indicates that the e-tailer has\u00a0. JD's second-quarter revenue rose 23% annually, marking its strongest growth in three quarters. It expects that momentum to continue with 20% to 24% growth in the third quarter.Much of that growth was fueled by higher demand for higher-ticket items like electronics and home appliances -- indicating that consumer spending in China remains robust in the shadow of the trade war. JD's adjusted net profit also surged more than sevenfold as JD Logistics' gross margin hit the break-even point for the first time ever. JD is also providing logistics to other companies as a third-party service, which will diversify its revenue streams beyond its core commerce business.It also expects to remain consistently profitable for the year with a net profit margin of 1.4% to 1.7%. That's a big improvement from previous years, and indicates that economies of scale are kicking in -- which will make it tough for smaller rivals to compete while staying profitable. Despite all that good news, JD still trades at less than one time this year's sales -- so it could rebound quickly if investors develop an appetite for Chinese stocks again. : Home furnishings specialist Wayfair has seen its stock return to roughly market-return levels after having nearly doubled at one point in 2019.

Instead, net losses ballooned over the first half of the year and are expected to jump again in the hiring buildup before the key holiday season.

Maybe a bunch of money managers all got into the office on Monday with to-do lists that included some selling and subsequent buying in bargain areas of the market (oil and retail, for example, went up). Or maybe individual investors all decided that 2019 has been a fantastic year so far, and it was time to take some profits. Maybe it was a little of both, or something else entirely.Who knows, but sometimes there is as much explanation for a sell-off as there is a logical explanation for why an unprofitable -- albeit fast-growing -- company like \u00a0would increase in valuation by several hundred percent in just a few months' time. At any rate, if you were holding on to cloud stocks over the weekend and found your holdings took as much as a double-digit haircut come Monday, two things should be true:Image source: Getty Images.Data source: YCharts. \u00a0When surveying the field of (mild) destruction, I tried to pick a sampling of companies from across the cloud and enterprise software sub-industry. I started with Salesforce, a stock I've owned for quite some time -- by far the largest of this group and one that didn't budge much, while its smaller peers tanked.That's likely because much of Salesforce's recent dip had already happened. Investors have been fretting over the company's \u00a0with the 2019 acquisition bill nearing $20 billion. But Salesforce's strategy seems to be paying off. During the second-quarter report, management said it expected a reacceleration of revenue in the next couple of quarters nearing 30%. That's quite the feat for a company the size of Salesforce, and I think it gives the relationship-management giant a clear path to becoming one of the largest tech companies in the world over the next decade or so. \u00a0I'll admit that  and  are two companies that took me some time to understand. I didn't make my initial purchase of each until earlier this year, but I bought in after I understood what each of them does. Twilio is changing the way businesses communicate with their customers, offering a suite of cloud-based tools to enable digital interaction. The toolkit includes text, voice, video, email, login security, and other digital functions, all of which developers can integrate into their own apps and websites.The Trade Desk operates a type of advertising exchange where buyers of digital ads can bid and optimize their marketing. With connected entertainment (think streaming TV and music) only increasing, Trade Desk's connected-TV and audio segments have been growing like weeds as of late.Both companies are making it easier for their customers to operate, disrupting the status quo in software development and ad purchasing. The results say as much. During the second quarter, Trade Desk's revenue grew 42% year over year, while Twilio's went up 86%. The cybersecurity space has been a really interesting segment of tech the last few years. Cloud computing has changed the game for digital security, and it's provided opportunity for newer upstarts to grow at the expense of many industry incumbents. One such upstart is Okta, which focuses on  -- ensuring that only the right people get access to data and applications within an organization. It's a fast-growing but small piece of the , and Okta has quickly taken command of the segment.Granted, there are some concerns with valuation here. Okta's market cap of $13 billion is close to the total amount of spending on privileged identity management in a few years' time. Thus, a breather was more than warranted, but Okta continues to demonstrate its ability to scoop up the lion's share of its particular cybersecurity discipline. Recently reported second-quarter sales were up 49%, easily outpacing the average growth of cybersecurity overall. \u00a0And finally, Alteryx -- another new one for me. I've owned big-data companies like for years, but Alteryx popped up on my radar this year as the data analytics industry consolidated, with Salesforce and Google's making  early in 2019. Alteryx is still here, though, and it's posting more than respectable results as it goes it alone. \u00a0compared with a year ago.I don't plan to stop adding to these positions -- and companies like them -- anytime soon. Digital transformation is a phrase increasingly used by top management teams to describe the rapid pace of change at the organizational level around the globe. As digital systems are proving their worth, old legacy operations are getting updated or replaced at a rapid pace. Estimates vary, but research company\u00a0expects global spending on technology to keep increasing in the mid-single-digits the next few years -- recession or not -- with enterprise software leading the charge, and by itself nearing $500 billion in annual spending by the end of 2020. \u00a0Arbitrary numbers? Probably. But they illustrate the point that software is still growing so quickly, and there's plenty of room for disruptive upstarts to carve out a niche. Thus, I'm still a buyer on the dips in the above stocks. The valuations look silly, but their  and long runways look too enticing.

Analysts on average were looking for earnings of only $0.12 per share, and Splunk's outlook called for revenue of just $485 million.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Within Splunk's top line, license revenue grew 39.2% to $279.3 million, and maintenance & services revenue soared 26.5% to $237.3 million. Within those totals, however, management noted that cloud business grew an incredible 80% year over year and now commands over $300 million of annual recurring revenue (ARR).\u00a0Splunk also announced it has agreed to acquire cloud-monitoring company SignalFX for $1.05 billion in a cash (60%) and stock (40%) deal -- a move that should significantly expand its reach and value proposition to clients.If that wasn't enough, Splunk increased its full-year outlook for revenue to $2.3 billion -- up $50 million from its old target.During the subsequent conference call, CEO Doug Merritt  Splunk is \"firing on all cylinders,\" adding almost 500 new enterprise customers. And by the end of the year, he said, essentially all of Splunk's new software sales will be cloud- or term-license based as it transitions away from a perpetual license model.\u00a0So what's the problem? That transition is happening much faster than Splunk expected -- it previously thought as much as 15% of total sales at the end of the year would be perpetual -- which hurts the timing of Splunk's cash collections as its perpetual-license sales base wanes.To be fair, Splunk saw the , when it lowered its operating cash-flow expectation for this year by $100 million to \"just\" $350 million. But as renewable license sales continued to soar, as of last month's update Splunk now expects\u00a0operating cash flow of $300 million this fiscal year.\u00a0Over the long term, however, I'm intrigued by Splunk's potential as it begins to lap this jaw-dropping transition and collects more of the recurring revenue it's putting into place today.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new November 22nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $120.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $120.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $114.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $121.92/share today.\n\nBecause the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.92% return on the cash commitment, or 38.98% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, and highlighting in green where the $120.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $124.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.20.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SPLK stock at the current price level of $121.92/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $124.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.79% if the stock gets called away at the November 22nd expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPLK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SPLK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $124.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $124.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.\n\nIn trading on Monday, shares of Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.1, after changing hands as low as $111.32 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 43.4.

First, Okta\u2019s earnings history is stellar. Second, the numbers this quarter look very beatable. Third, peer cloud companies have reported strong numbers over the past month.Fourth, and most importantly, the secular growth narrative underlying OKTA stock is so robust and wide-reaching that, even if the stock sells off in response to Q2 numbers, that sell-off will be temporary. In the big picture, it will be nothing more than an opportunity buy into a long-term winner at a discount.As such, I like OKTA stock ahead of earnings. In all likelihood, the company reports strong numbers, and the stock flies higher. In the event that doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m perfectly comfortable buying the dip, given the strength of this company\u2019s secular growth narrative. Either way, I see Okta stock as one for the long run.Let\u2019s have a look at the Okta Inc stock stellar earnings history. Indeed, the company\u2019s track record is flawless.Okta\u2019s first public earnings report was back in June 2017. It was a double beat report, topping Street estimates on both revenue and earnings. Ever since, Okta has racked up nine consecutive double-beats. Not surprisingly, OKTA stock has performed very well during this stretch. Since that first earnings report, the shares are up more than 430%.Coming into tomorrow\u2019s earnings report, history is on the bulls\u2019 side ahead of the Q2 print.The second big reason to buy OKTA stock ahead of earnings is that the Street numbers look very beatable.In every quarter since going public, Okta has reported revenue growth of 50% or better. That is nine quarters of 50%-plus revenue growth. The Street is looking for less than 40% revenue growth this quarter. Against the backdrop of those nine straight quarters of 50%-plus revenue growth, a sub-40% revenue growth estimate this quarter seems very beatable.To be sure, part of this slowdown is because management guided for it in the last earnings report. But, management has a history of under-promising and over-delivering. That seems especially true this time around, with revenue growth estimates slated at multi-quarter lows.As such, it seems highly likely that \u2014 at the very least \u2014 Okta tops revenue estimates in its Q2 print.The third reason to buy OKTA stock ahead of Wednesday\u2019s earnings is that peer cloud companies have reported strong numbers over the past month, in sum supporting that the secular enterprise cloud transition remains as vigorous as ever.Specifically, over the past month, cloud companies  (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:), and  (NASDAQ:) all reported double-beat-and-raise earnings reports. At the same time, hybrid cloud companies  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) both reported double-beats in the past month, and both cited cloud strength in their earnings report.Also of note, cloud infrastructure giants  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) both reported double-beat quarters recently, with cloud strength at the epicenter of both beats.Net net, the takeaway is that the secular enterprise cloud transition remains as vigorous as ever, despite slowing economic growth around the world. Okta makes its living off this transition. As such, so long as it remains vigorous, Okta\u2019s numbers should remain favorable.The fourth big reason to buy OKTA stock ahead of earnings is that the secular growth narrative here is so good that any post-earnings sell-off will likely be nothing more than a buying opportunity.Okta has created an innovative solution at the convergence of the cloud and cybersecurity worlds. Specifically, the company has developed what management calls the Identity Cloud, which is an identity-based cloud security solution which enables customers and employees alike to securely log into multiple applications using just one log-in. This solution is high adaptive, highly secure, and very convenient for enterprises \u2014 which are sometimes adopting  every month.Because of these advantages, Okta\u2019s Identity Cloud solution has gained significant traction in the  over the past several years. It will continue to gain traction over the next several years, too. At the same time, the whole cloud security solution market will expand dramatically, driven by more enterprise workloads migrating to the cloud and enterprises spending more money to protect and secure those workloads.As such, Okta projects as a market share gainer in a secular growth industry for the next several. That implies big revenue growth for a lot longer. Gross margins are north of 70%. Opex rates will fall with scale. Over the next few years, Okta projects as a big time profit grower \u2014 and all that profit growth should propel OTKA stock meaningfully higher.Okta should report strong second quarter numbers after the bell on Wednesday. Those better-than-expected numbers should be good enough to spark a nice post-earnings rally in OKTA stock.But, even if that doesn\u2019t happen, any post-earnings sell-off in OKTA stock will most likely just be a buying opportunity, since the secular growth narrative here implies that OTKA stock is a long-term winner.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long OKTA, SPLK, and GOOG.\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shares of big-data analytics company  (NASDAQ:) have been red-hot for a long time, and with good reason. This company is at the heart of the Big Data Economy, developing solutions which help enterprises turn their abundant data into actionable insights.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\tThe Big Data Economy has mushroomed rapidly over the past several years, and as it has, more and more enterprises have turned to Splunk to help them succeed in this economy.As all that has happened, Splunk\u2019s revenues have surged higher, jumping 300% from 2015 to 2019, as have its profits ( its operating profits are up nearly 2,000% over that same stretch). This robust revenue and profit growth has translated into huge gains for SPLK stock. Over the past five years, Splunk stock has surged about 175%.In other words, Splunk stock has been a long-term winner.But this long-term winner hit a road bump recently. Splunk reported beat-and-raise second-quarter numbers recently that, ostensibly, were pretty good. But they weren\u2019t clean\u00a0beat-and-raise results. Specifically, SPLK announced a sizable acquisition that will be partially funded through Splunk stock, so investors were concerned about that dilution. Also, SPLK cut its cash-flow guidance as the company\u2019s pivot into a subscription-based business is creating a near-term drag on its cash flows.Investors weren\u2019t too pleased about the Q2 numbers. Splunk stock dropped sharply in response to the results and presently trades 15% below its recent highs.At these levels, SPLK, a continuous-growth company, is a\u00a0 great stock to buy. Here\u2019s why.The first main reason SPLK is a great stock to buy on weakness is because Splunk stock remains supported by highly favorable, long-term growth fundamentals.In order to understand the long-term bull thesis on SPLK stock, it\u2019s first necessary to understand just how large the Data Economy will become. For all intents and purposes, data is the most valuable asset in the world. With data, companies can do a great number of things, including improve customer conversion rates, target new demographics, and\u00a0 create new and better products.The world is awash in data, and the volume of data is growing exponentially as more and more consumers leave bigger and bigger digital footprints. Thus, companies everywhere have a ton of data at their finger tips. But turning that data into actionable insights is a tall order.Splunk helps companies turn all this raw and messy machine data into clear and actionable insights. Companies don\u2019t just want to do that. They need to do that because if their competitors are gaining more and better insights from data, then they\u2019ll lose customers. It\u2019s that simple.Thus, competitive dynamics ensure that pretty much every company\u00a0 is going to start doing everything they can to gather, analyze, and interpret data.Does that mean\u00a0 every company\u00a0 in the world will become a customer of SPLK one day? No. There are many big-data solutions, and Splunk is just one of them. But Splunk arguably has the best data-analysis\u00a0 solution, so as the Data Economy grows over the next several years, so will Splunk. And as that happens, Splunk stock will climb, making Splunk a good stock to buy.I think Splunk\u2019s top line\u00a0 will climb 20%-plus annually for a long time.\u00a0 Moreover, its gross margins should reach nearly\u00a0 90%, and its operating-expenditure rate should naturally fall as its revenue increases rapidly. The end result of that is huge profits and a materially higher Splunk stock price in the long-run.The second reason\u00a0 Splunk stock is a good name to buy is that it is appealing to investors in the current macro environment. That characteristic will help boost Splunk stock for the foreseeable future.In the current high-risk, low-yield world, investors can get good returns from\u00a0 growth stocks supported by non-cyclical tailwinds which won\u2019t be interrupted by a trade war or a slowing economy. SPLK\u00a0 is in that category.As a result,\u00a0 investors will continue to be attracted to Splunk stock as long as the current macro trends persist. That continued attraction should keep SPLK stock on a healthy uptrend for the foreseeable future.The third reason Splunk stock is a good name to buy is that \u2013 despite its recent decline \u2013 the stock is still supported by favorable technicals which imply that its recent weakness is a natural hiccup in an otherwise strong uptrend. As you can see from the adjacent chart, Splunk stock put in a bottom in late 2018. Ever since then, SPLK stock has been on a steady and healthy uptrend, enabling the shares to form a strong support line.SPLK stock has tested and held that support line three times before. Each time, the Relative Strength Index on SPLK stock was plunging into oversold territory. And each time, SPLK stock proceeded to bounce sharply over the subsequent weeks and months. Consequently, the shares\u00a0 maintained their multi-quarter uptrend.Right now, SPLK stock is testing that support line, with the RSI plunging towards oversold territory. It looks like the stock wants to hold this support line yet again. If it does, that is confirmation that Splunk stock remains on a healthy, multi-quarter uptrend which should persist for the foreseeable future.Splunk stock is a long-term winner, supported by non-cyclical tailwinds in the Data Economy. The near- term weakness of Splunk stock is an opportunity to buy shares of this long-term winner. Its fundamentals remain favorable and it looks strong, creating robust investor demand. And the technicals of SPLK stock\u00a0 indicate the shares will rebound over the next few months.As a result, I\u2019m buying SPLK stock. The shares can rise in the near-term and over the long-term.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SPLK.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Stocks were back and forth, in the red and in the black, for the better part of Thursday\u2019s action.

Perhaps worse, the bearish momentum is starting to build in a way that portends lower lows are imminent.Nvidia was one of the hardest-hit names last year, sent lower in step with the broad market\u2019s weakness, which was exacerbated by a meltdown of the crypto-mining industry.NVDA stock has been working on a recovery since late last year though. It has not been able to form one just yet, but it continues to try. The end result is a well-made set of support and resistance lines. Better still, Nvidia stock is close to punching through the upper boundary.Finally, Albemarle has been in something of a nosedive since early last year. Although it has seen the occasional rebound effort, each one of them has been met by a move to lower lows.There has been a method to the madness, however. Each lower low and each lower high has contributed to the establishment of a well-defined, falling trading range. The current trajectory is clearly downward, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean ALB has to stay on the path. It does, however, suggest there\u2019s room for a little more downside before traders have to make a decision.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

After all, Splunk's\u00a0revenue soared 33%, to $516.6 million -- far above its own guidance for $485 million -- which translated into adjusted net income of $0.30 per share, trouncing estimates for $0.12 per share.But Splunk also reduced its full-year cash flow guidance for the second time in as many reports -- this time telling investors to expect\u00a0million in fiscal 2020, marking a massive reduction from its old target for\u00a0With echoes of its previous quarterly update in late May, management blamed the negative impact on cash collections of Splunk's faster-than-expected acceleration away from perpetual licenses and toward a cloud-based renewable model.Now that the dust has settled, let's dig deeper in an effort to better understand what's driving Splunk today. To that end, here are five key points management discussed during IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.I want to be emphatically clear, our business is firing on all cylinders and executing at highest levels. For a little data driven context, only a handful of enterprise software companies in history have had $2 billion in revenue while attaining greater than 25% revenue growth -- the likes of , , , ,  and . Splunk is on track to join this short list by the end of this fiscal year. Not only is Splunk on the cusp of joining these elite companies, we've done it concurrently while making massive investments in new cloud technology and executing on a full business model change. -- Splunk CEO Doug MerrittMerritt led with this statement to dispel any notion that Splunk's cash flow headwinds might be related to the underlying weakness of its business or waning demand for its products. To the contrary, and in a way few  have done before it, Spunk is taking market share and sustaining its incredible top-line growth -- both key priorities in these early stages of its long-term story -- despite the inevitable challenge associated with building on an increasingly massive base.Our renewable business model makes it easier to do business with [Splunk]. And in fact customers have adopted term [licensing] in Cloud faster than expected, increasing our mix from renewable by more than 10 percentage points in just one quarter to a stunning 95%. We've also evolved our pricing approach to make it easier for customers of Splunk much more of their data. Our contracting and pricing changes are making a big difference for enterprise customers. And our new pricing meaningfully expands the opportunity for Splunkable data worldwide. -- Doug MerrittLater in the call, Splunk CFO Jason Child elaborated\u00a0that renewable license sales are expected to accelerate to 99% of Splunk's total by the fourth quarter, with perpetual licenses comprising the remaining 1%. For perspective, this marks a drastic contrast from Splunk's previous target model, which called for perpetual licenses to represent a full 15% of its total at the end of this fiscal year.In Q2 we recorded 93 orders greater than $1 million and added 500 new customers. On margins, which are non-GAAP, Q2, overall gross margin was 84%, up two points on a year-over-year basis. With such rapid growth in the cloud, we are realizing anticipated efficiencies and scale in that business. In Q2 cloud delivered over 50% gross margin, which is an important milestone on the way to our long-term target as 70% or more. Q2 operating margin was 9%, notably better than our plan, driven by our solid top-line performance and some investment optimizations. -- Splunk CFO Jason ChildMake no mistake: While Splunk has incurred  over the course of its life as a public company, it has also done so with a longer-term eye on building its customer base, growing its enterprise value, and fostering an attractive margin profile that should pay off when it eventually, consciously takes a turn toward sustained profitability. The cloud business, in particular, is only just coming into its own to that end as it begins to scale in earnest.As you know, there are two kinds of M&A [mergers and acquisitions] transactions, consolidation deals in troubled market categories and acceleration deals in growth categories. Make no mistake, we are proactively positioning Splunk for growth and long-term value creation. Splunk is on a mission to become nothing short of the strategic technology partner to the world's most data savvy enterprises. -- Doug MerrittEven given its cash flow challenges, Splunk isn't shy about continuing to expand its reach through strategic acquisitions -- in this case, with its $1.05 billion cash-and-stock purchase of cloud-monitoring company SignalFX.\u00a0Here again, Merritt is taking a proactive approach to reassure investors that Splunk isn't acquiring SignalFX in a desperate attempt to prop up growth in a troubled niche. Rather, Merritt says integrating SignalFX into Splunk's existing core business will position it \"as a leader in monitoring and observability at massive scale,\" which in turn should only improve its value proposition and the stickiness of its offerings with its growing enterprise client base.[W]e expect our high growth trajectory to continue. Q3 revenue should reach approximately $600 million with a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%. For the full year, we are now expecting total revenues of $2.3 billion, up from $2.25 billion [before], and we maintain our non-GAAP operating margin target of 14% -- which to confirm will include the acquired operating expense run rate of SignalFx.For perspective, not only did Splunk provide Q3 revenue guidance that was well above analysts' estimates, but it also unsurprisingly raised its full-year revenue outlook while reiterating its adjusted margin guidance in the process. In short, it seems the only pain point the market had with Splunk's latest quarter was its reported and future cash flow expectations. Both are directly related to the incredible momentum of its transition to renewable licenses, which should leave the company better positioned to\u00a0growing for the foreseeable future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And whether it is successful or not likely rests on Federal Reserve Chairman Powell speaking tomorrow. His words have recently moved markets violently. Regardless, the effects should be short term and eventually stocks will trade on their own merits. So we seek the top stock trades for Friday separately from the fed announcement.These are  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:), and  (NASDAQ:)The experts on Wall Street got busy quickly with their opinions on Splunk stock Thursday morning. It caught at least two downgrades, but some will defend it. I usually ignore what analysts think as I find it best to do my own homework to form an honest thesis with no hidden agendas.SPLK stock is not cheap, but since it is a growth stock, that fact matters very little. In fact, they are supposed to spend a lot so they can grow a lot. The earnings report was strong as they clobbered expectations and raised guidance. They did announce a $1 billion acquisition so that could have scared a few opinions.I bet that the negative reaction down 10% is wrong. This is a dip that I\u2019d buy. If I am long SPLK I don\u2019t give up on them now just because of a knee-jerk reaction to earnings headlines. SPLK stock will continue to prosper as they transition into the subscription business model.So far, management with the leadership of CEO Doug Murray has performed well. There is no reason to start assuming this will change. SPLK stock came into the earnings up more than the  so it\u2019s not a slouch. This time, traders are acting incorrectly and investors need to step into it on the dip.Ford seems to be in disarray. While this statement may be too harsh, this is the impression I get from watching the pain in F stock. Fundamentally, it can get cheaper because it still sells at a premium to  (NYSE:). Not that GM is in much better strategical shape. It is interesting to note that F stock is outperforming GM this year but that\u2019s not the case longer term.Nevertheless, I bet there will be a big move in F stock. This is in spite of its Thursday headline against President Donald Trump over the .The opportunity in Ford stock comes from its high yield. Rarely does Wall Street allow for a high-profile company to deliver 6.6% yield.\u00a0 So either Ford will need to cut the dividend or the stock price has to rise. So this is a position I would hold for the long term in any case, but this dividend situation could render F a short-term win.Thursday morning rumors were that Volkswagen had interest in buying a stake in TSLA. The stock spiked 3% on the headline. These were vague notions with nothing specific so not likely true. But this is still a trading opportunity. The fact that the buyout subject is in the news places a bid below the stock. This makes it harder to short it, which gives TSLA stock bulls a temporary advantage.For those traders with a strong stomach they can buy TSLA stock and hope for the best. I am not that brave so I would prefer to use options to trade it. For example I can sell the March 2020 $135 put and collect about $8 to open. I don\u2019t even need a rally to win. In fact, the stock can fall almost 40% from here and I would still have gains. IF TSLA stock falls below that then I break even at $128 and accrue losses from thereon down.I only sell naked puts when I can own the shares, else I would use sell put spreads instead. My logic is simple; the company has great potential but TSLA stock has been crippled by Elon Musk shenanigans. So if the stock falls low enough, it gets cheap enough that someone will buy it. Then Thursday\u2019s rumors would then be more credible.UTLA stock has been on my watchlist all week. It showed a good potential setup going into earnings. This is a great retail success story when the most of the sector is still reeling from the  (NASDAQ:) effect.ULTA still carries advantages over typical retail in the sense that they control their inventory and have a loyal clientele.\u00a0Also since the pool of retail success stories is shallow, this places demand on the successful ones like ULTA stock,  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:).Technically, I like the chart setup. ULTA stock bulls have already pushed above $332. If they can go above $335 then the upside target should be closer to $350 per share. There will be resistance especially at $348.50 so it won\u2019t be easy. Earnings are coming soon so it could provide the burst necessary to do it. This is a stock I can hold into this breakout especially if my time frame not strictly short term. There is a bearish scenario that could occur short term but I bet that the ULTA stock fans will defend it.DKS reported a strong earnings report on Thursday. They beat metrics and raise guidance. Experts called it a breakout quarter. Indeed, the DKS stock spiked 13% on the headline. This is not a run to chase just yet. In spite of what the meme says, markets do have memory.Coincidentally, the DKS stock spiked to $38 which is inside a prior failure zone. Usually these are resistance at least on the first pass. The bulls rarely are able to slice through pivot zones like butter. They need more than one attempt to rise above. This is not the same as saying short DKS stock. Caution is warranted here.In this case, DKS stock failed at exactly a level it has failed at at least five times this year. Each time was followed by more red. So in spite of the optimism from the report, the stock price action is questionable from here. Onus is on the bulls to prove that this time they can consolidate well and push past $38 then $39.20 per share. Until then I wait for confirmation that floor levels below are solid enough and that the neckline above is breakable.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

By comparison, Splunk's guidance called for lower revenue of $485 million, and most analysts were looking for significantly lower earnings of $0.12 per share.Image source: Getty Images.Splunk added nearly 500 new enterprise customers during the quarter, including the likes of ,  Media Group, and . And in a separate press release, the company revealed it has agreed to pay roughly $1.05 billion (60% in cash, 40% in stock) to acquire cloud-monitoring leader Signal FX -- a move CEO Doug Merritt says will give it industry leadership \"in monitoring and observability at massive scale.\"What's more, CFO Jason Child says Splunk's cloud business grew 80% year over year, and now boasts annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $300 million. The company believes that by the end of the year \"virtually all new software sales will be cloud or term license-based.\"But in Wall Street's eyes, that's also the problem.While Splunk followed by increasing its fiscal-2020 guidance to call for revenue of roughly $2.30 billion (up from $2.25 billion three months ago), it also told investors it expects  operating cash flow of $300 million for the full fiscal year -- a big reduction from previous expectations for\u00a0positive cash flow of $250 million.During the  -- and with echoes of the  in late May -- management explained that Splunk's accelerated shift toward renewable licenses is hurting the timing of cash collection in the near term.\"Again, this is all about timing,\" Child added during the call. \"While we expect long-term cash yield to return to the mid-20% levels, the timing to get there is dependent on our term-cloud mix over the next few years.\"Make no mistake, it's an enviable \"problem\" for Splunk to see such incredible momentum in its shift toward a cloud-based recurring revenue model.

Revenue was up another 33%, including a 46% increase in revenue from the company's lucrative cloud and licensing software segment.In addition, Splunk got back to making acquisitions, announcing that it would be purchasing cloud computing software SignalFX for $1.05 billion. With its foot on the gas to take advantage of the myriad of businesses around the globe making the move to digital, Splunk remains one of the best software plays around.Total revenue through the first six months of the year is now up 34%, with cloud (data center-based software and services) and subscription sales leading the charge. Within that total, the licensing software segment still carries an incredibly high gross profit margin and grew at a 42% rate. In total, Splunk is operating a business model that only  as it adds new customers (there were almost 500 new additions in Q2).YOY = year over year. Pp = percentage point. Data source: Splunk.Businesses are awash in data, and Splunk's software is getting put to use in a variety of cases. Some of its clients are retailers looking to gain insight into customer interactions -- DoorDash was mentioned as a success story on the last , as it's using Splunk to help restaurants reach new customers -- while others are financial institutions monitoring financial data and making sure transactions are secure. The trend is set to continue, which provides plenty of opportunity for this software technologist to keep finding new use cases. CEO Doug Merritt cited an IDC study that predicts worldwide data will increase over 60% from 2018 levels, and much of that new information is uncategorized and unsecured. Splunk has a solution for both, enabling both analytics and security monitoring to give organizations deep insight into what is going on with their operations.Image source: Getty Images.One of the key areas of growth in the big data movement is the cloud. Global spending on cloud services and infrastructure should double by 2023, again according to IDC. Splunk's cloud-based revenue is currently running at around 15% of its total, but it's growing north of 80% and is expected to be about half of the total mix within the next few years.Doubling down on this trend, management announced it expects to close on the purchase of real-time cloud infrastructure monitoring company SignalFX. 60% of the $1.05 billion price tag will be paid for with cash on the books (Splunk had $1.67 billion in cash and equivalents at quarter end), with the balance paid in new stock. While new shares being issued will dilute current shareholders' interest, this will be a small hit as Splunk's current market cap is $19.3 billion. Overall, this is about growing a larger pie for everyone, so it's a smart move that should help Splunk maintain its sales momentum.But here's the one downside to the quarter: more negative free cash flow, a basic profit metric that calculates cash after basic operations and capital expenditures are paid for. It isn't exactly a surprise, as  during the last quarter, the result of a transition in renewable licensing contracts and subsequent revenue recognition. Splunk also said it will soon be rolling out new pricing plans, reducing the cost of its data volume-dependent model to help its customers run more information through the Splunk system -- and subsequently making the company more customer-centric. Nevertheless, while timing is certainly a factor, free cash flow is now at negative $120 million so far this year, compared to positive $102 million through the first half of last year.Headwinds to the bottom line will persist through at least the end of this year, and while some investors may fret over this situation, it's still all about top-line growth for this software company. With management giving another slight upgrade to full-year expectations and sales forecast to grow about 28%, Splunk looks like one of the best big data investments around.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Splunk also reiterated its target for fiscal 2020 adjusted operating margin to be roughly 14%.From its massive quarterly outperformance to raised guidance and an exciting acquisition to boot, there was little not to love about this report from Splunk -- apart from, perhaps, the modest dilution shareholders will endure for the stock portion of the purchase price helping fund the latter.

The data and analytics are core to every business worldwide. And while Alteryx has grown significantly in a relatively short period of time, or as I like to say, we are a great 20-year-old overnight success, we believe that we are still in the early stages of our maturity to fully capitalize on this massive opportunity. For example, based on our analysis, we believe there are approximately 8 million to 9 million potential Alteryx Designer users within the Global 2000 (largest 2,000 publicly traded companies) and we currently have less than 1% penetration within that population.\" This is leading to plenty of new customers, and existing ones are increasing their dollars spent. At the end of the second quarter, customer count was up 34% year over year, and net dollar retention rate was 133% -- implying that existing users on average increased their spending with Alteryx by 33%. It's a powerful combination that is leading to exceptional growth and one of the best gross profit margins in the software business, let alone the business world in general. Data source: Alteryx.\u00a0Pp = percentage point. \u00a0\u00a0Alteryx is an\u00a0established, 20-year-old company enjoying a surge of interest in its product, and it has plenty of potential ahead of it. What could go wrong? For one, after a red-hot run pushing prices up over 120% in 2019 alone, this stock is an expensive one.Since Alteryx barely runs a profit (on purpose, I might add, as ), investors are left with the subjective price-to-sales ratio to get a pulse on where the stock is. Valued at 28 times the last year's worth of revenue, it's a spendy price tag that assumes the company's torrid pace will continue for quite some time. For comparison, Salesforce bought Tableau for half that amount, and peer Splunk trades for 9.6 times its trailing-one-year revenue. Splunk is a much larger big data business, though, and its sales growth \"only\" clocked in at 36% during its  and carried a total gross margin of 77%. Thus, Alteryx trades at a hefty premium as investors are looking at the future potential rather than the here and now. \u00a0As is typical with high-growth stocks, though, expect Alteryx to be a highly volatile one. Risk-averse investors may want to steer clear, or at least keep the position a small one. As for everyone else, I recommend buying a little bit at a time, building out a larger position via smaller purchases on, for example, a monthly or quarterly basis. Be ready to keep your head in the sand as well. This is a long-term play, not a get-rich-quick scheme -- although Alteryx's returns so far as a public concern might argue otherwise.In short, big data is only getting bigger, and Alteryx is a key player in helping the world make sense of it all. The company should be on investors' radars as more organizations around the globe adopt new digital processes and put Alteryx to work on keeping track of it all.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Alteryx wasn't one of them!

Hello, everyone, and welcome. We are extremely proud of our Q2 results and our continued hyper growth at scale, particularly our 46% software revenue growth, 33% overall revenue growth and 80% cloud growth. In fact 25% of our business was cloud this quarter and we expect it will grow to 50% over the next few years. I'm also eager to tell you about the acquisition of SignalFx that we announced today. As you know, there are two kinds of M&A transactions, consolidation deals in troubled market categories and acceleration deals in growth categories. Make no mistake, we are proactively positioning Splunk for growth and long-term value creation. Splunk is on a mission to become nothing short of the strategic technology partner to the world's most data savvy enterprises.Before we get to the details of the acquisition, I'd like to give you a sense of where we are now and where we're going . I want to be emphatically clear, our business is firing on all cylinders and executing at highest levels .For a little data driven context, only a handful of enterprise software companies in history have had $2 billion in revenue while attaining greater than 25% revenue growth, the likes of Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware and Workday, Splunk is on track to join this short list by the end of this fiscal year. Not only is Splunk on the cusp of joining these elite companies, we've done it concurrently while making massive investments in new cloud technology and executing on a full business model change. As you know, customers today want to consume Software-as-a-Service.Our renewable business model makes it easier to do business with, and in fact customers have adopted term in Cloud faster than expected and increasing our mix from renewable by more than 10 percentage points in just one quarter to a stunning 95%. We've also evolved our pricing approach to make it easier for customers of Splunk much more of their data. Our contracting and pricing changes are making a big difference for enterprise customers. And our new pricing meaningfully expands the opportunity for Splunkable data worldwide. For example, DoorDash was able to provide an enhanced experience to all of its users from consumers to merchants to dashers through its Splunk Cloud expansion. DoorDash partners with Splunk across teams such as DevOps, IT Ops and business analytics to connect consumers with their favorite restaurants and power dashers to earn more money faster and help merchants grow their business.ABB Group a global technology leader who is driving the digital transformation of industries, selected Splunk for security through a new predictable pricing program. ABB will have Splunk and Splunk ES at the heart of their Global Security Operation Center. A large multi-billion dollar software Company significantly expanded on Splunk Cloud to take action on data across the entire business with IT Ops, security, DevSecOps and emerging business use cases. I'm also very pleased that this customer is able to utilize a new pricing program that gives them predictable pricing with no data limits. Stay tuned for much more about pricing from Splunk throughout Q3.Also our ecosystem continues to flourish, we recently expanded our strategic relationship with Cisco, which is capitalizing on integrations with the Splunk platform to rapidly bring to market new differentiated solutions that will be sold on Cisco's Global price list. A newly available security solution generated from this relationship Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics built on Splunk is now orderable and will be featured a Cisco's internal Global Sales Kickoff next week.We also just jointly announced an expansion of our strategic relationship with Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory. Deloitte's Fusion Managed Services offerings now incorporate Phantom which provides automated security monitoring and response capabilities to help clients address evolving cyber threats.According to IDC by 2025 the average person will interact with the connected device nearly 5,000 times per day. Further there'll be a 175 zettabytes of data, five times more than today, and 90% of this data will require some level of security, but less than half will actually be secured. The future is clear, data represents the biggest opportunity, and the biggest threat to businesses, governments and frankly to humanity.Splunk strategy is simple and powerful to bring data to everything. By bringing data to every question, every decision and most importantly every action, we are committed to delivering the technology platform required to instantly connect all forms of data, from any source in any format. Instantly enabling the new approach is required to produce data outcomes and stop security threats all at ferocious speed and massive scale.As part of our ambitious growth agenda today, we announced our intent to acquire SignalFx, a SaaS leader in real-time monitoring and metrics for cloud infrastructure, micro services and applications. SignalFx is a cloud-centric business that gives us best-in-class massively scalable cloud monitoring and we believe makes us a leader in observability and application performance monitoring for organizations at every stage of their cloud journey. The combination of Splunk and signalFx will give application developers and IT departments a unified data platform that allows them to monitor and observe data in real-time, no matter the infrastructure or scale in order to cut costs, boost revenue and improve the customer experience. This fit is not just from a product lines, though, I'm incredibly impressed with Karthik Rau, their Founder and CEO and the SignalFx team. We share a passion for customer success and our company cultures are a strong match. We look forward to having them as part of the Splunk team accelerating our cloud growth strategy.In conclusion, we are very proud of our Q2, we are executing in the cloud, we are executing on SaaS, we are executing in our product and technology agenda. Most importantly we are delivering real measurable economic value for over 18,000 global customers. Splunk is the company delivering the new approaches to make the right things happen at the right time to produce the right outcomes all with data. As a result, we are on track to become one of just a handful of enterprise software companies that had $2 billion in revenue while growing in excess of 25% by the end of our fiscal year.I want to personally thank our customers, our partners, our investors and most importantly, our people for working hard to turn the promise of the data future into reality. Thank you all for your time, attention and partnership. We look forward to seeing you at Comp '19 in Las Vegas, and now I will turn it over to Jason to take you through the quarter. -- Thanks, Doug and good afternoon everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. Our Q2 execution was strong highlighted by a faster transition to renewables than anticipated. Rather than provide a detailed line-by-line readout of the financials, I thought it would be best to point out a few key highlights, especially those that are the best growth indicators for the business, which you can reference on a new slide deck that we've published on our IR site. For today's report, it's important to note that all Q2 results reflect virtually constant duration of about 33 months on the TCV basis compared to Q2 last year. Second quarter revenues were $517 million, up 33% year-over-year, cloud revenue was $70 million, up 80% over last year and Q2 software revenues, which is the total of license and cloud were up $350 million, up 46% year-over-year. As Doug discussed, customers are adopting term and cloud faster than anticipated and our transition to renewable is tracking faster than planned. In Q2, 95% of software bookings were either term or cloud.We expect the elimination of perpetual license sales will accelerate renewable mix to 99% in Q4 and high 90s for the full-year. As we previewed last quarter, the accelerated shift to renewable has a timing impact on cash collections. As expected, Q2 operating cash flow was negative, given the more rapid growth of multi-year term and cloud contracts. This translates to a greater cash flow drag this year as more of our contracts are paid ratably. We are now expecting negative operating cash flow for the balance of the current year and expect fiscal '20 with $300 million net negative operating cash flow. To be clear, there are 2 new drivers behind this reduction. First that our renewable transformation is essentially complete with the mix at 95% in Q2 and expected to go to 99% by Q4. And second, we are significantly reducing our upfront cash invoicing for term and cloud deals from 58% paid upfront in the first half of '20 -- FY20 to an estimated 33% paid upfront in the second half of FY20. Again, this is all about timing. While we expect long-term cash yield to return to the mid 20% levels. The timing to get there is dependent on our term-cloud mix over the next few years.Underlying the constant increase in mix has been the substantial uptake of our cloud service. Since, introducing it just 5 years ago, ARR for cloud has grown from zero to over $300 million currently. Customer adoption of cloud is increasing rapidly and we expect momentum will accelerate from here, so much so that cloud will likely represent half of our overall business within the next few years.We ended the quarter with total RPO of $1.235 billion dollars, up 47% over Q2 of last year. The portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months was $751 million at quarter end, up 32% year-over-year. This is a new disclosure intended to provide greater granularity of RPO and its conversion to revenue over the next 4 quarters.RPO bookings was $554 million, up 19% from Q2 last year. Just to note this growth rate was understated by about 4 percentage points due to 606 related adjustments to RPO bookings last year.In Q2 we recorded 93 orders, greater than $1 million and added 500 new customers. On margins, which are non-GAAP, Q2, overall gross margin was 84%, up 2 points on a year-over-year basis. With such rapid growth in the cloud, we are realizing anticipated efficiencies and scale in that business. In Q2 cloud delivered over 50% gross margin, which is an important milestone on the way to our long-term target as 70% or more. Q2 operating margin was 9%, notably better than our plan, driven by our solid top-line performance and some investment optimizations.Turning to guidance, we expect our high growth trajectory to continue. Q3 revenue should reach approximately $600 million with a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%. For the full-year, we are now expecting total revenues of $2.3 billion, up from $2.25 billion [Phonetic] and we maintain our non-GAAP operating margin target of 14% which to confirm will include the acquired operating expense run rate of SignalFx.In closing, it was an excellent first half and we're set up for a strong finish to the year. My first full quarter here has been a complete adrenalin rush, grounded myself in the model and understanding the dynamics in the business have been top priority. With this I'm even more energized about the massive market opportunity we have in front of us and our unique position to penetrate it enhanced with the addition of SignalFx. I'm enthusiastic about the completion of our renewable transition and the outlook from here is excellent.With that, let's open it up for questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. -- Great, thank you so much and congrats on a great quarter. Jason, just so I make sure I heard it correctly. Can you just go back over your cash flow guidance for the full-year and perhaps double click a little bit deeper into it and bridge us back from the prior cash flow guidance that the company has given? -- Sure. So we actually previously had guided to positive $250 million cash flow for the full-year. The new guidance is minus $300 million. And so -- and the reason for that reduction, well, we included on the website slides kind of just a helpful overview of why this is happening, but what's happening is, one, the perpetual business which was previously anticipated to be about 15% of the total business. We said renewable 85% that was our previous guidance, we're now seeing renewable is going to go to 1% by end of year. -- Perpetual? -- I'm sorry, perpetual will be 1% by end of the year. So that is -- in perpetual as you may know, the cash is paid upfront. So if you take that reduction and apply that to the second half year of TCV which is just shy of $2 billion, you're going to lose a couple of hundred million just on that change. Second, we are changing the invoicing duration or percentage of TCV that's invoiced upfront for customers such that we're now effectively invoicing on a ratable basis, so invoicing annually. So typically our deals are 3 years, and our average duration now is about 33.5 months. So we're billing a third, a third, a third -- a third upfront, a third after-year-1, a third after year-2. And so, we previously in the first half of this year we had a higher collection closer to the -- on the combined basis, it was about 58%. The second half, we think on a combined or we project on a combined basis, is going to be closer to 33%. So if you kind of add all that up, it's about a 25% reduction in cash paid upfront on roughly $2 billion of TCV in the second half of the year that's roughly $500 million reduction and again it's all timing. We will be -- the invoicing that cash now really on an annual basis instead of upfront or less of it upfront, so we will get that cash back next year, but there will be headwinds for the balance of this year. -- Thank you so much for that. And Doug, if I could just follow up. Congrats on SignalFx, it's a really high quality company from what we know. But just to ask why now, what other alternatives might you have explored and what can you do by just bringing in the company into the fold versus the partnership that you already had with SignalFx? Thanks. -- Thanks, Brad. Good question. And, yes , you're right, there are a number of customers, we have there, joint customers. We -- as you'd expect, we've been in this IT and Dev segment really since the founding of the business. We spent a lot of time perusing all the different alternatives in this segment and I can't, think of a company in the overall NextGen Dev and APM segment that we haven't personally met with and/or investigated deeply. As you suggested, we view SignalFx as the top tier asset for the things that matter to our customers, which is incredible scale high-high accuracy around metrics observability in this very ephemeral NextGen cloud architecture that everybody is leaning into to try and get application velocity across AWS ,TCP and Azure, as well as OpenShift. The complement that we see between the two and this has proven out to a number of these big companies that use our best-in-class, best scale, log aggregation and metrics extraction with the more real-time streaming metrics capability that SignalFx have, is a world-class quite instrument deck as you're flying super high-speed plane which is SignalFx to make sure that you're going in the right direction, combined with a world-class investigative capability. And so, when that instrument deck signals something at the high accuracy that SignalFx is able to, you're able to actually very quickly dive in, understand what the root cause is, whether you should be paying attention to it or not and then remediated accurately. And so, it really helps us, if you think about this, whole generation of IT systems, which are generating the data that's so critical to companies, at the backbone having logs, metrics and tracing as a three core elements that all need to be done with high-high accuracy, incredible scale and enterprise-grade features across that suite. We feel this is a highly strategic and important addition to the portfolio. -- Very exciting. And congrats on all the success. Thanks -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Brad.Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. -- Hey, Perfect. Hey, thank you. Congrats from me as well on SignalFx. And if I can stay on it, like how do you, Doug, how do you think about the product integration? How to think about this like are you having to bring the products together, are these going to work side-by-side like -- how does this kind of come together? Thanks and then I have a follow-up. -- Hey, Raimo. Thanks for the question. So again going to the handful of these customers we've spent time with, as we say over and over we're customer success firs, and very customer centric. So, in addition to all the great investigations we've been doing and meeting we've been having, listening to our customers helps a lot. And when you're dealing -- I'll give an example, there is a Fortune 50 world-class consumer retailer that uses Splunk as a backbone for everything, they're doing across their expansive online portfolio and uses SignalFx as well.And they're working very effectively side-by-side right now. SignalFx, when you think about any big consumer introduction online you end up getting crunched with both human activity and bot activity, SignalFx does a really nice job of providing that instrumentation so that they know where they need to pay attention to anything, and we can optimize the revenue that they are trying to drive with one of these great introductions. And then, Splunk is right there by its side as anything is being signaled to dive in and help them understand what the reality of that situation is and what they should do if anything to make sure that they keep their revenue customer experience go in the right direction.I do believe that there is -- and obviously we believe as part of this acquisition that there are going to be some significant benefits to tighter integration between those two. The constant transposition and learning that happens between logs, metrics and traces goes back to the framework that we've been talking about with you guys on the pillars of this next-generation data landscape . We've got to have an effective investigative pillar, monitoring, analytics and action set of capabilities and those who are working in concert provide the ability for organizations to have that real-time sense and respond approach. And so, as we get full approval for the acquisition and the teams could actually start working together at the detailed level, I'd like to. I fully anticipate and Tim Tully, our CTO and Head of Development anticipates that we'll see some very interesting and rapid integrations being developed and delivered to market between the two products. -- Perfect. And then just a clarification. So, Jason, thanks for all the extra disclosure. And the one thing I wanted to double-click on, so you said the current RPO 12 months which is different from the 24 current definition that you had before I just want to make sure that you moved to 12 months. So because that's kind of a very good step in the right direction. -- That's right. -- Well done .Okay, thank you. That's really helpful. Thank you, well done. -- It's right on. -- Hey Raimo your key on that guidance. So thank you for giving us that feedback earlier in the year as well. -- Perfect, thank you. -- Thanks. -- Thank you. And our next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.Thank you. So Doug -- and thanks Jason for going through the cash flow details there because that's really important. But Doug, you've made a comment in your opening remarks, you said the new pricing expanse a Splunkable data, can you expand on that a little bit, is there some new pricing out there that I don't know just recently news. Because as you know, at least in investment community, this is always one of the things that's talked about with Splunk, probably more so than even the customer community. But if you could expand on that a little bit? That'd be great. -- Yes. Absolutely, John. So we did release pricing internally to our teams that we're going to be broadcasting much more loudly over the course of this quarter, so that everybody understands what -- how we've shifted. There are two dimensions to the pricing and when I went through my examples, ABB was one and a large multi-billion dollar software company was the other. One is for people that have digested the data volume piece, if you got contracts there, whether they but they like it or not, they understand it and they're comfortable with it. We've crafted a predictive pricing framework that very clearly illustrates organization of any size, what their unlimited footprint looks like and move these people to much more coarse-grained terabyte-sized bands and we get them to unlimited much more quickly, where we're trying to show them is that there is a terminal value for the core Splunk Enterprise box and by terminal value I mean there is a logical point after being in business for so many years, with today's offering and features and functions where we know that we're only X% of a software budget and we want them to understand that we know that, they know that and that data is not really the gate for them, So they can stop worrying about filtering data.Alternatively, we also been rolling out infrastructure base metric, kind of a virtual CPU, Splunk virtual core type thing that has no data to it at all. And then that just allows the customer to use infrastructure, they want to, they can add or delete as much compute and then pay for storage separately as they want, and therefore they can process unlimited amounts of data. The only difference is the speed of response, so the overall interface that people have with the system, you add more infrastructure you get faster response, you add less you get a little bit less -- less response but -- and we've heard loud and clear through the years that pricing, we need to be more thoughtful on pricing, we've been iterating and iterating through the 3.5 years I've been in the seat and a piece of that -- of those iterations were learning what customers -- what really worked for customers, no pricing is perfect.The other piece of that is, continue to expand the portfolio beyond the index. If you really look at our portfolio, and I said this during a lot of meetings that we've had with you and your peers in the past couple of quarters, the only product -- the only three products that are priced on any version of the index or index-based enterprise security, IT, science Splunk enterprise everything else in the portfolio is now priced on a different metric, and we just came out with the alternative metric to data volume with the infrastructure based metric for the core enterprise stack as well.So very important move. I think for our customers. And as we rolled it out internally in Q2 we saw some very positive response from customers. My prediction was to see the same even probably more positive response in Q3 as it becomes more well-known and the reps are a little bit more conversant with it and we go external with it as well, so that customers are leaning in the same time our reps are helping them with that. -- That's great. That is -- that's really interesting and thank you. Thank you for that detail, Doug. And I guess it was -- and just a quick follow-up, the numbers look really good. Right, and -- and I'd like to follow up another product question. I'm going to -- pre-SignalFx as you had a couple of those. But you mentioned Phantom too and in the world of security and orchestration Phantom that -- as you know customers are just I think overwhelmed by all the security products they needed to use to protect the enterprise and you have companies like Palo Alto and Check Point that are trying to put everything under one roof. And Phantom's score to this is like neutral thing that brings everything together, and still like choose a best of breed, those companies would say they have best of breed within their own roof, but is that -- I've always thought of that is kind of nirvana that you should be working toward. And I guess my question is, how close are you to that sort of nirvana like how broadly is Phantom being used in an enterprise and some of your -- I guess even the ones that use it the most across your entire security product portfolio? -- Great, great question, John. So one you're leaning right into 10 and doing org approach to Phantom, which is the 'orc' part is as important, maybe even more important than the store part of the S on your, I mean orchestration and automation are critical whether you are from an IT department to security apartment to manufacturing apartment, sales or marketing and part of what we love about Phantom is the elegance of the architecture to be able to extend the orchestration-automation as part of the overall platform, no matter what the use cases are. The other part that we really love about it is all the security content that makes the security orchestration-automation response framework. And I agree with you completely that we can't see a landscape and security and really I think in IT also, but in the security use case where you're not going to have a lot of volatility. There is so much changing so quickly that new products will come in and old products will go out on a continuous basis and whether it's Splunk or Phantom -- it's the Splunk index or Phantom are now increasingly next generation metrics and tracing stores. Our job across our layer is to try and be the abstraction framework that allows all those critical transactional elements that are both preventing and detecting and trying to manage that security landscape to be at the control of the customer. They can swap in and swap those out whenever they want and we will continue to work to make sure that there is an automation-orchestration routine that ties in the existing stuff and the new stuff and that there is an effective correlation and decision framework, a brain, to tell that nervous system what to do. But the corresponding products is the brain, Phantom is a nerve center, and you still need the muscles which are all those different products from firewall to virus an endpoint protection et cetera that need to actually do a ton of the work and I think part of the acceleration of the entire security portfolio, is it really helps that security leader feel like they're in control of the landscape and the landscape isn't in control of them. -- Okay. Well, it sounds like the journey is really in process here, Thanks a lot Doug and Jason. -- Thank you, John. -- Thank you, John, and good luck on your next gig. It's been great working with you. -- Save me [Indecipherable] -- Thanks, John.Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. -- Excellent. Thank you, guys. Excellent quarter and really nice acquisition indeed, and it makes a lot of sense in the portfolio. It seems to me with this acquisition, you guys are sort of weighing in on the debate on whether monitoring APM, infrastructure monitoring, log monitoring is going to be consolidating into one platform with this acquisition of SignalFx. If that's the case. Is there any other pieces of the puzzle that you need to put into place to get that complete monitoring view in that consolidating environment? -- Good question. Keith. On the 4 pillars we talk about 3 of them are very data-centric and one is fed by the data; investigate, monitor, analyze and act. I think that the one platform thing is interesting because if I go underneath the covers the way that an investigative framework is built, the Splunk Index is an example, it's purpose-built -- why we're so effective is, it's purpose-built to be truly world-class, and in a category of one for that schema-less, high-speed, high-cardinality, investigative suite that you need to drive. That is a different architecture than what you need for that same scale of monitoring where you've got instead of a flattened set of kind of random logs you've got very well defined, but many, many, many points of data in a metric flow. And that's different again than a more rich multi-dimensional all app framework, so you wind up with different technologies across the pillars, if you really want to be best-in-class and that is part of the real excitement of SignalFx and these guys learned the hard way Inside Facebook in one of the highest scaled organizations in the world what it takes to monitor these ephemeral environments back before that was a common buzzword and observability is being talked about outside of the walls of the Facebooks and Googles and Twitters, so they have a lot of experience, they've built a truly world-class framework. I think tracing is a really good important expansion area there as well that's a little bit different architected than what's helping those metrics and then I still -- we still really are excited about that whole all app journey. I mean, look at things like data fabric search, the point of data fabric search is to make sure that whether you choose our core technologies in those pillars or a third-party, we can still be the interface for the end user, to take advantage of that data wherever it lives, because for us to compete in that data -- next-generation data warehousing area that's tough.That's a really specialty set of skills, so let's make sure that whether we think we've got the best-in-class solution like SignalFx now and Splunk or whether that best-in-class solution is in some other platform, some other company, we can still help our customers extract value. -- Got it. And make a ton of sense. And then one follow-up on new customer adds that's one KPIs that hasn't been hitting kind of the targets that you guys had laid out previously. Can you talk to us about the efforts in place to ramp up sort of new customers coming into the door, if you will? -- Yeah, absolutely. We had 500 new customers this quarter. We think that we're on track to exceed 2,000 this year, which gets us at 20,000 mark that we had forecasted for you guys a year-and-a-half ago at Analyst Day. We continue to lean in a bunch of different activities to make sure that our products are viral at the low end, so that we can get that rapid immediate footprint, but the strength of Splunk and decision that most companies have to make on their journey is, the virality is awesome, but at some point in time, if you've done it properly, it becomes a critical set of infrastructure that critical set of infrastructure usually now spans the entire organization, it usually carries a higher price tag. And so there is a constant unioning of touch list, which we still have happening with cloud trials and downloads across the entire Splunk portfolio and the important element is convert those lightweight touches to pervasive enterprise wide deals, which is why that 2,000 plus mark per year is always going to be important for us. The conversion of those 2,000 and making sure we get effective wallet share and that the overall ASPs within our existing accounts continue to go up. It's probably give you the more important motion from revenue and overall growth perspective. -- That's all. Nice job on the quarter, guys. -- Thanks, Keith. -- Thanks, Keith.Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. You may proceed with your question. -- Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Doug, maybe to start with you, as we kind of think about bigger picture trends around enterprise IT procurement, we started to see a lot of the center of gravity on procurement shifted developers. So as it relates to the SignalFx acquisition, how do you feel this could open up a buying audience that you weren't maybe necessarily tapping into it optimally? And then I have a follow-up as well. -- Yeah, I think that that's one of the many exciting parts about the SignalFx addition to the fold. We did buy VictorOps roughly a year ago and that certainly has helped going back to net news and Keith's question, we still are trying to maintain consistency on net news around the corresponding products and VictorOps is much more of that viral, low touch, true developer-centric footprint that's had some nice traction for us, but I think that combined with SignalFx now gives us a much more interesting footprint for direct developer approach, but then ultimately development team is tied back to IT Ops team someone's got to -- whether it's your true next-generation SRE and CI/CD, there is a divide in the classic IT ops and DevOps world. Those two activities to have to work together, so ITSI and Core Splunk combined with SignalFx and VictorOps, I think gives us a really interesting, end-to-end coverage whether we're meeting with individual developer or a manager of development team, all the way back up to the head of engineering or the head of IT Ops across a complex infrastructure landscape. -- That makes sense, and maybe just dovetailing that into some of your very specific comment around pricing and being more flexible with the customer based on the pricing front. With the 2Q data points that you have, how should we and investors think about maybe the pricing delta versus the traditional data indexing model because I think maybe the perception is that your pricing power is may be coming down as you change some of the metrics and some of the underlying infrastructure things that you anchored to. So if you can just comment on pricing and in how in a capacity based data ingestion world that compares to some of the newer things that you're trying out from an infrastructure based perspective, and that would be super helpful? Thank you. -- Sure. That's good question. Fatima When I -- when I must have had 2,000 to 3m000 customer actions now over the past five years -- by almost six years I've been here. And I have never once heard one customer at any account say I have no more data that I even know exists that could take advantage of. We've got the opposite problem, which is I am trying to be super thoughtful and judicious on what data put in the Splunk only because you've told me that should pay attention to that metric because it's a data volume-based pricing metric. So what we're trying to do -- what we've seen and what we believe and why this predictive pricing with clear guidelines to unlimited for people that are still wrap their heads around the data volume piece is so important, is we think that we are 3% to 15% penetrated with the data that people would like to put through Splunk within organizations and if we relax that data volume piece then that we can really serve customers. And going back to customer success being our number one focus areas as a company. So I think that what we see -- what we saw in Q2, as we really rolled this out internally that we will see people take on the appropriate amount of data, because the data volume pieces is one of the scary element and we'll see volumes go up dramatically through the Splunk backbone. Just as a quick update, our largest customer is ingesting over 12 petabytes of data per day, real-time streaming data per day, up from less than 4 petabytes at the beginning of the year. So we view an almost infinite possibility of data. Now you combine that with non-database -- non-data amount pricing from SignalFx, from DSP, from our data stream processor, from Data Fabric Search, from Phantom, from VictorOps all those either deal with data or take advantage of data flowing through the pipe, so landing in different storage elements, the value only goes up with those products. So the whole move was to just finally come clean with everybody, hey, put as much data as you want in Splunk and either govern that through applying infrastructure with it or we'll give you a framework for -- we just stop charging you for data and don't -- again you're saving on infrastructure costs, but you manage that infrastructure. So you can get to the right amount of data not worrying about the cost of the data. -- That's helpful. Thank you, Doug. -- Thanks, Fatima.Thank you. And our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch . You may proceed with your question. -- Hi. Thank you very much. I am just curious if you have included the -- how much is going to be the revenue impact of SignalFx in your guidance for the second half of the year and also congrats to Kartik, if he is on the call here, on the acquisition. And secondly from a financial perspective, it looks like the shift is mostly done. So, Jason, you talked about a mid '20s cash flow yield, what kind of timeframe where we're talking about with respect to that kind of mid '20s cash flow yield, it could it be worst case calendar '21 or somewhere between calendar 2021 because we've gone through the shift and we've endured the cash flow drop. So I would expect it as sharp as the cash flow revision has been on the downside, its upswing should also be equally sharp on the positive side. Right? -- Yeah. Let me start off by saying it's OK. It is still lead with the Rush quote if you want cash. We're not as hardcore as Karthik but we still like Rush. -- I did say I got an adrenaline rush in the job. Okay. -- I mean that's the rush part, right, we've got SignalFx? (Multiple Speakers) -- So, first on the question about SignalFx revenue embedded in guidance, we effectively didn't include their revenue in guidance. And so it's just -- we did include cost because we know what cost we're going to be incurring. In terms of revenue, we'll update that when the completion -- or when we complete the acquisition. In terms of the second question on -- the tougher one on cash -- kind of a snapback on cash. So here's kind of the issue, the issue is your -- for the term, so perpetual now gone which is hard on cash, but much better on I think the long-term durability of the business. The downside on term, we do recognize three years, if you take the average term deal for every $3 in revenue recognized in revenue, you get $1 in cash. Since we're billing it annually but receiving most of the revenue upfront. So it has a relatively low cash yield as you are booking it. Of course, you get the benefit in the later years as that comes . Now -- so the problem is, because we were booking at a higher percentage of those three-year term deals or receiving a higher percentage of that cash, almost two-thirds of the cash upfront up until very recently, you are now going to have that headwind through the balance of this year and really through the -- definitely we'll feel the effect next year as well. The second aspect is, as you move to cloud, you will -- there you have a ratable business for every dollar of revenue, you have $1 of cash. So that's a high cash flow business. So the reality is we have to project that mix and that mix, it's been moving quicker than we had expected, and so committing to that timeframe is hard. So at this point, I think it's likely that you will not see the mid 20s until after '21 .But that's obviously something that we will monitor as we see the impact of mix between those two businesses over the next coming quarters . -- Got it. -- Does that answer you question? -- Yeah, it does. I mean the perpetual is the worst part, I mean that's the biggest detractor to your cash flow. And that is down to one, so it should be more manageable, I would imagine, right, between term and cloud, which is -- I'm surprised that you don't have some kind of a range for cash flow mix. You granted that we are going to be mid-20s that's going to be after '21 but I would implore that we gave a little bit more talk to having some range, albeit as broad as it can be because you have more definitiveness today than you had say two months back? -- Yes. I would say as we give full-year guidance, which will happen in Q4 then we'll probably be ready to talk about it then. -- Got it. All right, cool. Thanks, guys -- And Kash, as you saw with what Jason and Ken included with the visuals where we are trying to get much more aggressive at transparency and visibility, so that everyone can be dialed. So as we get a little bit closer to next year, and we really understand the effects of everything that we're putting in motion right now. I feel pretty confident that no matter what the answer is, you will have clarity on why the answer is the answer with less opaqueness . -- Wonderful. We'll see you guys at Dot Conference. -- Sounds good, thank you. -- Thanks, Kash.Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. You may proceed with your question. -- Hi, thank you. Question for Jason on CRPO, you gave an RPO bookings number, I think, of 19% . I don't think we have the information to be able to calculate the CRPO bookings number, is that something you could give us if you like. That's a little bit more of a standard duration constant and all that measure of growth? -- So, I'm sorry. You're asking for current RPO historical metric? -- Yes, CRPO bookings know or you have a Q1 or something to calculate the bookings. I don't think we can calculate that this quarter given we don't have Q1. -- The website slides we provided -- the links on the slide actually shows current RPO going back five quarters. -- Oh, got it. Okay, perfect. And then, Doug, I'm wondering on the transition, it seems like it happened pretty quickly In the quarter to renewable. Is there something I know the pricing seems like it's been sort of unofficially rolled out, so that probably didn't drive it. Is there something you attribute the -- driving that significant shift in such a short amount of time with -- in terms of renewables? -- Yes. You know I don't think the pricing had anything to do with it. I think we for a year-and-a-half now we've been leaning in on term and cloud. We've put incentives in place starting year-and-a-half ago to make both more attractive and perpetual. So I think for the first time a year-and-a-half ago our reps were leading with term and cloud and whether we like it or not sales teams tend to focus on the commission plan. So when paid more, they were leading with perp and now we've made it more attractive for term and cloud and they're leading with -- and we think it helped make a bigger secular trend that we're all dealing with you guys report on a million times a day, and there's a continued shift to cloud and as people are wrapping their heads around both their SaaS applications and other SaaS infrastructure and platform-as-a-service capability.So much of IT spend is going to OpEx anyway that I think that except for a handful of companies and some limited industries, everyone is actually asking for the opposite, which is, can I -- I need my budget to be simple no matter how the heck you are giving me the stuff. Can you please just fit into the OpEx category because my entire spend rate has shifted that way. And so, I think that there is a bigger trend that again is just carrying us long because it really was primarily customer saying, you know you guys even having perpetual is making my job harder because now I'm going back to the CFO and we're debating one versus the other, and just -- if you just took it away it'd just make it easier. And of course with term and cloud, we can offer a lot of these different pricing constructs and other pieces that make it a little more friendly to do business with us. -- Great. And then Jason, just on the CRPO I think we just don't have the 1Q of last year is the issue. So I don't know if that's something you can provide, but that'd be great. I think the 5 quarters stopped at 2Q of last year. -- Yes. If it's 47% growth this year, then you can you can infer it and you've got the Q2. -- With the growth rate from Q1, '20 you can get to each element of RPO. -- Oh, got it. Okay. We'll back into it. Okay, thank you. -- Got it. Thank you, Walter.Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO. You may proceed with your question. -- Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to ask 2 questions. The first one is back on cash flow for a second -- next year at a minimum, if you're perpetual has gone from 10 to 1 just to make it zero. Isn't that as a starting point, a $200 million benefit to your cash flow for next year versus the headwind that you're facing this year? -- No. Because perpetual is booked -- is collected the cash is 100% upfront and when you flip that to term and cloud, you're going to be booking one --yeah one-third of it, but if at all -- Yeah. So it's... -- You have to assume that you're doing that much perpetual. It's a one-time occurrence, not a repeat occurrence for perpetual. -- Yes, sorry. Yeah, I mean philosophically if you have a headwind this year in you remove it next year, right? I mean it's a $200 million -- anyway I agree with Kash's previous comment, I think it would be helpful to get some guidance and comments around cash flow for next year. Just again on the elimination of perpetual headwind it should be more beneficial. Transition to the RPO bookings, so I'm going to speak from the slide, I just wanted to get a little bit help on what the narrative is, so all the metrics look good. Your RPO bookings were down a little bit in terms of you're going from 48% growth in Q2 '19 to Q2 '20 was 19% growth. So it is -- has slowed a bit. Is there anything that you want to comment as it relates to the RPO bookings in particular and why that might be slowing or is it just lumpy? -- So, well, there is certainly some lumpiness to it, but the first thing I'd say -- so the 19% should really be -- if you take out the -- when we implemented 606 there was an adjustment that related to prior year, if you normalize that it's 400 basis points. The year-on-year growth absent that adjustment is 23%. So you should think of it as really being 23% on a comparable basis. Now, I would say that -- and that's... -- It's still not a sterling number. -- Which is still not a sterling number. So if you then look at other growth metrics -- so you probably see billings is 29%, RPO bookings adjusted is 23%, revenue was 33%, software revenue 46% and cloud 80% . So, you have this potpourri of growth metrics and I've been here roughly 90 days and I've been looking at those, trying to figure out like what really is the right growth metric to focus on and I know in the past, we've talked about software revenue. And as I looked at it, I said, well, other than it's a high number of 46%, why is that the right number? Well, when I look at it and kind of unpack it, I see that, one, the maintenance and services growth is slowing. And the reason it's slowing is for 2 reasons. One, as we move to cloud, the maintenance and services are eliminated because those are embedded into cloud. So it's all recorded as cloud revenue.Second, we're relying more and more on partners to provide those professional services for us, it's not a high margin business, it's better for them to do. So. If you want to think about what is really the right growth rate to focus on to say what's the core underlying growth? It is really software revenue. So I think you will see the lumpiness in RPO bookings, there is a -- there are impacts, I think you should look at software revenue and you will see move in RPO bookings, but I think it was probably a little bit low this quarter. Again, the adjustment is a key driver, but it will probably be a little bit lumpy because of the fact that we have large TCV numbers and timing of when the deal hits and all that kind of stuff can make that move around a bit. -- Okay, great. I think the deal makes perfect sense. Congratulations on that. And thanks very much for the slide deck, much appreciate it. -- You bet. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt He berg with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. -- Thanks. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. Following up from some comments we did last quarter talking about the vertical solution field teams. Could you just give us an update on kind of how the implementations of those have gone? I know it's probably pretty early still. -- Yeah. Great question, Matt. So the -- just for people who don't remember, when I talked the last quarter as we -- Susan St. Ledger, our President, hired a Head of Verticals. That verticals team now has 7 to 12 people depending on vertical that are focused on flushing out specific use cases in the vertical and financial services, retail, manufacturing , healthcare, public sector telecommunications and so a handful of verticals. They're really not sales teams, they are more technical evangelist teams that can certainly help on the sales side, but it's different than security sales specialists or an IT Dev sales specialists who is focused on making sure that we actually secure an independent deal within those accounts, working with the account generalist -- account the RSM. They have been doing some really good work. As I've told last quarter, we've got an e-book published by the financial services vertical that highlights. I think 31 different use cases that those guys have found that are mostly non-security and IT-based, probably 80%, non-security and IT-based and you'll see more of those being published as the guidebooks,, and recipes and direction centers when you move beyond security and IT. Ultimately what we're hoping for is that somebody us or a partner gets enough understanding of those use cases and seize the market potential that they actually craft application around it, and so it's way of trying to seed the market for non-security, non-IT, non-Dev-based use cases that eventually turn into applications. It's been really helpful I think for our customers in those verticals and for us to continue to visualize the multitude of different use cases with Slunk that we tell every earnings call, and people talk about Slunk live but they're kind of anecdotal and not written down. And this an attempt to make sure that there is a whole cookbook recipe guide book to make them less anecdotal. -- That's really helpful. And then it seems like -- can I get one more on SignalFx? It's really well suited for containerized environments, could you just talk about how pervasive that technology is through your installed base? -- I think there is -- there are very few customers I've met with that do not have active development activities in the cloud. And as they're developing the cloud they're obviously using the native services through microservices containers, Kubernetes, etcetera. So I think it is incredibly -- it is a undeniable wave that's happening. When you go back and look at the workloads that are being driven it's still is a small percentage of the total workload. Now a lot of the applications still wind up signaling or integrating with core applications back on Mainframe release boxes or Windows servers, they are back in the data center, but we expect that wave to continue as does Amazon, and Google and Microsoft and everybody else is participating. They've been providing that visibility around those environments, coupled with the rest of the landscape is something that team has been very clear on -- our customer team has been very clear as being important. -- All right, thanks. -- Thanks, Matt.Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question. -- Hey, guys. That. Good evening, and really great deal. Wonderful to see branching and broadening out this way. So a couple of financial questions, first -- and also just a clarification, just to confirm, Jason, are we -- are you at 100% annual invoicing -- annual billings is that now the rule of deals are annually invoice .? -- Yes. We were very, very close to 100% which is, I mean we have a 33.5 month average duration. So call it basically a three-year annual term and we are basically saying, if you look at Slide 13 of the website slides, I tried to help folks understand , how this works and it basically shows that a 33% invoicing which is basically annual billing. So very few exceptions, but on average annual billing is correct. -- If someone wants to give us the money. We will not ship it back. We don't want to pay them to give out the money? -- Well, I mean look I'm a CFO who used to buy all the services from Splunk and every one of the SaaS providers I've bought from all of them. And yes, it is -- no one is going to write a big check upfront unless they get a massive discount and so that's why -- or it just slows down negotiation and takes much longer. So this is what the market has been going. And that's why it makes sense . -- Okay. And I don't know. Are you able to cut through the noise regarding an adjustment on RPO for 606 and backing into the year ago and just tell us what the current RPO bookings was on a year-over-year basis? I think, Walter was asking for us. -- This is Ken. Let me clarify that. So you can get the total RPO growth rate from Slide 5 on the -- in the deck, but -- he's right, the current is not broken down. So here it is, so we've already disclosed $765 million as our total RPO in Q1 of '19, of that $238 million was current -- sorry, $238 million was long-term $526 million was current. $765 million total ,$238 million long-term ,$526 million short-term. Okay. Then the RPO adjustment Jason can answer that. -- Right. Yeah, OK. I mean, we're not going back and forth too many times unless you have it. I want to know [Indecipherable] get the current bookings adjusted for RPO. So if you got that that's great, it'd be great otherwise maybe we could do it offline. -- Yeah. So if you were to adjust RPO bookings -- if you were to go, same Slide 5, you would basically see Q4 '19 would go down by 400 basis points, so call it 37 instead of 41. In Q2 would go up from 19 to 23. -- Okay. All right, we'll do more offline. I'm just going to -- if I can sneak one more in, I'm just going to try to take another shot at the cash flow outlook, and I know we could get a range for next year, and I think you said after calendar '21 is when we get back to target but our for fiscal '21 at least cash flow from ops positive? -- I'm sorry, I'd say yeah fiscal '21 you're right, after fiscal '21. Now, it's -- again it depends on the mix shift. And so I just want to make sure it's very clear. This is tricky. So, I think before -- I think it was Keith or someone asked about headwind and how there wouldn't be a headwind on perpetual. Again, I want make sure it's very clear, with the perpetual you're basically collecting three years of cash upfront. So when I switch that to term the following year, I'm collecting one-third of cash upfront. So it is a headwind of two-thirds when that happens. So that's the headwind that you see just on lapping perpetual. And then on term we were collecting about 50% on average for the first half of this year, that's going to go to roughly 33% for next year. And then in the meantime, you have -- if you want to look at yield it gets more confusing because then, those are both perpetual and term are recognizing three years of revenue effectively upfront, at least on the license portion, when you get to cloud it's one-for-one. A $1 revenue to $1 of cash. So you have to look at all three dimensions to -- or all three dependent variables, not just one. -- Understood. My question was just in terms of looking forward, can we at least say that the fiscal '21 you guys will be cash flow from ops positive?I\"m not ready to say that now. Because again it depends complete -- I mean, we will be cash flow positive in some quarters, but to say what full-year is going to be after '21. I'm just, it's, there is -- I have to forecast multiple variables. I'm just not ready to do that yet. I'll do it by the end of this year, but not ready to do it yet. -- All right. Thanks very much and congrats on the acquisition. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. You may proceed with your question. -- Great. Thanks very much, Doug back on the pricing change are you fairly confident that upon renewal, people will be paying you more on a like-for-like basis? -- What you mean on like-for-like basis? -- So, can an existing customer renew to this new pricing model, or is that only sort of this idea of unlimited, so they have to get bigger? -- So right now we only have very few unlimited contracts. So for people to move to unlimited from their current payment stream will be an uplift for all but those unlimited customers and even with those unlimited their current there is usually some type of framework that has CPI and other adjustments that there is a moderate expansion. But the big expansion for existing Splunk Enterprise unlimiteds and hopefully we'll be adding more of those over time is we've got to grow the portfolio. Yeah, we got to add SignalFx, and Phantom, and DSP and DFS and come back in and say awesome you got unlimited for Splunk Enterprise let's roll that forward and increase it because of these new products.When I look at our installed base, there is so much upward pressure from every single account I've ever met with in my entire career at Splunk, I might have seen like two years in, which is the more you buy the more you want to buy. And I just -- yes, that's part of why I think people are frustrated with our pricing model is everyone knows data is exploding and you're going to hold me ransom. And we've been working with a multitude of different formats including this EAA structure that we I think just got much more aggressive on, to say, we really, really, really will not hold you ransom. That's not who we are. We're not Oracle. We are a company that is focusing on making sure that we make you guys productive and happy and we know there is a fair value exchange here between what we are providing and what you want to give us. So I'd expect upward pressure within our accounts as they expand. And we've got to make sure that our portfolio expansion continues to be attractive to them as well, irrespective of what the expansion looks like within the Splunk Enterprise Index. -- Great. And then Jason one quick follow-up, can you give us what the contracted but unbilled was? Or the impact in the last quarter was about $80 million. -- Contract but unbilled, $200 million. -- Great. Thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. You may proceed with your question.Okay. Josh, let's keep going, please. -- Sorry I was on mute. So good afternoon guys. Just want to commend Jason along with a couple of the other just on the additional disclosures, so first a clarification, if I may. So, previously you had guided $250 million in cash flow from ops this year and now it's minus $320 million. So a $570 million swing and you talked about the two dynamics that in total appear to represent $700 million delta. So does that mean that if we were to hold invoicing duration and the renewables mixed constant with what you had expected 90 days ago that your fiscal '20 cash flow from ops would have been about $100 million or so higher than your prior guidance? Or is that not the case? -- Okay. First let me clean up some of the statements. So we guided to minus $300 million, not $320 million. So that's a reduction of $550 million from the $250 million guidance that we had previously -- I'd also said that the, if you look at Slide 13 in the attached website slide that shows that we went from collecting 58% mix adjusted upfront to now collecting 33%. So it's a 20% reduction. 25% times the second half TCV which is roughly about $2 billion, that's the 500-ish million headwind. There is a little more because of the SignalFx acquisition, couple of things, so that's how you get to the $550 million. Now, I'm sorry can you ask me again what the second part of your question was? -- Would it been higher if we hadn't seen perpetual move and if we hadn't just shorten the duration? -- So . Slide 13 shows what the impact from perpetual as it went from a mix adjusted 10 to 1. So you could say 9% times that $200 million and then you could do the same thing for the other two buckets of term and cloud. -- Okay. Correct. And at least again based on my math, it does appear that apples-to-apples it would have gone up, if not for again invoicing duration and the higher renewables mix? -- Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, definitely. -- Okay. I just wanted to confirm that. And then secondly -- so a follow-up on pricing for the correlation guys obviously is not plus one but historically you've spoken about how increases in data volumes also drive clear increases in revenue each and every year. And I wanted to ask if that will still hold true under the predictive pricing as well> -- Yeah, it should, I mean, the predictive pricing doesn't grant every existing customer unlimited license. It provides a path where they can see that, well, I'm sitting at X and there is N bands and those bands are much more coarse-grained, now if I get to unlimited. So that at least they feel high visibility and much more in control of the data they currently have and what the price point will be for data that they will potentially out in the future. And so, we'd still expect much like our cohort showed in the past that very few people are going to come, jump in right at the unlimited, they're going to start with 100 gigs or terabyte or 5 terabytes and that prove out their value to the platform and eventually realize, holy cow I want as much as I can consume when we get to that upper band. And then you couple that with the many products that have come out over the past year-and-a-half, including products that we've added inorganically like Phantom and now Solus and VictorOps that complement that whole cohort discussion on the corresponding enterprise piece. So there's been two levers, we've been pushing, make sure that we're clear on what Splunk Enterprise does well and to complement Splunk Enterprise craft new technologies to the side or on top of it that bring even more to life and then make it easier for people to consume Splunk Enterprise. -- Okay, that's great. Thank you. -- Thanks, Greg.Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed with your question. -- Okay. Good afternoon. I would like to start with a clarification on the impacts from the end of the perpetual licenses. So I understand, the cash flow impact, but are you factoring in any potential customer churn or any revenue impact from that decision that we should consider? -- Yeah. In our overall forecast and we just drove we raised guidance to '23. A chunk of that forecast was the pipeline that we're working with, a chunk that is really understanding from the early indicators of the pricing what is going to happen on both the puts and the takes. There will be some people that decide, if you're not going offer me perpetual, I don't want to do business anymore. I don't -- I've not done that yet, we have not had any of those occurrences yet, but it's not as broadly known and we're not retiring new sales perpetual until November 1. So we've sent out an internal memo to our sales force and the partners and made its way through some investor checks and partner channel world, over to you guys. So there still -- it's not an immediate thing, but it will be happening starting in Q4. We think we feel confidence in the guidance that we're driving and believe that in general, it's a very positive element, both for us and for the customers. It gives them what they want and enable us to serve them the way that we want to, which is more data driven insights, more data driven actions, more data driven outcomes that they've been asking for from Splunk Enterprise. And with that... -- Thank you. And I was just wondering if you could comment on the competitive landscape, specifically against Elastic, and perhaps are your new pricing models have impacted your win rates? Thank you. -- Yes. I think we have been pretty consistent in reporting what our win rates look like against Elastic and they remain very high. I've said over and over that one of the things that makes me excited, but also gives me pause for concern is when your average win rates against competitors are north of 80%, that means you're just not being exposed to all the opportunities that are out there. I think that one of the things that's been holding us back is people are really afraid about the price of Splunk. It's not so much the price, they are worried about this data driven metric because again I have yet to meet with the customer that says I'm not getting a fair exchange of value for the dollars that I'm shipping you or euros or whatever the heck quantity is, they're saying I don't like the fact that I feel out of control because we all know that data volumes are going to go up. So I would anticipate and hope that this will continue to substantiate or accelerate those win rates. The win rates that I see are super consistent. We had been playing around with a bunch of different things and I realize how important this is and data is absolutely critical to my future or my Next-Gen infrastructure is going to go to my future but a cyber resilience in my corporation is critical to my future. I need something with enterprise scale with high resiliency, with the right features and functions allow me to deal with a very large population internally and externally and gosh darn it I need Splunk. The more that we can make that Splunk journey from the very first try all the way through the enterprise license the better, but ultimately our bread and butter is, and it has been for so many years, we really understand these very complex landscape and we're able to quote companies are doing 5-10-15 terabytes -- petabytes of data per day, which are those few that really understand the power of data. -- Great, thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Doug for any further remarks. -- I really appreciate the great questions in the call. We are, as I said, very proud of our Q2 and I just want to reach out to the SignalFx team that they may not be listening to the call, bit certainly speaking on a recorded basis, we are incredibly excited to have you join the overall Splunk team. I think the combination of the two of us will be extremely powerful for our customers. I appreciate, so much the customer centricity that you guys have, that we live every single day and you're joining a really motivated group of folks, people that natively grown up in Splunk and other organizations like you that found their way through an acquisition and to all of our customers out there. Thank you for the constant support and we're excited to see everybody a Comp '19 coming up at the end of October. It's going to be a fantastic show, a lot of new use cases and customer stories to share. So please find a way to get there and have a great day. Thank you.Thank you.

Several companies have reported their latest figures following market hours, and for the most part, they're quite good.   and  , to name two, handily beat analyst estimates for profitability. Read on for details.Image source: Nordstrom.com.How do you keep investor fears of  at bay? Well, if you're a big-name retailer, you post a bottom-line result that exceeds their diminished expectations.That's what happened with Nordstrom in its Q2 of fiscal 2019. The company's revenue for the quarter declined by over 5% on a year-over-year basis, to $3.87 billion. That didn't meet the average analyst projection of $3.92 billion. However, the retailer netted $141 million ($0.90 per share) in profit, and while that was below the $162 million of Q2 2018, it blew past the average prognosticator estimate of $0.77.The company attributed its successes in the quarter to \"inventory and expense discipline.\"\u00a0Even though many analysts had cut their forecasts for Nordstrom in advance of the Q2 earnings release, the company's bottom-line beat is still convincing enough to juice the stock tonight -- it's up by nearly 11% in after-hours trading.Nordstrom also made several minor adjustments to its full-year fiscal 2019 guidance. The company now expects a 2% year-over-year decrease in net sales. Previously, it believed that growth would be flat to 2% down. Per-share earnings are now forecast to fall between $3.25 to $3.50; formerly, this range was $3.25 to $3.65.Another quarterly outperformer reporting after market hours was data analytics specialist Splunk, which also announced a fresh acquisition.For the company's Q2 of fiscal 2020, total revenue was $517 million, a sturdy 33% over the same period of fiscal 2019. Non- (adjusted) net profit came in at nearly $47 million ($0.30 per share), well up from the year-ago tally of just under $12 million.Collectively, analysts tracking the stock were modeling only $488 million on the top line and a per-share adjusted net profit of $0.12.Splunk gave credit to the cloud for its improvements. \"[T]he strength of our cloud business is driving a faster transition to a renewable software model,\" it said in the press release heralding the results.Meanwhile, the company adjusted its revenue guidance for the entirety of fiscal 2020. It now anticipates it will book $2.3 billion for the period, a bump from the previous estimate of $2.25 billion. Splunk maintained its projection of adjusted operating margin, which is expected to be roughly 14%.Splunk also announced that it's acquiring SignalFx, a privately held company that describes its core, eponymously named product as \"the only real-time cloud monitoring platform for infrastructure, microservices, and applications.\" It didn't provide details regarding the price or terms of the acquisition. Regardless, SignalFx should add heft to Splunk's already weighty involvement in cloud solutions.In spite of the much better-than-expected results and the complimentary asset buy, Splunk's shares are essentially trading sideways this evening.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It has since been updated and republished.]Slow and steady wins the race, as the old adage goes. But slow and steady can be a bit boring. Investors looking for stocks to buy, as a rule, should focus on high-quality, and preferably, lower-risk issues.Still, there\u2019s room in any investor\u2019s portfolio for higher-risk, higher-reward plays \u2014 as long as those risks are understood.In that vein, here are 10 stocks to buy that offer\u00a0potentially significant rewards \u2026 and almost as much risk. None of these stocks should be a core part of a portfolio, and\u00a0all have the potential to blow up in your face.But\u00a0taking those risks also creates the possibility of a major reward. It\u2019s likely at least a few of these stocks will wind up big winners going forward.Teva Pharmaceutical\u00a0(NYSE:) isn\u2019t having a great year, down more than 57%.   Teva has too much debt and too little growth. Its key drug, Copaxone, which treats multiple sclerosis, is facing generic competition from \u00a0(NASDAQ:), among others.Bankruptcy likely isn\u2019t a near-term scenario but the current trajectory suggests it could occur down the line. In short, TEVA is a classic contrarian, \u201cbuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d type of play. And there are reasons TEVA is one of these great (if risky) stocks to buy.While pressure has persisted on generic drugs, but it won\u2019t last forever.The company has sold assets to clean up its balance sheet, which has de-risked the story somewhat. In my opinion, Teva is a better version of Valeant, but with an easier path back to normalcy.It\u2019s a risky path, but if it works TEVA\u00a0could gain another 20%-plus simply by reaching a higher multiple and removing bankruptcy fears.The story already has played out somewhat at \u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is up 14.23% so far this year. But the growth story isn\u2019t necessarily over.Source: Shutterstock\n\tOnly a few years ago, Scientific Games was a sleepy, low-growth provider of lottery tickets and terminals. But that changed in quick succession.SciGames acquired slot machine manufacturers WMS Industries and Bally Technologies, the latter coming only months after Bally bought equipment maker and gaming table designer Shuffle Master. Scientific Games became the dominant supplier to the casino industry worldwide: a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for casino floors.It also became one of the most indebted companies in the U.S. markets and still is. The combination of that debt and careful cost controls at casinos, particularly in the U.S., kept SGMS stock below $20 to start the year.But it now looks like the long-awaited \u201creplacement cycle\u201d of slot machines is arriving and that could be hugely beneficial for Scientific Games and its smaller, similar rival  (NYSE:). And considering how much leverage is still on the balance sheet, there\u2019s a case for SGMS to clear $100 \u2014 yes, $100 \u2014 if profit growth accelerates.That\u2019s not a guarantee, obviously, but\u00a0it\u2019s the nature of highly indebted companies. Leverage is a weight when those companies struggle, and it\u2019s a springboard when they grow.In the case of  (NYSE:), leverage has been a weight. After optimism about stable energy prices and Chesapeake\u2019s improved balance sheet boosted CHK stock in 2017, it was nothing but downhill in 2018.Source: Shutterstock\n\tCHK now trades down more than 68% since the beginning of the year and just bounced off multi-year lows.I think CHK is the best, if riskiest, of the stocks to buy on higher energy prices.It\u2019s also worth pointing out that Chesapeake bonds actually have been rather stable so far this year. Efficiency improvements at the wellhead have lowered costs as well.Chesapeake is a risky play, but the combination of debt on the balance sheet and leverage from higher energy prices mean that with a couple of changes, CHK could soar.(NASDAQ:), on the other hand, isn\u2019t the cheapest stock in its space or anywhere else. The high-flying \u201coperational intelligence\u201d software provider trades up nearly 30% since the beginning of the year alone.Source: \n\tThe valuation alone shows the risk in SPLK, which has pulled back from brief early-2014 highs above $100. But since that pullback, SPLK stock actually has been rather stable, as investors give the company time to grow into its valuation.Meanwhile, Splunk continues to be a likely acquisition target, with \u00a0(NASDAQ:) cited as a potential buyer in June and \u00a0(NYSE:) long thought to be a logical acquirer.Splunk is a classic growth stock in that it, too, is high-risk and high-reward. But it looks like one of the better growth stocks to buy in what might be an over-aggressive market at the moment.The shipping space generally has been a \u201cBermuda Triangle\u201d for investor capital, but \u00a0(NYSE:) might be the exception to the rule.Source: Shutterstock\n\tThere\u2019s likely to be some near-term volatility and Ship Finance\u2019s dividend, which currently yields 11%, could be at risk, but it\u2019s still one of those great stocks to buy if you can handle the risk.But this also remains one of the best plays in shipping, available for a modest premium to book value and at low-teens multiple to earnings. The industry alone, and a heavily leveraged balance sheet, both show the risk.But if Ship Finance can make it through some choppy waters over the next few months, there\u2019s likely a nice return for shareholders on the other side.   There\u2019s no sector of the market more boom-and-bust than biotech and drug development.\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:) doubles down on that volatility by developing its drugs from marijuana.But GW Pharmaceuticals isn\u2019t one of those fly-by-night penny stocks to buy based on legalized weed. Which is why . It\u2019s a $2.6 billion pharmaceutical company with a legitimate lead product candidate in Epidiolex, aimed to treat Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.Sativex, used to treat multiple sclerosis spasticity, already is on the market. And another compound has potential uses to fight epilepsy and treat autism spectrum disorders.Like most drug development plays, GWPH is high-risk. But there\u2019s a reason for investors to hold long-term optimism toward the company\u2019s pipeline. Success in getting those drugs to market likely would make GWPH an acquisition target at some point suggesting a significant upside from current levels. If it happens, analysts see GWPH stock surging near 30%.That in turn, would suggest likely significant upside from current levels for GWPH stock.Considering that solar power actually is gaining an increasing share of the U.S. market, in particular, it\u2019s surprising that solar stocks including \u00a0(NASDAQ:) actually haven\u2019t done all that well.Source: Shutterstock\n\tSolarCity had to be rescued by \u00a0(NASDAQ:). \u00a0(NASDAQ:) is down from multi-year highs despite the recent strength.There are risks for CSIQ, in particular. \u201cCommoditization\u201d and price pressure could hit margins. Still, demand for CSIQ equipment is growing, the stock isn\u2019t terribly highly valued, and it\u2019s lagged of late while FSLR, in particular, has risen.Solar stocks are likely to stay choppy for a while, but CSIQ should have some room to run if it can get through the second half of the year.\u00a0(NYSE:) is on the move again. Shipments of the company\u2019s aluminum wheels hit a record last year and it\u2019s starting to pay off.Source: \n\tAuto parts stocks as a whole have had trouble, driven by  in the space. Superior itself has had a couple of missteps that impacted margins, and profits. And with SUP one of the more indebted companies in the sector, both factors have had an amplified impact on Superior\u2019s share price.But there\u2019s a reason to see a reversal as well, which is what makes SUP one of the smart stocks to buy. Near-term auto sales may be coming down, particularly in the U.S.Last year\u2019s acquisition of European supplier UNIWHEELS improved Superior\u2019s position overseas. And there is room to improve execution, and hopefully, margins, going forward.SUP does have potential downside risk, particularly if global macro concerns arise, pressuring auto sales and\u00a0dropping SUP earnings further. But for contrarians who think the auto parts selloff is overdone, SUP is one of the more intriguing plays.(NYSE:) is another of the growth stocks to buy with a high valuation and a big opportunity.Source: \n\tThe company began as an online textbook rental company. But it wound up outsourcing that business to another provider and since has focused on becoming the dominant digital platform for U.S. college students.And Chegg is having some success. Revenues are growing and adjusted EBITDA has turned positive after years of losses. The company\u2019s tutors and study services businesses are growing rapidly, and it\u2019s becoming a fixture in the college landscape.There are risks here beyond valuation. Like so many companies, Amazon is a potential competitor down the line, given its efforts to offer free Prime services to college students. But at this point, it might simply be easier for Amazon to buy Chegg, rather than\u00a0expend the resources to try and fight it.With each passing quarter, Chegg gets more and more entrenched. And that only serves to strengthen the bull case for CHGG stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The stock market is in selloff mode right now. The only two things the market cares about \u2014 the trade war and interest rates \u2014 aren\u2019t progressing as hoped. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated over the past few days, with U.S. President Donald Trump implementing new tariffs on more Chinese goods, and China responding by playing currency manipulation games directly aimed at hurting the U.S. At the same time, the Fed has expressed a more hawkish than expected tone with respect to future rate cuts.In response, stocks \u2014 which marched 10% higher in June and July to all-time highs without ever retreating more than 2% \u2014 have dropped 5% through the first few trading days of August.In the big picture, this sell-off is nothing more than a bull market gut check. It will ultimately pass and soon. By the end of the year, stocks should be materially higher than where they are today.The recent round of tariffs is just a Trump chest puff in order to get the Fed to lower rates more aggressively. It will work. Renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China will create more economic cross-currents, which will force the Fed to cut rates more aggressively. Once those rates go lower, Trump will probably pull some of these tariffs off the table because he doesn\u2019t want the trade war to get out of hand ahead of the 2020 election. China will stop playing currency manipulation games because they, too, don\u2019t want things to get out of hand since trade with the U.S. accounts for a significant chunk of their economic activity.Net net, by the end of the year, you will have reduced trade tensions and lower rates. That\u2019s a winning recipe for stocks, especially growth stocks which thrive in a low rate environment.As such, growth stocks look like a good buy on this recent dip. By extension, growth ETFs also look a like good buy on this dip.\u00a0Thus, let\u2019s take a look at six growth ETFs which look good for a second half 2019 rebound rally.Source: Shutterstock\n\t21%8%Cybersecurity spend globally will continue to rise, implying sustained big growth potential for cybersecurity companies, and this ETF gives you broad exposure to the world\u2019s most important cybersecurity stocks.\u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0\u00a0(NYSE:),\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:) and\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:)For the past several years, I have employed a saying which broadly encompasses the bull thesis on cybersecurity stocks: another day, another hack, another reason to buy cybersecurity stocks. Long story short, companies are increasingly accumulating data on their customers and storing that data in the cloud. This data is extremely valuable and often very personal. But because it\u2019s in the cloud, it is subject to being stolen by hackers. Thus, enterprises need to keep spending big on cybersecurity solutions to secure all that data, and the more hacks that happen in the world, the more companies will double down on cybersecurity spend to avoid such hacks.This is exactly what has happened over the past several years. Every company in the world is collecting and storing more data. But all that data keeps getting compromised. In 2016, Adult Friend Finder,\u00a0Yahoo\u00a0and\u00a0(NYSE:) were the victims of big hacks. In 2017, it was \u00a0(NYSE:) and\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:) and in 2018, it was \u00a0(NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:). So far in 2019, the headline hack has been the  (NYSE:) data breach, which exposed info on more than 100 million Capital One customers.As all these hacks have happened, cybersecurity companies have broadly benefited from consistently huge revenue growth. Palo Alto Networks reported 28% revenue growth last quarter. Fortinet was up at 18% revenue growth last quarter. Splunk? 36%. Okta? 50%. Even further, the whole industry has high gross margins, so big revenue growth is paving the path for huge profits at scale one day.Nothing about this secular growth narrative changes because of the trade war. Instead, the lower rates go, the more the lofty valuations underneath cybersecurity stocks will be justified. As such, the \u00a0(NASDAQ:) \u2014 which is a collection of the market\u2019s most important cybersecurity stocks \u2014 should rebound in a big way from today\u2019s 8% selloff and head significantly higher into the end of the year and over the long run.Source: Shutterstock\n\t17%9%The cloud is the future of all enterprise workloads, yet only 20% of such workloads have migrated to the cloud, paving the path for sustained huge market growth in the long run \u2014 and this ETF gives you exposure to the world\u2019s most important cloud stocks.\u00a0(NYSE:),\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:) and\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:)In the enterprise world, the cloud is the future of everything. Every single enterprise workload \u2014 from crafting an email to creating a spreadsheet and everything in between \u2014 can and should be done in the cloud, given the cost and convenience advantages of cloud-hosted solutions over on-premise solutions. After all, are we really going back to the era of flash drives?As such, the inevitable outcome here is that, eventually, 100% of enterprise workloads will be performed in the cloud. Today,  of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud. Thus, this secular cloud growth narrative is only one-fifth done.And that\u2019s just the enterprise side of things. Consider that consumers are also increasingly pivoting to the cloud \u2013 think Office 365 or Adobe Photoshop. That\u2019s an entirely separate yet also very large growth vertical which should keep the entire cloud market on a secular uptrend for the next several years.Consequently, the big growth rates across this industry are here to stay. As they do stick around, cloud stocks will rally and that will drive the (NASDAQ:) significantly higher in the long run.Near term, escalating trade tensions will have a negative impact of enterprise investment levels, which could temporarily weigh on cloud growth rates. But as mentioned earlier, these escalating trade tensions will inevitably cool, meaning that any weakness here and now will be short lived. Instead, the more important implication is that falling rates will keep cloud stocks on a medium-term uptrend.Source: Shutterstock\n\t22%8%Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) stocks are winning investments, and this ETF gives you broad exposure to the world\u2019s best SaaS stocks.\u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0(NYSE:), \u00a0(NASDAQ:), Microsoft and SalesforceThe best way to look at the (NYSE:) is as a slightly expanded version of the Cloud Computing ETF. When buying IGV, you get the best cloud stocks, plus other SaaS stocks which are supported by similar secular adoption tailwinds and favorable margin profiles.The big holdings here include Adobe, ServiceNow, Autodesk and Salesforce. What do all these companies have in common? Huge revenue growth, with a majority of that revenue coming from steady subscription models. Big gross margins, which is the result of selling low cost software. And rapidly expanding operating margins, a byproduct of huge revenue growth driving positive operating leverage.Put those three things together and each of these companies is either currently or has the potential to produce huge profits.In other words, the core fundamentals underlying IGV are very strong. Those fundamentals are hardly deterred by the trade war. Yet the ETF is 8% off its 2019 highs. This drop will inevitably pass, especially with rates dropping and IGV will roar higher from here into the end of the year.Source: Shutterstock\n\t10%15%The automation trend is choppy, but within the next decade, automated technologies will go from niche to mainstream adoption, implying big growth potential for robotics and automation stocks in the long run \u2014 most of those winning stocks are packaged into this ETF.\u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0\u00a0(NYSE:) and\u00a0(NASDAQ:)Of all the ETFs on this list, the \u00a0(NYSE:) has been the worst performer in 2019. Every other ETF on this list is beating the market year-to-date, with gains in excess of 14%. ROBO, on the other hand, has under-performed the  in 2019, rising just 10% year-to-date.This underperformance won\u2019t last for long. The automation trend is admittedly choppy. Technology isn\u2019t quite there to justify enterprises spending big on automation\u2026 yet. Meanwhile, negative robot stigmas remain in the consumer world, so things like self-driving and robotic vacuum cleaners remain niche\u2026 for now.These are temporary phenomena. Eventually, technology will get to a point where automated technologies are good enough (and their value so compelling) that enterprises will pivot wholesale to adopting these technologies. At the same time, there will come a point where things like self-driving have enough evidence of success that consumers will start to trust them in bulk.In other words, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the automation wave changes our entire society. When it does, robotics and automation stocks \u2014 like Nvidia, Zebra, Intuitive Surgical and Rockwell \u2014 will soar. All of those stocks are packaged into the ROBO ETF, meaning that ROBO has huge potential long term.The trade war is just a hiccup in the secular automation growth narrative. As such, with ROBO down 15% due to trade war noise and near-term growth concerns, now looks like a compelling time to buy into this secular growth ETF.Source: Shutterstock\n\t20%7%E-commerce and digital services are the future of the consumer economy, and this ETF gives you exposure to all of the most important e-commerce and digital services stocks in the U.S.\u00a0(NYSE:), (NASDAQ:), \u00a0(NASDAQ:), Chegg and AmazonThe internet has connected the world in ways that it\u2019s never been connected before. In so doing, it has enabled a new digital economy to emerge, which leverages this unprecedented connectivity to allow consumers to essentially do anything from their computers or phones. Need to buy something? Go on the Amazon app. Need to study something? Go to Chegg.com. Want to sell something? Create an account on Etsy.Pretty much every consumer interaction can now be replicated online. Consumers like this. It\u2019s more convenient. They don\u2019t have to go to the store to shop. They don\u2019t have to go to the library to study.Yet, e-commerce still only represents 10% of total retail sales in the United States, which is considered one of the more deeply e-retail penetrated markets in the world. As such, there\u2019s still plenty of room for growth left here, the sum of which should drive e-commerce and digital services stocks \u2014 and the \u00a0(NASDAQ:) \u2014 materially higher in the long run.IBUY is presently 7% off its 2019 highs because of this fear that escalating trade tensions will disrupt the global consumer economy and in turn, weigh on e-retail growth rates. That could happen. But things would need to get a lot worse. At present, the U.S. consumer economy is still firing on all cylinders, thanks to sustained healthy labor conditions. The same is true for many other important consumer economies across the world.Consequently, near term weakness in IBUY looks like a long term opportunity.

This dynamic will persist for the foreseeable future. That means big growth for companies which provide these non-cash payment methods. Such companies include Mastercard, Visa, Square and PayPal. All four of those companies reported payment volume growth of 9% or better last quarter.The \u00a0(NASDAQ:) takes all of these non-cash payment processor stocks and packages them into one asset. Presumably, then, as these stocks all rise concurrently over the next several years with the non-cash payments pivot, IPAY will rise, too.The near term outlook is equally rosy. As is the case with IBUY, IPAY has dropped over the past few trading days over concerns that escalating trade tensions will dampen global consumer enthusiasm. But this isn\u2019t happening yet. It will take a lot more for this to happen. Trade tensions are more likely to cool going forward, than they are to heat up.

More and more companies are looking to integrate AI services into their businesses, and one of the best ways of doing that is through cloud computing services. For example, Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform offers object and image recognition AI services, as well as language translation.\u00a0Microsoft already holds a 16.5% share of the public cloud computing market, trailing only , and is successfully using it to grow its top line. In the most recent quarter, Azure revenues grew 64% year over year.CEO Satya Nadella said last year that \"AI is the run-time which is going to shape all of what we do.\" Nadella's comments are important to take notice of, especially when investors consider that the artificial-intelligence-as-a-service (AIaaS) market is forecast to reach $77 billion by 2025.NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are among the more sought-after components for artificial intelligence hardware because they do an exceptional job of processing visual information. That's particularly important for image-recognition systems, like the ones that allow driverless cars to see and react to what's around them.The company has capitalized on its chips' abilities by creating its own driverless car platforms -- the current iteration is the Drive PX Pegasus -- and is working with  and researchers to help bring autonomous vehicles to the masses. NVIDIA is so confident about the potential of\u00a0driverless cars that it projects its total addressable market in that segment alone will be $60 billion by 2035.But NVIDIA's opportunities to profit from AI go far beyond the autonomous vehicle space. For example, the company recently  through its purchase of . As more companies find ways to make use of cloud-based AI services (see the Microsoft section above), demand should push higher for NVIDIA's data center GPUs. The company believes the total addressable market for data center GPUs will be worth $50 billion by 2023.Splunk is a hybrid cloud-computing company, and it's tapping into AI to make the services it offers even better. For instance, it has integrated machine learning (ML) into its data sorting services for business, which help companies effectively categorize, search through, and find patterns in massive amounts of data. \"With AI and ML, it's possible to use that data to get value not possible with human analysis alone, leading to improved effectiveness and productivity with new insights and automation,\" the company explains on its website.Splunk has made some strategic purchases to , including SignalSense in 2017 and VictorOps last year.

As more people around the globe connect to the internet and hundreds of millions of devices get connected to a network every year, the need to keep all of that data secure is on the rise.In fact, according to research firm  Insights, cybersecurity is expected to go from a $120 billion-a-year endeavor in 2017 to more than $300 billion in 2024, good for an average 12% annual growth rate. It's no wonder, then, that so many businesses are getting in on the movement. Old tech titans like , , and  all offer cybersecurity as part of their service suites. Other names are investing in the action, too. Old smartphone maker  , for example, bought small cybersecurity outfit Cylance in early 2019 to further its transformation as a software company.Image source: Getty Images.As the world goes digital, managing new digital-first business operations and keeping information safe and secure will continue to evolve and grow in importance. For those wanting to invest in the cybersecurity industry, researching the biggest names in the business is a good place to get started (after ). Here are the 10 largest companies that make cybersecurity their primary concern based on  (the value of the company calculated by number of shares outstanding multiplied by price per share).Data as of July 23, 2019. Data source: YCharts and company-specific investor relations.\"Cybersecurity\" is the umbrella term, but there are different types of security firms tackling various problems in today's connected age.For example, the larger outfits have been angling themselves to cover a wide range of needs, becoming one-stop\u00a0security shops. Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet are two such companies, covering everything from firewalls (a network feature, sometimes a piece of hardware but more often software, that decides what data to let in and out) to artificial intelligence-based software that automates tasks and monitors an organization's digital activity.These companies focus on securing remote devices connected to a network. The number of devices hooked up to the internet has been , and that trend is expected to continue. Businesses are leading the charge, and everything from employee smartphones and tablets to assets in transit to connected machinery is in need of safekeeping. Endpoint protection software handles that specific need. Startup , among others, is a specialist in this space.These niche companies include Okta, which provides privileged-access management -- basically, only allowing users access to the sensitive data that they're supposed to see. Then there's security for , or computing and software that is offered remotely by way of a data center. Zscaler concerns itself with keeping cloud connections and data safe for businesses and organizations.Regardless of the security need, digital-based operations and communications are on the rise across the board, which means all of the top cybersecurity companies are experiencing growth of some sort. That creates an opportunity for investors to cash in on the movement. Here is a breakdown of each of the top cybersecurity companies and how their stocks are valued.Sitting atop the cybersecurity pure-play list is Palo Alto Networks. The company has built itself into the leader in the security space, offering a broad range of services for its customers from firewalls to automated threat response to cloud security. The largest player in the cybersecurity niche by market cap, Palo Alto has managed to outpace the industry's average growth rate in spite of its size.Part of the story behind Palo Alto's growth is the company's acquisition spree of smaller competitors. In May 2019, the company announced its intent to purchase , one for $410 million and the other for a smaller undisclosed sum. Both were added to a new cloud security service segment called Prisma, aimed at continuously updating Palo Alto's offerings as needs of customers evolve over time. CEO Nikesh Arora, a former executive at 's   Google, has indicated that strategic acquisitions will continue to play an integral part in his company's strategy to remain relevant.The sums of money paid for acquisitions have been substantial (at least $1 billion spent since 2018), and they're among the reasons Palo Alto is not yet a profitable business. However, when backing out one-time nonrecurring expenses and noncash items, the company still manages to post positive  (money left over after basic operating expenses and ). In short, that means the company can afford its aggressive buying spree.The free cash flow generation is important, because it gives the leader in pure-play network security the wiggle room it needs to invest heavily in cloud computing, AI, and other technology as customer needs change over time. Global cloud spending is expected to grow an average of about 16% a year through 2022, according to technology research group . Sitting at the intersection of two double-digit growth industries, that long-term trend should give Palo Alto Networks an enduring outlet to sustain double-digit sales growth and help it maintain its pole position within the world of cybersecurity.Splunk started out as a . Its software suite allows organizations to analyze and make sense of information being generated from their digital systems, from websites to connected equipment to payment processing networks, among other things. If it's an electronic system, it creates data; and if it creates data, Splunk can help monitor it and give customers the ability to make sense of trends and other behavior of digital systems. Incidentally, one of the primary use cases for the data parsing and analytics platform is cybersecurity.To increase its capabilities in that department, Splunk has also embarked on an aggressive . As a result, the big data company is now a leader in the fast-growing security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) segment of the cybersecurity industry. SOAR utilizes artificial intelligence (a software system that mimics how the human brain works and learns and adapts to changing circumstances) to sift through information in real time, detect potential threats, and take action to keep things on lockdown. With data breaches a constant threat, the ability to automate aspects of the workload holds appeal for large organizations.Despite its size, Splunk has still been growing quickly. The downside is that Splunk is spending lots of cash to foster further expansion, which keeps the company in the red. Specifically, research and development of new software capabilities and sales and marketing to acquire new customers are the biggest line items affecting the bottom line. However, much like Palo Alto Networks, Splunk is free cash flow positive; profits will be a bigger consideration later on as the company matures.That's because Splunk's primary industry, big data analytics, should grow an average of 13% a year and surpass $274 billion in size by 2023 -- according to researcher IDC. Along the way, Splunk will also benefit from the booming and fast-changing cybersecurity industry, making it one of the best plays on the trend. The company's expertise in monitoring and making sense of large and complex sets of data particularly lends itself to keeping business information locked up, and its recent takeovers of smaller peers have helped bolster its position in network security. Splunk's prospects and chances at continued industry leadership look especially good.Check Point Software, as its name implies, offers software security along with hardware to keep business networks secure. Much like Palo Alto Networks, the company has a diversified mix of solutions covering on-premeses computer networks, cloud, and endpoint protection.Though it's one of the largest and oldest cybersecurity companies around (founded in 1993), Check Point has not been growing at the breakneck speed of some of its peers.  has been the norm for some time. The reason? New technologies like the cloud have made some of Check Point's legacy services like hardware-based security less compelling. The company is trailing some of its competitors, so spending to update the business model for today's security needs has been a top priority. It isn't paying off yet, and Check Point's sluggish pace could mean its younger peers will bypass it in the years ahead.There is one thing that makes Check Point different from other companies on this list, though. As an older, well-established company, it does turn a profit. Thus, traditional valuation metrics (without the need to make adjustments for things like , shares a company pays to employees as an extra perk) work for the stock. However, heavy spending to transform the business into a more relevant one for the times has the bottom line stuck in a rut. Until that changes, there's little compelling reason to consider the stock.Check Point has been working hard to update its offerings for more modern needs, but the sheer number of newer start-ups could mean this established cybersecurity business will continue to get disrupted. That's not an enviable situation to be in, especially when the industry overall is growing by double digits.Endpoint security company  after it had its  (sold shares to raise money, making it available to the general investing public for the first time) in June 2019. That easily puts the firm among the largest in the cybersecurity business by market cap.The stock has years' worth of double-digit sales growth baked into it, but momentum could be on CrowdStrike's side. Revenues more than doubled in 2018. The number of connected devices around the globe is increasing every year -- by the hundreds of millions -- which plays right into the hands of this security company and its endpoint-protection software suite. Since many of those devices are not tethered to an office or other physical location, CrowdStrike's cloud computing-native system lends itself to this type of security particularly well.Because it is cloud based, CrowdStrike also boasts the ability to make near-instant system updates when a threat is detected, and its software can learn and adapt from uploaded customer data. Paired with millions of new connections getting added to an internet-connected network every year, it adds up to lots of new customer sign-ups and expanding relationships with existing ones. Dollar-based net expansion (which measures how much money existing clients spend each year) has been over 100% for years, indicating customers spend more with CrowdStrike as time passes. It's a powerful business model, one that CrowdStrike plans on putting to use in other security disciplines as it begins to expand beyond endpoint security. With the cloud and the number of endpoints increasing dramatically, it's no wonder this stock is off to a hot start and looks like it has years' worth of growth left ahead of it.Another upstart security company, Okta has only been around since 2009, but the identity-protection specialist has been growing like a weed. The company ensures that employees and others with privileged access within an organization get connected to the apps and data they need -- and keeps everyone else out. The number of digital systems and software being utilized by organizations continues to rise, increasing the complexity and difficulty in keeping systems secure from intruders. Thus, the need for Okta's identity services has been booming.In just a few years' time, Okta has become one of the largest cybersecurity pure plays around, with sales consistently growing north of 50% in the past. Management expects that trajectory will moderate to somewhere in the mid-30% range for the foreseeable future -- still nothing to balk at. And that rate of expansion could be sustainable, too. According to the Global Market Insights cybersecurity report, identity, authentication, and access management services are expected to be an especially fast-growing subset of cybersecurity, with the potential for services to increase an average of 17% a year through 2024. At the forefront of the movement, Okta is primed to gobble up market share as identity and access management increases in importance.Here's the downside: Okta is not a profitable business as of this writing. The company is funneling cash into marketing and research to maximize its sales growth now. Profits will be a concern later. The good news, though, is that gross profit margin (the amount of money the company keeps after producing a service and then selling it but before paying other operating expenses) is on the rise as the company grows.That bodes well for the future of this cybersecurity leader. Identity security/privileged data access rights is expected to be a high-growth segment of network security for the next few years, and Okta is a leader in the space.Another diversified provider of firewalls, cloud and endpoint security, and identity management, Fortinet took a hit amid worries that the trade war between the U.S. and China would dampen growth in the company's important international markets -- Asia and Europe specifically. Newer security upstarts have also disrupted some of Fortinet's legacy offerings like hardware-based network security for on-premises protection. Economic and industry headwinds or not, though, this cybersecurity outfit is doing just fine.Revenues and adjusted earnings were up 20% and 77%, respectively, in 2018. Fortinet has been adding dozens of new deals worth more than $1 million every quarter, winning customers over with its new and improved software suite aimed at keeping all parts of an organization safe. Although less aggressive in its acquisition strategy than Palo Alto Networks or Splunk, Fortinet continues to invest heavily in updating its offerings to keep its customers secure. The cloud has been an area of focus, as well as increasing the number of subscription-based software deals. The investments in new technology have been paying off and yielding results for shareholders, even as other legacy cybersecurity companies have been failing to make the cut.As a result of its less aggressive nature, Fortinet also runs a profitable business where some of its competitors don't -- and the bottom line has been rising faster than sales as the company's investments have started to yield results. Ample cash means this security business can continue to invest in its new high-octane segments like cloud, endpoint, and identity security, which bodes well for it being able to maintain its two-figure top-line growth rate for some time even as legacy lines of business fade. With a well-established presence in the industry and a successful business update strategy well underway and paying off, Fortinet is one of the best cybersecurity stocks around.Symantec is the world leader in cybersecurity services when using sales figures as the metric. With nearly $5 billion in revenue in the last year, it is nearly double the size of its younger peers like Palo Alto Networks. Yet despite Symantec's leadership, its market cap lags. One of the oldest network security players around and owner of recognizable software names like LifeLock and Norton Antivirus, Symantec has had to deal with disruption and shifting technology that have left growth near nonexistent and profitability underwhelming.Though Symantec has been updating its operations -- it recently announced a new comprehensive cloud-based security suite covering everything from email to application login protection -- results have been sluggish. Fiscal 2019 sales fell 2%. The company's legacy operations are holding it back, and bloated operating expenses have meant paltry bottom-line earnings. Not exactly what investors should be looking for from the leader of a high-flying industry.There could be hope of a rebound, though, as Symantec continues to work through its transition. Chipmaker  and was reportedly interested in acquiring the old security company to add it to its growing software division. However, negotiations fell through, and Symantec will have to go it alone for now. Until the company can demonstrate a strategy that can gain some traction in the growing world of cybersecurity, Symantec will continue to struggle in the wake of younger and more nimble peers that started investing earlier in the shifting landscape.The next security outfit on the list handles a different piece of the industry than any of the others covered thus far.  helps deliver and secure web content as it travels from its source to the end user, from live and streaming video to traditional web page text and pictures. The internet's continual expansion has been a boon for Akamai, which has launched new services to cover new web applications (like video streaming) and new mobile device types to keep the internet connection to them secure.Akamai's traditional web business is a low- to mid-single-digit growth story, but its newer cloud security services have been growing well into the double digits. New services are still a small fraction of the whole, but they are a high-margin endeavor. Akamai's bottom line has been getting a big double-digit boost as Akamai's investment and spending on new web delivery applications subside and past spending starts to yield results.Akamai has grown into one of the internet's primary content delivery platforms, responsible for handling as much as a third of global web traffic. As such, this company will be slower moving than other security businesses, but Akamai still has growth prospects ahead of it. Internet infrastructure company Cisco expects web traffic -- led by video content -- to grow an average of 26% a year through 2022. That means Akamai's newer business should continue to move the needle for some time; plus the overall operation is solidly in profitable territory. In short, the leading internet content delivery and security company should be a slow-and-steady play for the foreseeable future.Back to small but up-and-coming cybersecurity. Zscaler has its sights set on securing cloud computing and thus built itself from the ground up as a cloud-only software suite. The world is going mobile, and so are business operations. With fewer centralized locations and more remotely connected devices popping up, Zscaler helps keep newer business networks safe for its customers and their employees.With a business model similar to those of CrowdStrike and Okta, Zscaler plays in a new multibillion-dollar industry that will only continue to grow larger, and the company has been frank in saying it is all about maximizing growth right now. And no wonder, as Gartner says in its cloud research that annual spending will nearly double from 2018 to 2022 to more than $330 billion a year. Sales at Zscaler have been growing north of 60% year over year for some time, but what's a few hundred million in annual sales when the whole market is worth hundreds of billions? The downside is that in spite of massive growth and a rosy outlook for the good times to continue, operating losses are still substantial. With Zscaler all about nurturing sales as fast as possible, the red ink is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.Much like its start-up peers, though, Zscaler takes those losses by design as . Gross profit margin was an enviable 81% at last report, one of the best in the industry. With profit potential like that in a fast-expanding cloud computing sandbox, it makes sense Zscaler is all about growth now and profit later. With the world going mobile, this security stock looks like an especially promising one in the years ahead as it takes advantage of its early cloud-based security lead.F5 Networks provides hardware and software solutions that help companies keep their applications and app delivery secure. Similar to Akamai, the company's legacy business isn't exactly lighting the world on fire. However, newer services, particularly those aimed at cloud computing-based apps, are on a tear. To that end, F5 recently acquired app optimization and security peer NGINX for $670 million.It's a sizable sum but likely a prudent move for F5. The company has been reporting low-single-digit revenue growth the last few years -- nearly all of which has been driven by big expansion in its software service segment. While the top line has been sluggish, the upside is that new software and security offerings are a much more profitable concern. As a result, earnings are up nearly 40% over the last trailing three-year stretch.During its transition phase to more modern app security and delivery, F5's stock has taken a beating. There's worry that the transition will continue to be a bumpy one, thus making this stock among the cheapest in the cybersecurity industry. However, though the low valuation reflects the fact that F5 has fallen behind the curve in the digital age, F5 is an inexpensive play on digital security and delivery. With internet traffic and content delivery still a slow-and-steady endeavor, F5 can continue to thrive -- albeit at a much slower rate than elsewhere in cybersecurity.One of the smaller outfits in the security space, Proofpoint is worth a mention as a bonus number 11 on the top-10 list. The company specifically helps organizations keep their employees safe. Email attacks are a key pain point for many businesses, and securing communications in that department -- as well as on social media, cloud applications, and mobile devices -- is a specialty at Proofpoint.Though a niche offering within the greater cybersecurity industry, Proofpoint is expanding fast. After , management forecasted full-year 2019 revenue to be up at least another 22%. However, as with its high-powered sales-oriented peers, the company does run up big losses. As with many other cybersecurity plays we've been discussing, though, that's due to Proofpoint reinvesting in itself to foster more growth.Nevertheless, when we adjust the bottom line for one-time items and other noncash expenses, Proofpoint is free cash flow positive, a metric that has been steadily on the rise. That should help Proofpoint keep up its double-digit growth trajectory as employee access points via remote computers, smartphones, and other devices continue to boom in the States and especially overseas. It's a much smaller business than the top 10 companies are, but this cybersecurity concern still offers a compelling growth story worth keeping an eye on as it keeps communications safe and secure.Proofpoint will also likely see long-term benefit from the explosion in devices hooked up to a network in the years ahead. The workforce's increasing mobility means keeping employee communications on lockdown will be an increasingly complex problem, one that this small security company can help solve.Image source: Getty Images.Taking a high-level look at the biggest companies in the cybersecurity market is only the start to choosing an investment. Some of the stocks are buys, others not so much. As the industry is still in high-growth mode and adapting fast to technological developments, investors would be best off picking the companies posting the fastest revenue expansion rates and those that carry the highest gross profit margins. Click here for a discussion on the top cybersecurity stocks and an introduction on .Before investing, though, it's important to remember a few things. Though cybersecurity is one of the fastest-expanding industries around, with high growth expectations comes a high level of volatility. Stock prices can run higher very quickly -- and reverse course just as fast. Only investors who have a long-term perspective (no less than a few years) and the ability to purchase a position over time (buying a few shares at a time on a set schedule, like monthly, quarterly, or whenever the stock dips in price by at least double digits) should consider buying.For those with the time to wait, though, investing in cybersecurity should be a profitable endeavor. In a decade's time, this top-10 list will no doubt look very different, but a few of these names will still be around and will likely be much larger than they are today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Meanwhile, shares of two of Tableau's data-analytics industry peers,\u00a0  and  , were each up around 6% on the news. Salesforce, for its part, is down around 5.3%.More specifically, Salesforce will acquire Tableau in an all-stock transaction -- which helps explain Salesforce's drop today -- in which each share of Tableau will be exchanged for 1.103 shares of Salesforce common stock. Based on Salesforce's three-day average close as of Friday (before today's modest drop), the deal represented an enterprise value for Tableau of roughly $15.7 billion net of cash. The exchange should also be tax free for Tableau shareholders, with the exception of cash paid for any fractional shares held.Image source: Getty Images.In a press release this morning, Tableau argued that combining its platform with Salesforce's Einstein AI assistant will create \"the most intelligent and intuitive analytics and visualization platform for every department and every user at any company.\"\"Salesforce's incredible success has always been based on anticipating the needs of our customers and providing them the solutions they need to grow their businesses,\" said Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block. \"Data is the foundation of every digital transformation, and the addition of Tableau will accelerate our ability to deliver customer success by enabling a truly unified and powerful view across all of a customer's data.\"Of course, the acquisition doesn't directly benefit Alteryx or Splunk. But each company will enjoy enviable momentum for its respective data-analytics platform -- with both of them\u00a0 of \u00a0in the first quarter of 2019 as more people recognize the previously untapped value they can glean from their data. So it's hardly surprising to see the market driving Alteryx and Splunk higher as investors drool over the prospect of an increase in merger and acquisition activity in the space.As it stands, the acquisition still needs to pass regulatory muster and requires the majority approval of Tableau shareholders. The investor approval will be easier to achieve considering both the acquisition premium and the fact that Tableau founders Christian Chabot, Patrick Hanrahan, and Christopher Stolte have all indicated they'll tender their own shares in the exchange offer.Assuming all goes as planned, Salesforce expects to close the purchase during its fiscal third quarter ending Oct. 31. With Tableau stock currently trading at only a slight discount to the agreed acquisition price based on Salesforce's current levels -- and unless Tableau investors would rather eventually  -- I think they would do well to consider taking today's profits and putting them to work elsewhere.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Now it\u2019s almost up to $100 a share. Should you get long now?No. Shares are up more than 70% in about five weeks. It has almost quadrupled from its December lows (not that it deserved to be that low in the first place). But the point is still the same: you\u2019ve missed the boat.I love ROKU over the long term, but to think that we won\u2019t see sub-$95 prices again is absurd. With the stock overbought in the short-term and coming into possible resistance, hedging and/or taking some profits doesn\u2019t seem like a bad idea at this point \u2026 at least until lower prices come around.  (NASDAQ:) is going splat, falling 7% on Friday . The move forced a test of the 200-day moving average, which held as support.Aggressive bulls who feel compelled to go long SPLK stock can do so against Friday\u2019s low.I would love a lower open near the 200-day on Tuesday that quickly reclaims Friday\u2019s close and goes green. Preferably, SPLK would also reclaim the 50% retracement at $120.78 in the process.If it falls under Friday\u2019s low, SPLK can go even lower. On a rally, we need to see if it can climb back to Friday\u2019s highs near $130, and/or the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. (NASDAQ:) is off by more than 5% on Friday after disappointing earnings results.

It would put ADSK below several key support levels and suggest that sellers have not yet exhausted themselves. In that case, look for a possible test of the 200-day.Reclaiming the 50-day would repair some of the damage, but beware that this level may act as resistance. That would give short-sellers an entry, with a retest of the $158 area in mind.(NYSE:) stock is up almost 4% after getting approval for its $2 million-plus gene therapy treatment.The move has NVS hitting new highs in Friday\u2019s session.

That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0to learn about these picks!\u00a0It's the  radio show! I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio this week, senior analysts Jason Moser and Andy Cross. Good to see you as always, gentlemen! We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street. We'll get a summer movie preview with our guest, Nell Minow. And as always, we'll give you an inside look at the stocks on our radar.\u00a0But we begin with retail, and up first is Target. Same-store sales looked good in the first quarter. E-commerce sales looked really good, Jason, and shares of Target up 12% this week. They did look very good. In a world where Amazon and Walmart are really dominating a lot of the conversation, I think Target is holding its own. And we should at least recognize that. I mean, it's not been a straight line up, of course. But I think a lot of the investments that CEO Brian Cornell has been making are really working out. You mentioned the comps -- 4.8%. That was strong, particularly when you tie it to the 4.3% growth in traffic. I mean, anytime you see that growth in traffic, you know that's going to trickle down to the bottom line. And it did for Target. Eighth consecutive quarter of comp growth. And I think really, to me, the most interesting part is the way that they've been able to evolve in this e-commerce world. They now put the stores at the center of fulfillment, and those stores handled over 80% of the company's digital volume for the quarter. So that's just really a sign that the investments they're making in e-commerce and omnichannel are starting to really pay off.\u00a0We're going to talk a lot about this, I think, when we talk about retail and the success that some of these stores and companies are having with the omnichannel, Drive Up at Target is now available in more than 1,200 of all the 1,800 stores. Jason mentioned the 80% stat. That's just really impressive, when a company is trying to position themselves to compete not just against Amazon, but all the other e-commerce players out there. A brand like Target has to be able to be more and more relevant. And they certainly are doing that. And that really is showing up not just in the comp store growth but in the e-commerce growth as well.\u00a0They've made a lot of smart investments, although it is interesting when you compare them to what Walmart, just from a consumer-facing standpoint, you look at the marketing messages from Walmart over the past six months have first and foremost been about that pickup option. You're not really seeing that yet from a marketing standpoint with Target. But clearly, they've made the underlying investment.\u00a0Yeah, they have. Same-day fulfillment services, where it's order, pick up, drive up, get it from the store, those really did perform. They drove over half of the company's digital sales growth. But we talk about that digital sales growth, it was up 42% for the quarter. But when we look at it bigger picture, it's only about $5 billion to $6 billion of the overall top line, which is $76 billion-$78 billion. So yeah, it's not that big of a deal today. But by the same token, you can see there's a lot of opportunity for them to continue picking that up in the coming quarters and years. I mean, I think you have to be at least encouraged by that.\u00a0Shares of \u00a0falling a bit this week despite a solid second-quarter report and expanding their gross margins, Andy, which is not something you necessarily think of with a business like Best Buy.Yeah, I think a lot of talk on the call has been about some of the tax issues as well, some of the trade issues that are going on now. But really Best Buy continues to deliver. We mentioned omnichannel with Target. They have done a fabulous job. They acquired GreatCall, which offers technology for seniors, both phones as well as health services. That's helped boost their gross margins a little bit. Comp sales for the quarter were up 1.1%, that was at the high end of their guidance. Revenues were basically about flat, but a little bit higher than some of the estimates there. But thinking about where Best Buy is going, they talked a lot about this Best Buy 2020 initiative to be able to reduce costs, grow earnings, focus on omnichannel, make the right investments, and that has been paying off. And I suspect going forward, that will continue to be a benefit for Best Buy and for Best Buy shareholders, too.\u00a0 After seven years as CEO, Hubert Joly is going to step down next month. He's done a phenomenal job turning around this business when you think about seven years ago and how challenged Best Buy was. Coming in, remodeling the stores, investing in high-margin things like the Geek Squad. Corie Barry, who is currently the CFO, is going to replace him, going to be the first female CEO in the company's history.\u00a0And she's been there since the late '90s. But when you think about Best Buy, again, Chris, to that point, 40% of their online revenue now is done through in-store pickup. So they are making those initiatives. I expect those initiatives with Corie to continue. Clearly there's a lot of excitement. She's the fifth Best Buy CEO in its history. A lot of excitement about transitioning over to her into the new management team there and continue to make the investments that they have been making and that they will continue to make. As you mentioned, Hubert turns into the executive chairman, to be able to stay involved in overall strategy thinking with Best Buy.\u00a0 From general retail to home improvement, Home Depot and Lowe's both out with first-quarter reports this week. Home Depot's profits came in higher than expected. Lowe's is dealing with higher costs, and they cut guidance. Shares of Home Depot basically flat this week, Jason, whereas Lowe's, down about 12%.\u00a0Yeah, I mean, there are not many retailers that can say they've actually strengthened their competitive position here in the age of Amazon. But I think Home Depot can definitely say that, because it really seems like they're doing nothing but getting better. I mean, the numbers are all pointing in the right direction. But we look at specifically during the quarter, a couple of things that stood out, big-ticket comp sales, which are those sales of over $1,000, that metric was up about 4%. That matters, because that's about 20% of the overall business. Another thing that really stands out is where Home Depot is executing on the pro customer. That pro customer is turning into a very lucrative one for the company. It's becoming close to half of the overall revenue stream for the company. And what they're doing also on top of that is really building out this rental business that several years ago, maybe 1 in 10 of those pros would rent tools from Home Depot. Now, that metric is about 1 in 4. And that's important, because if they're going back and just renting those tools as opposed to buying them, that's a pretty reliable revenue stream. But then they're also buying stuff along the way too, all of the consumables that go with those tools that they're renting.When we look at Lowe's, Lowe's is like the younger sibling, always compared to the older brother or sister that graduated med school -- they can't ever quite nail it. And even when they do OK, the market really just takes it to task. I think that's what happened here. It was less about the quarter, I think, and more about the guidance for the year. They did pull back on earnings guidance a little bit. Gross margin with Lowe's took a nice little ding of about 165 basis points. A lot of that has to do with the restructuring that CEO Marvin Ellison is doing on the merchandising side of the business. He's coming up on his one-year anniversary, and the stock actually just dipped back below where it was when he started. That has to hurt a little bit, given that he had a nice first year.\u00a0But listen, when you're going up against Home Depot, you've got your work cut out for you. One place where they're not even coming close to executing is on that pro customer. I think that's where Home Depot has been able to really differentiate. Small silver lining for Lowe's, their online sales seem to be going in the right direction. No question. They are looking at that as an opportunity. And you're right, that's a point where the business is getting better. Stepping back and looking at retail writ large. You look at the store closures that have been announced so far. When you look at companies like , Victoria's Secret, Payless Shoes. This week, we saw announce that they're shutting down all 650 Dress Barn locations. All told, that's more than 6,000 store closures that have been announced in 2019. That's more than we saw for all store closures for all of 2018. You combine that with the fact that this week, we've seen , Gap, , , , they're all hitting 52-week lows with the stocks. Where should investors be looking when it comes to retail? Because I could see some investors looking at those companies I just mentioned, hitting 52-week lows, and thinking, \"Maybe that's a value.\" Those seem like value traps to me.You have to be careful about that, Chris, because they can be value traps. The United States has been over-retailed for a long time. We have more retail locations and real estate per capita than in Europe or the rest of the world, as consumers continue to look to spend more money online. You have to make sure, if you're investing in [retail], I think you have to go to where the growth is going to go. That's e-commerce. Looking at these omnichannel players, those companies that are continuing to make the right investments. We've talked about Walmart, doing a great job with this, into the e-commerce, connecting the physical retail locations with their e-commerce space. Companies that do that well will continue to do well in the marketplace.\u00a0 Shares of\u00a0\u00a0up this week after a strong third-quarter report that was followed by the software company raising guidance for the full fiscal year. Intuit's kind of getting it done, Andy. Yeah, Chris, this was my radar stock from last week. And if you recall, the things I was looking for were their small-business ecosystem revenue growth continuing to thrive. And they have a goal of making that more than 30%. That's really tied to QuickBooks Online for small businesses. That was up 38%. That matched what it was last quarter. So overall, the business continues to do well. Revenues up 12%, that was a little higher than the estimates. That included 10% in the consumer group, which is you and me using QuickBooks or using Turbo Tax. That was two-thirds of sales. 19% growth in the small-business category. Across the board, their Turbo Tax business continues to do well, their ecosystems are growing, they're getting more and more people to the platform. They're managing their costs well. They continue to generate high profit margins and lots of growth in there. So overall, the Turbo Tax story, the QuickBooks story, the Intuit story, continues to do well. I think going forward this business, as it continues to evolve into more and more services for both corporate clients and individuals, will continue to do really well.\u00a0This is a $65 billion company. Do you see them making any sort of acquisition?\u00a0They've done such a good job of building these businesses, and as you said, managing smart growth. It seems like, if they wanted to, they could go out, make a tuck-in acquisition, and just add to their ecosystem.Yeah, I think so, Chris, but I think overall, continuing to build out that and get more and more people into the platform, offering higher and higher revenue, higher and higher margin services for all those clients, different opportunities for them to connect into those ecosystems. I mean, that continues to really show. They have more than 14 million registered users on the platform. That's up from 5 million on the Turbo Tax platform. That's up from 5 million last year, and that allowed them to generate higher profits and raise the dividend 21% this quarter. So overall, whether it's acquisitions or continuing to grow the business organically, Intuit's doing really well.\u00a0Not every software company having a great week. First-quarter results for Autodesk were weak and guidance was not exactly inspiring confidence either. Shares have had a good 2019 so far, Jason. Do you look at this as a speed bump? Or do you think they've got some legit problems on their hands?\u00a0Oh, I would say speed bump. I mean, I don't know that I would qualify that quarter as weak. We can talk about that after the show, Chris. You can be forgiven if you really don't know about the business. I mean, it certainly does keep under the radar. It's not one we talk a whole lot about. I think that the market that it serves is becoming more and more relevant by the quarter. I've talked recently about the work I've done in the augmented reality space. I will say that Autodesk is one that I have high on the list of great opportunities in that space. Autodesk makes and sells 3D design and engineering and entertainment software. They have helped customers build virtually anything, whether it's a car or a building or a movie with cool special effects.\u00a0Now recently, they did make a bit of a change to the business model. They went from selling essentially perpetual license software to a subscription model. We talk about subscriptions all the time on this show. We like them. I think it was a good move. It threw a little bit of a... A wrinkle?Maybe a wrinkle.\u00a0\u00a0A curveball? A curveball, that's a good one. Yeah, threw a curveball to the analysts, I think. It made the financials a little bit tough to model out there. But ultimately, I do think it is the right move. A key metric they have in annualized recurring revenue for the quarter was up 33%. And management does recognize that the real competitive advantage for the business stems from the suite of offerings that they have. So they continue to invest in that software and bringing new products to their customers.\u00a0If you look over the last five years, the stock has absolutely pummeled the market. It's up over 200%. I think that given the size of the company, around $36 billion today, similar to another competitor, , a recommendation in  that's done very well also. It's a great market, I think, and a company that investors should really have on their radar.\u00a0 First-quarter revenue for \u00a0was higher than expected, but shares of the data analytics company falling nearly 15% this week. Andy, Splunk is not profitable. Do they have a cash flow problem?No, they actually generate free cash flow, Chris. So it's one of those companies that's not profitable, but when you add back some of the non-cash expenses, they actually make some money. To Jason's point about Autodesk, there's been some changes in some of the billing techniques and some of the solutions that they're offering, which has caused a little bit of questions about some of the cash flows expected for this year. I think some analysts are trying to make sense of that. Also, while they added 400 new clients, now have more than 18,000 in total, that's down a little bit from last quarter. Splunk is a kind of cool company, man. It takes all this data that companies generate from all their apps, all technology, and helps those companies make sense of that data and provide better solutions internally, solutions for their customers. It's machine data learning and helps their clients get smarter. So when you take in all those numbers, adding clients maybe a little bit lower than last year, analysts still a little bit lukewarm on what this means for some of the cash flow this year. Even though the company grew revenues more than 36%, Chris, higher than estimates this quarter. Just some concerns on maybe what the growth prospects for the year may mean. I think long-term, it's a $20 billion business, generates some free cash flow, playing in a very fun, dynamic market, and Splunk is taking market share and doing well. Any concerns about the lack of profitability? Obviously, they've grown the business to this point. But at some point, investors and particularly Wall Street is going to want them to start generating a profit.\u00a0Yeah. They also invest a lot in R&D. More than 25% of their revenues go into research and development. They are making progress on both gross margins and operating margins. They're getting there. I can see the profitability curve going the right direction over the next couple of years. So I'm not quite as worried about that. As long as they continue to add more clients. I think that is the thing that we have to watch. What are the client number additions looking like each quarter?In July, unveils season three of . The show has been a hit, in part because it is set in the 1980s and has a certain nostalgia factor going for it. But season three is bringing back something that absolutely no one asked for: New Coke. \u00a0is producing half a million cans of New Coke to go along with this launch of season three of . Do you think the people at Coke are unaware that New Coke was one of the all-time debacles in terms of a new products, Jason? It really feels like there's a lot more that can go wrong with this move than can go right. That's just a personal opinion. And I'll leave it at that.\u00a0Well, and we were talking about this before the show, Andy, I think this is long enough ago that people will be forgiven for not remembering that Coca-Cola in 1985 didn't just roll out New Coke as an option. They basically said, \"Oh, this highly successful product we've been making since the late 1800s? We're stopping production of that altogether. There's no longer an option. Here's New Coke, you're welcome.\" And it was, I believe, less than three months later, they had to just take it all back.\u00a0Yeah, I think 80 days it was basically on the market. I was a fan of New Coke. Oh, you're the one! [laughs]\u00a0 Maybe I was the one person out there who liked it. I was a fan. I had my parachute pants on, drinking my New Coke, it was great. I actually liked it. But clearly, a marketing and innovation mistake there. Given Mac's love of , I do feel like we're probably missing out on a pretty sweet holiday gift if we don't get a case and put it aside for him a little later.\u00a0Put that order in for him now, JMo. Let's go to our man behind the glass, Steve Broido. Steve, do you remember the New Coke debacle?\u00a0 Vaguely. I vaguely remember it. Yeah. Didn't it come out in a different can? The can looked different, if I recall.\u00a0 It did. You'll have a chance to see that new can.I won't be buying it, though. No siree, Bob. Alright, Andy Cross, Jason Moser, guys, we'll see you later in the show.\u00a0Thanks, Chris![...]The summer movie season officially kicks off this weekend, so of course, we turn to Nell Minow. She is the film critic known as the Movie Mom. She is also an expert in corporate governance, and the vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors. She joins me now. Nell, always good to talk to you! Thank you!Before we get to the movies, let's talk some business. We have to start with Boeing. The 737 MAX remains grounded after the two crashes that killed more than 350 people. We've seen reports now that Boeing was trying to get this new model certified as quickly as possible. Engineers were under pressure from managers to limit safety testing to keep down costs. Bizarrely, to me anyway, over the last 12 months, shares of Boeing are basically flat, whereas this seems like the sort of thing that would really sink an aircraft maker's stock. Where is Boeing's board of directors in all this?\u00a0First of all, I'm going to say that I have some stock in Boeing. I spoke to the person who bought it on my behalf and said, \"What is going on?\" And I'll tell you what she said. She said, \"Where's the competition? People don't like Boeing, where are they going to take their business? ? Go to the back of the line, a very, very long line, before you get your new plane?\" The customers don't seem flustered, and therefore, the investors don't seem flustered.\u00a0I would expect, however, we may see some real corporate governance changes there. The board doesn't seem to be on top of this at all. The fact that they ignored the warning signs is very, very troubling. The fact that safety doesn't seem to be factored into the set of compensation is also very troubling. I'm hoping that we see some changes there. But I don't anticipate any changes in the stock price for a while.\u00a0I get that this is basically a duopoly between Airbus and Boeing. And yes, it's not an online advertising platform. You can't just stand up a business like this. But it also, by the same token, seems like the sort of thing whereas, yeah, if you're , and you're looking for new planes, you don't necessarily want to get in the back of the line at Airbus. But it also seems like the longer this drags out, the longer the ripple effects become. So maybe Boeing's stock isn't affected now, but as this continues to slowly drag on, it could be troublesome down the line.\u00a0Oh, I absolutely agree with you. However, I also have confidence that there will be enough customer and investor pressure that they will make some changes before that happens.\u00a0Housing is obviously such a big industry. \u00a0 is the biggest home builder in America. They've been making headlines recently for some deals, not necessarily on the up-and-up. What is going on with the children of the chairman at D. R. Horton.\u00a0The children are doing fine. I'm not sure the shareholders are doing so well. It reminds me, I grew up in Chicago, under the original Mayor Daley, the first Mayor Daley, who gave a lot of the company's insurance business to his son who was just out of school. And he said, famously, if you can't do good things for your children, what's the point of being mayor?And that's kind of how I feel about this. [laughs] The problem is, in a public company, hello, you're supposed to be acting on behalf of the shareholders. There seems to be no evidence that that's the case here. What you want to see in any kind of insider transaction is, you want to see the company bending over backwards to show you that it was an arm's length transaction, that they shopped it around, got the best price. That doesn't seem to be the case here. There's all kinds of stuff going on with sweetheart deals for the kids, guaranteed returns, and personal loans from the dad. Once again, this is yet another company that wants the access to capital of a public company, but they want the control and the insider bennies of a private company. And that can sustain itself very long.\u00a0Shares of Disney recently hit an all-time high. The early reaction to the Disney+ streaming service seems to be positive, especially when you consider it's not going to launch until sometime time this fall. CEO Bob Iger is making $65 million a year. Abigail Disney, who is the granddaughter of Walt Disney, is not at all happy about this. She called that amount of pay insane. I know you're a fan of Bob Iger's leadership. I'm curious what you think of this compensation.Well, I'm a fan of both Bob Iger and Abigail Disney, who herself is a very fine filmmaker, has made some excellent documentaries. She also puts her money where her mouth is. I spend my time getting upset about people get paid too much for doing a bad job. I put people who get paid too much for doing a good job on another level. I also do own some Disney stock. I want to point out that they've done quite well this year with a little movie called  and buying the Fox content. So yeah, he is getting paid too much. I do think it is bad for the employees as a whole. I don't think it's good for the company to have the CEO get paid that much. On the other hand, he's getting paid too much for doing a really good job.\u00a0Since you mentioned , which at this point has made more than $2.6 billion worldwide, are you at all surprised at the success either of this one film or the entire package that Disney has put together under Kevin Feige's leadership going back over the last 11 years starting with ?I'm really happy that you mentioned Kevin Feige. He deserves to go down in Hollywood history with Irving Thalberg and some of the really great producers. Everybody tried to make comic book movies before that. Some of the worst movies ever made were people's attempts to make  movies. And still, they haven't quite figured out how to make a  movie. It was really Kevin Feige who brought in the vision, the love for these characters, the understanding of the symbiotic relationship between bringing all the characters together. This was his real genius -- he had the wisdom to allow each of the franchises to develop their own personality. You've got something like , which is hilarious; you've got something like , which was a throwback to the 1970s movies of political paranoia; and yet, still make them all cohesive. If you're going to watch for the third or fourth time, you will be able to tell that each of the individual musical themes for each of these characters come together just as the characters themselves do. So, yes, I was surprised, but very pleasantly surprised. There has never been a franchise like this in the history of movies. And I don't expect ever to see anything like it again.\u00a0Well, and add to Kevin Feige's list of accomplishments, and you touched on this with , his selection of directors. The fact that someone like Taika Waititi, who to that point was just known for these small -- Quirky, little -- Yeah, almost cult films. And then he gets handed this enormous budget with .\u00a0Yeah. And that worked out really, really well.  worked out very, very well. It really is astonishing, what he's been able to do, that he's been able to give, particularly these young directors, as you said, their own imprint, and yet keep it as a cohesive whole. Imagine if they did the  franchise, and Hermione had her own movie, and Professor McGonagall had her own movie, and yet they kept bringing them back together. It's just mind blowing!I want to go back to the Disney+ service for just a second. One of the things we're starting to see in the wake of, obviously, the rise of Netflix, but also Disney rolling out their streaming service, is almost a land grab among these different companies. with NBC, this week reportedly looking to buy Starz from . And Disney is taking over Hulu. What do you think are the prospects for Disney+, and how nervous should the brain trust at Netflix be?\u00a0Well, Netflix really surprised us all with the strength of their content. As long as they keep that up -- they've really abandoned their original business plan completely, which is heartbreaking to me, because what I loved about them originally was that the most obscure films that I wanted to see were always available on Netflix. And that's just not true anymore, I guess, unless you want to do DVD. But they have more than made up for with creating original content. They've gone from being, Blockbuster to being MGM. They're going a different way. Disney, of course, is now going in the opposite direction, from being a content creator, to the streaming service.\u00a0The thing that Disney has is the built-in perpetual audience. They can just keep putting out the original , the original , and they're going to have a new generation every seven years. That's a really solid basis for them. They're very, very good on content. I'm pretty impressed with the way they're going.\u00a0All we need now is, each of us, an extra 40 hours a week to watch all this stuff.\u00a0 [laughs]\u00a0Let's get to the summer movies. I'm curious what you're looking forward to with all of the options this summer.\u00a0Well, as usual, we have a lot of sequels, a lot of blockbusters. I have to say the guilty pleasure I'm most looking forward to, doesn't  look amazing? The spin-off of the  franchise. That looks incredible! I mean, anytime that you've got car chases, Jason Statham, The Rock and Helen Mirren, you're pretty much good.\u00a0Also, we just talked about . The two stars of  are teaming up for another one of my favorite franchises, . The trailer looks absolutely amazing! We've got .  looks wonderful! I'm very excited about that!And then, every summer, what I look forward to are the little surprising indies. We've already got one opening up this week. It's called . It could not be more adorable. It is about two very, very, very bright high school seniors. It's the last night before graduation. They've done everything right. They have given up all fun and just done all their homework. They've gotten into their dream schools. And on that last night, they decide to go out for the last time and have some wild adventures. And they do. If it sounds a little bit like , then let me tell you that the star of , Jonah Hill, his sister is the star of , but this is a much sweeter story. And yes, it's very raunchy, but it's absolutely great! Looking forward to having everybody see that!Well, I was going to ask you if there was an under-the-radar movie that we should be looking for. Sounds like you've already answered that. I'm curious, of all the big movies you mentioned, and certainly some of those are on my list, one you didn't mention, I'm curious if you have any early sense of this movie, particularly in the wake of the Academy Awards, any buzz on , which is the Elton John movie? Yeah, the buzz that I've heard so far is that it is not a straight biopic, and that it goes off and uses kind of fantasy sequences, which sounds appropriate for what it's doing. There is one other little neglected indie that I think everybody will be talking about this summer. It's called , with last year's breakout star, Awkwafina, who stole the show in and also in\u00a0. This year, she plays a young woman whose grandmother, with whom she's very close in China, is going to die. But they decided they're not going to tell her that she's going to die. They're just going to pretend that they're having a family wedding, so that gives everybody an excuse to come see her before she dies. And it's about what happens then. It's called . It is absolutely great! That's another one I want everybody to be on the lookout for.\u00a0I and all of our listeners will forever be indebted to you for the conversation you and I had this time two years ago when I asked you, is there a movie this summer that we can skip? And you told us yes, you don't need to go see Tom Cruise in . Thank you from the bottom of my heart!That's both time and money that I saved, and apparently based on the box office receipts, time and money that lots of other people saved as well. Everyone listened to me, thank you! With that in mind, this summer, they can't all be hits. What is something we're probably better off skipping?\u00a0I have not seen it yet. Take that under advisement. But I have to say the new looks awful.\u00a0After all of the things I just said about Disney, yeah... Wow, OK! I'm clearly shaken by this one, but not as shaken as the Disney people are going to be. I hope I'm wrong! Last thing, then I'll let you go. Roughly 40 million Americans are going to have some type of road trip this Memorial Day weekend. I know you're going to be traveling back home to Chicago. With that in mind, what is a road trip movie or two that you enjoy?\u00a0Well, you cannot beat  with Robert De Niro. I always say that road trips are the oldest story of all, going back to Odysseus. They always work because they take people out of their milieu and they get to know each other.  is a classic. And then, of course, the greatest road trip movie of all time, . One of the best reasons to be on so you can follow Nell Minow and get her thoughts on movies and corporate governance and so much more. Nell, have a wonderful time with your family this weekend!Thank you! Bye-bye![...]It's Memorial Day weekend. We want to help you get ready for your summer vacation, not just with the awesome summer theme music that our man behind the glass, Steve Broido, has been playing. Also by encouraging you to check out The Motley Fool's podcast swag shop. You can get T-shirts, ball caps to keep the sun off your face, coffee mugs, and a lot more. Go to .\u00a0Time to get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man behind the glass will hit you with a question. And you know what? You can hit him back with one if you want. Jason Moser, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?\u00a0Sure. Well, perhaps we have listeners tuning in to this week's  via my radar stock, , SPOT. Obviously, as we've discussed before, the economics of the music business are pretty brutal. But when we get back to the whole content-is-king thing, let's also remember that distribution plays a very important role as well. And I think that's actually where Spotify is starting to show they have a leg up on everyone here. Recent quarterly results came out. Monthly active users grew 26% to 217 million. Premium users grew 32% of 100 million. Where I think they're starting to differentiate themselves is they're going beyond just music. They're building out, I think, a platform of all sorts of different content, and that includes podcasts. The acquisitions of Gimlet Media and Anchor will help them build out those offerings. An interesting partnership, which is going to result in Spotify being pre-loaded on all these new Samsung devices coming out. I just think there are a lot of opportunities in the future here for Spotify to become that default operating system for folks' entertainment on their mobile devices. Obviously, Music will play a role. But when we look at Android's position there, that's the dominating operating system, and that's where Spotify, I think, can really exploit that advantage there.\u00a0Steve, question about Spotify?If you ask 10 people on the street if they knew what Spotify really did, do you think they'd be able to answer correctly?\u00a0Sure, I think so. I mean, I can ask my daughters what Spotify does, and they can answer it. I give credit to people just walking the street. Most people have a Spotify account now, don't they, Steve? Don't you?I did. I don't now. They all blend together. There's so many of them!\u00a0 Andy Cross, what are you looking at?, a human resources software company, and provides finance solutions as\u00a0well, reports earnings next week. It's a $46 billion company, so very large. It was founded by Dave Duffield and Aneel Bhusri, who worked at PeopleSoft, that was acquired by years ago. It's a company that serves more than 2,600 clients, including 40% of the Fortune 500, and, Chris, half of the Fortune 50. So it's really a growth story, it's been able to grow more than 30% per year. So I want to see if that growth is slowing and what they are seeing with the client additions. That's an important factor for them to be able to continue to grow the business. So symbol is WDAY. Steve? How would a company like The Motley Fool use Workday in our day-to-day? There's a lot of competitors. How you interact with payroll, it handles a lot of the things that client and client employees need to be able to interact with to basically just do their everyday work job. So I think it's an important software solution for lots of different clients out there.\u00a0What do you think, Steve?\u00a0I think I'm going with Spotify. I'll give it a shot! I don't know if I understand it, but I think I'll go with it. Alright, Andy Cross, Jason Moser, guys, thanks for being here! That'll do it for this week's show. Our engineer is Steve Broido.

The company also raised full fiscal-year revenue guidance to $2.25 billion from $2.2 billion, implying some upside over the consensus $2.22 billion estimate.Image source: Getty Images.The company exceeded most metrics for the quarter, but a number of analysts took a glass-half-empty view of the results. Post earnings, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman lowered his price target to $157 from $162 due to \"uncertainty\" around Splunk's growth rates and free cash flow penetration, though he did say the valuation remains attractive.Guggenheim analyst Imtiaz Koujalgi similarly lowered his price target to $115 from $125, saying operating cash flow could be a headwind for the entire year. And Piper Jaffray's Alex J. Zukin noted the company \"meaningfully\" cut its forecast for operating cash flow to $250 million from $350 million, and that management expressed disappointment regarding the number of new customers added in the quarter.The quarter might not have been perfect, but as Bachman notes there is still a lot to like about the performance. Prior to the earnings release, shares of Splunk had been up 30% year to date and have more than doubled in the past three years.The company is still moving in the right direction, but armed with an indication that Splunk's momentum might be slowing somewhat, investors on Friday apparently thought it best to book some gains.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Meanwhile on the bottom line, that translated to a surprise adjusted profit of $0.02 per share, crushing consensus estimates for an adjusted of $0.14 per share. What's more, Splunk offered second-quarter guidance for revenue of $485 million, around $5 million ahead of Wall Street's models, and followed by increasing its full fiscal-year revenue outlook by roughly $50 million, to $2.25 billion.So why the drop on Friday?It didn't help that Splunk was already up 25% year to date leading into the report. But it turns out  that Splunk simultaneously told investors it now expects full fiscal-year operating cash flow to be roughly $250 million, a whopping $100 million reduction from its previous $350 million target.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.But this also raises the question: Should investors be concerned with Splunk's tempered cash flow prediction?I don't think so.During the , David Conte, Splunk senior VP, finance, elaborated:With respect to cash flow, [we] mentioned before that the shift to renewable bookings impacts the timing of our invoicing and therefore the timing of our cash collections. We reached the renewable mix of 77% last year -- which was 12 percentage points higher than planned -- and it's expected to be at least 85% this year. This overachievement is driving acceleration of unbilled contract value as well, which is well ahead of our plan. ... Importantly, we expect that the timing of cash collections will normalize once the renewable mix reaches a steady state.Put another way, Splunk's transition away from perpetual licenses and toward a more predictable, cloud-based subscription model is happening much more quickly than the company initially expected. And the timing of Splunk's recognized cash flow is suffering in the near term as a result.This reminds me of Adobe's similar transition away from perpetual licenses and toward its popular cloud-based solutions a few years ago. That process led traders to punish Adobe stock multiple times between 2014 and early 2016, as the market failed to equate the creative-software specialist's seemingly conservative forward guidance with the timing of its own rapid shift to a recurring-revenue model.Sure enough, astute investors who  have watched Adobe stock more than triple since early 2016 as the underlying strength of its business became clear.With Splunk shares now down nearly 20% from their all-time highs -- and barring a broader market pullback that drags down high-flying tech in the process -- I think Splunk investors willing to watch this recurring-revenue shift unfold could be poised to enjoy a similar run, particularly as the market sees its cash flows begin to stabilize in the coming years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The global economy has transformed from farm-based to machine-based to mental-work-based, and our patterns of living have changed drastically with it. And they keep evolving at a rapid clip. It can take effort to keep adapting to it all.One method that Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner uses to help himself in that endeavor is cross-pollination -- he's constantly looking to the works of other smart people for great new ideas he can bring into his life. In this\u00a0podcast, he shares some of his favorite tips for winning in our thinking world, culled from four great authors, and one great sci-fi TV series' most terrifying villain. But this isn't the first time he's brought a \"thinking world\" theme to the podcast. Three years ago this month, Michael Bloomberg's 2016 commencement address at the University of Michigan led Gardner to ponder the idea that humanity is exiting the Industrial Age and entering the Information Age, which in turn made him think about which companies were best poised to benefit from that transition. He built a five-stock sampler around that concept, and this week, he'll tell you how it's doing.To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our\u00a0.

For 3,000 years, humankind had an economy based on farming. Till the soil, plant the seed, harvest the crop, hard to do, but fairly easy to learn. Well, that ended a few hundred years ago, when machines began doing that work for us. Today, most of the value you and I create, when you think about it, is through not our muscles, but our minds. As my friend Roy Spence says, dream it, build it. That is the wonderful world in which so many of us -- not all of us, but so many of us -- find ourselves in today. Dream it, build it. I like to call it a thinking world.\u00a0On this podcast three years ago, this very week, I picked five stocks that I hoped would thrive in a thinking world. It was called \"Five Winners in a Thinking World.\" How have they done? We will review.But beyond that, I also want to help you think and consequently act smarter. It's one thing to find five winning stocks in a thinking world, it's another to try to help you win in a thinking world. Let's try to do both, only on this week's .\u00a0[...]Welcome back to ! I'm David Gardner. So glad to have you with us this week!Three years ago this week, a few important things related to this podcast happened. One was that I picked five stocks,\u00a0\"Five Winners in a Thinking World.\" Part of this week's podcast will be reviewing those stocks. I have the wonderful Emily Flippen joining me a little bit later this podcast. Emily and I are going to talk through those five companies, how they've done. \"Five Winners in a Thinking World,\" have they been winners? What can we learn from them? That's a big part of this week's podcast.\u00a0But a couple of other things happened three years ago this week that made me want to do something different to start with. One of them was that I was recently reacting to a commencement speech given to the University of Michigan by Michael Bloomberg of New York City fame and Bloomberg, the company. He said some interesting things to those graduates that I'm going to recall for us and talk a little bit about that this week.Also happening three years ago this week on this podcast, the first ad read in Motley Fool, at least  podcast, history. The Motley Fool for years up to then had never had any ads on any of our podcasts. If you're a regular listener, you're probably used to brands like Rocket Mortgage -- which, for the record, was the first ad that I ever read on the show three years ago this week. I had also just been on a TV show. It was on PBS with Consuelo Mack. That was also a week before three years ago this week.\u00a0In fact, I'm just going to put it out there right now to you my listener, if you're interested, it was about a 26-minute interview and appearance. It's right out there on the internet if you just Google Consuelo Mack . You'll find it. If anybody wants to take the time to watch that again, I'd be very curious, A, what did I get most right? And B, what did I get most wrong? In fact, if you want to have some fun with that and tweet us @RBIPodcast this upcoming week, maybe I'll include some of that in this month's mailbag toward the end of the month. If anybody wants to slog through a 26-minute interview that I did with Consuelo Mack, that was also happening three years ago this week.\u00a0That's some of what was happening three years ago. But now I want to go back to that Bloomberg quote. I want to use it to frame up some of our conversation and thoughts this week. Here's what Mayor Bloomberg was saying three years ago, to the graduates of the University of Michigan. Just a short excerpt. He said, \"For the first time in human history, the majority of people in the developed world are being asked to make a living with their minds rather than their muscles. For 3,000 years, humankind had an economy based on farming. Till the soil, plant the seed, harvest the crop. Hard to do, but fairly easy to learn. Then, for 300 years, we had an economy based on industry. Mold the parts, turn the crank, assemble the product. Hard to do, but also fairly easy to learn. Now, we have an economy based on information. Acquire the knowledge, apply the analytics, use your creativity. Hard to do, hard to learn. And even once you've mastered it, you'll have to start learning all over again pretty much every day.\"I think that's a very apt reflection on where we are today as a species, and what the world needs of us. The world needs us to be winners in this increasingly thinking world. We need to add value using our minds. I wanted to use that as an opportunity to share with you a few insights that I have, hoping to make you a winner in our thinking world. I'm going to be drawing on some of my favorite concepts from a few of my favorite books. That's the focus of where we are right now. Then we'll have Emily in a little later and talk about those five winning stocks -- if they are, in fact, winning stocks -- in this thinking world.\u00a0Five reflections, if you will, \"Making You a Winner in Our Thinking World.\" Now, most of these are from my book learning. If you remember last year on the podcast, for August, we made that \"Authors in August.\" That was the first year we'd done that in 2018 for . I had in some of my favorite authors of books that I'd primarily read the previous year or so. You may remember Amor Towles, the author of . If you're just finding our podcast here a year later, you can go back and hear me interview one of the better novelists of our time about a wonderful book, . That same month I also had Priya Parker talk about her wonderful book, . And just to keep things really motley and mix it up, Mark Penn came in and talked about his book , looking at some of the key trends of the future. All of that was last August. In a way, I'm prepping you for this August, because I'm sure hoping to have at least one of the authors I'll be mentioning shortly on this podcast for our \"Authors in August\" 2019.\u00a0Well, the first thought I wanted to share with you, the first good thinking tool for you, comes from somebody who's already been on this podcast, David Allen. For anybody who knows his work, , GTD. There's a big community. If you just Google GTD, you're going to see a lot of people who follow David Allen's ideas. As I try to make you a winner in our thinking world, here's the first thing I wanted to just swipe from David Allen and share with you. He has many concepts I appreciate, but one of them is the two-minute rule. I think I can do this -- I sure hope so -- two minutes or less. David Allen's two-minute rule is simply this: If you can do it in the next two minutes, do it. A lot of us will walk past something in our house and think, \"I really should take the garbage out,\" or have this quick thought reappear, like, \"I should write that down on a Post-it note.\" And yet we don't. We walk past that un-taken-out garbage, or we don't write down that quick thought that we have. And we might forget it altogether; in which case, we're in trouble that we didn't take the garbage out, or we're sad we never wrote it down. Or, we write it down later. We keep rethinking the same thought until finally, we act.\u00a0This is such a simple point, but it's profound. He says, literally, if you can do it in the next two minutes right now, do it. Corollary to that is, it has to be two minutes or less. If you start head faking yourself and say, \"Well, that's a two-minute task,\" but it takes you four and a half minutes, then you'll start doubting yourself in future and start putting off and not using this rule because you'll think it actually takes more than two minutes, I'm not even going to bother with that approach anymore. No, it has to be two minutes or less.\u00a0That simple rule has saved me all kinds of forgetfulness and increased my productivity since I first read it when I read his book, , I think in the year 2003. 16 years later, here I am, leading off \"Making You a Winner in Our Thinking World\" with David Allen's wonderful, powerful two-minute rule. If you could do it in the next two minutes, just do it! Put things aside and get it done. You'll be happy you did. You don't have to keep that up in your gray matter and have it keep cycling and reminding you that you haven't done anything about it.\u00a0To each of the authors I'll be sharing with you today, I say, thank you, David Allen!All right, the next one is from a new author I've not yet met. I know some of you have read his wonderful book, . James Clear. I really enjoyed reading his book in the last year, . It's all about creating good habits and getting rid of bad habits and how really small changes that you make in your own thinking -- because that's where it starts, your thinking, and then, of course, your acting. The habits that we create for ourselves because darn it, we really are creating our own habits, if you change them, even in micro ways, all of a sudden the results that you can get can be profound.\u00a0From James' book, I'd just like to pull this key insight, the four laws of behavior change. James writes, \"This provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones. You can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior. When the levers are in the right positions, creating good habits is effortless. When they're in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.\" To me, this is the key insight of his book. How to create a good habit, he's got four laws. The first: Make it obvious. The second: Make it attractive. The third: Make it easy. And the fourth, the reward part: Make it satisfying.\u00a0James goes on to say, \"We can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.\" Here we go. How to break a bad habit, inversion of the first law: Make it invisible. Second: Make it unattractive. Third: Make it difficult. And finally, in the inversion of his fourth law: Make it unsatisfying.\u00a0James' book, much like David Allen's book, is really here again to our theme, helping you think smarter and make winning decisions. A lot of that for a lot of us is getting rid of old habits or bad habits and replacing them with a better version of you. Because I can think of examples in my own life, I bet you can, too, and I can look at others and see people have really improved themselves over the course of life. Some people are almost addicted to doing that. It's wonderful to watch. Some people are just constantly learning and self-improving. If you have somebody like that in your life, it's a powerful force of influence for you or for me. But so much of our life, Clear points out, is ruled by habit, often unthinking habits. In fact, one of the things he says early in his book is, inventory your own habits. Go through a day, and just for the fun of it, write down everything you do habitually. For example, do you always brush your teeth right as you get out of bed? That would be an example. And just be self-conscious about your habits, good or bad, throughout a day. By collecting them in the first place, it enables you to reflect on them and think about how to improve.Thank you, James Clear, for your book, .\u00a0All right, \"Making You a Winner in Our Thinking World.\" Tip No. 3. This one comes from another excellent book and I'd love to have Warren Berger join me. I enjoyed his first book, , and his follow-up to that book, which I've read in the past year, is , from which this short excerpt comes. Berger invites us to do something I've often tried to invite you to do, talking about investing on this podcast, and that is, don't be a binary thinker. Life isn't so often about yes or no. An example Berger gives in one of his chapters in , he says, let's pretend that you have problems with your boss. A lot of people would say things like, \"Should I quit this business?\" Yes or no? Binary. But there's almost always a third way, a new thought, a way to think differently, that isn't a yes or no. And so often, the Foolish answer, I think, lies in that third creative choice.\u00a0The excerpt I'm sharing with you here, Berger shares, use these five questions to open up possibilities. The first is, how can I open up the question to be decided? He writes, \"We have a tendency to make binary decisions -- yes or no, either/ or -- which limits options. Try using open-ended questions like, 'what are the best ways' or 'how might I...' to frame your decision?\" That's No. 1. No. 2, what is the great, the good, and the ugly? Warren writes, \"When making decisions, try to choose from at least three options. Do this by projecting three different potential outcomes or scenarios. One very positive, one moderate, and one negative. Third, if none of the current options were available, what would I do?\" Another beautiful question. He writes, \"Imagine that the existing options you're deciding between suddenly have vanished. This forces you to try to come up with additional possibilities. Upon returning to reality, you can now weigh your newly imagined options against the existing ones.\" Fourth. \"What is the counterintuitive choice? Include one option,\" as you're thinking through whatever problem you're thinking through, \"that goes completely against the others. You probably won't choose it, but it stimulates unconventional thinking.\" And finally, fifth. \"What would an outsider do? You can get an actual outsider to help answer this, or just try to look at the situation the way an outsider might.\"That's the end of the excerpt from by Warren Berger. I like that last one in particular. Sometimes I think about great leaders. For me, a lot of them are from the corporate world. I think about some of my favorite CEOs, somebody like Steve Jobs. I say, how would Steve Jobs approach this situation? How would Jeff Bezos try to solve that? How would, fill in the blank, anybody that you admire as a leader, approach the situation you're looking at?\u00a0Thank you, Warren Berger, for your book, . Maybe we'll get to have Warren on in August.\u00a0All right, \"Making You a Winner in Our Thinking World\" tip No. 4. This one's just about knowing yourself. Now unfortunately, I can't have the next author on our show because he's no longer living. Warren Bennis for almost 50 years was one of our best writers in the United States of America about leadership. He wrote a lot of good books about it. I've certainly quoted him before on . His book,\u00a0, is the one that I've read. Tip No. 4, it really is inspired by an epigraph, a lead-off quote to one of the chapters in his book . The chapter is entitled \"Knowing Yourself.\" And here it comes, from William James, the psychologist, the brother of the famed novelist Henry James. William James wrote this as Bennis quotes him. \"I've often thought that the best way to define a man's character would be to seek out the particular mental or moral attitude in which, when it came upon him, he felt himself most deeply and intensely active and alive. At such moments, there is a voice inside which speaks and says, 'This is the real me.'\"\u00a0Every one of us is different. The real me contrasts, in marked ways, I'm sure, and connects in some similar ways with the real you, whoever you are. But it is often the goal to know ourselves. That is a lifelong journey for many of us. We change. The world makes us change. The world's going to keep changing, so you and I better try to change when we need to, whether in the business world, socially, culturally. But knowing ourselves. After all, I think it was on the Oracle of Delphi, I believe, scrawled there -- this might just be one of those old saws that wasn't actually true, but I think it's true, I think carved on the Oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece, was the phrase \"know thyself,\" of course in Greek. Knowing yourself. In particular, when you think about, when do I feel \"most intensively active and alive,\" that can often help guide you toward making the right decision for you and yours in this thinking world. A simple thought, but I hope a penetrating one.\u00a0Oh! I see Emily Flippen on the other side of the glass! She's going to be coming in to do a stock review real soon. So here's No. 5. This one's just one of my personal favorites. In fact, it's a story I've told to some of our employees over the years. I'm going to tell it to you now and share it with you. It starts, like so many things that I love, rooted in a geeky world, in this case, the world of .\u00a0Now, if you're even more of a Trekkie than I am, I might be slightly butchering the story, but I am enough of a Trekkie that I feel comfortable briefly giving my view of the Borg, which at least in , and maybe all  lore, is maybe the most feared of all aliens that we meet in the universe through all of the different  stories and lore. The Borg. The Borg are kind of cyborgs. They're part human, part machine. And when we first beam aboard their mothership and we find ourselves in a combat circumstance, one of the \u00a0ensigns -- I'm just going to say, one of the red shirts -- is walking along a tunnel somewhere in that mothership. The Borg are there walking just like you're passing somebody in a corporate office building or on the street, just walking right past them. In combat, we walk up and punch them. And right away, we connect, and that Borg falls over, short circuits, and presumably dies. It seems so easy. One punch, one hit, man down, keep moving.\u00a0The problem is, when that same ensign then tries to do that to a second Borg, as soon as he or she throws the punch, a force field goes up right in front of that punch. So it fails. So, what is the answer? What would you or I do? We just pull out our phaser -- kind of like a laser gun -- and just shoot it. And sure enough, the Borg falls over, short circuits, and dies. No. 2 is down. So now you come up to No. 3 in this combat situation. Throw a punch, force field blocks. Pull out the phaser, uh-oh, different color force field just negated the phaser. Now you're trying to figure out how to fight the Borg. And why are the Borg the most feared species that we encounter through all of ? The answer is because they're all networked with each other. When any Borg learns anything, all of them learn at the same time what they need to do, so they progress and evolve together in a collective manner, which is devastatingly effective if you think about the power of networks. You're just an ensign with, unfortunately for you, a red shirt on a  episode.\u00a0The way that I've turned that around and made that a business story for our employees here at The Motley Fool is, I've said, be the Borg. It's just fine to get knocked out by our first mistake. Somebody punches us, OK, we weren't expecting it, we go down. They pull out their laser, shoot us, sure. It's the first time we'd ever seen that out. Ouch. But when they try that again, I sure hope that you're learning. As a Motley Fool employee, I really want you to be learning, because you're on my team. We're trying to grow a company to make the world smarter, happier, and richer, so I sure hope you'll be learning. But for all of us, I think in a thinking world, tip No. 5 says, be the Borg. Be the Borg. That is, you can fail, but learn and be ready and grow.\u00a0In fact, one of my very favorite websites is betheborg.com. I encourage you, if you've never visited what I'm going to call one of my favorite websites, that you type that into your browser, betheborg.com, and enjoy that website.\u00a0I hope you enjoyed my efforts to make you a winner in our thinking world. In fact, if any one of those five connected with you -- David Allen's two-minute rule, James Clear's how to create good habits and get rid of bad ones, Warren Berger's what if this isn't a yes or no decision, or William James reminding us through Warren Bennis to know thyself, or finally, be the Borg. If any one of those connected with you, then I feel really good about it, because each of those has been, for me, anyways, powerful learning leading to better activities.\u00a0Well, Emily, as I've already mentioned, you're here to help us review five stocks picked three years ago this week, \"Five Winners in a Thinking World.\" Now, when I did this list of stocks on May 4th of 2016, I was saying at the time, we're going to be picking these for three years. Now, everything we do really is for three-plus years. But if we kept holding all of these five-stock samplers, this podcast would be nothing but reviews one week after another. So this is, in fact, Emily, the end of covering \"Five Winners in a Thinking World.\" This is their three-year birthday. Emily, three years ago, May 4th, 2016. What were you doing?\u00a0I think I was really excited because I just got an offer from The Motley Fool to come in for an internship. I don't think I'd quite yet started. But I know that I got it and I was really pumped.\u00a0 That's awesome! I'm so glad to know that's what was happening three years ago this week and your life. I've already shared a little bit about mine. So I think we can now move on from us to our stocks. And we've got five of them. And for each of these, I'll be reviewing briefly what the stock was, where it was, and where it is today. The numbers part of it. And then Emily, I've asked you, since the purpose of The Motley Fool is to make the world smarter, happier and richer, I would love it if you could make us smarter and happier about each of these five stocks. So maybe make us smarter, reflect on the three years, and pick out maybe something that really says why this stock did well or not. And then, how about a fun fact, something that makes us happier? And then we'll find out at the end whether these stocks made us richer or not as we do the results. Sounds good?\u00a0That sounds great! Let's do it! OK. The first stock up three years ago this week was . The ticker symbol is CELG. This is a company that on that day was just below $101. It was $100.90 a share. Today as we tape this podcast the afternoon of Tuesday, May 7th, it's at about, I'm sorry to say, $95 a share. Celgene is down 5.5% over these three years. Here's what really hurts for stock market investors who may have followed my advice three years ago: The market is up exactly 40%. We're taping on a date -- pretty bad,\u00a0the Nasdaq's down about 2% today. It's 2% less. But still up 40% over the last three years. So this stock is 46% behind the market. Emily, this stock has not made us richer, but could you make us smarter and happier about Celgene?I think Celgene, regardless of whether or not you're an investor who may be bought in and lost about 5% there, has made us smarter. It's not just because of all the research that they've done into their cancer treatment drugs. I think it's the way that it really opened up the biopharmaceutical industry. I mean, it was kind of the first play that was integrated. It had so many different components to its business. And for a long time, a lot of investors' first step into biopharmaceuticals. Now it feels like every other week in , at least, we see a different company coming out that's doing something revolutionary and amazing in the space of biopharmaceutical. So in a way, it was an anchor for a lot of investors when looking at investing in the biopharmaceuticals space. And just because Celgene maybe didn't perform the best, I know there are a handful of other companies that came after it, trying to get after very similar things, in the way that they conduct research and create products.\u00a0I think that ultimately, we can all come out of it a little bit smarter.\u00a0I appreciate that point very much. It is, I guess, in a way, even though it is a loser, it's consoling to know that it did make the world smarter. And apparently it made pretty interested because Celgene, part of the reason you're using the past tense, Emily, is that Bristol-Myers contracted to buy this company out. That's something that happened just a few months ago. The price is, well, around where it is right now, which is why the stock's trading there. It's a $74 billion buyout, one of the bigger buyouts in pharma history. Celgene didn't exactly fully, in a way, last these three years. It did decline those first couple, so we were sitting on a loser. It got bought out at a premium, but still below where I talked about it three years ago this week.\u00a0I'm a little sad about Celgene for a few different reasons. I really appreciate all the inroads they've made to go after blood cancer. It's great work, and it's obviously very valuable. About $75 billion or so, Bristol-Myers says. But Emily, can you make me a little happier about Celgene?\u00a0Well, there's a lot of things to be happy about for Celgene. Going beyond their products, which I'm sure have made a lot of people happier who had the unfortunate exposure to things like blood cancer,\u00a0whether themselves or through their family or loved ones, Celgene as a business actually makes me happy. It's because it's not well known that Celgene has continuously been ranked as one of the best places to work internationally, especially in the biopharmaceutical industry. They have an extremely robust CSR program -- Corporate social responsibility.\u00a0Exactly. They really see themselves not as a company that's out there to make money even though clearly they are. They see their bigger obligation to humanity, which is really saying something in the environment that we're seeing today with a lot of these companies, which we now are seeing dragged in the water because they're preventing treatment from being sent out to people. The fact that Celgene has taken the high road in a lot of regards is really nice.\u00a0All right, well, thank you! That was stock No. 1. Great to hear! Emily, let's go to stock No. 2. Ticker symbol is well known to many longtime investors and  listeners. The ticker symbol is DIS. The company is . A company that has a ton of properties, data. A lot of our thinking, in many ways, is driven by a company like Disney. I've noticed some people have been focused on the . When we talk about a thinking world, a lot of people are thinking just about the biggest box office hit of all time, which is still in early days for Disney. But of course, it's about a lot more, not just superheroes, but businesses than that.\u00a0Walt Disney was at $103.67 three years ago this week. As we do this podcast, I have it just over $134 a share. Hey, great news, right? Up 29.5%, we'll round that to 30%. Bad news, though, the market up 40%. Disney up 30%. So, \"Five Winners in a Thinking World,\" so far, we've got two losers. Emily, make us smarter about Disney.\u00a0Well, it's a good lesson to be learned from Disney that sometimes the best-run companies, doing the best things in the world that you love the most, may not outperform the market. It's a reminder that smart investors take that\u00a0three years is not a long enough time horizon. That's purely because I don't think there's a single person looking at Disney in the state that it's in today and thinks, \"This isn't going to continue to do amazing things in the future.\" Whether you bought in three years ago, or you're buying in today, I mean, this is such a well-run company. We can all be a little bit smarter to not be latched onto these historical biases, this small underperformance when in reality, you see the opportunity clearly before your eyes with a company like Disney.\u00a0Thank you! And you're right. And I'm so glad you emphasize that. This five-stock sampler, \"Five Winners in a Thinking World,\" just because we're ending it this week, because that's how long the game was being played on this podcast over the last three years, doesn't mean that we don't still love these companies, admire them, and think great things about them. Had we done this the three or so years before, I bet Disney would have been a winner over those three years. I sure hope it'll be a winner over the next three years. But by no means does our interest or belief in any of these stocks end with this podcast. Quite the opposite. They all remain active recommendations in  or .\u00a0I think in a lot of ways, Disney makes us happier. I think that's at the heart of its brand. Emily, can you make us a little happier about Disney?\u00a0It's so hard to choose one thing about Disney that can make me or an investor, anybody in the world, a little bit happier. But I keep going back to Disney+. Maybe that's just because it's very topical right now. I don't have kids. But I imagine if I was a parent to young kids, there'd be nothing in this world that made me happier than Disney+. To be able to have an essentially unlimited supply of family-friendly content that you can plop them down in front of and feel totally comfortable with that decision...I mean, it makes me project a little bit into that state.\u00a0But if I were a parent, I would feel very happy.\u00a0Well, certainly the stock market has not failed to notice that Disney+ will be coming out later this year. It's not yet a present reality. But in some ways, Disney's stock reacted really positively in its most recent earnings report. I think the stock popped over 10% in a single day as Bob Iger began to talk more about Disney+. Everybody knows it's coming. Yes, I still love ,\u00a0too. I don't think these things are opposed. It's a thinking world, and these kinds of companies and brands all do well in my experience. It'll be really interesting to watch. Thank you for highlighting Disney+.All right, Emily, stock No. 3. Now, spoiler alert, things are about to get better with this five-stock sampler. Because after all, the purpose of Motley Fool, Emily, is to make the world smarter, happier, and what? Richer!Let's hope so! This company, I can say, has done so. This is a market-beater, company No. 3. The ticker symbol is SPLK. The company is . Three years ago this week, it was at $48.87. At the close on May 4th, really happy to let you all know that it's at about $130 a share right now as we talk. Just short of $130 a share. I have it then up 166%. The stock market up 40%, so we can put a big plus 126% in the win column. One hundred and twenty-six points ahead of the S&P 500. And if you compare the previous two stocks, which were a minus 46, reviewing quickly, a minus 46 and a minus 10, and you do the math with me, 126 minus 56 looks like a plus 70 right now as we look over these three stocks.Emily, make us smarter about what's been happening over these last three years with Splunk.\u00a0 Well, Splunk has made all of us aware, gave us information to what a zettabyte is. David, do you know what is a zettabyte is?\u00a0I'm going to say it's a ton of data, but that's about as far as I can go.\u00a0A zettabyte is one billion terabytes. One terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes. So you can get an idea about how Splunk is making us smarter. Splunk sees the 44 zettabytes, which I don't even know how to do that math quickly in my head, this huge amount of data. I'm glad you know it's 44, not 40, no round number here. Somebody at Splunk found that number, with all the universe of information that we have out in the world, and they're making sense of it. That makes us all a little bit smarter.\u00a0So you're saying, Emily, that the world's data at this point equals 44 zettabytes? By 2020, the world's information will equal 44 zettabytes.\u00a0OK, great! You know, Splunk, I'm going to supplement your smarter lesson with a little bit more smarter. This was kind of interesting to note. Splunk had been a losing stock the one year leading up to when I picked it three years ago. The three years leading up to it, it had also been a loser stock. It had IPO'd not that far before. It had a big initial IPO. But then it just dawdled for a while. So, I'm so happy to think that we did pick it three years ago this week, because it's gone from basically about $50 to about $130 over these three years, and shows that often, the winners win out there. And it is a winning company.\u00a0Thank you for making us smarter! How about, make us a little happier when we think about Splunk? Splunk is subtle happiness. It's that happiness that you feel when you wake up in the morning and you see a nice sunrise, you see the birds tweeting. You don't know exactly what it is, but it makes you happy. Let me name a couple of companies that maybe conduct this happiness for you, because they're all Splunk customers. Splunk makes all these customers run and make you happy. Do you like ?\u00a0 I do like Yelp! ? Sure!? I know it.?Coke makes me happier than Groupon, personally.\u00a0I'm referring to Coca-Cola.\u00a0 Yes, Coca-Cola. The only thing that's important to me is the fact they help run their information system.\u00a0I transacted with Domino's last night. And that's a vital part of my everyday life, for better or worse. So, Splunk, I like to think, makes a lot of people happier without them quite realizing that Splunk is in fact making them happier.\u00a0Love it! Yeah, it's a great company! Of course, we like it a lot for the next three years, but we're going to stop tracking it with this five-stock sampler as of this podcast. That leaves us with two final stocks to talk about, Emily. One thing I want to say about these two companies is they both have silly names. There's Splunk and the next two. Since we named our company The Motley Fool, an inherently silly name, especially in the area of finance, you can see that I'm probably a little bit of a sucker for companies that have silly names. So Splunk, probably playing into my subconscious, part of the reason I picked it three years ago or years before that for , is because I like the silly. I like the happy and silly. So, let's next go to some more silly. Stock No. 4, the ticker symbol, tell me if you can guess the company name from this ticker symbol: TWTR. I think a lot of us, even if you're not an investor, maybe you can guess along with me. . Stock No. 4 was Twitter. Three years ago this week, Twitter was just below $15 a share. $14.84. It should be noted that it had lost 70% of its value in the years leading up to our picking it three years ago this week. It had lost 70% of its value, down to $14.84. As we speak now, it's at about $38.50. Twitter, therefore, is up 160%. Again, the stock market, up 40% over these three years. So that's up 120%, making me really happy that we found some winners in this thinking world.\u00a0Emily, looking back over three years now, thinking big picture about Twitter, make us smarter.\u00a0Well, there's so many ways that Twitter makes everybody a little bit smarter. That might sound counterintuitive right now, especially with all the noise we hear about these fake accounts, information privacy. But Twitter is doing something that's really revolutionizing the way that we learn and consume information. It's democratizing information. It's making people smarter by increasing responsibility, by increasing accessibility. And that, to me, is probably the most strong value proposition at a company like Twitter. This access to information, it's unprecedented. Even in the internet age, having a Twitter, using a Twitter, accessing people over Twitter, that type of level has really never been seen before.\u00a0I agree. And certainly many of us who love a celebrity or an athlete, we can follow them on Twitter. And really, in a lot of ways, we might in some cases be following their social media manager. Some others are more authentic than that. Side note, I'm a small presence on Twitter, but I just tweet myself. I mean, there are no social media managers here guiding Motley Fool advisors' accounts. That said, whether it's a celebrity, an athlete, or how about the authors that I referenced earlier this podcast? James Clear, . I follow him on Twitter. I follow David Allen on Twitter. I follow Warren Berger, the author of on Twitter. So yeah, we can follow the people that interest us and hear how they're thinking about the world. Definitely making us think-ier in a thinking world.\u00a0Emily, how about a fun fact? Something to make us happier about Twitter?I actually don't have a Twitter account. I really should.\u00a0That's a fun fact! Why not?It is a fun fact. I'm not sure if that makes anybody happier. But what will make people happier, and what made me happier, even though I don't have a Twitter account, is last week seeing have a spiffy pop, and seeing the number of people that both tweeted at The Motley Fool, tweeted at you, all of these happy investors, who had bought MercadoLibre's stock on our recommendation, having a spiffy pop last week. Twitter made that accessible, and that made me happy.\u00a0 That made me happy, too! I really appreciate you pointing that out. I'd forgotten to thank all of our listeners and those who did tweet out to @RBIPodcast and @TheMotleyFool, a much bigger Twitter account for The Motley Fool, and reflected on their happiness and joy around watching MercadoLibre, which I think went up about 21% or so that day in one day. But for those of us who've bought and held it a long time, it's not in this five-stock sampler, it's been in some others, but more importantly, it's been a part of  for more than a decade now. And we all made more money in that one day than we had paid for it way back when. That's what a spiffy pop is, a term that I want every  investor to know. Something we talk about probably not enough on this show. But thank you for pointing out that spiffy pop. It was a very happy day.\u00a0It was. And it was made happier by Twitter. You're absolutely right, Emily, because otherwise I wouldn't have heard that, I wouldn't have known that. And so yeah, that makes me happier! OK, good!Well, we're going to get to stock No. 5 now, and I'm going to pre-empt any suspense here. I'm going to let you know up front that this stock also lost to the market. It was a disappointment. But good news, take this five-stock sampler together and we crushed the market once again with this five-stock sampler. Even more meaningful since this is the last time we'll ever talk about it. We're waving goodbye to it. We're sun-setting \"Five Winners in a Thinking World.\" Stock No. 5 was one of three losers in a thinking world. The stock was still up. The ticker symbol is Z, and the company, we've already talked about a little bit is, Zillow, another really silly name like Splunk and Twitter and The Motley Fool. Zillow three years ago this week was just over $28 a share. It's now $33.63 as we tape. It's up 20%. The market is up 40% so it's a minus 20. Right at the end, I'll give the final numerical take on the overall performance of this five-stock sampler, but let's focus on Zillow for a sec. Emily, we talk about Zillow some on the  team. It's one of our probably more widely owned Rule Breakers. It's a stock that I own. I'm obviously a little disappointed that it's been an underperformer over these last three years. Why?\u00a0Zillow had a bit of a challenge, you could say, with its business model, particularly making money off of its business model. But Zillow recently has been a stock of a little bit more controversy here at The Motley Fool because they're changing their business model. They're changing their business model to make homebuying a little bit easier. And so while many people are rubbed the wrong way by that, and I will be the first one to say that I was one of those people, a number of people here see this outdated, dying industry and they think, \"Wow, Zillow could really do something! There's a lot of potential there!\"Because Zillow's business when we picked the stock three years ago was largely based on realtors, real estate professionals, taking out ads, advertising themselves in their zip code for the houses that you might be looking to buy. That was the bread and butter. Definitely a data-heavy company. I'm not sure any of those full zettabytes are Zillow's, but if you think about all the data, pricing and having specifications around all the properties, just residential properties here in the United States, for one, that's a ton of data. It was more a data business. But as you point out, Emily, this is a company that is now buying houses themselves and becoming a real estate-owning company. That's a real shift in the business model.\u00a0 You could say that it's made us smarter by showing that businesses can change. They continue to change. As long as you have a long-term outlook, there's always going to be value behind what these businesses do, whether that be collect data or take out advertisements. You can't ever\u00a0discount a business because the ability to change and innovate is always going to be inherent. But the one way that I think Zillow has really made someone I know smarter, is our recent new hire on the candidate side of our investing team, Joey, who used Zillow to look at and eventually purchase a house here in the area. Almost bought a house, but looked on Trulia, a Zillow platform, and saw the crime rates in one of the areas he was looking. Having never visited the area before, didn't know anything about the crime rates. He was immediately smarter. Immediately thought, \"I don't think I want to buy that house anymore.\" And because of Zillow, because of their platforms, he was able to get a house he loves now that he never, before buying, even stepped into. That's great example! I'm so happy to know that Joey found a house more to his liking. And I think he did. As a new employee, I think he's moved into the area, which I think means Joey's around here for a while. Yeah, not going anywhere!Speaking of change, I also want to point out that Rich Barton has now returned to become the CEO of Zillow, another change, having replaced Spencer Rascoff, who was running the company last few years somewhat successfully, especially early on, but not as successfully. Obviously, a market loser here over the last three years. I think it's very promising to have Rich Barton back. We'll see how things play out from here.\u00a0OK, so I hope we made our listeners a little smarter about Zillow. It's a stock that I still favor and own. And Emily, you're not as big a fan, which is fine; it takes two to make a market. We'll see. You were certainly right the last three years. I wish I'd listened to you as a summer intern, summer 2016, when you were probably talking daggers about Zillow. But, no, more seriously, how about a fun fact? Make us happier about, in this case, current underperformer?\u00a0Well, Rich Barton has one job, and he says he's going to make your life happier by making home buying and home selling easier. If he's able to succeed on that, I think all of us will be a little bit happier. The process as it is today is complicated, long, and full of unnecessary fees. If there's a way that Zillow and Rich Barton, with all of his amazing vision, can come in and smooth that process, maybe three years from today, we're all happier because of Zillow. Well, I sure hope so! In many cases, whether we recommend our own stock or not, we're wanting better things for the world in which we all live. Competition in capitalism, sometimes viewed as negative, but I think it's pretty great. I'm glad that exists, or Trulia used to compete with Zillow. Competition often forces people to become better and usually the winners win in the marketplace, and we all win as investors of these companies. Well, thank you Emily, for joining in!Let's just talk up the final numbers for this set of five stocks, this five-stock sampler, \"Five Winners in a Thinking World,\" dated May 4th, 2016. You can go back and listen again to that original show where I picked the stocks and share my thinking. But I'm really happy to say as a group, they're up 74% on average, the market up 40% on average. Therefore, plus 34% per stock. Seventy-four percent against 40%. I would say even though some of them weren't winners, we really did win on behalf of our listeners with \"Five Winners in a Thinking World.\"[...] All right, well, thus it was for \"Making You a Winner in Our Thinking World.\" The first half of this podcast, thoughts for you. The second half, reflections on companies that prospered, have prospered, in this thinking world.\u00a0Next week, a horse of a different color, although in a lot of ways, it's consistent with what we did this week. I'm going to have Phil de Picciotto, who helped found the sports agency, Octagon, a visionary in the industry. He's going to share some of his entrepreneurial experiences. I'm also going to be asking him about the future of sports, how television is going to change or not the future of sports, what it means for salaries, the size of stadiums. Phil is a visionary. If you're a sports fan, I certainly am, you're really going to enjoy the show. But even if you're not a sports fan, but you're thinking about the future of business, we're going to help you think smarter about the world of sport.\u00a0So thanks for listening! Have a great week in our thinking world, and Fool on!As always, people on this program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the press release and on the website.With that let me turn it over to Doug. -- Thank you, Ken. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the call. Q1 was a strong start to the year both for product innovation and field execution. We delivered $265 million in software revenue, up 54% over last year. We also announced a series of product developments that expanded capabilities of our portfolio and the possibilities for our customers. Our growth continues to come from a combination of new and existing customers, expanding their deployments both on-prem and in the cloud, letting them consume Splunk in the way that best enable their success.For the past few years, you heard me continuously site our focus on becoming the trusted data partner for our customers. We've been describing these capabilities as comprising four key pillars investigate, monitor, analyze and act. We've arrived at this understanding by listening very closely to our customers. The use cases we are delivering with Splunk are crafted by leveraging the integrated functionality across these four pillars. Let me take a step back for a moment and spend a little bit more time on these four pillars. First, investigate our unique investigative approach solves data problems without requiring our customers to ever structure their data.Turning to the next two pillars, monitor and analyze. This is where our customers are able to reap the rewards of investigations by monitoring for certain conditions or thresholds and creating predictive analytics. And the fourth pillar Act. This is where our acquisitions of VictorOps and Phantom come in with orchestration, automation, alerting and collaboration to help our customers remediate any issues discovered in the investigation, monitoring and analysis phases. It's through these lens of capabilities that we look at our product innovations and roadmap and it was a busy Q1 for Tim and the product teams, as they drove continued innovation and delivery across these pillars.We just released a new version of Splunk Enterprise 7.3 that continues to define unprecedented scale, ease of use and lower total cost of ownership. Our Data Stream Processor and Data Fabric Search products complements Splunk Enterprise to deliver the next generation Splunk platform that works against a vastly expanded data landscape. Data Stream Processor accesses, analyze and transforms vast amounts of data in motion, in real time and routes it to multiple destinations. A great example of a DSP use case is analyzing transactional events such as call detail records in real time, monitoring for anomalies on the stream routing service quality issues to one set of Splunk indices initiating an orchestrated and automated response, while directing the full historical data set to separate indices for long-term historical retention.Data Fabric Search enables customers to perform complex analytics against enormous data sets stored in the Splunk Enterprise and elsewhere. Using the above example, DFS would identify the patterns of service quality incidents in those call detail records searching billions of events, spanning multiple weeks, months or even years and analyzing them at the level of individual user accounts or device IDs to determine both the root cause of the issue and the full scope of its impact.Moving across all four pillars, our platform services like AI and machine learning, our Splunkbase ecosystem and emerging products like our newly released Connected Experiences and Splunk Business Flow. Connected Experiences delivers insights on the go through augmented reality on devices like the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV and through mobile application to provide users with the ability to investigate, monitor, analyze and act on their data, anywhere, anytime.Business Flow automatically interrogates the machine data gathered by Splunk and dynamically connect steps and events from disparate systems to generate an immediate view of operational processes. In other words, it visualizes processes for our users, so that businesses can identify bottlenecks and issues through data to help improve business operations. Auto Group, one of the world's largest e-commerce companies reported a notable increase in customer conversion rates after using business flow.And finally, our applications. These are packaged solutions that bring the value and capabilities of Splunk to life in a turnkey fashion. Here you see our continued investments in apps like Enterprise Security or ES, IT Service Intelligence or ITSI and User Behavior Analytics or UVA, which all saw Q1 updates. While we've been primarily focused on go to market and security and IT, we recently formed a vertical solutions field team, which is focusing on financial services, telecom and media, healthcare and IoT. This team is leveraging our existing product portfolio to expand into other parts of the business, increasing our access to additional buyers. Each quarter, our customers continue to validate that Splunk's data platform is unique and the best solution to help them unlock trapped value by bringing data to every question, every decision and every action.Now turning to Q1, we saw continued customer momentum both with our platform and in line with our core markets. Starting with IT, ops and app delivery wins in the quarter include Chipotle, who is moving to Splunk Cloud with this major expansion. Chipotle uses us to increase sales by gaining insights from their mobile application orders and rewards program. They increased digital sales more than 100% in their latest quarter. The company's biggest driver of sales and traffic growth.Madrid-based El Corte Ingles, one the largest department stores in the world has expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise. El Corte Ingles uses us for IT monitoring, including new lines of business by Click & Express its rapid delivery service. LATAM Airlines Group expand their use of Splunk Cloud, which they can better monitor their website and customer applications to quickly resolve customer issues, improve the ticketing process and increase revenue. LATAM spotted us because they needed a data platform that could drive outcomes across the entire business and not just in one silo. Thanks to partner Cordel (ph) for collaborating on this opportunity.Moving to security, where we continue to help our customers migrate from a structured legacy SIM to an analytics-based approach. Notable wins include Slack, who is a new customer that shows Splunk Cloud to enhance their enterprise security program. Slack chose us over the competition because they want security analytics that meet the needs of their very demanding environment. Brink's the world's largest cash management company expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise, ES and UBA for their global SOC. Brink's selected us due to the platforms ease of use and flexibility, which helps the Brink's team innovate, as well as our ability to handle a complex data architecture that spans more than 40 countries.PCL Construction, one of the largest general construction and contracting organizations in North America is a new customer purchasing Splunk Cloud to monitor 700 plus construction projects and their corporate enterprise. PCL Construction will have a comprehensive view into data from their office towers, retail outlets and sports facilities as they are under construction, providing actionable intelligence across the organization. A longtime customer and Global Aerospace Corporation signed a 7-figure deal for Phantom this quarter, so they can better automate, orchestrate and respond across their security data. The customer also uses the strong platform for a wide range of use cases across the business, including application performance analytics, dev ops and security investigation.Highlighting a few customers, who have standardized on Splunk as their data platform, two large government agencies each made a significant expansion of the Splunk platform in Q1. One agency is a longtime customer, who will expand from security into IT ops and APM use cases making us the data platform across both their SOC and their NOC. The other is expanding the platform to an entirely new division within a large civilian agency, which uses us across IT and security use cases.And a global entertainment conglomerate purchased an eight figure Splunk Cloud deal to expand their use of the platform across the business. This customer already uses us for both operations and security. With the expansion, they will focus internally on creating more use cases to drive business outcomes and adoption within the organization.And in IoT last year, I attended a cycling event in Paris and was fascinated by how the cycling world could better use data to improve team and bike performance. And now Track, a leading bicycle manufacturer is a new customer. They use Splunk Cloud for racing analytics such as tracking riders' nutrition needs to optimize athletic performance. They will also use Splunk to support the company's security and IT operations.Moving onto the ecosystem. Over the last three years, our relationship with Accenture has continued to flourish. I was honored to take the stage at Accenture's Industry Analyst Conference alongside their Chief Analytics Officer. We spoke about the future of data and analytics, how we are increasing our focus on business analytics and IoT and the value Accenture is delivering to their customers, as Splunk today. We are grateful to our partners to a layer of strategic, technical and market expertise, they each bring to our community. This helps us continue to evolve the ways we deliver impactful solutions to our customers.As you know, customer success is our number one Company priority and that focus has helped us build a great team and culture. I am proud that Splunk was named one of the best places to work in the Bay Area, for the 12th consecutive year. We received similar recognition around the US and in Asia. This is a testament to our people and their dedication to our customers and our partners.In summary, it was a solid quarter and start to our fiscal '20. We are early in a large and growing market. The velocity of digital transformation continues to gain momentum, granting market leaders like Splunk the ability to bring data to every question, every decision and every outcome for any organization. Again, thanks to all of our customers and partners, and thanks to all of our talented Splunkers. Before I hand the call over to Dave, I'd like to welcome our new CFO, Jason Child to the Splunk team and invite him to share some thoughts. Dave, we've all benefited from your leadership over the years, your passion for your Rush, your allegiance to Las Vegas Raiders, and I can't thank you enough for your commitment to Splunk and to our shareholders. Jason? -- Thanks, Doug. I'm thrilled to be here and looking forward to dive into the role. My first two weeks in the office, I focused on meeting senior leaders on all teams throughout the business (technical difficulty) passion that everyone here shares with customer success as a unified mission. My priorities over the next few months are to first get up to speed on our primary growth initiatives, specifically as it relates to our current product roadmap; second, identify the leverage points on our model to understand the areas, where we can fund future growth; and third, I am excited to meet or get reacquainted with our covering analysts, as well as our investors. I look forward to working with you all.Now, over to Dave for a readout on the quarter. -- All right, thanks. Thanks to everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for joining the call and still one more year as the Oakland Raiders, and I'm happy to report that they tied for first in the division. So always optimistic. Hey, it's been a -- it's a pleasure to take the mic today and then hand it over to Jason going forward, and it's great to be reporting a strong first quarter and of course, an excellent start to the year.First quarter revenues were $425 million, a 36% increase over Q1 of last year. Cloud revenue was $62 million, up 85% over last year. And Q1 software revenues, which is the total of license and cloud were $265 million, up 54% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with total RPO of $1.2 billion, up 57% over Q1 of last year. In Q1, we recorded 46 7-figure orders and added over 400 new customers, ending with over 18,000 customers overall. International operations contributed 26% of total Q1 revenues and education and professional services represented 10% of revenues consistent with the seasonality, we've seen in prior periods.On margins and other results, which are all non-GAAP. Q1 overall gross margin was 82%, up about 2 points on a year-over-year basis, reflecting improving efficiencies and scale in our cloud business, specifically. Operating loss was $7.8 million, representing a margin of minus 1.8% notably, better than our plan, driven by our solid top-line performance. Net income was $3.2 million or a positive $0.02 per share using a fully diluted weighted average share count of 155.4 million shares. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $35 million and free cash flow was about $20 million. And we ended the period with $2.8 billion in cash and investments.Now turning to guidance, we expect Q2 revenues of approximately $485 million and non-GAAP operating margin of a positive 3%. For the full year, we are now expecting total revenues of approximately $2.25 billion, up from $2.2 billion, and we maintain our non-GAAP margin target of 14%. As in Q1, we expect to be non-GAAP profitable for the remaining quarters this year. So remember to use your fully diluted weighted average share count in your EPS calcs.With respect to cash flow. As mentioned before that the shift to renewable bookings impacts the timing of our invoicing and therefore the timing of our cash collections. We reached the renewable mix of 77% last year, which was 12 percentage points higher than planned and it's expected to be at least 85% this year. This over-achievement is driving acceleration of both unbilled contract value as well -- which is well ahead of our plan. In fact, last call I detailed that our total uninvoiced contract value increased by $0.5 billion last fiscal year to almost $600 million in total. This trend continued in Q1 with total net uninvoiced contract value increasing by another $80 million, even though our normal seasonal pattern had total contract value decreasing by several hundred million dollars sequentially.With this faster shift and its impact on collection timing, we now expect full-year operating cash flow of about $250 million. Seasonality of cash flow will be impacted as well and we are modeling negative operating cash flow of about $125 million in Q2 flipping to about $125 million positive in Q3. Importantly, we expect that the timing of cash collections will normalize once the renewable mix reaches a steady state.In closing, we're off to an excellent start to the year. Our product investments continue to drive customer success and our field expansion is enhancing our overall execution capacity. Our strategy is working well and we continue to feel the pace of adoption, as we drive to make Splunk the ubiquitous data analytics platform.Now on a personal note, I'd like to say how humbling it's been to have played a role over the last 8 years of Splunk's journey. I've said to many that going public is easy, but being public is hard and the collective Splunk teams have handled this journey with style and integrity. Of course, I want to sent a special shout out to the finance team, whose grace under pressure has carried the day through high growth, complex business all amplified by our favorite topic 606.When I joined the company in 2011, we were less than 400 employees in 9 countries and posted $121 million in total annual revenue. Today, we are nearly 5,000 employees in 26 countries and tracking to total revenues of more than $2.2 billion this year and growing.Living on the lighted stage has approach the unreal and the adrenaline surge one gets from the Splunk experience is like nothing else. I pass the baton to Jason with high confidence that our engine is running well and prime for the next phase of the journey. Thanks, Doug, and thanks to all of the Splunkers out there, past and present.With that, we'll open up for questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys, good evening. So, Jason welcome, Dave, congrats, and thanks. And Doug, I'll start with you, and then -- then question for Dave. So Doug first just, maybe you could comment on the security environment obviously it's good revenue quarter, was a weak quarter for a lot of -- weaker than expected for a lot of security companies. How does it look for you in security? And any comment on the competitive landscape around SIM, which seems to be heating up? And then Dave, I got a couple. -- Thanks, Michael. So I'd characterize the security business is very consistent and its contribution within Splunk as it has been for the past 5, 6, 7 quarters. We saw continued strength in security overall, including sales of enterprise security or SIM. As you know, and as the world sees the market for the secure -- cyber security ultimately comes down to a data inspection and data reaction play. We were very early by not falling into the narrow orientation of SIM and continued -- continuing to define the opportunity as a security data opportunity and a security analytics opportunity.I think because of that we've seen that momentum within the security realm. And again, it's not SIM tends to be the incident event monitoring piece that a security operation center users. There's a whole host of correlated use cases around that -- that do a fraud, compliance, risk, there is growing trend of operational technology and their need for the same security wrapper. And so I think the security data market keeps redefining itself, the SIM market is redefining itself. And I think we've been very nimble and pretty foresightful in both many of the developments that we have pushed out organically and some of the inorganic additions we've had that enables our portfolio to be comparative.And of course, we're seeing more entrants come into the market both from brand new start-ups, as well as some bigger established players. Our focus is that -- that hasn't had an impact in our success rate that we can determine, and our focus is to maintain really, really tight intensity on our customers. Customer success is our number one corporate priority plastered everywhere and make sure that we keep the innovation and ROI and adoption engine running strong, so that our CSOs get that strong benefit they expect out of us, but they also get to evangelize the use of the data, they have collected across a whole host of non-security use cases to bring about quick value and efficiencies across the corporation. -- Thanks, Doug. And then -- and Dave, two sides to the duration question. One was -- was there anything I know, you've been guiding to flat duration into this year, last year of 32 months. So is that where we were because we had really good software revenue growth and I just want to see if there's any extra boost from contract duration there? And then conversely billings were only up 20%-ish. So is there any shortening to contract assuming to invoice duration that would have affected billings? -- Yeah. Hey, Michael, duration was consistent in that 32, 33 month range that we expected the way we've been modeling it and what we saw through most of last year. From an invoicing perspective because I mentioned in prepared remarks, what -- what I didn't expect was the $80 million increase in uninvoiced contract value and it's all part of the timing in terms of when we're sending the invoice relative to the amount of renewable contracts that we're doing now. So I'm really pleased with the progress that the Company and the field is demonstrating in terms of this accelerated shift to a renewable model. And the timing of the -- of the cash collections, as I mentioned on prior calls, is going to be most acute in this year and then stabilize after that. -- And so that will primarily hit deferred on an invoice as opposed to revenue? -- Yeah. Yeah. So you guys know, I've been beating the drum for quite a while about RPO being a more comprehensive metric than billings. And for a model like ours in particular, much of our contract value doesn't flow through deferred. So the billings calculation, the historic billings calculation is not as comprehensive as RPO, and you can see that in terms of the dynamic. Now, from a -- even though I don't think it's the right metric going forward. Of course, we look at it. The billings growth rate was consistent Q1 to Q1. But again, it really doesn't capture the full breadth of in terms of the scale of the business, as does the RPO calculation. -- Okay. Thanks. -- Yeah. -- Thanks, Michael.Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks, guys for taking my question, and congrats on a great start to the year. Just wanted to focus on the two items here. First is, just the -- the new customer adds -- adds this quarter at 400, so starting up again with good metric. Just wondering, what you think about balancing this year between sort of new customers and up-sell, how you're feeling about where you started and sort of how you think about the full year kind of in the context of, obviously, you also had a strong $1 million plus field comp this quarter up again year-over-year. So I guess call it expansion versus land, some more color that would be great. -- Good question, Phil. So we continued -- continue to task our people with having this tool focus of extending within accounts and making sure that we are seeding future big expansion accounts within net news. I would say that it was an acceptable quarter on net news, but certainly not what our long-term ambitions have, right. We've said in so many different calls there's hundreds of thousands of sizable corporations around the globe, and I don't know any of them that don't have a SOC or NOC or don't need to make better decisions through effective data and interfaces.So all those customers, at some point in time, should be Splunk customers. And -- and there is work that we're doing in the product side, as well as work we're doing across the marketing and sales work to make sure that we both fulfill the 20,000 target that we had set three years ago. But I think even, it's more importantly that you create a bigger aperture average for that. I think this quarter as Q1, we did -- we saw really healthy expansion within our account base and there's 20,000 (ph) a day. And when you got a big huge expansion opportunity as rep, you wind up spending a lot of time on that, which is good news because we'd love to see that cohort and the adoption continue to go up into the right. So we are -- we are not resting or satisfied with net new and but we also are not resting or satisfied with the adoption portion within our companies, our customers either. -- Yeah. Hey Phil, it's Dave. Just to give some anecdotes. We talk now about 7-figure orders and something we talk about every quarter. And there was a time where that was a really significant event and something that we really anchored around in terms of evidence of adoption and how strategic we can be. And the -- when I got started here, the idea of a 7-figure order was quite exciting, and not that -- they're not very difficult, but it's -- it's with quite impressive performance by the field and the pride that we feel in that execution that we see this many of our customers gaining this kind of value from what we deliver that they're making us a strategic partner.So when you think then about hey, a good start to the year 400 customers, yeah, we like that number. We obviously, we like more, but the success inside of our existing customers, i.e. expands in your vernacular. It's really impressive. And it's certainly the village of the entire company that's leading to that kind of success with product, the customer success team, the field, post customer sales, all that stuff. But just in terms of the scale of what we do with customers now versus what we did say 2 years ago, 4 years ago, 6 years ago is really impressive. -- And thanks, guys. And thanks again, Dave for all the insights over the years and best of luck in the future. -- All right, Phil. Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks guys. Well done and I'll offer my congrats to Dave as well. I'm sure, we'll cross paths sometime in the future. RPO growth was 57% and it was really strong especially relative to last year and even looking at the growth in Q4. I think on the call, you talked about a lot of the reasons for the success there and then really a good indicator of sort of the true health of the business. I guess, I'm wondering -- and the comp certainly improve over the year as well, how should we think about RPO growth. Is there -- I know, you don't guide to, but just, is there a way that we should kind of think about the progression of that and sort of the underlying sort of strength of the business. -- Yeah. Hey, Matt. Thank you. It is an -- it's an interesting question and one that we've been kicking around here for sure in terms of what trajectory would we expect that to take. When you're talking about upper 30 percentile for revenue at 2 plus or at 425 (ph) for the quarter, and then you look at RPO at $1.2 billion knowing that our duration has been pretty steady and say, well, how sustainable is that. Now you guys all know, I hate the percentage game because the bigger the numbers, the harder the percentages.But I think if you got to step back and say how penetrated are we in our existing customers and we believe lightly penetrated as evidenced by these large orders, by these large expands and then how penetrated are we in the TAM. We think it's very early in that context, and in particular, because the TAM has effectively doubled since we took the Company public. So what's the opportunity for continued growth in RPO. I expect continued growth in RPO. I expect continued growth on the P&L because there's just so much opportunity to go add value to the customer. Now, what you're not going to hear me say is, oh, I expect the percentage to be consistent, yeah, 57% is sustainable like we are not guiding to RPO, but it's certainly should continue up into the right. -- That's right. No, I think it really is indicative of sort of how early, you are in the sort of the customer journey here. And I guess maybe as a follow-up to that. I'm curious, we've talked about EAAs over the years and I'm sort of curious where are we there in terms of like getting the more structured program to drive sort of wall to wall Splunk adoption. Is that -- that becoming more of a focus for you guys to sort of convert more of your customers to sort of all in on Splunk? -- Yes, for sure. There's -- OK -- there is two buckets of initiatives we've been focused on adoption and net new on the go-to-market side. And as they get talked about couple of years ago, we formed up the whole customer success group, much like many other SaaS companies probably 3.5 years, 4 years ago, we've built that up from a relatively small initial founding to. I think a very sizable function that's gained a lot of maturity and won a ton of awards across the industry for some of the innovative products and approaches that they are driving. And I think that -- that investment in the team, but then a lot of the work they're doing on -- we released a 2 years ago, 2.5 years ago, the capability for Splunk to phone home for customers allow that to happen with our cloud offering, we've instrumented everything.It has deep telemetry in combination of the growing body of customers that are phoning home, plus the cloud telemetry has enabled the customer success group to build a whole host of different interfaces to help give guidance to customers both delivered onsite to the customers and delivered to the customer success team on how to be -- how successful they are being with Splunk, where they could be more successful? How they could save additional costs? But it is definitely something that a big chunk of our organization wakes up and focuses on every day in addition to the number one customer success overall Company priority that everybody shares. -- Great. Thanks, guys. Well done. -- Thanks, Matt. -- Thanks, Matt.Thank you. And our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Dave signals transmitted message received reaction making impact invisibly all this makes for a very moving picture the first song that I heard of Rush. Two questions. One for you, Dave. With respect to your comments on the uninvoiced value going up by $80 million, although you said seasonal patterns, the total contract value decreased by several hundred million dollars sequentially. Can you just explain for us what exactly the mechanics are behind that? And as you have this uninvoiced contract value continue to grow, what are the implications for cash flow looking at next year.And I guess, one for you, Doug at a very high level. Congratulations, Jason by the way, welcome to Splunk. Look forward to working with you. Doug, question for you. The cohort analysis that you shared with us at the Analyst Day, a couple of years back, where you had data volume grow by I think 8x over 4 years or 8x over 5 years and bookings value expanding 4x or 5x over 4 years to 5 years. Can you give us an quick update on how that trend is sustaining or not. Thank you very much. And that's it from me. -- Okay. Kash, it's Dave. In your honor, I did actually craft in prepared remarks some direct references to Splunk. -- We love that (ph). We love that. -- Yeah. So I'll let you guys go on the -- on the word out there. With the dynamic on -- you're right, the absolute increase in uninvoiced contract value was material $80 million incrementally even though seasonally, the pool of contract value was hundreds of millions of dollars lower than -- than Q4. So what does that imply going forward? As I've mentioned before and tried to refer to in today's prepared remarks as our shift, which again has accelerated a year early is, I'll call it, I'm using air quotes here completed when we're done and a vast majority, north of 90% of our contracts are renewable, then you're going to see normalization of cash yield, as a result.So this is all just timing, as we move on an accelerated basis to this renewable model. I think how long is that. I would -- obviously, we went from 58% (ph) to 77%. Now, we're saying, look at least 85%, we had a really strong quarter in terms of renewable composition. So I think this is -- this is kind of the end of that transitional cash flow thing timing wise, and we'll start to see it normalize next year. -- And on the cohort. Last cohort we did was 2 years ago (multiple speakers) Analyst Day this year. And what was the figure is now on similar it goes little -- little bit higher wasn't it? -- Yeah, it's... -- 10x data. -- 10x the data after 7 years. -- With the similar (multiple speakers) -- I'm sorry. It was 5 years, it was 10x the data by 7x the economics. -- So the way it went from 8x data with 5x (inaudible) 10 and 7. But -- so, but we haven't done a refresh since then cash . But I mean, what I'm seeing and looking at the adoption programs that we've driven the customer success metrics that -- that I'm seeing based on the comments I made in the prior question is continued -- as long as we can spend time with the customer and help them with the use case proliferation we see that cohort continue to drive in the right direction. -- Congratulate, the cohorts are getting stronger. That's great to see. Thank you so much. -- Yeah. Thanks so much.Thank you. And our next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. My first question is for Doug. Doug, I want to ask a question about the last pillar act in Phantom. Orchestrations always made sense, I mean it's -- it has, but it's just really been too hard to do.. Just curious, I mean, I think you mentioned there was a 7-figure Phantom deal this quarter like why -- why it can't work now and how much like, is this still -- is this an evangelist type sale. Do you have people out there having to convince people that they should be buying it, it's not really new concept, but it really, it sort of is a new market. I'm just curious how this is -- what's happening today? And how do you think it evolves? -- Okay. I think, I mean the idea of orchestration has been around for 30 years, 40 years. The whole BPM category is focused on that back in the '90s and 2000s. I think the difference with something like Phantom and the difference that I think generally drives an effective platform is one, it's highly that we had very complementary partnership before we bought them because they are highly dependent upon the intelligence of the Splunk engine to direct the high level orchestration, automation that Phantom then does. Two, they are really thoughtful and being really the orchestration integration layer. It doesn't do all the work. It ensures that the heterogeneous landscape actually completes the work.So the way that we've crafted the both ability to drive playbooks or the actual orchestration, automation pieces and the way that the integrations happen to ensure that the firewalls close loop the way they're supposed to or the endpoints react the way they're supposed to, I think makes it more practical within customers landscape. It weaves into what they were invested in. But then three they started with a very tight focus on security and we know that cyber security industry has got skills shortage that they're wrestling with. And luckily for Splunk, they are one of the first functions within companies that realize security as a big data play, and they actually have the data and the volumes of data to help drive lot of these insights that through some time especially with Splunk, they've gotten more comfortable with the results and saying yes, close the loop automatically for these types of activities.Well, we've been working on with the underlying Phantom platform. There's two aspects one, continue to increase the participation by the ecosystem and by any of our own people on the depth of security oriented playbooks; but two, incorporate Phantom into the overall platforms that IT and non-security and IT users also can get the advantage of the orchestration automation capabilities of Phantom and increasingly the alerting and collaboration capabilities of VictorOps, which together really make up that act pillar.And so right now, we're seeing more of a, I'd say, more of a pull from the market and especially in security. This (inaudible) category is something that I think has a straight -- is landing well security buyers need and they feel like the only way they're going to get the ability to deploy more people to tier 2, 3 level is to automate more of the Tier 1 level and something like Phantom is perfect for that. -- That's great. Thanks. But it's -- and thanks for that explanation. I was -- that was really detailed and helpful. But it sounds like you're getting more of a pull, it's not like you have to convince people that hey it's not hard to convince them, it's a good idea, but that -- that you can actually accomplish it that -- that's OK. -- I mean, I think these platforms work well in their specific use cases and security has a pull. I'd say we're probably still a little bit more evangelical sale with IT, but those guys are pretty tight with each other, so they influence each other. And I'd say that non-security, non-IT is still trying to wrestle -- they're still trying to digitize their landscape. So having a orchestration automation platform that requires big data and digitization is something that's probably in the future for them. -- Great. And if I might just that -- I have a question for Jason and it -- to actually Jason. Dave is leaving you with ASC 606 and he's told everybody to go out and look at things and he's a great guy and he is -- I'd love to talk new about it. But if I didn't really want to take a look at RPO and I didn't believe -- I believe Dave knows that he is talking about, but I didn't believe that was a great way to look at it. And as you know, Jason, when you did your due diligence here, there's a lot of questions around it with Splunk because you have is -- a sort of hybrid model and people are like well, now you're seeing the license benefit. But if I wanted to just take a look at the momentum of the business, which feels like it's going really well and I want to just look at the subscription revenue, plus the change in short-term deferred revenue. And I know that's getting toward billings and Dave doesn't want -- Dave is not -- you're not supposed to talk, Jasonist (ph). Is that going to give me a good sense of what the momentum of the business is?Again -- and I say subscription, I mean maintenance plus cloud. So the theoretical part of the revenue, and maybe I try to adjust that a little bit. You're not going to tell us on a quarterly basis what the renewal mix is. But if I can adjust it a little bit because it's something is on a theoretical basis, there is more of it that's ratable, then if was maintenance and the term license versus perpetual, does that make sense to you? Because I'm trying to make sense of it. And RPO for me just doesn't do it. -- Thanks for the question on date 15, actually date 14 -- no, 13. So it's a great question. We are in -- you guys have been talking about the transformation now for a year plus. So I understand, trying to find what is the right metric that correlates long term with true growth and true value is what we're all trying to figure out.I think, theoretically RPO makes a lot of sense. But if I were to kind of step back and say, what do I think the value is going to be going forward, where do we see the value right now, I think overall software growth at 54% year-on-year. But that's the number that is probably the one that I think is the one I think will be most indicative of the growth that we're creating. And when I look at cloud revenue growth, at 85% up year-on-year, and the ARR of -- ARR just above growth of 85% year-on-year, that -- for a company that is at our size and been around for as long as we have, those are pretty credible numbers. And so -- I don't know -- that's how I think about it. I'm going to get much more refined on my thoughts over the next 12 days or more. But I don't know that helps, but that's how I think about it. -- Yeah, no, listen, that does help. It does in long-term. That's great. We look at it too that way. However, every time you guys report a quarter there's all this new information we want to gauge what the momentum of the business was in the quarter, it feels like was really strong this quarter, as Matt -- but at the same time, like some of the metrics some people look at maybe it doesn't look as strong. But I think -- and Dave, if you can just weigh in on that, that will be awesome maybe, and I'll just stop talking. Thanks. -- Hey John, yeah. Look you know this about us, we are really thoughtful about the words we use when we characterize the quarter. And it was just a (ph) quarter and it was a great start to the year. And you can't, as Jason pointed out, I think even in our press release, and we've been pounding the table for a long time about software growth rate. 50% plus software growth rate in a Q1 at our scale is a tough compare because last Q1 was a good quarter yeah. So we are proud of the quarter, we are not satisfied nor will we ever be. But I think it's a great start. -- Okay, thanks a lot guys. -- Thanks, John.Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So maybe just at the risk of diving more into that RPO metrics, if I look at the change in RPO and I actually be curious if we get the exact number for RPO or if that $1.2 billion is grounded. If I take the change in RPO and add the revenue, I look at a RPO bookings growth rate of about 33%. So I guess, maybe the first question is that a better metric to look at the overall kind of momentum or the growth of the business, then RPO stand-alone or billings. And then just to follow up quickly on the federal space. -- Yeah, hey, it's Dave. The $1.2 billion, it's not in the disclosure, it's not going to be 1,200,000 (ph), but it's so Gosh Darn Diggity close that you would never notice the difference. And the calculation that you're doing is revenue plus change in RPO is I think it's the new era, billings calculation of revenue plus change in deferred. So 30% plus growth in that metric, I think is a good proxy. -- Perfect. And I guess just a follow-up on the federal (technical difficulty) -- Alex. Sorry, you were breaking up through most of that. -- I was just asking about the federal work before (ph), and if you have any commentary on, if it was impacted by the government shutdown what the pipeline looks like for the rest of the year, just broader macro question about your pipeline generally. -- Got it. Yeah, we're really satisfied with the performance of the public sector team and the Federal team that's in public sector in Q1. Yeah, it's been a bumpy ride for the past 18 months for that group. And I really am deeply appreciative of all the Federal employees that found a way to keep their heads down and keep doing the right thing for our citizens and for their organizations and persevere through the ups and downs.I think we had -- getting the final resolution of the budget and having a little bit of a clean slate up till September, I think is probably helping and we said that -- helping our buyers and then helping all of us that have been tightly aligned to those buyers. So I'm excited about the run up to the end of the year and hopefully we'll have a good landscape to work with the Fed group post September as well. -- Okay, thanks, Alex. Jim, if we could move on, please.Certainly. Next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. This is Melissa Franchi calling in for Keith. Doug, I just wanted to follow up with you on the security business. You said it's been relatively consistent, but it's been consistently good for you guys. So you're benefiting from both expanding within your customer base, but also displacing the legacy SIEM vendors. And so on the later driver, I'm just wondering if we are looking forward, how much more is left to displace the legacy technology. And are you seeing any change in the piece of displacements? -- No, it's been a really consistent drumbeat for probably a year and a half now, as far as the pace. And it -- there are still quite a ways to go. There was a -- quite a broad landscape of folks that have tried myriad of different SIEM vendors out. There is lot of focus in ArcSight and QRadar, but there were many, many other implementations besides those.And I think the other piece is that definition of the SIEM market keeps changing as well. It's gone from just strict incident event management to the augmentation now, behavioral analytics and much more broad-based security analytics play and now with the security orchestration automation category that's sort of blend in as well. So while we are replacing last generation SIEMs, even for the customers that have already done that, we're still coming in with additional functionality and new product offerings that continue to extend that SIEM landscape and offering. -- Okay, that's helpful and then just one follow-up for Dave. In terms of the guidance for cash flow, sorry to follow up on that again, but you're still looking for 85% renewable mix for the full year. And so I understand how increase in in-invoice contract value could drive a headwind to cash flow, but I guess relative to when you guided a quarter ago, can you maybe just put a finer point on what's changed and what's driving that increase in the uninvoiced? -- Yeah. Specifically, the composition in the first quarter in terms of renewable mix, and in particular the billing -- the invoicing characteristics far exceeded our estimates in our model. And that changed to slow relative to timing. -- Thank you. -- Sure. -- Sure. Thanks, Melissa.Thank you. And our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I have one for Doug and one for Dave. Doug in your prepared remarks, you were pretty deliberate about some of the initiatives you're putting in place from a vertical solutions go-to-market perspective. And I'm getting the sense, this is certainly more of a deliberate stance versus your approach in the past. So I wanted to understand what the catalyst behind that was. And then maybe as a extension to the question to David is how should I think about the incremental investment into the business this year given that full-year operating margin guidance is unchanged. And if that might have anything to do with this new initiative around vertical solutions? -- Yeah, hey, Fatima, it's Dave. I'll just talk about the margin for a second. The vertical initiative was part of our plan that we set out at the beginning of the year. And when we look at Q1 results, which obviously we had a really strong top line and that flowed to the bottom line, we also looked at the weighting of margin contribution Q1 relative to margin contribution for the full year and that was the basis for maintaining our 14% op margin.So that's the reason it's unchanged. There wasn't a specific new initiative, everything is moving in terms of insight in the context to the plan that we started the year with in terms of the investment portfolio. -- And to call out on verticals, I was really trying to be comprehensive, in where we are making our investments overall. And a portion of those investments are against that both the existing Splunk Enterprise footprint, but then the complementary aspects around the monitor, alert, analyze and act, we've been contributing a significant portion of the R&D budget for the past 3 years on the net new innovation and new product deliveries to complement what has always been a strength of Splunk.And vertical -- the way that we have gone after new segments in the past, including how we got in security was to start to peel off, hire people and put people into groups that have deep expertise in that area and allow them, working with customers to find the patterns that could be repeated patterns that either we or our partners get to craft a more specific delivery around.And we've been talking about the opportunity outside of security and IT for many years. We launched a whole set of recipes or cookbooks we call Splunk Essentials in the IoT segment last year. And because there we've seen some strength in manufacturing uptake, we published a whole ebook in the financial services arena in the past 60 days, that starts to detail out the Splunk essentials and non-security IT areas as well as some additional security and IT, that are specific to financial services, and all those are the future monetization and further expansion opportunities for data fabric like Splunk within those orbs. -- Makes a ton of sense. Thank you so much. -- Thanks, Fatima.Thank you. And our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is now open. -- Okay, thanks very much. Dave, you maybe exiting this particular limelight but it's been an incredible journey. So I'll add my congrats and welcome, Jason. Question for you, Doug. So over the past 6 to 12 months, you've announced a lot of enhancements to the platform DSP, DFS, Smart store, insights for infrastructure and natural language and now business flow and connected experiences. It sounds like you might be most excited about DSP and DFS. What I'm wondering is, can these collectively move the needle on growth in fiscal '20 or do you think it will take longer for that to translate into greater sales velocity? -- I think that like any 1.0 product introduction, there will be contributions from them over the course of this year. But when you are $1.8 billion with a forecast for $2.25 billion you need material results in how do I find $100 million revenue generation sources and it will take some time to have those products get to that same level of contribution, but the usage, the feedback that we're getting, as they have gone into limited general availability across some of our most complex and thorniest customers is incredibly positive.And the other, there's a line at the door to for this -- for usage on a limited availability basis. So I'm really excited to continue to push those products, make sure that we understand all the use cases and that they are truly ready for life in the wild with no guardrails and I think, we got a lot more to share with the community on how they're being used? What use cases they power and how they power them differently than what you've always seen from Splunk, and how to get quick value from them at our upcoming user conference in fall Dotcom 2019. -- Okay, that's great. And then just a quick follow-up on the net new logos because maybe this is a function of rounding. But on the surface anyway, it would appear that this quarter was the lowest level that we have seen in a few Q1s or a few years for that matter. Are you still -- you guys still fairly confident that you can eclipse 20,000 total customers by year-end? -- Yes. Still remain confident on that number and we did round down the numbers. So but again it's said -- the quarterly reporting on this metric is kind of pain in the butt given that constant tug and pull between what are you doing on the adoption side versus what our customers doing on the net new side. And the real focus that we've had, is what are we doing across all aspects of the company, including product releases and our overall cloud footprint to make it -- to make that number easier and easier to achieve.Right now there still is a lot of sales involvement and I'll be really satisfied when there's less human dependency on getting early adopters successful and procuring those products from Splunk. -- Perfect, thanks, Doug. -- Thanks, Gregg. Appreciate it.Thank you. And our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Maybe one for Doug, one for Dave. Doug, the 46% license growth, super strong, the highest in a while. Was there one or two areas that contributed to that or did any element of the business in the quarter feel a little bit one time-ish that is worth calling out to us? And then Dave, I'll ask the second question, now. I think everybody could get a little bit more comfortable with your lower operating cash flow guide if it was apparent that the ratable mix really did accelerate beyond say 77% you did in fiscal ' 19.I know you don't want to get into the habit of disclosing that metric, each quarter, but just maybe just given that cash flow guide might be creating some angst, can you give any color about where that metric landed in Q1? Thank you, -- Karl it's pretty close to our full-year objective which is not typical, which is not typical for a Q1. -- Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And yeah, Doug love to hear a little color. -- And Karl thank you for not asking for quarterly mix, took us 18 months to get off of that, but yeah, we materially exceeded our expectations in terms of renewable and that's reflected in the $80 million increase in uninvoiced contract value. Again see sequentially Q4 to Q1 much much smaller pool of dollars to draw from. So it was really great performance by the field. -- Got it. -- And then on the performance over the quarter, it was, I think, a relatively balanced performance. We had a handful of accounts in that 7 figure up arena that really, really leaned in, which always helps. And that's really the marks that we are focused on to take the few number of EIA and ELA customers to much bigger number of EIA, ELAs, I think is a really important motion for us as a company. The Americas is most mature. So they tend to be most mature with that activity, but we saw some healthy endorsements from customers outside of America as well.That does -- as Dave said, it's a strong quarter, but really pleased with the performance of the teams and we are excited by how it sets us up the rest of the year. -- Got it. Thank you, both. -- Thanks, Karl. -- Thanks, Karl.Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. -- Great, thank you. Thanks guys. So one for David, one for Doug. And thanks Dave for all the help over the years, definitely appreciate it. -- How are you? -- For you Dave -- thank you. So building on Alex's question. So yeah bookings metric kind of low to mid '30s year-on-year, the software metric kind of 54%. I don't expect every metric to match exactly every quarter, but maybe could you help reconcile those two a little bit and then I've got a follow-up on for Doug. -- Sure. We've been conscious of moving away from perpetual and having a greater component of the business be cloud specifically. I can talk about term in a second, but cloud doesn't come with maintenance. So it's in the services line, for sure, but when we report software we're seeing our cloud number plus our on-prem number i.e. license. That's 54% software growth, and we have been doing that for over a year now. So when you look at the composition of the calculated RPO bookings number like the software component is actually is quite strong, and you're asking me how do you reconcile the delta. The biggest delta is in the non-software components. -- Got it. Okay. I will work on that. And then the one for Doug. So Doug, when I look at some of the -- kind of the next generation kind of new age vendors that want to -- want to -- do innovate in both security and in IT ops. It seems like there have been some interesting value added innovation, some of these companies are doing, and then some of them in those spaces are going back and trying to do log management. And -- and I'm just wondering what's your sense of the competitive dynamic out there with regards to the newer players and how Splunk plans to stay ahead? -- Sure. So I'll -- let me start with the log management piece. The core uniqueness that Splunk has that people still can't emulate and have a tough time wrapping their arms around is that we don't manage logs. Logs are unmanageable by definition. Every log is a snow flake and any attempt to create structure and mandates with logs is sisyphean task. It's never ever going to come to fruition. That's not the nature of logs.Why Splunk was created is, if you've got a data source that by nature is chaotic and never systematizable and yet, you've got to make sense of the data, then you need to create a data structure that actually is able to be completely non-schematized, so you can take what people would assume is random garbage and put it into this data -- investigative data link and still make sense of it. That -- that is -- that's completely unique. There is no other data structure out there that can do that yet. It's not worthwhile for us to rely on that eventually someone will figure that out, but nobody else can do that, which is why on a forensic investigation basis, whether it's security forensics, IT forensics or outside those departments, we're in a pretty -- we're in a category of one.As these vendors are coming in with very IT or security focused lens, it's not a bad way to go to actually start a platform. But the dilemma with that is the data that you're gathering for to serve an IT user or dev ops user or security ops user, the overlap between those different constituencies is very high on the data. And then it winds up being very similar data that you want to use outside those two departments as well. If you structure all the data there is not much reuse, you can get because now it's tailored for that specific audience.But the dilemma that we all have, and I think part of why Splunk is in leadership position is, how do you create a very robust framework, how do you -- starting with a data repository that never structures data allows you infinite variety on how you cast that data and make use of it across these different apartments. And that's I guess, I'm trying to say to solve the problems for these users and then to extend beyond that finite set of users to a broad set of organizations across the company, means you've got to build a very complex and robust data platform capability set. And I feel like the investments we've been making over the past three years or four years and got products like DSP and DFS are just examples of that. There's over 10 products we've announced in the past year and a half, I think gives us the ability to continue to deliver unique value to our customers across multiple use cases including security and IT. -- Thanks guys. I appreciate it. -- Thanks, Steve.Thank you. And our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Thanks very much. Thanks for fitting me in, and Dave best of luck going forward. I guess my question is for Doug. Doug, one of the things, I have been sort of wondering about over time is just the flywheel effect for partners for you all, only 70,000 customers for product like yours just seems so low relative to the potential. And I'm just wondering, what's -- what sort of taking a while for partners to kind of jump on and create really another distribution model for you all because you can sort of slugging this out, I think with more of a direct sales approach and that's sort of been the way you had to do it at the start, but have a $2 billion run rate. I'm just wondering what's -- is it going to take to get the bigger SIs to get some of the VARs really jumping in a bigger way with you all, so you create a little bit more leverage from a go-to-market perspective over the next couple of years? Thanks. -- Sure, Kirk. No, it's -- I have obviously been very consistent on the need for a robust partner ecosystem. And I think that the improvements we've made over the past five years have been pretty notable and remarkable. There is still a long way to go. You're never done. We're proud, but not satisfied. We just had a global partner summit this quarter and rolled out a bunch of new enhancements to our partner programs, as well as our partner portal and tech infrastructure to help make their lives easier and better.I think the amount of partner involvement has gone up and up and up over the past five years. It's well over 50% across our -- all of our theaters right now, as a Company. The dilemma is that partner involvement is usually co-sell with us not independent sell. And I think a lot of what we are continuing to work on which goes back to the underlying platform and the platform capabilities is making it easier and easier to build solutions and other contributions on top of this Splunk platform, so that partners actually -- the thing that they are talking to a customer about, is their thing on top of Splunk rather than Splunk or Splunk's thing. And I think we made traction, we keep seeing Splunk base -- the volume of items on Splunk base go up and -- but there is still more, more work for us to do. -- Okay. I guess, just trying to maybe put a timeline on it. Is this something, you can see moving the needle next year. I'm just kind of curious, I know it's an iterative process, but just kind of curious, it seems like you see a lot of data points heading the right direction. Is there any sort of inflection you see coming or is it just -- it's going to be sort of pushing the boulder up the hill to a certain degree? -- I mean, I think the -- what we're seeing is, we have prioritized different partners and accounts. Accenture is one of those examples. We've had some interesting announcements with Cisco and Symantec, where they are OEMing Splunk for different use cases. So pick fewer partners that we go deep with and really do co-development to make sure that there is going back to that as a partner thing that they're leading with that -- that they have what they need for a whole series of use cases or different buying centers to be successful on their own with that sales initiative.And I think within those customers and Accenture is probably the one we've been most consistent with for three solid years, we're seeing their productivity from those accounts. And then in addition to that, what I was referencing around overall partner program and the technology enablement that we're doing and the partner enablement is, how do you continue to increase the capacity and capability of those that are not getting that really, really discrete focus as well. But I think we're seeing the tipping point in some of our top tier accounts, which hopefully, we'll see that, you guys will all see the benefits out in the marketplace. -- It sounds good. Thanks for the answer, and congrats on the quarter. -- Thanks, Kirk.Thank you. And we have time for one final question. Our last question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks. I guess, Dave a question for you. I guess, final question on final call on maintenance. There was a (multiple speakers) -- Hey, Walter, I save the best for last. -- Certainly. So on maintenance, I guess looking forward on that number and maybe I guess it's adjacent, but should we think about that staying positive or it's the growth rates come down quite a bit. I'm wondering, how should we think about that from a trajectory perspective? And then had a -- have a question for Doug? -- Meaning that the maintenance growth rates. -- Yeah, the growth rate. Yeah, I think it was 30s (ph) -- it was 30s maybe a year ago and it's kind of into the 10% range right now. Is that -- is this a level you think it stays or you think it comes down further in terms of growth? -- It probably is going to continue to decline a little, but it's -- it's really the offset is well, how fast as cloud grow as a percentage of the total. Obviously, term gets a -- a chunk of term gets put into maintenance. It's a different math equation then when it's perpetual. But the big swing is cloud as a bigger percentage versus perpetual that's the biggest thing in maintenance. The other piece, professional services more times than not don't flow through RPO at all. You do get them into deferred on occasion based on timing of delivery and payment and all that. But when I talk about the other components when we think about gross book of business that the field is generating, we put all the software components, all the maintenance components and all the services component in that pool. But the biggest -- again, the biggest recomp that earlier question relates to maintenance. -- Okay. Got it. And then, Doug, on the sort of higher velocity model that you're looking to drive. Could you update on -- update us on where that -- where things stand there, is that starting to contribute a material number of new customers and are there milestones this year that you're looking at to feel like that -- that this year will be where it needs to be? -- So for better or worse, as I've talked about in past calls that net new customer count is really a Splunk Enterprise count. And for month to month contracts in our cloud arena for the VictorOps contracts, which are true ARR (inaudible) monthly we don't, we don't include those, the numbers. So we've -- so we maintained consistency over the many years. We have been reporting that on how we'll define that number. So a lot of that velocity is not trapped in that number.And as we get more and more traction with the Splunk Cloud platform and lot of the elements that are offered there, we're going to have to face the decision point of how we want to update you guys on the total customers, not just the Splunk Enterprise customers and what the -- and what that trajectory looks like because that's becoming a more and more sizable portion of our R&D investment as well as everything around the Company, systems to support that lower touch higher volume model, marketing programs, sales teams et cetera, et cetera. -- Okay. And milestones this year, is there any -- is there anything we should be focused on or is it -- is it a sort of incremental (inaudible)? -- It is -- it's something that you -- that we have not -- we have not -- we're not making visible to guys. So no, there is internal milestones that we have, but there is nothing that we are breaking and reporting externally right now. -- Okay, great. Thanks. -- Thanks, Walter. -- Thanks, Walter. -- Thanks.Thank you. And at this time, I'll be turning the call back to Ken Tinsley for any closing remarks. -- Great. Thank you, Jimmy. Appreciate your help today. Jason, welcome, and Dave, thank you. It's been a pleasure and an honor. Hope everybody has a good night.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude your program, and you may all disconnect.

Even though results didn't disappoint, small imperfections sent shares into a double-digit retreat from their recent high-water mark.Now's the time to listen to the cliche and buy the dip.Splunk's software-specific revenue was up 54% year-over-year during the quarter to $265 million. Within that, the company's incredibly high-profit recurring license fees grew 46%. The company signed over 400 new customers to kick off its new fiscal year, and existing customers continue to spend more money with Splunk as time goes by.YOY = year over year. P.p. = percentage point. Data source: Splunk.Splunk's gross profits on services also increased year-over-year, with licensing (now near half of the tech outfit's total sales) notching a 97.2% margin. That's fueling the company's expansion into new areas like Internet of Things data management and orchestration for cybersecurity teams. It's clear that Splunk's data parsing service and a  it made last year are paying off, giving the new year a hot start --\u00a0. Image source: Getty Images.Nevertheless, the stock fell in spite of good headline numbers, and soaring operating costs are likely to blame. Total operating expenses rose 34% to $474 million during the first quarter, steepening Splunk's net loss.YOY = year over year. Data source: Splunk.This may be an uncomfortable situation for some investors, but Splunk's cash burn is yielding big revenue upside. Of particular note is the surge in research and development costs. Big data software is still getting put to use in new ways across a variety of enterprises. Management cited a couple of new customers the company picked up, including an entertainment conglomerate (which needed help with operations management and security) and a bicycle manufacturer (which is using Splunk for racing analytics), not to mention a few government agencies that expanded their use of the Splunk software.Thus the uptick in R&D looks like money well spent right now. Splunk is still very much a growth-now-profit-later concern. Adjusted earnings -- which back out one-time expenses and stock-based compensation -- increased, hitting positive territory during quarter one. Current cash on the balance sheet is also remaining stable at $1.84 billion at quarter end, with Splunk funding its aggressive expansion with stock instead.But Splunk is nonetheless expensive thanks to all of the internal investment. Trailing 12-month price to earnings is currently at 80, so the highly variable changes in growth and spending are making share prices volatile. Just as in times past, though, Splunk is not disappointing on the top-line. And that makes the recent pullback look like another good buying opportunity for investors who are in for the long-haul and don't mind the ups-and-downs.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares have pulled back, with FB stock falling from roughly $200 down to $180. However, the pullback has been very orderly so far and is even finding some moving average support.\nSource: Shutterstock\n\tIs this investors\u2019 chance to hop on the Facebook train or should they stay clear in the event of more selling?With the trade war hitting U.S. stocks, virtually all industries are under pressure, even though not all of them are impacted by the trade war. For instance, cloud companies like  (NASDAQ:) or  (NYSE:) won\u2019t see their businesses impacted by the trade war. Nor will  (NYSE:) or  (NASDAQ:). Worth mentioning is that Facebook isn\u2019t allowed in China, although its WeChat has plenty of global exposure.My point is, even though some of the companies above aren\u2019t impacted by the trade war, their stocks are still under pressure. FB stock is no exception either. Maybe the indices have already bottomed from these headlines, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it. If we have one or two more down legs to do go, investors will get a better shot at Facebook stock. That said, traders have a reasonable risk/reward situation with FB right now, should the markets hold up.So far, uptrend support (blue line) and the 50-day moving average are holding up for FB stock. That\u2019s a perfect spot for traders to watch, too. A pullback in a strong stock to its 50-day usually draws in buyers, even if only for the short-term. Facebook at least has that going for it right now.The key is to see what kind of bounce we get. Is it a modest 1% to 2% rally or does it send FB stock back to recent highs near $195? If it clears $195, $200 is on deck. Over the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $182.10 increases the odds for a retest of the 20-day moving average and gives some momentum to bulls.Should the selling accelerate in the overall market and FB stock gets pulled down, there are levels of support below too. A price of $170.82 marks a 50% retracement and down near $159.50 is the 38.2% retracement. The latter comes into play near the 200-day moving average and is a key level of support. Conveniently, $170 could be decent support too, it just depends on the aggressiveness of sellers should we get a pullback down to these levels.We may not see that type of decline, but if we do, it will pay to know where FB stock can hold up.It was like the sky was falling with Facebook stock over the past year, as investors were dumping the social media giant hand over fist. That\u2019s despite it having the best financials and metrics compared to peers like  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:).Privacy concerns and worries about leadership caused investors to puke up the stock. Never mind that FB stock has one of the  and is a cash-flow machine.Analysts expect the company to earn $7.05 per share this year. That\u2019s down almost 7% from the prior year. The plus side is that they expect 32% earnings growth to $9.32 per share in fiscal 2020. On the revenue front, growth is doing anything but slowing. Estimates call for 24% growth this year and 21% next year.Social media is far too efficient for businesses to ignore when it comes to advertising and it\u2019s far too addicting for users to put down. So long as that remains the case, Facebook will be in business. That , particularly given the balance sheet strength of FB stock.Long-term investors may consider waiting for a larger correction in FB stock should they want to bet on the continued growth in social media.

Now, everything we do really is for three-plus years. But if we kept holding all of these five-stock samplers, this podcast would be nothing but reviews one week after another. So this is, in fact, Emily, the end of covering . This is their three-year birthday. Emily, three years ago, May 4th, 2016. What were you doing?I think I was really excited because I just got an offer from The Motley Fool to come in for an internship. I don't think I'd quite yet started. But I know that I got it and I was really pumped. That's awesome! I'm so glad to know that's what was happening three years ago this week and your life. I've already shared a little bit about mine. So I think we can now move on from us to our stocks. And we've got five of them. And for each of these, I'll be reviewing briefly what the stock was, where it was, and where it is today. The numbers part of it. And then Emily, I've asked you, since the purpose of The Motley Fool is to make the world smarter, happier and richer, I would love it if you could make us smarter and happier about each of these five stocks. So maybe make us smarter, reflect on the three years, and pick out maybe something that really says why this stock did well or not. And then, how about a fun fact, something that makes us happier? And then we'll find out at the end whether these stocks made us richer or not as we do the results. Sounds good?That sounds great! Let's do it! OK. The first stock up three years ago this week was . The ticker symbol is CELG. This is a company that on that day was just below $101. It was $100.90 a share. Today as we tape this podcast the afternoon of Tuesday, May 7th, it's at about, I'm sorry to say, $95 a share. Celgene is down 5.5% over these three years. Here's what really hurts for stock market investors who may have followed my advice three years ago: the market is up exactly 40%. We're taping on a date pretty bad, the NASDAQ's down about 2% today. It's 2% less. But still up 40% over the last three years. So this stock is 46% behind the market. Emily, this stock has not made us richer, but could you make us smarter and happier about Celgene?I think Celgene, regardless of whether or not you're an investor who may be bought in and lost about 5% there, has made us smarter. It's not just because of all the research that they've done into their cancer treatment drugs. I think it's the way that it really opened up the biopharmaceutical industry. I mean, it was kind of the first play that was integrated. It had so many different components to its business. And for a long time, a lot of investors' first step into biopharmaceuticals. Now it feels like every other week in , at least, we see a different company coming out that's doing something revolutionary and amazing in the space of biopharmaceutical. So in a way, it was an anchor for a lot of investors when looking at investing in the biopharmaceuticals space. And just because Celgene maybe didn't perform the best, I know there are a handful of other companies that came after it, trying to get after very similar things, in the way that they conduct research and create products.I think that ultimately, we can all come out of it a little bit smarter.I appreciate that point very much. It is, I guess, in a way, even though it is a loser, it's consoling to know that it did make the world smarter. And apparently it made pretty interested because Celgene, part of the reason you're using the past tense, Emily, is that Bristol-Myers contracted to buy this company out. That's something that happened just a few months ago. The price is, well, around where it is right now, which is why the stock's trading there. It's a $74 billion buyout, one of the bigger buyouts in pharma history. Celgene didn't exactly fully, in a way, last these three years. It did decline those first couple, so we were sitting on a loser. It got bought out at a premium, but still below where I talked about it three years ago this week.I'm a little sad about Celgene for a few different reasons. I really appreciate all the inroads they've made to go after blood cancer. It's great work, and it's obviously very valuable. About $75 billion or so, Bristol-Myers says. But Emily, can you make me a little happier about Celgene?Well, there's a lot of things to be happy about for Celgene. Going beyond their products, which I'm sure have made a lot of people happier who had the unfortunate exposure to things like but cancer, whether themselves or through their family or loved ones, Celgene as a business actually makes me happy. It's because it's not well known that Celgene has continuously been ranked as one of the best places to work internationally, especially in the biopharmaceutical industry. They have an extremely robust CSR program -- Corporate social responsibility.Exactly. They really see themselves not as a company that's out there to make money even though clearly they are. They see their bigger obligation to humanity, which is really saying something in the environment that we're seeing today with a lot of these companies, which we now are seeing dragged in the water because they're preventing treatment from being sent out to people. The fact that Celgene has taken the high road in a lot of regards is really nice.Alright, well, thank you! That was stock No. 1. Great to hear! Emily, let's go to stock No. 2. ticker symbol as well known to many longtime investors and  listeners. The ticker symbol is DIS. The company is . A company that has a ton of properties, data. A lot of our thinking, in many ways, is driven by a company like Disney. I've noticed some people have been focused on the . When we talk about a thinking world, a lot of people are thinking just about the biggest box office hit of all time, which is still in early days for Disney. But of course, it's about a lot more, not just superheroes, but businesses than that.Walt Disney was at $103.67 three years ago this week. As we do this podcast, I have it just over $134 a share. Hey, great news, right? Up 29.5%, we'll round that to 30%. Bad news, though, the market up 40%. Disney up 30%. So, , so far, we've got two losers. Emily, make us smarter about Disney.Well, it's a good lesson to be learned from Disney that sometimes the best run companies, doing the best things in the world that you love the most, may not outperform the market. It's a reminder that smart investors take that three years is not a long enough time horizon. That's purely because I don't think there's a single person looking at Disney in the state that it's in today and thinks, \"This isn't going to continue to do amazing things in the future.\" Whether you bought in three years ago, or you're buying in today, I mean, this is such a well-run company. We can all be a little bit smarter to not be latched onto these historical biases, this small underperformance when in reality, you see the opportunity clearly before your eyes with a company like Disney.Thank you! And you're right. And I'm so glad you emphasize that. This five-stock sampler, , just because we're ending it this week, because that's how long the game was being played on this podcast over the last three years, doesn't mean that we don't still love these companies, admire them, and think great things about them. Had we done this the three or so years before, I bet Disney would have been a winner over those three years. I sure hope it'll be a winner over the next three years. But by no means does our interest or belief in any of these stocks end with this podcast. Quite the opposite. They all remain active recommendations in Motley Fool  or Motley Fool .I think in a lot of ways, Disney makes us happier. I think that's at the heart of its brand. Emily, can you make us a little happier about Disney?It's so hard to choose one thing about Disney that can make me or an investor, anybody in the world, a little bit happier. But I keep going back to Disney+. Maybe that's just because it's very topical right now. I don't have kids. But I imagine if I was a parent to young kids, there'd be nothing in this world that made me happier than Disney+. To be able to have an essentially unlimited supply of family friendly content that you can plop them down in front of and feel totally comfortable with that decision... I mean, it makes the project a little bit into that state. But if I were a parent, I would feel very happy.Well, certainly the stock market has not failed to notice that Disney+ will be coming out later this year. It's not yet a present reality. But in some ways, Disney's stock reacted really positively in its most recent earnings report. I think the stock popped over 10% in a single day as Bob Iger began to talk more about Disney+. Everybody knows it's coming. Yes, I still love too. I don't think these things are opposed. It's a thinking world, and these kinds of companies and brands all do well in my experience. It'll be really interesting to watch. Thank you for highlighting Disney+.Alright, Emily, stock No. 3. Now, spoiler alert, things are about to get better with this five-stock sampler. Because after all, the purpose of Motley Fool, Emily, is to make the world smarter, happier, and what? Richer!Let's hope so! This company, I can say, has done so. This is a market-beater, company No. 3. The ticker symbol is SPLK. The company is . Three years ago this week, it was at $48.87. At the close on May 4th, really happy to let you all know that it's at about $130 a share right now as we talk. Just short of $130 a share. I have it then up 166%. The stock market up 40%, so we can put a big plus 126% in the win column. 126 points ahead of the S&P 500. And if you compare the previous two stocks, which were a minus 46, reviewing quickly, a minus 46 and a minus 10, and you do the math with me, 126 minus 56 looks like a plus 70 right now as we look over these three stocks.Emily, make us smarter about what's been happening over these last three years with Splunk. Well, Splunk has made all of us aware, gave us information to what a zettabyte is. David, do you know what is a zettabyte is? I'm going to say it's a ton of data, but that's about as far as I can go.A zettabyte is one billion terabytes. One terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes. So you can get an idea about how Splunk is making us smarter. Splunk sees the 44 zettabytes, which I don't even know how to do that math quickly in my head, this huge amount of data. I'm glad you know it's 44, not 40, no round number here. Somebody at Splunk found that number, with all the universe of information that we have out in the world, and they're making sense of it. That makes us all a little bit smarter.So you're saying, Emily, that the world's data at this point equals 44 zettabytes? By 2020, the world's information will equal 44 zettabytes.OK, great! You know, Splunk, I'm going to supplement your smarter lesson with a little bit more smarter. This was kind of interesting to note. Splunk had been a losing stock the one year leading up to when I picked it three years ago. The three years leading up to it, it had also been a loser stock. It had IPO-ed not that far before. It had a big initial IPO. But then it just dawdled for a while. So, I'm so happy to think that we did pick it three years ago this week, because it's gone from basically about $50 to about $130 over these three years, and shows that often, the winners win out there. And it is a winning company.Thank you for making us smarter! How about, make us a little happier when we think about Splunk? Splunk is subtle happiness. It's that happiness that you feel when you wake up in the morning and you see a nice sunrise, you see the birds tweeting. You don't know exactly what it is, but it makes you happy. Let me name a couple of companies that maybe conduct this happiness for you, because they're all Splunk customers. Splunk makes all these customers run and make you happy. Do you like ? I do like Yelp!\u00a0? Sure!? I know it.?Coke makes me happier than Groupon, personally. I'm referring to Coca-Cola. Yes, Coca-Cola. The only thing that's important to me is the fact they help run their information system.I transacted with Domino's last night. And that's a vital part of my everyday life, for better or worse. So, Splunk, I like to think, makes a lot of people happier without them quite realizing that Splunk is in fact making them happier.Love it! Yeah, it's a great company! Of course, we like it a lot for the next three years, but we're going to stop tracking it with this five-stock sampler as of this podcast. That leaves us with two final stocks to talk about, Emily. One thing I want to say about these two companies is they both have silly names. There's Splunk and the next two. Since we named our company The Motley Fool, an inherently silly name, especially in the area of finance, you can see that I'm probably a little bit of a sucker for companies that have silly names. So Splunk, probably playing into my subconscious, part of the reason I picked it three years ago or years before that for , is because I like the silly. I like the happy and silly. So, let's next go to some more silly. Stock No. 4, the ticker symbol, tell me if you can guess the company name from this ticker symbol: TWTR. I think a lot of us, even if you're not an investor, maybe you can guess along with me. . Stock No. 4 was Twitter. Three years ago this week, Twitter was just below $15 a share. $14.84. It should be noted that it had lost 70% of its value in the years leading up to our picking it three years ago this week. It had lost 70% of its value, down to $14.84. As we speak now, it's at about $38.50. Twitter, therefore, is up 160%. Again, the stock market, up 40% over these three years. So that's up 120%, making me really happy that we found some winners in this thinking world.Emily, looking back over three years now, thinking big picture about Twitter, make us smarter.Well, there's so many ways that Twitter makes everybody a little bit smarter. That might sound counterintuitive right now, especially with all the noise we hear about these fake accounts, information privacy. But Twitter is doing something that's really revolutionizing the way that we learn and consume information. It's democratizing information. It's making people smarter by increasing responsibility, by increasing accessibility. And that, to me, is probably the most strong value proposition at a company like Twitter. This access to information, it's unprecedented. Even in the internet age, having a Twitter, using a Twitter, accessing people over Twitter, that type of level has really never been seen before.I agree. And certainly many of us who love a celebrity or an athlete, we can follow them on Twitter. And really, in a lot of ways, we might in some cases be following their social media manager. Some others are more authentic than that. Side note, I'm a small presence on Twitter, but I just tweet myself. I mean, there are no social media managers here guiding Motley Fool advisors' accounts. That said, whether it's a celebrity, an athlete, or how about the authors that I referenced earlier this podcast? James Clear, . I follow him on Twitter. I follow David Allen on Twitter. I follow Warren Berger, the author of on Twitter. So yeah, we can follow the people that interest us and hear how they're thinking about the world. Definitely making us think-ier in a thinking world.Emily, how about a fun fact? Something to make us happier about Twitter?I actually don't have a Twitter account. I really should.That's a fun fact! Why not?It is a fun fact. I'm not sure if that makes anybody happier. But what will make people happier, and what made me happier, even though I don't have a Twitter account, is last week seeing have a spiffy pop, and seeing the number of people that both tweeted at The Motley Fool, tweeted at you, all of these happy investors, who had bought MercadoLibre's stock on our recommendation, having a spiffy pop last week. Twitter made that accessible, and that made me happy. That made me happy, too! I really appreciate you pointing that out. I'd forgotten to thank all of our listeners and those who did tweet out to @RBIPodcast and @TheMotleyFool, a much bigger Twitter account for The Motley Fool, and reflected on their happiness and joy around watching MercadoLibre, which I think went up about 21% or so that day in one day. But for those of us who've bought and held it a long time, it's not in this five-stock sampler, it's been in some others, but more importantly, it's been a part of  for more than a decade now. And we all made more money in that one day than we had paid for it way back when. That's what a spiffy pop is, a term that I want every  investor to know. Something we talk about probably not enough on this show. But thank you for pointing out that spiffy pop. It was a very happy day.It was. And it was made happier by Twitter. You're absolutely right, Emily, because otherwise I wouldn't have heard that, I wouldn't have known that. And so yeah, that makes me happier! OK, good!Well, we're going to get to stock No. 5 now, and I'm going to pre-empt any suspense here. I'm going to let you know upfront that this stock also lost to the market. It was a disappointment. But good news, take this five-stock sampler together and we crushed the market once again with this five-stock sampler. Even more meaningful since this is the last time we'll ever talk about it. We're waving goodbye to it. We're sun-setting . Stock No. 5 was one of three losers in a thinking world. The stock was still up. The ticker symbol is Z, and the company, we've already talked about a little bit is, Zillow, another really silly name like Splunk and Twitter and The Motley Fool. Zillow three years ago this week was just over $28 a share. It's now $33.63 as we tape. It's up 20%. The market is up 40% so it's a minus 20. Right at the end, I'll give the final numerical take on the overall performance of this five-stock sampler, but let's focus on Zillow for a sec. Emily, we talk about Zillow some on the  team. It's one of our probably more widely owned . It's a stock that I own. I'm obviously a little disappointed that it's been an underperformer over these last three years. Why?Zillow had a bit of a challenge, you could say, with its business model, particularly making money off of its business model. But Zillow recently has been a stock of a little bit more controversy here at The Motley Fool because they're changing their business model. They're changing their business model to make home buying a little bit easier. And so while many people are rubbed the wrong way by that, and I will be the first one to say that I was one of those people, a number of people here see this outdated, dying industry and they think, \"Wow, Zillow could really do something! There's a lot of potential there!\"Because Zillow's business when we picked the stock three years ago was largely based on realtors, real estate professionals, taking out ads, advertising themselves in their zip code for the houses that you might be looking to buy. That was the bread and butter. Definitely a data-heavy company. I'm not sure any of those full zettabytes are Zillow's, but if you think about all the data, pricing and having specifications around all the properties, just residential properties here in the United States, for one, that's a ton of data. It was more a data business. But as you point out, Emily, this is a company that is now buying houses themselves and becoming a real estate owning company. That's a real shift in the business model. You could say that it's made us smarter by showing that businesses can change. They continue to change. As long as you have a long-term outlook, there's always going to be value behind what these businesses do, whether that be collect data or take out advertisements. You can ever discount a business because the ability to change and innovate is always going to be inherent. But the one way that I think Zillow has really made someone I know smarter, is our recent new hire on the candidate side of our investing team, Joey, who used Zillow to look at and eventually purchase a house here in the area. Almost bought a house, but looked on Trulia, a Zillow platform, and saw the crime rates in one of the areas he was looking. Having never visited the area before, didn't know anything about the crime rates. He was immediately smarter. Immediately thought, \"I don't think I want to buy that house anymore.\" And because of Zillow, because of their platforms, he was able to get a house he loves now that he never, before buying, even stepped into. That's great example! I'm so happy to know that Joey found a house more to his liking. And I think he did. As a new employee, I think he's moved into the area, which I think means Joey's around here for a while. Yeah, not going anywhere!Speaking of change, I also want to point out that Rich Barton has now returned to become the CEO of Zillow, another change, having replaced Spencer Rascoff, who was running the company last few years somewhat successfully, especially early on, but not as successfully. Obviously, a market loser here over the last three years. I think it's very promising to have Rich Barton back. We'll see how things play out from here.OK, so I hope we made our listeners a little smarter about Zillow. It's a stock that I still favor and own. And Emily, you're not as big a fan, which is fine; it takes two to make a market. We'll see. You were certainly right the last three years. I wish I'd listened to you as a summer intern, summer 2016, when you were probably talking daggers about Zillow. But, no, more seriously, how about a fun fact? Make us happier about, in this case, current underperformer?Well, Rich Barton has one job, and he says he's going to make your life happier by making home buying and home selling easier. If he's able to succeed on that, I think all of us will be a little bit happier. The process as it is today is complicated, long, and full of unnecessary fees. If there's a way that Zillow and Rich Barton, with all of his amazing vision, can come in and smooth that process, maybe three years from today, we're all happier because of Zillow. Well, I sure hope so! In many cases, whether we recommend our own stock or not, we're wanting better things for the world in which we all live. Competition in capitalism, sometimes viewed as negative, but I think it's pretty great. I'm glad that exists, or Trulia used to compete with Zillow. Competition often forces people to become better and usually the winners win in the marketplace, and we all win as investors of these companies. Well, thank you Emily, for joining in!Let's just talk up the final numbers for this set of five stocks, this five-stock sampler, , dated May 4th, 2016. You can go back and listen again to that original show where I picked the stocks and share my thinking. But I'm really happy to say as a group, they're up 74% on average, the market up 40% on average. Therefore, plus 34% per stock. 74% against 40%. I would say even though some of them weren't winners, we really did win on behalf of our listeners with .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at options trading activity among components of the Russell 3000 index, there is noteworthy activity today in JetBlue Airways Corp (Symbol: JBLU), where a total volume of 25,814 contracts has been traded thus far today, a contract volume which is representative of approximately 2.6 million underlying shares (given that every 1 contract represents 100 underlying shares).

Specifically, ETFs \u2014 through diversification \u2014 allow investors to invest in themes, not stocks. This reduces the risks inherent in picking a single winner in an industry, while still giving investors exposure to the upside throughout the entire industry.In other words, thematic investing through ETFs is a great way to simultaneously reduce risk and maintain solid upside exposure.The key with ETFs, of course, is to pick the right ones. As opposed to picking the right stock, investors have to pick the right theme. This is easier to do than picking the right stock\u00a0and\u00a0the right theme. But, it still requires ample due diligence.With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look six big growth ETFs investors should consider if they are looking to invest in tomorrow\u2019s most important themes.The value of cybersecurity will only dramatically rise in an increasingly digitally connected world.  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:)Thanks to the widespread proliferation of the internet and rise of things like AI, IoT and the cloud, the consumer and enterprise worlds are becoming more digitally connected than ever before. Ostensibly, this is a good thing. But, we\u2019ve been reminded recently of the downfalls of this unprecedented connection through various hacks and data security breaches. Broadly speaking, everyone and every company\u2019s data is running around on the internet, and that presents huge risks for both the individual and the enterprise.Cybersecurity solutions protect against these risks. Over time, as the world becomes more digitally connected, these risks will only grow. As they do, the value of protecting against these risks will grow, too. Consequently, the outlook for the whole cybersecurity space to rise dramatically in value over the next several years is favorable. That\u2019s why the  (NASDAQ:) looks like a solid long-term holding.Everything is going to cloud, and as it does, the companies that provide cloud-based services will grow tremendously. (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:)Technology used to be delivered and stored on-premise. That is, you used to buy software at a store, bring it home or to the office, download it and use it on-site, with all the operations, data and workflow hosted on-site. Over the past several years, this process has changed thanks to the cloud. Now, there\u2019s no need to go to a store and buy anything. Services are delivered directly through and stored in the cloud, and this removes frictions related to on-premise delivery and storage.This revolution is well underway. That\u2019s why the  (NASDAQ:), which focuses on companies that deliver cloud-based services, is up more than 100% over the past three years. But, only 20% of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud. At scale, that number will be closer to 100%. Thus, we are only one-fifth of the way through the cloud growth narrative, and that means SKYY still has lots of runway left to head even higher in the long run.Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) stocks are winning investments, and this ETF gives you broad exposure to the world\u2019s best SaaS stocks.Microsoft, Salesforce,  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:)SaaS stocks are winning stocks. Broadly speaking, these are high-growth companies with robust exposure to the cloud and software revolutions. They\u2019re also high-margin companies since costs associated with delivering cloud-hosted solutions at scale are relatively small. Further, they are often supported by steady and predictable revenue streams, which gives investors confidence regarding go-forward operational stability. Because of these winning attributes, the (NYSE:) is up 115% over the past three years.This big rally will continue. As stated earlier, only 20% of workloads have migrated to the cloud, so revenue growth potential remains huge. Plus, margins have lots of room to expand as the industry matures, and revenue predictability will likewise improve with scale. Overall, then, the three big tailwinds which have produced huge gains in IGV will persist for the foreseeable future, and that means that this big rally is far from over.The robots are coming, and companies that provide automation technology and services will profit tremendously in the long run. (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:),  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:)One of the biggest trends over the next several years will be automation. Specifically, automated technologies will continue to get better and better, until they are good enough to largely replace human labor in many parts of the workforce. That\u2019s not great news for the labor market. But, it is great news for the companies that are leading this automation revolution, like Intuitive Surgical \u2014 the company that is putting robots in the surgery room \u2014 and iRobot \u2014 the company that is putting robots in your house to clean your floors.All of these leading automation companies are packaged into the  (NYSE:). As such, as the automation trends gain mainstream traction over the next decade, the ROBO ETF will explode higher alongside all the important automation stocks.E-commerce is still in the early stages of a multi-year secular growth narrative, and e-commerce companies will continue to grow at a rapid rate for the foreseeable future.Amazon,  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:)One of the biggest growth narratives over the past several years has been the rapid rise in e-commerce. Companies like Amazon, Wayfair and Etsy have pioneered of new of era shopping from the comfort of your own home, and in so doing, have stolen tremendous market share from traditional retailers. Consequently, all those stocks have soared, as has the  (NASDAQ:).These gains will continue. At the present moment, e-commerce sales represent just over 10% of total retail sales in the U.S. That\u2019s still a relatively small piece of the pie. Further, the whole industry continues to grow at a healthy double-digit rate. Thus, it increasingly appears as though we are still in the early stage of e-commerce\u2019s long-term growth narrative. As that narrative plays out over the next several years, the IBUY ETF will continue to rise.Digital payments, and specifically mobile payments, are gaining massive traction, and the companies behind these payments project as big growers.PayPal,  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:)As digital shopping has grown, so has the digital payments world. When you shop online, you can\u2019t pay for an item with cash. You have to use a card or a digital payment account. Thus, cash has become less prevalent throughout the economy over the past several years, while digital payments have become more prevalent. This has led to huge gains in digital payment stocks like Master, Visa and Square, as well as in the  (NASDAQ:).As stated earlier, e-commerce sales only represent 10% of total retail sales, so that growth narrative is far from over. Consequently, the parallel digital payments growth narrative is likewise far from over. Specifically, within the digital payments world, we are going to see a huge rise in mobile commerce over the next several years as mobile-first apps like Instagram dive deeper into shopping. All of this implies big growth ahead for digital payments stocks and the IPAY ETF.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long PANW, CIBR, CRM, NFLX, AMZN, ADBE, NOW, ROBO, CHGG, PYPL and SQ.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors eyeing a purchase of Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $129.88/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.

And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $80 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Splunk Inc sees its shares decline 38.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $74.00 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $6.00 from $80), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.4% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, and highlighting in green where the $80 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 put at the $80 strike for the 4.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Splunk Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $129.88) to be 45%.

The company added that its revenue tallied up to $425 million for the period, beating the $395.4 million that analysts projected.Splunk\u2019s revenue was up 36% when compared to its first quarter of the fiscal 2018, while its earnings of 2 cents per share topped the loss of 7 cents per share it amassed during the same period a year ago.

It has since been updated and republished.]When it comes to tech stocks a lot of ink has been spilled on the so-called FANG stocks. And for good reason. Leaders like  (NYSE:) or  (NASDAQ:) have been dominant forces in the sector and have shaken-up their respective technology subsectors since the end of the Great Recession. The problem is,as we continue to focus on the FANGs, plenty of other tech stocks have gone unnoticed. After all, there\u2019s more to the technology sector than just  (NASDAQ:).In fact, there\u2019s a lot more.Some of the best tech stocks continue to fly under the radar as the focus continues to be on FAANG stocks. For investors, looking at them could provide some of the best long-term growth potential around.But which firms have the goods to help get your mind off the likes of\u00a0 (NASDAQ:) and NFLX?Here are five tech stocks worth a look.Advertising today is nothing like an episode of Mad Men. As various digital platforms have exploded in use, marketers and advertisers have been forced to adapt to the shifting landscape. Helping them adapt to that shift and target the right customer at the right time is (NYSE:).The idea behind TTD is simple enough. Dubbed \u201c,\u201d Trade Desk will use high-speed computers and various algorithms to automate the process of ad buying in real time. By searching the nearly 20 digital-ad exchanges, TTD allows advertisers to instantly find exactly who they want to target their ad to \u2014 whether that\u2019s on their computer, smartphone or other devices. Trade Desk\u2019s programs are so fast and successful, they are able to place roughly 9 million ads per second through their online auctions.In the end, it creates a much more efficient and cost-effective way for companies to reach consumers.For TTD, this creates plenty of revenues and growth. As Trade Desk has been able to score more customers, the Trade desk saw its revenue jump by 56% year-over-year during the fourth quarter. The best part of that jump was that two of firm\u2019s main growth engines \u2014 video and connected TV advertising \u2014 are just really getting started. That leaves plenty of room for TTD to continue its pace of huge revenue jumps. Even better, TTD stock is profitable.All in all, the Trade Desk has what it takes to be one of the best tech stocks outside the FANGs.Cloud computing has really changed the way we function these days. So, naturally, tech stocks leading the way into the cloud are worthy FANG replacements. And  (NASDAQ:) may be one of the best.Human Resources is full of tedious tasks such as changing ACH payroll information, filling out expense reports or signing up for a retirement/401k plan. Often these things get in the way of allowing the HR staff to do meaningful work. WDAY makes a variety of applications for small or large businesses to cover these tasks. The best part is, like many cloud computing firms, a business can add as little or as much as they like. And rather than purchasing the service, they pay a reoccurring fee.For Workday, this has all added up to some great growth. , WDAY saw a huge 35.4% jump to its total revenues, while subscriptions revenues came in at $673.5 million \u2014 a 30% year-over-year jump. The best part is that its subscription revenue backlog \u2014 that is, sales that are not officially booked, but will be as because companies have signed up for multi-term products \u2014 came in at over $6.7 billion.With key high-margined products \u2014 such as WDAY\u2019s business intelligence offering, Prism Analytics \u2014 growing like weeds, the pace of revenues should continue. Moreover, it should allow Workday to finally move into the black when it comes to GAAP accounting standards.All in all, Workday is quickly becoming a go-to name in HR management. For investors, that makes one serious tech stock to have your portfolio.Want to forget the FANGs? A 278% return will help you do it. And that\u2019s just what investors in  (NASDAQ:) were treated to last year. That return was one of the best among all tech stocks \u2014 FANG\u2019s included. There\u2019s plenty of reasons why TWLO could see more gains ahead.Twilio designs cloud-based communications platforms that allow developers to send automated phone calls, text messages, and other communication functions. For example, when you\u2019re doing a bit of online shopping or banking and you see one of those chat boxes that allows you ask questions or find out more about a product or account, Twilio made that happen. The awesome part is that developers can simply take TWLO\u2019s APIs and apps, chuck them into their code and instantly get the ability to add these functions. TWLO  when consumers use the functions.And collect fees it does.As of the end of the third quarter, TWLO had roughly 64,300 different customers using their apps.\u00a0 In Q4 alone, revenues jumped by 77%\u00a0as both organic and new customer growth surged. And there\u2019s still plenty of room to grow across a variety of customers.Given the ease of TWLO\u2019s products and the continued growth potential, it\u2019s easy to see how the tech stock will a giant over the long haul. That\u2019s assuming it doesn\u2019t get bought out first.As technology has invaded our lives, we create a lot of data. In fact, we make so much of it, a new term \u201cBig Data\u201d was invented to describe the billions of gigabytes of info we generate. The problem for businesses is how to comprehend that data and dig into it to gain actual knowledge. Software firm  (NASDAQ:) hopes to provide the answers.At its core, Splunk provides a variety of tools and businesses intelligence software to collect, manage and analyze all the data various organizations make. This includes everything from machine learning and application analysis to cybersecurity and business analytics. The win is that SPLK\u2019s applications are set-up to use a simple website-style interface. You don\u2019t need to be a developer to use or understand the software.This ease of use and ability to comb through all the data has a lot of fans. Some of SPLK\u2019s customers include  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:) and AAA.Naturally, all of this love for Big Data has created some big revenues for the tech stock. In Q4, revenues jumped 35% year-over-year.When it comes to tech stocks, Splunk is the reigning big data king.Not to be confused with the popular video game Fortnite, (NASDAQ:) could be one of the best tech stocks out there. And that\u2019s because of what it targets: cybersecurity.With hacks, data breaches and other cyber threats on the rise, protecting a network is of utmost importance. And it\u2019s only getting much more important as we move into the cloud, conduct more banking online and live more complicated digital lives. It\u2019s FTNT\u2019s job to make sure a company\u2019s or your data doesn\u2019t fall into the hands of hackers. It develops and markets various cybersecurity software as well as devices such as firewalls, anti-virus, intrusion prevention, VPNs and endpoint security products. Basically, all the stuff you\u2019d need to build a secure network.And given the high-profile nature of several recent data breaches, FTNT is supplying a lot of stuff. In Q4, its revenues grew at 22%. More importantly, the\u00a0 company\u2019s 2019 With digital threats continuing to grow, Fortinet is poised to be one of the biggest winners among tech stocks.Disclosure: As of the time of writing, Aaron Levitt held no position in any stock mentioned.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NYSE:) stock management reported earnings last night, and the stock has been active since then. Traders initially sold the stock down on the headline in a knee-jerk reaction but then it flipped green. This morning TWLO is holding the rally \u2014 it\u2019s up almost 5%. So clearly the news was indeed more good than bad.Source: \n\tWhat makes this pop impressive is that the stock came into the earnings event already up 52% year-to-date. This is double that of the Nasdaq  (NASDAQ:). This differential is even more pronounced farther back in time. Twilio is up over 200% in 12 months. Compare this to the QQQ, which is up 18%. Clearly, the buyers are in charge of this stock.When a stock is at or near all-time highs, the setup for an upside reaction to earnings is difficult. So the greens today, if they hold, are a testament to the respect that Wall Street has for the stock. Now the onus is on management to continue to execute on its plans this well going forward, so that it continues to prove worthy of the trust that investors have in it.The report card was strong. They beat expectations and guided stronger forward. Revenues grew 80% to $233 million when investors were only expecting $223 million. This is a proper result for a growth stock as the company continues to grow the top line.So is it a buy here? Not exactly. I call stocks like this too high to chase and too hot to short.This is a case where your next move totally depends on your time frame. If the intent is to own these shares for a long time, then there is no sense trying to snipe the perfect entry point \u2014 but up here at all-time highs, it\u2019s not an obvious entry point into Twilio stock.This is not a negative statement against the company\u2019s prospects, just a caution against the price action from here. Ideally, it would be better to wait for a pull back to $125 per share but the traders may not allow for it for a long while.Fundamentally, Twilio is not cheap. This is a tech stock that sells at 26 times sales. Compare that with the original cloud company,  (NYSE:), which sells at only 10 times sales. And remember, CRM stock is not cheap either so I am not comparing TWLO to a bargain. Salesforce\u2019s trailing price-to-earnings ratio is 115, which is more than most mega-cap stocks \u2014 even  (NASDAQ:).In summary, buying TWLO stock at all time highs requires a lot of faith in the future of the markets in general and in this sector. So the safer bet is to wait for a better entry point perhaps near $125 per share. Otherwise, if not already long it, it\u2019s okay to admit that the trader missed this trade.Most analysts who cover the stock rate TWLO as a buy as it trades towards the upper end of their price target ranges, so they will need to reset their targets higher or downgrade it soon enough. And that, too, could be a price driver.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of\u00a0. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Investors looking for stocks to buy, as a rule, should focus on high-quality, and preferably, lower-risk issues.Still, there\u2019s room in any investor\u2019s portfolio for higher-risk, higher-reward plays \u2014 as long as those risks are understood.In that vein, here are 10 stocks to buy that offer\u00a0potentially significant rewards \u2026 and almost as much risk. None of these stocks should be a core part of a portfolio, and\u00a0all have the potential to blow up in your face.But\u00a0taking those risks also creates the possibility of a major reward. It\u2019s likely at least a few of these stocks will wind up big winners going forward.\u00a0(NYSE:) isn\u2019t having a great year, down just about 7%.Teva has too much debt and too little growth. Its key drug, Copaxone, which treats multiple sclerosis, is facing generic competition from \u00a0(NASDAQ:), among others. Bankruptcy likely isn\u2019t a near-term scenario but the current trajectory suggests it could occur down the line. In short, TEVA is a classic contrarian, \u201cbuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d type of play. And there are reasons TEVA is one of these great (if risky) stocks to buy.While pressure has persisted on generic drugs, but it won\u2019t last forever.The company has sold assets to clean up its balance sheet, which has de-risked the story somewhat. In my opinion, Teva is a better version of Valeant, but with an easier path back to normalcy.It\u2019s a risky path, but if it works TEVA\u00a0could gain another 20%-plus simply by reaching a higher multiple and removing bankruptcy fears.\n\t\n\t\tSource: Shutterstock\n\tThe story already has played out somewhat at \u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is up 14.23% so far this year. But the growth story isn\u2019t necessarily over.Only a few years ago, Scientific Games was a sleepy, low-growth provider of lottery tickets and terminals. But in quick succession, SciGames acquired slot machine manufacturers WMS Industries and Bally Technologies, the latter coming only months after Bally bought equipment maker and gaming table designer Shuffle Master. Scientific Games became the dominant supplier to the casino industry worldwide: a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for casino floors.It also became one of the most indebted companies in the U.S. markets and still is. The combination of that debt and careful cost controls at casinos, particularly in the U.S., kept SGMS stock below $20 to start the year.But it now looks like the long-awaited \u201creplacement cycle\u201d of slot machines is arriving and that could be hugely beneficial for Scientific Games and its smaller, similar rival  (NYSE:). And considering how much leverage is still on the balance sheet, there\u2019s a case for SGMS to clear $100 \u2014 yes, $100 \u2014 if profit growth accelerates.That\u2019s not a guarantee, obviously, but\u00a0it\u2019s the nature of highly indebted companies. Leverage is a weight when those companies struggle, and it\u2019s a springboard when they grow.\n\t\n\t\tSource: \n\tIn the case of  (NYSE:), leverage has been a weight. After optimism about stable energy prices and Chesapeake\u2019s improved balance sheet boosted CHK stock in 2017, it was nothing but downhill in 2018. CHK now trades up ,pre than 57% since the beginning of the year. This could be the upswing you\u2019ve been waiting for.I think CHK is the best, if riskiest, of the stocks to buy on higher energy prices. At the least, Chesapeake has bought itself more time for those prices to work higher. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that Chesapeake bonds actually have been rather stable so far this year. Efficiency improvements at the wellhead have lowered costs as well.Chesapeake is a risky play, but the combination of debt on the balance sheet and leverage from higher energy prices mean that with a couple of changes, CHK could soar.\n\t\n\t\tSource: \n\t(NASDAQ:), on the other hand, isn\u2019t the cheapest stock in its space or anywhere else. The high-flying \u201coperational intelligence\u201d software provider trades up nearly 30% since the beginning of the year alone.The valuation alone shows the risk in SPLK, which has pulled back from brief early-2014 highs above $100. But since that pullback, SPLK stock actually has been rather stable, as investors give the company time to grow into its valuation.Meanwhile, Splunk continues to be a likely acquisition target, with \u00a0(NASDAQ:) cited as a potential buyer in June and \u00a0(NYSE:) long thought to be a logical acquirer.Splunk is a classic growth stock in that it, too, is high-risk and high-reward. But it looks like one of the better growth stocks to buy in what might be an over-aggressive market at the moment.\n\t\n\t\tSource: Shutterstock\n\tThe shipping space generally has been a \u201cBermuda Triangle\u201d for investor capital, but \u00a0(NYSE:) might be the exception to the rule.There\u2019s likely to be some near-term volatility and Ship Finance\u2019s dividend, which currently yields 10.95%, could be at risk, but it\u2019s still one of those great stocks to buy if you can handle the risk.But this also remains one of the best plays in shipping, available for a modest premium to book value and at low-teens multiple to earnings. The industry alone, and a heavily leveraged balance sheet, both show the risk.But if Ship Finance can make it through some choppy waters over the next few months, there\u2019s likely a nice return for shareholders on the other side.There\u2019s no sector of the market more boom-and-bust than biotech and drug development.\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:) doubles down on that volatility by developing its drugs from marijuana.But GW Pharmaceuticals isn\u2019t one of those fly-by-night penny stocks to buy based on legalized weed. It\u2019s a $2.6 billion pharmaceutical company with a legitimate lead product candidate in Epidiolex, aimed to treat Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Sativex, used to treat multiple sclerosisSativex, used to treat multiple sclerosis spasticity, already is on the market. And another compound has potential uses to fight epilepsy and treat autism spectrum disorders.Like most drug development plays, GWPH is high-risk. But there\u2019s reason for investors to hold long-term optimism toward the company\u2019s pipeline. Success in getting those drugs to market likely would make GWPH an acquisition target at some point suggesting a significant upside from current levels. If it happens, analysts see GWPH stock surging near 30%.That in turn, would suggest likely significant upside from current levels for GWPH stock.\n\t\n\t\tSource: Shutterstock\n\tConsidering that solar power actually is gaining an increasing share of the U.S. market, in particular, it\u2019s surprising that solar stocks including \u00a0(NASDAQ:) actually haven\u2019t done all that well.

Still, demand for CSIQ equipment is growing, the stock isn\u2019t terribly highly valued, and it\u2019s lagged of late while FSLR, in particular, has risen.Solar stocks are likely to stay choppy for a while, but CSIQ should have some room to run if it can get through the second half of the year.\n\t\n\t\tSource: \n\t\u00a0(NYSE:) is on the move again.

And with SUP one of the more indebted companies in the sector, both factors have had an amplified impact on Superior\u2019s share price.But there\u2019s a reason to see a reversal as well, which is what makes SUP one of the smart stocks to buy. Near-term auto sales may be coming down, particularly in the U.S.Last year\u2019s acquisition of European supplier UNIWHEELS improved Superior\u2019s position overseas. And there is room to improve execution, and hopefully, margins, going forward.SUP does have potential downside risk, particularly if global macro concerns arise, pressuring auto sales and\u00a0dropping SUP earnings further. But for contrarians who think the auto parts selloff is overdone, SUP is one of the more intriguing plays.\n\t\n\t\tSource: \n\t(NYSE:) is another of the growth stocks to buy with a high valuation and a big opportunity.

That's because when a new technology -- like the smartphone, for example -- takes off, it can have truly transformational effects. But some much-hyped innovations also flop spectacularly, which can leave investors skeptical when the buzz begins for the next \"next big thing.\"When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), though, investors would be wise to take the hype seriously. AI-powered tech is already all around us, with everyone from automakers to tech giants to data security companies using it to boost their businesses.If you're dubious about investing based on the long-term growth potential of AI, consider these five ways the technology is transforming the industries around it.Image source: Getty Images.A report from PwC estimates that artificial intelligence will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy about a decade from now. But what does that mean, exactly?The analysis forecasts that AI will make companies more efficient, and allow them to introduce new products across a wide range of sectors including healthcare, automotive, financial services, retail, communications, manufacturing, energy, and transportation. The cost savings from applying AI to older systems, as well as revenues from new services and hardware, underlay that massive potential.And while many are concerned because AI will eliminate jobs, that's only half the story. While AI is on track to eliminate 1.8 million U.S. jobs next year, it will also  2.3 million, , according to research firm  Among the most significant beneficiaries of this growing technology will be the semiconductor industry. The AI chip market is expected to reach $91.2 billion just six years from now.  . The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are being used more and more by some of the world's leading tech companies to boost their servers' ability to process image and speech information quickly. The pharmaceutical industry is using its computing power to help find new cures for diseases. And NVIDIA is building systems to handle the complex data processing required by autonomous vehicles. The company is already knee-deep into AI chips, and management believes that its total addressable market for them will reach $50 billion by 2023.Autonomous vehicles are moving from science fiction to everyday reality, and the powerful AI chips mentioned above are integral to that transition. Self-driving cars using the AI tech of 's   Waymo subsidiary have already racked up 10 million autonomous miles.The company was one of the first to launch a (limited)  last year. Waymo plans to expand the service this year. It's also testing ways to use its autonomous vehicle tech to  and could potentially license it out to other companies.And Waymo is hardly the only company making significant moves in this space. '  self-driving vehicle subsidiary, Cruise Automation, plans to launch an autonomous ride-sharing service this year as well. Illustrating just how serious GM is about the self-driving market, the company said recently that it would  to about 2,000 by the end of this year.In 2040, 16% of all new vehicles sold annually will be autonomous, predicts , which is why everyone from automakers to chip companies to the incumbent ride-sharing leaders is working on developing this tech now.AI isn't just about cool new tech gadgets. The tech is also being used to make existing systems more efficient. And in the case of data sorting, it can make it easier than ever to protect and share sensitive information.Data security company   helps companies collect and categorize data using machine learning -- a subset of AI. The company says that it uses machine learning to \"get deeper insights\" from data than its customers could without it. This should allow them to  from the mountains of raw data they produce.Spunk's machine learning services are already helping its customers, and with companies collecting and creating ever-larger amounts of data, such tools will only become more important.Cloud-computing services from some of the world's biggest tech companies rely on artificial intelligence.  , which at 32% has the the largest share of the cloud-computing market,  in a host of its cloud products.For example, the company offers speech recognition and text translation services through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Why does this matter? Because the cloud computing market will be worth $278 billion by 2021, and whichever company has the lead with its AI services will hold a clear advantage.But Amazon is also embedding AI into nearly every aspect of its retail business; among other things, machine learning fuels the company's fraud detection and content personalization efforts. It's also used to analyze churn information, and it helps Amazon optimize its logistics. In combination, this helps Amazon maintain its dominance of the U.S. e-commerce market, where it accounts for more than 50% of all sales.Artificial intelligence is already here, and the market for the technology is growing quickly. So forward-looking investors should consider what the above companies are doing in this space. Over the next few years, even more businesses will be talking about how AI is transforming their industries, and how they're tapping the technology to keep up with competitors.Each of the major companies discussed above is already using AI to extend its dominance in its respective business. Whichever companies turn out to be the biggest winners, the level of commitment to AI by these giants should put to rest any suggestion that it's just an overhyped tech fad.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There's no doubt  , but they won't be the only ones.If you're looking for a few companies that are using AI to boost their businesses -- but are off the well-worn AI path -- you may want to consider what  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NASDAQ: NTNX) , and  (NASDAQ: Z) (NASDAQ: ZG) are doing with AI.Image source: Getty Images.Splunk is a hybrid cloud-computing platform company that helps businesses collect and categorize their data so they can better understand how to use it. Think of it this way: Companies are generating so much data from their customers that they're having a hard time making sense of it all. And Splunk's AI-powered platform helps address that.Splunk has used machine-learning data -- a type of AI -- to make sense of businesses's big data for several years. The company's CEO said back in 2016:To stay ahead of its competition, Splunk has frequently  , including machine-learning company SignalSense late in 2017 and VictorOps last year. So far, the company's moves have paid off: In the most recent quarter, its software sales were up 42% from the year-ago quarter, and total revenue jumped 35%.Splunk's shares are up about 24% over the past 12 months -- with the most recent jump coming when the company's management  -- but investors know there's likely some volatility ahead for the company as it continues to carve out its niche in the hybrid AI/cloud-computing space.Like Splunk, Nutanix offers its customer a hybridization of cloud-computing service that can be controlled by a company's own hardware. This mix allows Nutanix to provide a unique way to tap into artificial intelligence that sifts through data at its source (a business's private cloud) and in the public cloud at the same time.This type of approach to processing data is likely to become more important as businesses generate gobs of data on their own and require a robust AI system to help them effectively use it.Nutanix has been focused on earning more revenue from recurring subscription sales, and in the most recent quarter, the enterprise cloud-computing company made huge progress on that front, with subscription revenue up 112%. The company says 57% of its billings now come from subscriptions.Nutanix's stock is  , and its share price is down about 20% over the past 12 months, following a decline after the company released its second-quarter results. But investors should know that the company is continually gaining customers, increasing its subscription revenue, and improving its gross margins to boot. In the second quarter, gross margins reached an impressive 76.8%, up from 63.5% in the year-ago quarter. And Nutanix now has 12,410 customers, with 920 additions in the most recent quarter.Zillow may seem like the odd man out in this group of AI tech stocks, but one of the reasons Zillow is the premier online source for homeowners and sellers is because of the company's use of AI.For years, the company has incorporated machine-learning algorithms into nearly every part of its platform, particularly for its Zestimate calculator -- which gives an estimated value for each home on its site.While the company has made improvements to Zestimate calculations for years, Zillow launched an artificial intelligence competition two years ago with a $1 million prize to anyone who could improve its algorithm. In January, it announced a winner. The company said the winning team used \"sophisticated machine learning techniques, including using deep neural networks to directly estimate home values and remove outlier data points that fed into their algorithm\" that improved on Zillow's current Zestimates by 13%.Aside from its Zestimate, the company also uses AI to find homes an online user may want to see, based on other houses they've looked at already, even if they fall outside of the users' initial search filters.Zillow doesn't make money from AI, of course, but it is a foundation of the company's technology across its  . The company now has 157 million unique monthly users across all of its companies, and it brought in $365.3 million in sales in the most recent quarter, up 29% year over year. With AI already at the core of how the company runs its business, investors can expect Zillow to continue tapping more sophisticated machine-learning and neural networks to improve its home listings.These stocks are just a snapshot of how companies are using AI to make their businesses better for their customers and more efficient overall. As artificial intelligence grows, investors can expect even more off-the-beaten-path companies to look to AI for more growth. In fact,  estimates that AI will create $3.9 trillion in business-related value for companies by 2022. All of this means investors would be wise to take notice of this trend now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Stretching out to 2025, some of these big-name tech stocks begin to look very attractive indeed - especially at current price levels.In order to pinpoint which tech stocks will be leading the way seven years from now, I turned to a recent report from RBC Capital. Its \"Imagine 2025\" portfolio selects the tech stocks the firm believes will be winning on a long-term basis. \"We believe the following names are best positioned to outperform over a seven-year time horizon through 2025\" writes the firm.What does this mean for now?

This is with a $1,347 average analyst price target (27% upside potential).\"AMZN and GOOGL, in particular, appear to have invested the most in AI competencies and have the Big Data access and Compute Power infrastructure to benefit most from AI and ML developments\" writes RBC Capital.And Google has an extra string on its bow: its self-driving car unit Waymo. Alphabet most recently disclosed that Waymo reached the 10 million miles of autonomous vehicle driving milestone.\"GOOGL appears particularly well situated to lead autonomous vehicle innovations, given its substantial investments in Waymo autonomous vehicle technology\" cheers the firm.Luckily for Alphabet, RBC believes autonomous vehicles will be arguably one of the biggest applications of AI.Interested in GOOGL stock?

However he says Nvidia remains \"a top play on secular themes\" in AI, gaming and autonomous vehicles. He tells investors to \"buy the confession.\" Indeed his $246 price target suggests near-60% upside potential from current levels.\"While there are no guarantees of a winner in the AI race, we think Nvidia is well ahead of its peers and is continuing to gain traction due primarily to the value of Cuda software\" says RBC Capital. It estimates over one million engineers working with Cuda and calls it \"the secret sauce that underlies the entire ecosystem.\" Source: ShutterstockYou probably aren't surprised to see  (NASDAQ:  ) on this list. The ecommerce company is consistently innovating for the future, be it through acquisitions, technology or entering new markets.One interesting advancement for the company is in the field of robotics. \"Amazon appears particularly well situated to lead robotics innovations, given its ongoing investment in Kiva logistics robots\" points out RBC Capital.The company already deploys something to the tune of 100K Kiva robots, basically a robot army. And it's now looking increasingly likely that a very large percentage of Amazon's distribution workforce will be complemented with these robots by 2025.As RBC concludes, the impact of this should be greater operational efficiency for AMZN stock.Another interesting trend to consider: AI-powered Voice Recognition will likely improve significantly from current levels, allowing even better use of internet apps via voice commands. Again, Amazon should be a major beneficiary of this trend.Notably, AMZN boasts one of the best ratings on the Street. Out of 37 analysts polled, only one is sidelined on the stock.

Making sense of the growing amount of data the digital world is generating is a top priority for many enterprises, helping with a diverse set of needs like streamlining operations and cybersecurity. Splunk recently wrapped up its 2019 fiscal year (which ended at the end of January 2019), demonstrating once again that investing in it is one of the best ways to cash in on the boom of digital data.Splunk's double-digit growth last year was driven by businesses' continued interest in making use of the otherwise unusable and unwieldy data they generate, but Splunk did its fair share to make the most of the movement as well. Several acquisitions were made, most notably a  to boost Splunk's presence in that fast-changing industry; new and updated product rollouts were also made for things like cloud computing and Internet of Things device tracking; and more than 2,000 apps from strategic partners were available on Splunkbase (an app store of sorts for companies) to extend the usefulness of the data analytics software for specific business needs.The result? Another year of massive sales expansion.\n  \nYOY = year over year. Ppt = percentage point.

As a result, Splunk's management team believes it is still in the early innings of its journey. With the new year under way, the company is closing in on some important milestones.Image source: Getty Images.Some investors may shy away from Splunk because of the large and widening operating losses the company is running. Most of that is due to elevated sales and marketing expense, as well as research and development -- which both increased 32% and 47%, respectively, last year. CEO Doug Merritt  : \"We're early in our journey and are investing for scale and growth. We're delivering high value to our customers, who are expanding their adoption of Splunk as their platform for data analytics both on-prem and in the cloud.\"Thus, the big data company is keeping its foot on the gas and worrying about profits later, although adjusted earnings were in the black and notched a 39% increase after backing out share-based compensation and other one-time items. All that spending is expected to equate to another big year, including Splunk reaching its longtime goal of $2 billion in annual sales by the 2020 fiscal year. Specifically, management said it expects $2.2 billion in revenue in the year ahead and adjusted operating profit margins coming in at 14%.As the world goes digital, big data is only getting bigger -- which means making sense of that data is also growing.

To fully unlock all the benefits of digitization, organizing all of that information into usable form and analyzing it in an efficient manner is a must.Enter  (NASDAQ: SPLK) , a data-parsing software service that delivers usable insights into digital systems -- everything from websites and apps to servers and mobile devices. The company has said that the amount of data production each year will be 44 times greater in 2020 than it was just a decade ago. With the amount of digital information booming, Splunk has been growing by leaps and bounds.Data by  .Though Splunk's stock has notched strong returns the last few years, many investors have steered clear because of steep losses. Even as the company has grown -- revenues have doubled several times over the last five years to $1.8 billion last year -- the amount of red at the bottom of the operating statement has also grown. During the recently completed  (the 12 months ended Jan. 31, 2019), net losses were $275.6 million, up from $190.2 million the year prior even though sales went up 38% over that same stretch of time.The reason for those losses, though, is intentionally elevated expenses to foster the most growth possible. Splunk notched big annual increases in spending last year, especially in research on new products and headcount to support sales.\n  \nYOY = year over year. Data source: Splunk.Given the inordinate amount of expense at Splunk, some math can give some perspective. Adjusted profit -- which backs out a massive $441.9 million in stock-based compensation to employees last year and $394.9 million on  -- changes a steep loss into a profit of $202.1 million. Free cash flow (money left over after basic operations and capital expenditures are paid for, a more accurate portrayal of cash-based profitability) was $273.3 million in the 2019 fiscal year, a 13% increase over last year. As a result, price to free cash flow currently sits at 72.8. Paying nearly three-quarters of a century's worth of profits is ludicrously expensive, right? That's what the stock is trading for nonetheless. Here's why.Image source: Getty Images.Splunk has the accelerator mashed to the floor to the detriment of the bottom line. What's the upshot for shareholders? Gross profit margin on services is enviably high at Splunk -- to the tune of 97.8% on the large licensing revenues segment and 58.3% on maintenance and services.With those kinds of profit margins and a fast-growing industry around data analytics, it makes sense that the company would try to scoop up all the sales it possibly could. It's all about growing now and worrying about profits later. And there's plenty of growth left in the tank. Splunk's software has a myriad of uses like cybersecurity, website traffic pattern analysis, monitoring of machines and devices connected to networks, and data center management, to name just a few. Headed into a new fiscal year, management expects total revenues to increase to $2.20 billion, another 22% increase over last year. That's a slowdown from recent rates -- although Splunk has a history of underpromising and overdelivering -- but the company is beginning to ease off the throttle and grow the bottom line. Adjusted operating profit margin should come in at 14%, up from 12.7% last year.Still, that's just a glimpse of Splunk's potential payoff given how fast the digital world is expanding and all of the new data getting created that businesses need help making sense of. Granted, Splunk stock isn't for everyone. Since it doesn't run an unadjusted profit, variance in its top-line growth trajectory will send share prices on a volatile ride that only the steeliest of investors should think about owning.

After the company reported its Q3 results in December, BB stock fell sharply, reaching a 30-month low of $6.57. Source: ShutterstockSince then, BB stock has rebounded, along with the market, reaching nearly $9.50 before pulling back in recent days along with most other tech stocks.BlackBerry stock has several positive catalysts which suggest that BB will react more positively after Friday's results. Specifically, for the first time in many years, the company's quarterly revenue is expected to rise year-over-year, and CEO John Chen  that the company's annual top line should soon exceed $1 billion. Additionally, there are indications that the company's government business is continuing to ramp up, and its revenue from its QNX operating system should continue to rise meaningfully.On the negative side, however, BB 's costs from its acquisition of AI cybersecuity company Cylance will likely weigh on its profits and gross margins, while reducing its cash. Moreover, BlackBerry's business with the government may have been hurt by last quarter's long government shutdown.BlackBerry stock bears could seize on and emphasize those negative metrics, causing BB stock price to drop in the near term. However, over the long term, BB stock remains well positioned to benefit from increased demand for cybersecurity and the proliferation of autonomous vehicles and connected devices.Here are three important areas that the owners of BlackBerry stock should keep their eyes on when BB reports its results.Earlier this month, Chen said that BlackBerry's revenue from software will exceed $1 billion in 2020. The owners of BB stock should be interested to see if he reiterates that guidance on Friday.Assuming that BB's revenue from software comes in at $1.1 billion, and that its operating margin is the same 12% in fiscal 2020 that it reported last quarter, then BlackBerry's operating profit from software would be $132 million. If we throw in another $18 million of operating profit from its non-software businesses with the same operating margin, BB's earnings per share, excluding other items, would likely be at least 28 cents for the year. Applying a 25x multiple on that EPS would make BlackBerry stock worth $7 per share. Following the Cylance deal, the company still has $1.6 billion of net cash and short-term investments, or $3 per share, raising the value of BB stock to $10.00 per share, versus the current BB stock price of about $9 per share.But of course, BlackBerry stock could be worth much more if investors become very excited about its growth and its future prospects. For example,  (NYSE:  ) has a price-sales ratio of 25, while  (NASDAQ:  has a price-sales ratio of 19. If BlackBerry stock traded at those valuations, based on 2020 revenue of $1.2 billion, it would be worth $55 per share or $22 per share, respectively.There are multiple indications that BlackBerry's business with governments is continuing to grow and may be accelerating. For example,  that it had won two major contracts  , although it did not disclose the amounts of those deals. If BB is winning new deals with NATO, there's a good chance that it's continuing to expand the revenue it receives from multiple Western European NATO members.Moreover, earlier this month, the company announced that  a new subsidiary, called BlackBerry Government Solutions, that will be focused on serving the federal government.In the past, I've pointed out that the U.S. government has embraced the use of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, and that the acquisition of Cylance consequently leaves BlackBerry well positioned to win additional, lucrative cybersecurity deals from the U.S. federal government. Such deals will be positive for BlackBerry stock.Also positive for BlackBerry and BB stock is the fact that President Trump now looks poised to stay in office through at least January 2021. Not only has the Trump administration placed a heavy emphasis on cybersecurity, but a company owned by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has partnered with BB in the past.Chen has said that the acquisition of Cylance could help accelerate the QNX operating system's top-line growth.Meanwhile, revenue stemming from design wins for the operating system in 2016 and 2017 should have increased further over the last quarter. BlackBerry has also indicated that QNX has been incorporated into many other connected products. The company's FY20 guidance will likely be boosted by the additional growth of QNX in autonomous vehicles and other connected devices.BlackBerry's results and guidance should be lifted by several items, including increased revenue from QNX and government deals. However, costs from the Cylance deal and delays in transactions with the U.S. government as a result of the federal shutdown may weigh on BlackBerry's Q4 results. Over the longer term, however, BB and BlackBerry stock should be boosted by the proliferation of QNX, increased demand for its cybsersecurity offerings and the company's overall top-line and bottom-line growth.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" incurred second-quarter fiscal 2019 loss of 23 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents.

Not only has the stock nearly doubled in value over the last 24 months, but the company has also been on an acquisition spree. The cybersecurity outfit made its largest yet just ahead of its 2019 fiscal year second quarter, fast-tracking its move into artificial intelligence capabilities as customers deal with increasingly complex cyber threats from the bad guys.Palo Alto Networks recently announced its intent to purchase privately held Demisto, based in Cupertino, California. Total consideration is $560 million payable in cash and stock, an impressive sum given that the smaller security company was founded less than four years ago in 2015.That's the fifth buy of a smaller peer Palo Alto has made since the beginning of 2017. The total price tag is over $1 billion, a big chunk of change considering Palo Alto's current enterprise value is $21 billion. It's been money well spent, though, helping the company expand beyond its legacy of providing firewalls (a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to a network). A few years ago, booming growth in cloud computing necessitated the expansion in that direction. The result was a 29% and 47% increase in revenue and adjusted earnings during the  , and revenue and adjusted earnings so far in 2019 are up another 31% and 48%.\n  \nData source: Palo Alto Networks.Though Palo Alto has been shelling out big sums for smaller rivals, cybersecurity is a fast-evolving industry. Demisto will be an especially ambitious purchase, but CEO Nikesh Arora said the small firm is expected to post at least $50 million in sales this year. That's huge growth for a four-year-old endeavor.Image source: Getty Images.And that's exactly why Palo Alto was willing to pony up. Demisto is a specialist in security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) services, an emerging segment in the cybersecurity industry. Big data company  (NASDAQ: SPLK) also made several buyouts last year in the same area. Automated responses to digital threats powered by machine learning (a type of artificial intelligence) is an increasingly important need for organizations as they navigate the digital age, and Palo Alto wants to accelerate its strategy in AI and automation.It's yet another evolution in the digital space as companies around the globe slowly migrate away from legacy operations. Over the last two years, Palo Alto has transformed itself into a diverse provider of security services to protect that transformation. First was a focus on  , and now Demisto helps the company's customers learn from its data and automatically respond to anomalies. In response to the ever-shifting landscape, management said during its second-quarter  that more acquisitions could be forthcoming. It's a good move to capture market share as the industry responds to nefarious activity and changing needs from its customers -- one that Palo Alto can afford, as it has over $2.8 billion in cash and short-term investments on the books.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As of mid-day Monday, a basket of SaaS stocks had declined by more than 4%. (NASDAQ:  ), an SaaS provider, wasn't immune to the selling, as SPLK stock fell 5% on the day. Another leading cloud-computing company,  (NASDAQ:  ),fell 5% as well, while SaaS company  (NYSE:  ) retreated 2.7%.This turn in sector sentiment came at a terrible time for SPLK stock. Just last week, SPLK beat analysts' earnings expectations and raised its guidance for the full year. Its numbers looked amazing. And yet, Splunk stock traded essentially flat following its earnings and fell sharply to start the week. Is it time to buy the dip in Splunk stock yet, or would it be prudent to let SPLK stock continue to correct?Splunk has been one of the most consistent and impressive large-cap tech growth companies in recent memory. Its numbers are truly mind-blowing. Over the past five years, SPLK's average compounded annual revenue growth rate was 45%. In 2014, the company produced just $451 million of revenue. For the most recent 12 months, that figure quadrupled to more than $1.8 billion of sales.Additionally, while SPLK has not been very profitable yet, analysts see the tipping point coming soon. On average, analysts forecast that the company's earnings per share will reach $1.62 over the next year, and its earnings are expected to grow at an average annual rate of more than 30% over the next five years.Perhaps most incredibly, even as Splunk's revenues have gone through the roof, its growth rate hasn't slowed down. Normally, companies decelerate as they get bigger, but Splunk is still finding plenty of opportunities to grow. It's far more impressive when a company with $1.8 billion of revenue is growing its top line 40% each year than when a firm with a few hundred million dollars of annual revenue is accomplishing the same feat.Splunk's earnings report drew nearly universal praise from analysts.  , which has long been a Splunk bull, raised its price target on SPLK stock from $137 to $157 following the earnings release. The firm suggested that Splunk is even stronger than it may seem.  , not to be outdone, lifted its price target on SPLK by $20 to $165 per share.Mark Moerdler of  raised his price target from $119 to $131. He left a \"neutral\" rating on the shares. In a moment of humility, he noted that \"we obviously got off the bus too early on this one.\" Even  , which is sticking with its \"sell\" call on SPLK stock, had to give credit where it was due. Citi recommended selling Splunk stock last year as it felt that the company probably wouldn't grow much more. After Splunk's recent results, however, Citigroup raised its price target on SPLK stock from $98 to $112.The key issue facing SPLK stock is that Wall Street is fully aware of its great growth outlook. As a result, SPLK stock was trading around 13 times its sales following its most recent earnings report. That's really pricey, even for a company with phenomenal sales growth. Traditionally, as a rule of thumb, investors need to be careful about paying more than ten times sales for even the fastest-growing tech companies.Often, when a company reports stellar earnings results and the stock doesn't move, it is simply because the Street's expectations were high before the results were released.If SPLK's earnings had come in below expectations, it probably would have plunged 10% or more, as investors were really confident that Splunk would continue to grow rapidly. With the market already pricing in greatness, it is hard for Splunk to surprise to the upside, even with outstanding results.If SPLK stock trades at ten times its sales, and its 2019 sales meet expectations, SPLK stock will rise to nearly $150, considerably higher than today's price.Thus, for a patient investor, the selloff of Splunk stock following its great earnings could be a golden opportunity. As long as the company maintains its stunning sales growth, SPLK stock will rise much higher over time. SPLK stock may not rally in the short-term, given macro headwinds, but the value of SPLK will keep increasing, along with the company's booming revenue forecasts.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["xpected Earnings Release: 02/28/2019, After-hoursAvg.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of software that helps companies collect and analyze internal data is expected to pos  of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +105.4%.Revenues are expected to be $560.66 million, up 33.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Splunk, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Splunk will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Splunk would pos  of $0.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.38, delivering a surprise of +22.58%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Splunk doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

The potential to reshape how people work makes them intriguing growth stocks that ought to be on everyone's radar right now, so we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to take a closer look. Read on to find out: Although Smartsheet isn't widely known to most investors, it's increasingly recognized by companies looking to boost worker productivity and accountability.  ,  , and  are only a few of the big companies using Smartsheet's collaboration tools to help structure project workflows.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.In its most  , Smartsheet's sales grew 59% year over year to $47 million and its dollar-based retention rate was 132% because few customers unsubscribed and more customers increased their spending. There were over 4.5 million Smartsheet users last quarter, up from 3.6 million users when Smartsheet filed for its initial public offering last year. The number of big spenders on its solutions is going up, too. Last quarter, Smartsheet says 360 companies spent over $50,000, up 148% year over year, and 127 spent more than $100,000 per year.The potential for Smartsheet to disrupt project management, productivity, and collaboration markets shouldn't be underestimated. Those markets were worth $21.4 billion market in 2017 and they're expected to grow to $31.6 billion in 2021, according to International Data Corporation.Importantly, the company's customers appear happy. Exiting Smartsheet's recent customer conference, over 97% of attendees said they'd recommend Smartsheet's solution. Improvements to dashboards, how people assign workloads, time-sensitivity tools, and visualization should help keep satisfaction high while new, premium tools expand revenue at existing customers.Smartsheet's still losing money, though. Its adjusted loss was $0.09 per share last quarter. But it's predicting rapid growth will continue and it's got $212 million in cash on the books. Its full fiscal 2019 year guidance is for sales of between $174.6 million to $175.6 million, which works out to a 57% to 58% year-over-year increase.Given the size of its addressable market, the importance of collaboration tools to an increasingly remote workforce, and its success so far, this is fast becoming one of my favorite growth stocks. After having a year's worth of gains erased at the end of 2018, shares of big data parsing company Splunk have  since the start of the new year -- and for good reason. The company is one of the fastest-growing software providers out there, riding a wave of digital transformation as businesses around the globe try to make better use of their data and streamline operations.But after a more than 40% rally in the last year, is the stock still worth a look? For long-term investors who don't mind some volatility, absolutely. Through the first three quarters of 2018, revenue was up 39%, led by the important licensed software segment, which carried a whopping 97.3% gross profit margin. When the company reports its full-year 2018 revenue at the end of February, management said to expect a 37% increase over 2017. Preliminary estimates for fiscal year 2020 (the 12 months ending on Jan. 31, 2020) are for $2.15 billion in revenue, another 24% increase over the current year.If Splunk can pull that off, that means there's plenty of upside left for this growth stock. There's a good chance that happens, especially given the strong demand for the company's software services, which include data analysis,  device management, and cybersecurity threat detection and investigation. Perhaps the biggest area of growth, though, will be the bottom line.Splunk currently isn't profitable, running at a loss of $278 million in 2018 at las  . Much of that has to do with the company's aggressive investment in its future as it spent $311 million on research and development and $726 million on sales and marketing through the third quarter. However, adjusting for those expenses, full-year operating margin should be between 11.5% and 12%, capped off with an expected 25% to 26% operating margin in the fourth quarter. Thus, as the company reaches a larger scale, profits will be forthcoming. That should provide plenty of fuel for the stock in the years ahead.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Revenues of $1.22 billion grew 0.7% year over year and outpaced the consensus mark of $1.18 billion. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the company expects revenues in the range of $1.19-$1.22 billion and earnings per share in the range of 37-41 cents.

Earnings per share climbed 37.8% from the year-ago quarter while revenues jumped 35%. For the first quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $198-$200 million and earnings per share in the range of 31-35 cents. For the full year, Proofpoint expects revenues of $870-$874 million and earnings per share of $1.60-$1.67.Check Point Software Technologies  posted earnings per share of $1.68 and revenues of $526 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63 and $517 million, respectively.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 29 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Splunk Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $98.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $170.00. The standard deviation is $13.757.But the whole reason to look at the  SPLK price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SPLK crossing above that average target price of $129.72/share, investors in SPLK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $129.72 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Splunk Inc:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

Investors care most about the forward guidance. This is obviously wrong since in most cases, management of any sort is simply being cautious given the geopolitical headline threats that sill loom.Click to Enlarge Source: Case in point, last night  (NASDAQ:  ) reported earnings and FireEye stock is falling 12% on the news. This is even though management beat revenues and earnings expectations. The problem was that they lowered their forward guidance. Traders want to be wowed and this one lacked luster.Luckily for investors, FEYE stock came into the event from a position of strength and up 14% year-to-date, which is more than the  . But not all credit falls to it. The whole sector is also up and some even more.  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) to name two are also up 22% and 15% for the same period.Wall Street is gaga over cybersecurity. Incidents like the one  (NASDAQ:  ) had last year raised the overall concern on the threats to extreme levels. Ten years ago when we barely used technology, this wouldn't have been much of an issue. When we were still using low BAUD dial-up modems, all we needed to do is guard our passwords.Now our providers require us to use two-step verification codes, thumbprints and soon ocular verification. And even then, we won't be 100% secure. I am realistic about my expectations. I know that if they want my data, they are going to get it. So I can only slow them down.Data privacy and network security have become an absolute obsession everywhere. Corporations have no choice but to spend now more than ever on their system integrity. Otherwise, they leave themselves vulnerable to huge penalties and legislative scrutiny.  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) recent suffered a multi-billion dollar penalty from the European Union.This ramp in demand for electronic safety caused a run-up into cybersecurity stocks like FEYE. Consequently, valuations are high. Most are still losing money but investors don't care.But I do. These valuations are too high for me to chase the massive run-ups. Dips like today's dip in FireEye stock could offer points of entry for fast traders or those who want in on the sector.These are momentum stocks, so they will rarely give us a clear point of entry. They run too fast in either direction making it difficult to get on board. Just since last October, FEYE stock has had five 20% moves and it's working on its sixth today.So yes, technically this would make for a decent entry point for a swing trade. But not necessarily for a fundamental investment. For those who are looking for a longer-term thesis, these stocks are still unproven. Nevertheless, given that it's on a 12% drop and since management didn't report a major systemic problem for FEYE, it is worthy of a stab.I am not dissing the company. I acknowledge the need for the FEYE services. We now rely more on technology and connectivity than ever. We knowingly or indirectly put all of our vital information online several times per day. It is only a matter of time before we fall victim to a breach.But just because there is demand for FireEye services doesn't mean I should be blind the fundamentals aside. If I am forced to buy an internet security stock to invest in, FEYE would be on my list. But in these uncertain times, I'd prefer to risk my money on surer bets.If I bet on  (NASDAQ:  ) for example, all I need to fret is the health of the general market. I am confident that the AAPL fundamentals will stand for years to come. I know there is value below, so I can ignore temporary drawdowns.When holding a frothy stock like FireEye stock, I need to worry not only about the market in general but also about its own success inside it. So I would be what they call a weak hand, meaning that I would stop myself out of the stock much faster than I would in AAPL or GOOGL.Why be so careful? FireEye stock has seen better days. It is 80% below its highs of 2014 so clearly things can go wrong. So I would classify going long today as a trade not an investment and it would be imperative to establish a clear stop out point. This varies among investors as we have different risk tolerances.Technically, the $15 area has served as support on the last few draw-downs so it is important that they hold here. Below that sits the February 2018 lows of $13.60.In summary, FEYE is a decent stock and it can make for a nice trade on this dip. But for my portfolio and in this jittery market that has so many deadlines looming, I'd rather wait for better timing. I'd feel more comfortable when the political environment is more stable. So I will let this falling knife hit the floor without trying to catch it.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["What will the software market look like by the end of 2019? RBC Capital has delved into its crystal ball to find out. The firm has just released a report highlighting five potentially transformational software deals that could take place this year.In fact there's already strong momentum in place. In the last six months of 2018, 14 software transactions occurred with a value of over $1 billion. Most notably,  (NYSE:  ) snapped up RedHat for a whopping $34 billion in October 2018. Could we now be building towards something even bigger?Bear this in mind, the sheer amount of dry powder (read:money) available is truly astounding. RBC Capital has calculated that the total cash available for a deal exceeds $1 trillion. That figure could go even higher if we add sovereign funds to the equation.For example, if we zero in on some of the large-cap tech vendors, then  (NASDAQ:  ) has a whopping $106.4 billion at its disposal in gross cash and marketable securities.  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) both have even more available at $137.9 billion and $237.1 billion respectively.Plus there are non-traditional buyers of software such as  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ), which are now showing increased interest in the space.Let's now dive into five potential deals, ranked in order of highest probability: Source: ShutterstockWord on the Street: the hybrid-cloud market could be worth more than $60 billion by 2021. And one of the key players in the field is  (NASDAQ:  ) - a leading provider of hyperconverged infrastructure solutions.Would such a proposition appeal to tech heavyweight Alphabet? Its Google Cloud Platform () is the third-largest public-cloud vendor by revenue and has remained primarily cloud-native with smaller deals.By acquiring Nutanix, GCP would gain an enterprise software sales force and be able to leverage trends in hybrid-compute through the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Platform.Also keep an eye on  (NASDAQ:  ). CSCO is already in the Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HC) market, but adding Nutanix to its capabilities would catapult it to becoming a market leader.\"We believe that Nutanix could not only aid Cisco's traditional networking/hardware business, but it could also better position the company to sell more virtual firewalls (micro-segmentation)\" says RBC Capital.But is Nutanix even up for sale? The short answer is that yes - at the right price it could indeed be a willing seller, according to RBC Capital. If such a deal did go ahead, it could disrupt large vendors such as IBM/Red Hat, AWS/VMware and Microsoft Azure that are already fully vested in hybrid-compute.If you are thinking of investing in Nutanix, check out the stock's bullish 'Strong Buy' analyst consensus rating. That's with a $62 price target for 25% upside potential.\"We believe NTNX is well on the way to becoming the dominant private cloud infrastructure software resource manager, at the expense of VMware\" wrote Maxim Group's Nehal Chokshi (  ) earlier this month. His $72 price target indicates sizable upside potential of 46%. Want to learn more about Nutanix?  Source: If Cisco doesn't snap up Nutanix, then rapidly-growing  (NASDAQ:  ) could be in the cards. In essence, Splunk turns machine data into answers. It captures and uses real-time data to generate graphs, reports, alerts and dashboards.Given the importance of data and data analytics, a Cisco-Splunk tie-up would create a premier data management platform.What's more with ~50% of Splunk's use cases being security-related deals, buying Splunk would also get Cisco deeper into security, which is something the company has talked about in the past.Right now, Cisco has $43 billion of cash and investments on its balance sheet and has deployed more than $8 billion for software assets since 2017 (the largest being AppDynamics for $3.9 billion and Duo Security for $2.3 billion).So is Splunk a willing seller? \"Ultimately, we believe Splunk could see additional leverage in being able to tap into a larger customer base while continuing to sell more products into existing customers\" points out RBC.Such a deal would primarily disrupt vendors like  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) that could also be interested in logging or APM technologies.From an investor perspective, Splunk scores a bullish 'Strong Buy' consensus. That's with a $135 average analyst price target. \"SPLK's unique platform has positioned it to leverage global data growth into steady revenue growth\" comments Oppenheimer's Shaul Eyal (  ).  Source: Another potential stock on Google's wish list:  (NYSE:  ). Canada-based SHOP is an e-commerce platform. It allows anyone to easily sell online, at a retail location, and everywhere in between.So why would GOOGL want to buy SHOP?\"At a very high level, the Internet remains over-indexed to advertising vs. commerce, and so in the long-run, we believe Internet advertising heavyweights will want to capture more commerce share in order to grow\" explains RBC Capital. Indeed, 5% of global GDP is eCommerce but 75% of Internet GDP is advertising.Plus although Google monetizes eCommerce through advertising, monetization could be much higher owning an eCommerce platform. Moreover it would also carry network effects like merchant-ad placement advantages. (NASDAQ:  ) is also a potential contender for SHOP. \"It is possible that Amazon could be viewed as an interested party, as it has historically acquired high-quality assets (Whole Foods, etc.) and Shopify and would enable it to consolidate the eCommerce market, though regulatory concerns could run high in this case\" writes the investment bank.Overall, SHOP has received only buy ratings from analysts in the last three months. They have a $168 average price target.In particular, D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte (  ) has just upgraded SHOP from Hold to Buy. He calls it an \"exceptionally\" well-run company with the potential for open-ended growth.  (NYSE:  ) cloud platform streamlines how work gets done. It's a sizable acquisition target - with a market cap already at $34 billion. That's with a $10 billion revenue goal over the next five years.\"We think ServiceNow could be one of the more disruptive acquisition candidates as it provides not only a service-automation platform but also a cloud application development platform\" says RBC Capital.Such an opportunity could attract the attention of the market's biggest players - Google or Microsoft for example.Google Cloud Platform could make sense as a buyer because it would gain an enterprise sales force and it would have an anchor cloud-application platform that would differentiate it from larger public-cloud rivals AWS and Microsoft Azure.At the same time Microsoft could use NOW to get more into service, which could be a nice complement to existing cloud applications such as Dynamics and to provide another cloud-application development platform to build out a broader and differentiated cloud application suite.Of course, the price needs to be right. \"We continue to think ServiceNow has the opportunity to become an even larger company on a stand-alone basis\" says RBC Capital. \"So, at first glance, we don't think it needs to sell, nor is it necessarily looking to sell. That said\u2026 we believe it could be sold if the price were right\" the firm concludes.Such a deal would most likely be the largest software acquisition to date, beating the $34 billion IBM/Red Hat deal.NOW has received only buy ratings from the Street in the last six months.  Source: Workday (NASDAQ:  ) is a provider of cloud-based human resources software. This includes business planning, financial management and human capital management.Ever since Microsoft bought LinkedIn, RBC has wondered whether MSFT will make a bigger push into Human Capital Management. And Workday would be a perfect fit.\"Workday would appear to be the most interesting asset given its win-rate in enterprise customers for core HCM and the potential to create a differentiated offering by tying LinkedIn data to the Workday Recruiting/HCM platform\" says RBC Capital.Furthermore, WDAY also brings with an enterprise-focused financials application. And Microsoft would also add another asset that can heavily leverage the Azure infrastructure.\"We have always believed that Workday would be a willing seller to a vendor that could accelerate the strategy to make enterprise software easier\" the firm tells investors.Right now, WDAY as a 'Moderate Buy' analyst consensus with a $163 average analyst price target. Monness' Brian White (  ) is the stock's biggest supporter (with a $185 price target).\"Overweight WDAY; it has no shortage of growth opportunities\" says the five-star analyst. Considering cloud financials is roughly a 2x larger TAM than HCM, Workday has a long growth runway ahead, White explains.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new March 22nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $117.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $125.98/share today.Because the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SPLK stock at the current price level of $125.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $127.00.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPLK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SPLK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $127.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $127.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Investors eager to find good artificial intelligence stocks can look beyond the major players and find cloud computing companies that are making big bets on AI, including  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NASDAQ: NTNX) , and  (NYSE: NEWR) . Each company's share price is up at least 30% over the past 12 months, and their AI ambitions are only just beginning.Image source: Getty Images.Splunk offers software solutions to companies looking to make sense of the data that they have and find ways to collect and categorize new data. The company has increasingly incorporated  , a type of artificial intelligence, across nearly all of its software products.Splunk's sales were up 40% in the most recent quarter, software revenue was up 49%, licensing sales jumped 44%, and the company added 500 new enterprise clients. Splunk's management is optimistic about the company's potential with its cloud AI services, and increased its total addressable market by $7 billion recently to $62 billion.The company believes that its top line will reach $2 billion next year, up from $944 million in 2017, and reach 20,000 customers. Splunk has  and while it's still unprofitable, investors should take note that the company is still at the beginning of its long-term prospects. Splunk is a leader in helping businesses use machine learning to collect and analyze data, and if the company continues on its current trajectory it could prove to be a wise investment bet.Nutanix calls itself an \"enterprise operating system\" company that allows its customers to benefit from public cloud computing features, but with the added ability to control their own hardware. It's this hybridization of the private cloud and the public cloud that allows Nutanix to uniquely benefit from artificial intelligence (AI). That's because AI data processing works best when computers can process information both at the source (i.e. servers sitting in an office) and from the cloud servers. Nutanix's software allows companies to do both at the same time, tapping into the ability to process AI data locally and from more robust cloud sources.Nutanix is already benefiting in this space, and  the company increased its software and support billings by 50% year over year. Additionally, the company's important subscription revenue skyrocketed 104% from the year-ago quarter. Nutanix is transitioning from its hardware business to focus on subscriptions, and the transition has already paid off, with 51% of first-quarter billings coming from recurring subscriptions.Investors should know that while Nutanix isn't profitable right now, its margins are moving in the right direction, and reached 76% in the first quarter, up from 61% in the first-quarter 2018. With the company's current sales growth, a customer list north of 10,000, and a massive opportunity in the growing AI cloud market, Nutanix has the potential to be a great long term play.Image source: Getty Images.New Relic's software offers its customers unique insights into how their apps are performing in something called the global application performance management market. The company calls itself a \"digital intelligence\" platform, and it is increasingly looking to artificial intelligence to make it smarter. New Relic says that its AI services sift through a company's internal data to find \"meaning and solutions.\"The company's cloud-based products have already attracted 17,000 customers, and its  . New Relic's sales were up 36% in the most recent quarter, and the company is increasing the ranks of its most-lucrative clients. For example, customers with annual contracts over $100,000 jumped 34% in second quarter.The global application performance management market is expected to be worth about $9 billion by 2023, and New Relic has already carved out its niche. The company's share price will likely face some volatility as New Relic grows, but for investors looking for a company that's combining cloud-computing with machine learning for apps, New Relic looks like a solid long-term AI play in the coming years.Investors who want to benefit from the rise of AI but also want to avoid some of the bigger tech companies should give the above stocks strong consideration.

And for good reason. Leaders like  (NYSE:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  ) have been dominant forces in the sector and have shaken-up their respective technology subsectors since the end of the great recession. The problem is, has we continue to focus on the FAANGs, plenty of other tech stocks have gone unnoticed. After all, there's more to the technology sector than just  (NASDAQ:  ).In fact, there's a lot more.Some of the best tech stocks continue to fly under the radar as the focus continues to be on FANG stocks. For investors, looking here could provide some of the best long-term growth potential around. but which firms have the goods to help you forget about the FANGs like  (NASDAQ:  ) and NFLX?Here are five tech stocks worth a look.Advertising today is nothing like an episode of  As various digital platforms have exploded in use, marketers and advertisers have been forced to adapt to the shifting landscape. Helping them adapt to that shift and target the right customer at the right time is  (NYSE:  ).The idea behind TTD is simple enough. Dubbed \"  ,\" Trade Desk will use high-speed computers and various algorithms to automate the process of ad buying in real time. By searching the nearly 20 digital-ad exchanges, TTD allows advertisers to instantly find exactly who they want to target their ad to - whether that's on their computer, smartphone or other devices. Trade Desk's programs are so fast and successful, they are able to place roughly 9 million ads per second through their online auctions.In the end, it creates a much more efficient and cost-effective way for companies to reach consumers.For TTD, this creates plenty of revenues and growth. As Trade Desk has been able to score more customers, the Trade desk saw its revenue jump by 50% year-over-year during the  . The best part of that jump was that two of firm's main growth engines - video and connected TV advertising - are just really getting started. That leaves plenty of room for TTD to continue its pace of huge revenue jumps. Even better, TTD stock is profitable.All in all, the Trade Desk has what it takes to be one of the best tech stocks outside the FANGs.Cloud-computing has really changed the way we function these days. So, naturally, tech stocks leading the way into the cloud are worthy FANG replacements. And  (NASDAQ:  ) maybe one of the best.Human Resources is full of tedious tasks such as changing ACH payroll information, filling out expense reports or signing up for a retirement/401k plan. Often these things get in the way of allowing the HR staff to do meaningful work. WDAY makes a variety of applications for small or large businesses to cover these tasks. The best part is, like many cloud computing firms, a business can add as little or as much as they like. And rather than purchasing the service, they pay a reoccurring fee.For Workday, this has all added up to some great growth.  , WDAY saw a huge 33.8% jump to its total revenues, while subscriptions revenues came in at $624.4 million - a 34.7% year-over-year jump. The best part is that its subscription revenue backlog - that is, sales that are not officially booked, but will be as because companies have signed up for multi-term products - came in at over $5.9 billion.With key high-margined products - such as WDAY's business intelligence offering, Prism Analytics - growing like weeds, the pace of revenues should continue. Moreover, it should allow Workday to finally move into the black when it comes to GAAP accounting standards.All in all, Workday is quickly becoming a go-to name in HR management. For investors, that makes one serious tech stock to have your portfolio.Want to forget the FANGs? A 278% return will help you do it. And that's just what investors in  (NASDAQ:  ) were treated to last year. That return was one of the best among all tech stocks - FANG's included. There's plenty of reasons why TWLO could see more gains ahead.Twilio designs cloud-based communications platforms that allow developers to send automated phone calls, text messages, and other communication functions. For example, when you're doing a bit of online shopping or banking and you see one of those chat boxes that allows you ask questions or find out more about a product or account, Twilio made that happen. The awesome part is that developers can simply take TWLO's APIs and apps, chuck them into their code and instantly get the ability to add these functions. TWLO  when consumers use the functions.And collect fees it does.As of the end of the third quarter, TWLO had roughly 61,000 different customers using their apps. Those customers have channeled revenue growth of 230% since Twilio when public back in 2016. Last quarter alone,  as both organic and new customer growth surged. And there's still plenty of room to grow across a variety of customers.Given the ease of TWLO's products and the continued growth potential, it's easy to see how the tech stock will a giant over the long haul. That's assuming it doesn't get bought out first.As technology has invaded our lives, we create a lot of data. In fact, we make so much of it, a new term \"Big Data\" was invented to describe the billions of gigabytes of info we generate. The problem for businesses is how to comprehend that data and dig into it to gain actual knowledge. Software firm  (NASDAQ:  ) hopes to provide the answers.At its core, Splunk provides a variety of tools and businesses intelligence software to collect, manage and analyze all the data various organizations make. This includes everything from machine learning and application analysis to cybersecurity and business analytics. The win is that SPLK's applications are set-up to use a simple website-style interface. You don't need to be a developer to use or understand the software.This ease of use and ability to comb through all the data has a lot of fans. Some of SPLK's customers include  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and AAA.Naturally, all of this love for Big Data has created some big revenues for the tech stock. Over the last quarter, revenues jumped  . This was now the 27th consecutive quarter of beating estimates. Moreover, the firm's loss per share has narrowed.When it comes to tech stocks, Splunk is the reigning big data king.Not to be confused with the popular video game Fortnite,  (NASDAQ:  ) could be one of the best tech stocks out there. And that's because of what it targets: cybersecurity.With hacks, data breaches and other cyber threats on the rise, protecting a network is of utmost importance. And it's only getting much more important as we move into the cloud, conduct more banking online and live more complicated digital lives. It's FTNT's job to make sure a company's or your data doesn't fall into the hands of hackers. It develops and markets various cybersecurity software as well as devices such as firewalls, anti-virus, intrusion prevention, VPNs and endpoint security products. Basically, all the stuff you'd need to build a secure network.And given the high-profile nature of several recent data breaches, FTNT is supplying a lot of stuff.  , non-GAAP revenue surged 71%, while revenues grew at 21%. More importantly, the pace of growth is accelerating. According to Fortinet's sales breakdown, $250,000-plus deals jumped more than 27%, while the number of $1 million-plus transactions surged 32%. Even better is that average contract lengths have increased more than two years. All of this will continue to bring in more revenues for the cyber-security firm.With digital threats continuing to grow, Fortinet is poised to be one of the biggest winners among tech stocks.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ight from the top brass to research analysts, earnings growth interests all. This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Notably, earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time.Earnings acceleration, however, works even better when it comes to boosting the stock price. Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a rally in stock price.Basically, earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company. In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be referred to as earnings acceleration.In case o  growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.Let's look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods' growth rates. : The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1). : The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2). : The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters: : This screens out low-priced stocks. : High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only 16.

This is especially true as the Dow Jones rallied more than 1,000 points (up almost 5%) on Dec 26, marking the largest single-day point gain in the history. The S&P 500 also climbed nearly 5% while the Nasdaq Composite recorded its best performance since March 2009, climbing about 5.8%.Outstanding performance came on the report that this holiday season is the strongest in six years with an e-commerce bonanza and surge in last-minute shopping. Total U.S. retail sales, excluding automobiles, rose 5.1% year over year between Nov 1 and Dec 24 per MasterCard Advisors' SpendingPulse. Overall, U.S. consumers spent more than $850 billion this holiday season. In particular, e-commerce giant Amazon  led Wall Street higher after the company announced a record-breaking holiday season (read:  ).Additionally, energy stocks rebounded sharply with a spike in  , which jumped about 8% on Dec 26, marking their largest one-day increase in two years.

A Santa Claus rally refers to the increase in stock prices in the final week of the calendar year (i.e. between Christmas and New Year's Day) that extends into the first two days of the New Year.In the past five decades, the final week of the year and the first couple of trading sessions in January registered  gain.

Notably, high beta and high momentum products are expected to lead the market in the weeks ahead. This is because high beta funds experience larger gains than the broader market counterparts in a bullish market while momentum investing looks to capture profits from buying hot stocks, which have shown an uptrend over a few weeks or a few months.As such, we have highlighted five ETFs & stocks that are expected to outperform the Santa Claus rally and are intriguing choices for a short spell.This ETF tracks the performance of 100 stocks from the S&P 500 Index with the highest beta over the past 12 months.

Read on to learn why they like  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NYSE: AOS) , and  (NYSE: GRUB) .IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Splunk is up more than 20% over the past year on the heels of its  . But it's also trading well off its recent highs, as the broader market's recent weakness  this perennial outperformer without merit.To be clear, Splunk's underlying business has never been stronger. As more people discover the power of its operational intelligence platform, Splunk continues to win new customers at a rapid clip. It added 500 enterprise clients in its most recent quarter alone, including industry giants like  ,  , and  in Japan. And even as it builds from its larger base, revenue next fiscal year is expected to climb nearly 24%, to $2.15 billion -- both as new customers continue to pile on and existing clients find new ways to leverage Splunk's solutions.Of course, given Splunk's long streak of beating expectations, we can be fairly sure that Wall Street will be modeling even greater growth. But patient in-the-know investors who take advantage of this pullback realize that Splunk is a winner that should keep on winning. , with the stock down more than 30% from early-year highs. One reason is a slowing Chinese economy. China accounts for roughly 34% of the company's business. A.O. Smith is expecting 2019 revenue growth to fall to a range of 4% to 5.5% from a 7% pace in 2018. That's not great news, but it is likely to be a short-term slowdown at a company with a still-robust future. data by  .Revenue and earnings at the water heater maker have grown at a compound annual rate of 10% and 25%, respectively, since 2010, driven by 21% revenue growth in China. As consumers there moved up the socioeconomic ladder, they eagerly paid for hot water as soon as they could afford it. This trend isn't complete, either, since the country continues to advance economically, just at a slightly slower pace.  That said,  , which makes up less than 1% of sales today. As consumers in that nation start to become wealthier, they will jump on the opportunity to take hot showers, too.Which is why A.O. Smith's long-term expectations haven't really changed. It is still looking for modest growth in developed markets (roughly 4% annually), which make up around 65% of its business, to underpin much higher growth (as much as 11%) in emerging markets like China and India. All in all, it expects to hit 7% revenue growth over the long term. Yes, a slowdown in China is a near-term headwind, but investors who step back and  . Grubhub controlled 34% of the U.S. food delivery service market in July, according to Edison Trends, making it the top dog in an increasingly crowded market. Its closest rivals -- Uber Eats and DoorDash -- controlled 28% and 18% of the market, respectively.Grubhub became the top delivery service by acquiring rival platforms, including Seamless, MenuPages, Eat24, and Tapingo. Surging demand for food deliveries boosted its total active diners by 67% annually to 16.4 million last quarter, as its daily average grubs (meals) rose 37%.As a result, Grubhub's revenue grew 52% annually to $247 million last quarter. Its adjusted EBITDA rose 41% to $60 million, as its non-GAAP net income surged 72% to $42 million. Those figures beat analysts' expectations, but the stock slumped after that report due to its  for the fourth quarter, which called for 38% to 43% revenue growth and a 12% to 30% drop in EBITDA.That forecast, which reflected bigger investments in tech and marketing, sparked concerns about tougher competition and pricing pressure, especially from Uber Eats. However, the bears often ignore the fact that Grubhub is leveraging its first mover's advantage to expand its services ecosystem -- which now includes LevelUp's payment and loyalty services -- and that it's locking in fast-food giants like  .Grubhub definitely isn't a cheap stock at nearly 40 times forward earnings, but it's a promising play on a high-growth market that could eventually generate multibagger returns.Nobody can know for certain where the stock market is headed from here, or whether these three growth stocks will go on to deliver outsized gains. But coupling steep pullbacks from all three stocks with Splunk's increasingly popular platform and growing customer base, A.O. Smith's steady results, and Grubhub's enviable industry position, these contributors think chances are high that they'll do exactly that.

The major indices each dropped by more than 1.5% on Thursday as this horrible month of December continues to get worse.The Dow fell by nearly 2% (or 464.06 points) to 22,859.60, while the NASDAQ slipped 1.63% (or about 108 points) to 6528.41. The S&P is now solidly beneath 2500 after declining 1.58% to 2467.42.It's still all about the Fed. The market really wanted them to take this steep correction into account when deciding further rate hikes, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell doesn't seem as concerned as investors. The Committee sees one fewer increase next year than originally expected, but that obviously wasn't enough.Meanwhile, a higher possibility for a government shutdown isn't helping matters either. The U.S. Senate approved a temporary funding bill to keep everything going until February, but President Trump said today that he would not sign it without funding for a border wall.Investors, though, are much more anxious about the Fed continuing to raise rates at a time of weakening growth across the globe. Each of the major indices have now dropped more than 3% in the past two sessions since the announcement.As you'll see in the highlights section below, a few of the editors decided to take a chance and add positions in preparation for a bounce back. Unfortunately, there was no rebound today as the market's sentiment continues to be ugly. The market is way overdue for a relief rally, according to Jeremy. The editor mostly sat on the sidelines while stocks crumbled, but now it's time to gather some courage and buy while everyone else gives up. On Thursday, he bought the following four names:\u2022 Etsy (ETSY) - a provider of online and offline marketplaces\u2022 Illumina (ILMN) - a provider of DNA sequencing and array-based tech\u2022 RH (RH) - a luxury furniture company\u2022 Splunk (SPLK) - a provider of software solutionsThese companies are all fundamentally solid and have reported strong quarters, but the correction has either pulled down shares or limited any improvement. RH is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while the other three are Zacks Rank #2s (Buys). Jeremy is adding each of these names with small, 5% allocations and plans to buy more during better times. The complete commentary has specifics on each of these buys with charts. With major technical damage running into a hawkish Fed, Kevin decided before the open this morning to drop all bullish biases and get net short with an initial target of S&P 2400. And with little potential bullish relief in sight until Q4 economic data and earnings, institutions will likely remain in \"sell the rallies\" mode. So the editor added Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 3X Shares (SPXS) on Thursday. Read the full write-up for more on Kevin's outlook and todays' moves, which also include a couple of sells. Lots of changes in the portfolio today. As Tracey said yesterday, this deeper-than-originally-expected correction demands a new strategy for the service. Therefore, she sold six names that have been getting killed and added a couple mid- to large-cap positions that should perform better in tough times. Here are the new buys:PVH (PVH): Insiders at this apparel retail giant rarely ever buy their own shares, so it really caught Tracey's attention when the CEO and a director recently made moves. The CEO's play was especially bullish since it was likely a \"confidence buy\" meant to send a signal that its 35% drop year-to-date is way overdone.Chemours (CC): This specialty chemical company was spun off from DuPont in 2015 and the insiders were rewarded handsomely. So they don't often see the need for insider buys. And yet, earlier this month a director bought 10,000 shares despite the stock being down nearly 50% so far this year.Both names were added with 10% allocations. After today's moves, the portfolio has plenty of cash on hand to continue adding as we move into 2019.

This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Notably, earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time.Earnings acceleration, however, works even better when it comes to boosting the stock price. Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a rally in stock price.Basically, earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company. In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be referred to as earnings acceleration.In case o  growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine.

Splunk is benefiting from multiple tailwinds -- including the migration to cloud computing, business needs for more data-driven insight into operations, and increasingly complex cybersecurity countermeasures -- resulting in  . Though the company isn't in the black yet, the stock is worthy of consideration for investors looking for a multidecade portfolio holding.Shares of Splunk are up 28% this year as of this writing, although they're still down 19% from the all-time high reached over the summer. Though it has been a bumpy ride, the stock's performance underscores how well the business has been performing.\n  \nData source: Splunk. P.p. = percentage points. YOY = year over year. Chart by author.Splunk has its foot on the gas to grow the top line as fast as possible. (It is pushing for over $2 billion in sales next year.) That shows up in steep sales and marketing, and research and development expenses -- which have increased 30% and 43%, respectively, year-to-date. That is the primary reason Splunk operates at a loss in spite of its size.Nevertheless, the decision to sacrifice profit now for more of it later is yielding impressive growth. Management thinks sales will rise to about $560 million for the current quarter. It also raised its full-year revenue guidance to $1.74 billion from $1.685 billion. That puts the company on track to meet its ambitious $2 billion goal next year.It's been a landmark couple of years for Splunk. As organizations have realized the benefits of converting big data into useful insights, Splunk has been a primary beneficiary. As the company has grown, it has reached a size where it can throw its weight around in the technology space. Since 2017, it has reported six acquisitions, ranging from the most recent buyout of Internet of Things data platform Krypton to machine-learning and cloud-computing company SignalSense late in 2017.Image source: Getty Images.The biggest acquisitions, though, were Phantom (for $350 million) and VictorOps ($120 million) to boost the company's presence in the burgeoning yet fast-evolving  . The result has been new software offerings helping companies orchestrate the detection and prevention of security breaches, a key area contributing to Splunk's recent success and acceleration in sales growth.Still, some investors may shy away from the stock because of the steep losses, especially as operating losses have increased this year even as revenue continues to rise. However, I think management is doing the right thing here. Gross profit margin on services is an enviable 78.8% so far this year, so adding as much of that good stuff as possible will pay off down the road.Plus, when adjusting for one-time items and stock-based compensation, Splunk's operating profit margin is positive and rising. Adjusted operating margin was 13.6% in the third quarter and is expected to increase to 25% to 26% in the final quarter of the current fiscal year. Full-year adjusted operating margin should be 11.5% to 12%. That is driving steady growth in free cash flow -- or the money left over after basic operating expenses and capital expenditures are paid for.That doesn't mean Splunk is an inexpensive purchase. The stock currently trades for 52 times free cash flow. Paying for half a century's worth of profit isn't usually advisable. However, bear in mind that the figure includes the cost of the company's recent acquisitions and other expansion efforts.Nevertheless,  stock have little to do with valuation. Rather, it's all about long-term potential: not just the size of the future payoff, but also in the company's ability to lead the charge in the big data industry. With revenue on track to grow nearly 40% this year -- an impressive feat given the company's size -- it seems the business community thinks Splunk is indeed a leader in providing usable big data insights. With plenty of runway ahead of it, this stock looks to be worth holding onto for the long haul.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Within that, license revenue grew 44.3% to $279.6 million, and maintenance and services revenue jumped more than 35% to $201.4 million. That translated to adjusted earnings of $57.6 million, or $0.38 per share, exceeding consensus estimates by $0.06 per share.Splunk CEO Doug Merritt credited the company's outperformance to its \"pioneering innovation and the rising demand for data-driven insights across all industries.\"To be sure, management elaborated that Splunk not only added over 500 enterprise customers during the quarter, but also enjoyed higher average sales from each of its existing customers as they expanded their adoption of Splunk's various products.Looking ahead to its current fiscal fourth quarter, Splunk told investors to expect revenue to increase 33.4% year over year to $560 million, modestly above Wall Street's estimates at the time.Of course, you can be sure the market will be anticipating Splunk will cap its seventh straight year of exceeding guidance when all is said and done in its current period. But however conservative that guidance might be, and however aggressive consensus estimates might grow, it won't matter if Splunk absolutely crushes those estimates again with its next report in February 2019.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We drove fantastic results in Q3 thanks to strong execution in the field and the most exciting .conf in Splunk's history. We delivered $481 million in total revenue, up 40% over last year. Our success comes from new and exiting customers, expanding their adoption with Splunk as their platform for data analytics and machine learning. So, it's on prem and in the cloud.At .conf18, we hosted nearly 10,000 people and shared our newest wave of product innovation. We announced updates to our existing products, including new versions of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, with better performance, scale, machine learning, and analytics abilities.A few of the new capacities include a machine learning toolkit connector for Apache Spark and a container for tension or flow, guided data onboarding to help customers move customers into their partner, Splunk SmartStore, which allows compute and storage tiers to be independently scaled on business demands, Splunk on Docker to cover deployments in Docker containers, metrics workspace to monitor and analyze metrics data in an efficient, intuitive user interface, and the crowd favorite, dark mode, which is perfect for SOC and NOC environments.We released Splunk for industrial IoT, our first IoT solution, which provides a simple view of the complex industrial data environment to minimize downtime and shift our operations from reactive to proactive. We announced a new release to Splunk IT Service Intelligence or ITSI to help customers better predict and prevent problems through a series of enhanced capabilities like KPI predictions and predictive cause analysis and an entirely updated security suite with new versions of Splunk Enterprise Security or ES, user behavior analytics or UBA, and Phantom.We also announced an exciting new suite of beta capabilities, which we call Splunk Next. Splunk Next evolved from conversations with our customers, who asked us to focus on three major areas -- one, to work with their data wherever it lives, two, to further embed AI and ML in our platform to create action-driven outcomes, and three, to empower users across their organizations on any device.Splunk Next announcements, like our Data Stream Processor and Data Fabric Search mean you can refine and adjust data as it moves across the stream and then search across multiple data stores in Splunk or elsewhere. And additional capabilities like business flow, natural language processing, and Splunk Mobile empower new users regardless of their technical skillset or physical location to investigate, monitor, and act on their data no matter where it lives.During the keynotes, we welcomed leaders from Starbucks and BMW who shared how they're using Splunk to make things happen in their organizations. I was honored to be joined on stage by Arnold Donald, CEO of Carnival Corporation. He shared our Carnival creates meaningful guest interactions both on and off their fleet of floating cities. Carnival relies on Splunk to monitor connectivity on the ships, monitor their mobile apps, and keep their own and their guests' data safe, ultimately helping to provide a seamless digital experience.Since our first product shipment, Splunk has taken a different approach to data. Unlike other data technologies, you do not have to know the questions you'll ask before you deploy our solutions. The magic of Splunk is that we embrace the complexity and chaos of an ever-changing data landscape and allow you to find insights from your data without the high entry costs of cleansing, parsing, and structuring.Our goal remains the same, to become the ubiquitous machine data platform, the standard in every organization, solving our customers data challenges around IT operations and application delivery, security compliance and fraud, as well as business analytics and the internet of things. These markets are going through a shift to an analytics and machine learning-based approach, where Splunk is uniquely poised to lead this change and deliver for our customers.Transitioning to customer success in Q3, let's start with IT. Softbank purchased Splunk Cloud to speed up troubleshooting for mobile devices and application management. Softbank already uses us for IT and AI ops and expects Splunk Cloud to improve efficiency and performance across infrastructure and operations management.ATB Financial, Alberta's largest homegrown financial institution, expanded their use of Splunk Cloud and brought on ITSI one year after their first Splunk investment. ATB Financial has been using Splunk Cloud to make their online activity data available across teams and will now use Splunk for mobile app monitoring and executive reporting.Chicago Public Schools, one of the largest public school districts in the country, expanded their use of Splunk Cloud to help automate their service and out-ticketing process along with other IT monitoring and response workflows.Moving to security, longtime Splunk customer, Norfolk Southern, expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise and ES to better lead with an analytics-driven approach to security. With Splunk, they will use data to gain visibility into their threat environment at machine speed, while also meeting compliance standards with positive train control, a federal safety mandate that controls trains to avoid accidents.The Department of Home Affairs, which brings together Australia's federal law enforcement, national security, and criminal justice-related functions and agencies, replaced its legacy SAM with Splunk Enterprise. With Splunk, they can centralize security management on a single platform and better handle the big data scale of their security operations center.Texas A&M University selected Splunk Enterprise as the foundation of their security operations strategy. The university chose Splunk for continuous threat analysis, monitoring, and investigation as well as satisfying compliance requirements. A&M also plans on their cybersecurity researchers with Splunk's machine learning capabilities in order to develop and improve threat monitoring to better detect advanced threats.Highlighting a handful of customers who standardized on Splunk as their machine data platform, Randstad, a global leader in the HR services industry, got Splunk Cloud, ITSE, and ES to support their global IT infrastructure services. We will help Randstad expand the company's infrastructure monitoring across the business and leverage Splunk as a SIM at the heart of their SOC. We would like to thank our partner, TCS, for their support in collaboration in initiating this opportunity.SendGrid has gone all in on Splunk, expanding Splunk Enterprise across their customer support, compliance, professional services, and engineering teams. SendGrid uses Splunk to debug and DevOps, help their customer meet in SLAs, and keep their customer-facing platform online. Thanks to our partner, Presidio Capital, who was instrumental in this transaction.The Naval Post Graduate School is a new Splunk customer, purchasing Splunk Enterprise, ITSI, and ES. The school plans to use ITSI to keep a wide range of mission-critical IT systems online while ES will stay at the heart of their new SOC. Long-time customer Clemson University purchased Splunk Enterprise, ES, ITSI, and UBA. Clemson uses Splunk to thwart cyber threats, monitor campuswide IT, and integrate into their campus platform to support student success.We also saw continued global adoption in our cloud business. A sampling of our cloud wins in the quarter include Teachers Mutual Bank, one of the largest in Australia, who is a new customer that bought Splunk Cloud and ES to optimize their security operations and improve their security posture. Teachers Mutual Bank expects to obtain end to end visibility, ensuring a safe environment for their customers' business.New customer Fleetcor Technologies bought Splunk Cloud to improve their security posture. Splunk was selected because we can support all of Fleetcor's data sources and will augment their current SIM. Thanks to new Splunk partner, DataMD, who supported this opportunity.Personalized video marketing platform Sunday Sky moved to Splunk Cloud as their central platform to provide complete transparency into IT and business operations as well as for research and development use cases.To highlight the impact that Splunk can provide on the IoT front, one of my favorite keynote presentations at .conf was Boulos El-Asmar from BMW Group. BMW group took us through their Splunk journey, starting with a small Splunk Enterprise license and just one security use case to now, where BMW Group is using Splunk to drive innovation across their business. BMW is using our machine learning toolkit to predict traffic dynamics as well as our natural language capabilities to help them speed time to value, allowing them to simply ask questions of Splunk via Alexa.On the manufacturing side, Splunk Industrial Asset Intelligence helps plant floor engineers, keep production up and running by correlating IoT data. Amsterdam's public transport operator, GVB, is a new Splunk customer, purchasing Splunk Enterprise to support use cases in IoT, IT, and business intelligence. GVB will be using Splunk to better monitor and act on their real time passenger information services, providing users with a better, more efficient, and more informed public transportation experience. Big thanks to our partner at DITP for their support in this opportunity.And it was another big quarter of customer-focused innovation with AWS. I'm just back from re:Invent. This week, we launched a new integration with AWS Security Hub and an added capability to query against cloud watch log insights. We also released integrations this quarter with web application firewall and Trumpet. This is in addition to our many other integrations, including the Splunk app for AWS.In summary, we delivered a great Q3. This year's .conf was our biggest and best ever. As always, it's exciting to see so many of our customers and partners and hear their enthusiastic feedback about Splunk's products and people. Customer success is our number one company priority and our efforts and investments are paying off. I'm looking forward to continuing this momentum.Thanks again to all of our customers and partners and thanks to everybody who works at Splunk. Finally, I want to take a moment to congratulate you, Dave. As I'm sure you all saw, Dave has announced he's going to retire.Dave is staying on board until March of 2020 as we initiate a search for a successor and I appreciate that he's going to stay and help with the transition. I can't overstate what Dave has done for Splunk. His leadership, accomplishments, and the foundation he helped create will continue to serve us well. I speak for all of us at Splunk when I say it has been an honor to work side by side with Dave over the years.Thank you so much and now, over to you, Dave. -- Thanks, Doug. I certainly appreciate those very kind words. To open, I'm looking forward to reviewing our results following another strong quarter for Q3, which is our largest ever, and providing an update for Q4, the full year, and our outlook for our next fiscal year, Fiscal 20.Before I do, remember that almost two years ago, I set several important and material expectations for our multi-year business transformation, from primarily a perpetual company to one that is mostly renewable, shifting our go to market strategy to drive 75% of our software sales to renewable by next year. I can tell you that our execution toward this goal has significantly exceeded the expectations we set in January of '17 and my confidence in delivering the $2 billion revenue milestone in Fiscal 20 has never been higher.When I retire, I'll have spent over eight years with the company after completing this latest transition. Over the next several quarters, I'm really looking forward to helping the company extend its market leadership as the ubiquitous platform for our customers' data.Now, back to our report. Before I detail actual results and discuss guidance, I want to clarify a few things regarding the strength and growth of our business. I've said the best measure of our overall business momentum is software revenue, which is the combination of on-prem license and cloud revenues. When looking at the mix of transactions on prem, there is both a tailwind from longer duration and a headwind from fewer perpetual contracts.When aggregating these, we estimate we've recognized tailwinds of about $40 million for the last nine months, i.e. year to date. However, as we said, the strategic shift to renewable contracts includes delivering more of our software via the cloud, which we all know is recognized. So, obviously, this represents a headwind to overall revenue.Consistent with overachieving our mix shift a year early, it follows that we realized more cloud transactions than originally anticipated. Specifically, year to date, the growing contribution from cloud to total software sales has resulted in a headwind of about $43 million. So, as we've said, we believe the shift in both mix and duration has a net neutral impact on total software revenue as they generally offset one another and are therefore not material.To give you a sense of just how rapidly our Cloud business is growing, the current ARR of Cloud-only is about $200 million, which is nearly double from a year ago. For simplicity, something we always strive for here, our outlook in Fiscal 20 is based on a consistent mix and duration level that we're realizing in Fiscal 19. We expect any deltas resulting from head and tailwinds to be immaterial at this level of scale.Now, more on FY20 in a minute. Let's move on to the current period results. Q3 total revenues were $481 million, a 40% increase over last year. Software revenues, again, the total of license and cloud were up 49% from Q3 of last year, totaling $325 million. Cloud revenue was $45 million, up 87% over last year. Education and professional services represented 8% of total revenues, international operations contributed 24% of total Q3 revenues, and we added over 500 new customers and recorded 111 seven-figure orders during the quarter.Now, turning to profitability and other results which are all non-GAAP, operating income was $65.4 million, representing a positive margin of 13.6%. Q3 overall gross margin was 85%, comparable on a year over year basis. Net income was $57.6 million or $0.38 per share using a weighted average share count of $153 million shares. Operating cash flow in Q3 was $59 million, while free cash flow was $52 million. And we ended the period with about $2.8 billion in cash and investments, reflecting the net proceeds of about $1.8 billion from our convertible debt offering we closed during the quarter.Again, the best indicators of our business momentum are software revenues and also RPO. Recall that RPO includes backlog, so the total of revenues plus the change in RPO should provide a better estimate of in-period bookings in the traditional billings calculation. With that, we ended Q3 with total RPO of $950 million versus $602 million for Q3 of last year, up 58% and reflective of our bookings achievement thus far this year.Okay. Turning to guidance -- we expect Q4 revenues of approximately $560 million and non-GAAP operating margin of a positive 25% to 26%. For the full year, we are now expecting total revenues of approximately $1.74 billion, up from the $1.685 billion, and we are increasing our FY19 non-GAAP op margin target to range between 11.5% and 12% positive.For EPS purposes, since we expect to be non-GAAP profitable for Q4 and the full year, you should use fully diluted weighted average share counts of $155 million in Q4 and $152 million for the full year. Looking forward to next year, the investments we're making in product and field continue to fuel our growth. We expect our momentum this year will translate into next year, with FY20 total revenues of $2.15 billion, exceeding the $2 billion expectation I set two years ago.Again, to be clear, this revenue target is based on a target mix and duration assumption for software contracts as compared this year, with any deltas expected to be immaterial. For your models, please remember that just as we saw this year, 606 causes a steeper revenue ramp during the year than we've seen historically. As such, I expect total revenues in 2020, Fiscal 20, will be weighted 40-60 first half to second half, with the largest seasonal impact visible in Q1.In closing, Q3 execution was outstanding and I expect a very strong finish to the year. I'm extremely proud of everything we've accomplished thus far, transitioning from a $100 million private company to a public company targeting well above $2 billion in total revenue. It's been terrific contributing for such a long time and I've had the pleasure and honor of working for so many great people at the company and all of you on the call. I'd like to thank all the current and former Splunkers and all the folks on the finance team. I'm looking forward to the next year here and making sure we continue to deliver in Fiscal 20 and beyond.On that note, thanks so much and we'll open up for questions.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, press * and the number 1 key of your touchstone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself form the queue, press the # key. Again, to get in the queue, just press * and 1.Our first question is from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Dave, we appreciate the long runway you're giving your team here. It truly has been a great pleasure working with you. It really has. We're going to miss you. It looks like we've got you for a while. -- Thanks, John. -- These results look really strong here, but as you guys know, there's a question of how much of that strength is because of ASC 606 and props expanding duration of on prem term license. Dave, thanks for that $40 million of tailwind over the first three quarters of the year. We can look at it three quarters over three quarters. Could you tell us what it was this quarter? It's probably not dividing by three. Could you break it out per quarter? -- John, thanks for the question. Thanks for acknowledging we quantified our estimated at $40 million for nine months, but don't forget I was explicit to point out the shift to renewable includes a shift to routable cloud. That was about a $43 million headwind for the same period.Now, in terms of quarter impact -- John, you've been with us since the IPO and we've talked about mix for so long and it was really frustrating because it would jump up and down every 90 days. That remains the case today. The best way to think about it is over not a 90-period but a nine-month period.More importantly, if you think about the size and scale in Fiscal 20 and look comparably between Fiscal 19, now $1.740 billion, growing $2.150 billion, our model has consistent assumptions for both duration and mix. Even if there are gyrations between the two categories, it's going to be immaterial at that level of scale. -- Okay. This is something for us to chew on tonight. Thanks. That's helpful.Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Good evening. Dave, congrats on the long-term outlook for retirement but retirement nevertheless. You gave us a sense of what the duration was last quarter. I was wondering if you could update us in terms of where we are now with this quarter and year to date and also what impact that extension and duration might have as we come in terms of the renewal period a couple years out since we're signing longer deals now. -- Sure, Michael. Our year to date duration remains consistent for the year, which is about 33 months. That's the blended duration for all of our renewable contracts, both on prem term and our subscription cloud contracts. In terms of our outlook going forward, we were modeling and setting the objective to get to 75% renewable. We thought of course, we're going to have a recurring stable of contracts that will come up for renewal. As we've been accelerating toward that goal, we're seeing that group of contracts grow beyond our original expectations based on really strong execution in the field.When we model forward and think about the foundation that provides from a model perspective, it's really strong and stronger than when we first set the objective originally. All that's great on the financial model side. But more important strategically, we've learned it's by far the best way to enable our customers to deploy and adopt our solutions. Customer success is number one for us. Everything that we do from the investment portfolio that we manage here is all focused on that as the prime directive. Having these kinds of contracts out in the market for our customers to leverage really puts them in great position to consume our products. -- Thanks very much, Dave. Doug, you made a couple comments about IoT becoming a hotter area. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about the investments you're making in IoT and business non-IT analytics in general and where that money is going and what we should expect in terms of your strategy? -- Absolutely. The key IoT announcement we made at .conf was the release of industrial asset intelligence, which is a collection of dashboards, queries, alerts focused specifically on predictive maintenance in industrial shops. However, the biggest issue we've talked about for a number of years on extending beyond the technical footprint within IT and cybersecurity is making it easier for less technical people to play with the data in Splunk and then take actions on that data as well.There were a host of announcements we made at .conf to help lower that bar, from our new mobile platform to augmented reality in a future virtual reality framework that makes it far easier for people to visualize what's happening in the environment around them, the demo that Jesse, the leader of that product gave. We introduced a product called Business Flow, which represents the data within Splunk through a process journey.That is, I think, a much more approachable interface for anyone that's involved in marketing, operations, manufacturing to see how their reality of their environment is performing. That was prompted by one of our customers to help them see customer interaction patterns through the machine data. We introduced natural language processing as an application so that you can actually have a verbal interaction with Splunk.So, we're attacking it from a multitude of angles so that we can continue to broaden or allow our customers to broaden from their more technical personnel.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Dave, congrats from me as well, although I'm slightly confused because you've just done 606 and you're done with the subscription transition and now you ride off. You should have done it the other way. Doug, you've been at AWS. Most of us were at re:Invent. Can you talk about the changing nature of competition you see from cloud that are all popping up there? What are you seeing from the market on that one? -- From a day in, day out basis, we haven't seen a change in competitive dynamics. We continue with really impressive win rates. We continue to work within accounts to allow them to understand the power that Splunk provides. That winds up helping us a lot in the competitive landscape.Within AWS and the cloud vendors, those are really complex environments, as we all just got to see, so many different services and capabilities can be online all the time, every one of those exuding different kinds of data. They've got different attempts within AWS to help capture that data so AWS customers can make sense of it. We integrate with all those different services and different data capture devices.We were first to the table with Cloud Watch to have our integration ready. We were right there with them with their latest announcement related to the insights capability released in Cloud Watch as well as Security Hub. Our focus and why that innovation agenda is so important at .conf and why we're pushing hard on the product front is to stay in front based on customer needs and customer feedback the different capabilities being released around us. -- I might have missed it, but did you talk to the mix on security and other use cases this quarter? -- No, we didn't talk about it because it was uneventful and consistent with what we've been experiencing over the last handful of quarters.Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. -- Two quick questions, one a quick housekeeping item for you, Dave -- you mentioned duration of 33 months for the nine months this year. What was that metric for the nine months last year? Also, for the team, just a broader question on pricing and particularly larger deals, any update that you have on pricing, particularly as you get to these larger deals that Doug highlighted on the call, it seems like you were talking about multiple different use cases here, way more data volume, how is that impacting the pricing conversation when you're talking about going down the pricing curve? -- First, as it relates to duration, let's just say unlike the Raiders, Splunk is leading the league and we're putting up a lot of points on the scoreboard. I'd love if the Raiders could replicate that. Duration again for the nine months this fiscal year was 33, the comparable nine-month prior year was about 26. Then as it relates to pricing, Doug? -- My favorite initial lead-in for pricing is folks are never happy with the price, but the one thing I hear from our customers is they're always happy with the value. The question for pricing continues to be how do we provide predictability to our customers. I think we've done a better job over the past couple years of making customers aware of the possibility of unlimited contracts and other buying vehicles that lock down their perspective and how much they're going to owe Splunk.The biggest impact the last nine months has been that shift to term. Customers can lock in a three-year perspective of either consistent data usage or in many cases escalating data usage. It's a little bit easier to give them a little bit more than they might need without the permanent impact you'd have on a perpetual contract we had in the past. I think some of that pricing noise is going down. We're never done. We are always focused on making it more transparent and easier for customers. Stay tuned for additional focus areas to help there.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. -- Congratulations, this is spectacular. You guys are accelerating at scale while cancelling out the headwinds versus the tailwinds. My question for you is as you look at the use case, clearly, the option is there to grow to be much larger, $5 billion, $6 billion, who knows? But you look at successful companies like a Salesforce.com or Workday, they always had a second act, third act, or fourth act.Is there going to be a fourth use case, fifth use case that could end up being a big hundred-million opportunity or billion-dollar opportunity? It's hard to think of Splunk going from $2 billion to $6 billion while maintaining the same mix of use cases such as security, operations, SIM, if you will, and IT operations. There's got to be something, a third act, a fourth act. How do you envision the future for Splunk four to five years from now? That's it for me. Thank you. -- First of all, it's hard to believe how we get to $5 billion to $6 billion with security and IT. I think we can get to $5 billion to $6 billion with security and IT. We do have lots of other plans.When I look at the installs that we have across our existing customer base and how broadly we are being used, what data sources we're ingesting across the IT set of use cases and how much utilization we have at ITSI and how many additional apps we've deployed they've built themselves or they've downloaded from Splunk just within IT, we are a fraction of what is necessary for the vast majority of the customer base. I'd say 95% of the customer base is still not getting the full analytics and monitoring detection and investigation capability they could or should just within security and IT.That said, the power of Splunk, we talk about a percentage of business every quarter, where a sales rep has said they bought this solution for a security use case or IT use case or non-security use case. We know that's the beginning of the journey. If we're successful, they're implementing a whole host of use cases outside of IT and security.As we see patterns emerge, we'll start to facilitate the ecosystem to release apps we'll highlight or build these apps ourselves. We do believe at Splunk there's a huge opportunity -- again, probably tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of potential applications to recover the needs of the functional users and the different industrial use cases in the industrial IoT or IoT segment.Our next question is from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Doug, you mentioned again this quarter you have a ton of IT ops use cases in your prepared remarks and to Dave's point around the business mix being consistent from a use case perspective, I wanted to understand from your view what you need to do either from the technical or go to market perspective to replicate the type of success you've had in the security arena. As we think about DevOps becoming the more influential buyer in the enterprise, how are you positioned from that standpoint? -- Thanks, Fatima. A lot of the quick rise in security was two things. One, obviously, cyber is becoming a critical component for everyone to understand and address, so that alone with the board scrutiny has become a heavy drumbeat to make sure you've got the degree of insight you need in your landscape and two, there was a clear replacement category. There's this whole SIM market and the way Splunk approaches that problem because of the flexible underpinnings of Splunk Enterprise was pretty differentiated.In the IT ops arena, ITSI, the whole orientation around ITSI was to provide that same degree of flexibility in that IT operations side. It took ES five years to get significant foothold and traction. I think the first coding on that was done in '09 and '10. So, it takes a while for these products to mature and right now, we're in the third year with ITSI.We are starting to see more completeness with ITSI and more situations where a 20-40-year old systems management framework is now being replaced with ITSI. So, my hope and Rick's orientation is that with continued investment and focus, we can be talking in a future call about the replacement cycle opportunity on the IT ops side.The other piece that's equally important -- replacement within that heavyweight IT ops segment, a lot of the energy of new workloads is going to next gen DevOps. We have a whole host of different insights, the lighter weight applications was really primarily focused on DevOps, a true next gen environment where every developer owns their code end to end without that handoff. Stay tuned for more releases in that category. In addition to the SOC and NOC, the next gen DevOps portfolio is one we're really excited about and developing aggressively toward and in the strategic landscape is something we're looking toward as well. -- Dave, a quick follow-up for you. You talked about the accelerated shift toward more the routable business being a pretty big drag on your cash flow profile this year. If you could, give us an update on how that should shake out as we barrel through the end of the year. At a very high level, what does that trajectory for cash flow from operations look like next year as we think about that and also internalize the headquarters-related CapEx you're going to be doing next year. That's it for me. Thank you so much. -- So, as we mentioned at the beginning of the fiscal year, we expected Fiscal 19 to be a cash flow trough as we made a material shift toward renewable. As we know, those are billed typically on an annual basis versus the full contract value. With the over-achievement on that objective in terms of renewable, that would add additional pressure form a cash flow perspective, but that's been offset by strong over-delivery of our plan in the field.Obviously, the fourth quarter is our largest quarter of the year and we have plenty of execution that we have to go nail down and that is going to ultimately translate to the amount of cash flow that we generate for Fiscal 19 but I'm confident we're on the right direction and '19 will be that trough year.When you look forward, what about cash flow going forward? When you see stability in the percentage of our business that is renewable and stability or consistency in terms of duration, then the business starts to normalize form a cash flow yield perspective. That's what we expect to see for Fiscal 20.As it relates to CapEx, we are a fairly light capital expenditure-consuming company, outside of the facility work that we do in terms of global footprint. We're excited about many of the spaces we're developing around the world and of late, we've made some significant investments in terms of creating the right footprint for Splunk in the Bay Area.But like we did a couple years back when we expanded in San Francisco and South Bay at the same time, we quantified what we expected the incremental or total cash flow or capital expenditures and therefore, the impact of free cash flow would be from those facility buildouts and we'll do the exact same thing as we finalize our plans for our latest phase of facility expansions.Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. -- A couple questions, Dave, for you -- on the duration impacts, a lot of us focus on the license impact. Can you help us understand how you're getting to the cloud impact and if there's any impact as it relates to the amount of booking you're deferring into maintenance and how that may come back in any way? -- Thanks, Water. There's been focus on license, which makes a lot of sense. Candidly, the reason I have been very deliberate over the last how many periods to point out software revenue as the best way to look at our growth, you have to contemplate how much of our software is being delivered in the cloud that doesn't hit the license line.So, when we look at the drag or the headwinds from the routability of cloud, we look at it in terms of how much is it growing as a percentage of our business that is in lieu of what would otherwise in our model be on prem, i.e. the on prem hits the license line, cloud hits service line, you've got to look at those two sides of the equation together. -- On the margins for next year, I know you didn't give an explicit -- I think at analyst day, you talked about a 14% operating margin in 2020. Is that still the way we should think about profitability next year? -- We didn't explicitly update what we provided at analyst day. As is consistent with our cadence on this call, we focus on the visibility we have and making sure we give that to all your folks in terms of the revenue. We've got to get to the end of the fiscal year, measure up the beans and look at the investments we have on the table and we'll provide an update at that time. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our final question will come from Steve Koenig with Wedbush. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for squeezing me in. What I'd love to ask you guys about is if you can, give us a little color -- do you have a playbook for converting perpetual customers and what does that playbook consist of and how do the mechanics of that work? Also, I'm curious to know are there any incentives for cloud sales this year over and above any incentives for recurring sales? What's driving the strong Splunk Cloud adoption and execution this year beyond any sales incentives. -- Let me talk about sales incentives for a second -- we've been very transparent that we've been on this multi-year journey having been born as a perpetual company to one that wants to deliver our solutions, obviously, on prem, but also in the cloud in leveraging the renewable structure. I think we were pretty clear that as we looked to accelerate our move in terms of that shift, we had this multi-year adjustment to how we align incentives in the field, moving where perpetual was the first-class citizen to now having renewable be the first-class citizen.As it relates to Cloud, what we experience in the field, it is absolutely most relevant around use case, customer preparedness, the needs and requirements in terms of how they want to leverage our technology, ultimately differentiates between are they going to use a renewable term contract on prem, are they going to use a cloud instance for that particular data source?We continue to see a very high percentage of customers that are with us in the cloud are also on prem customers. But unlike the incentive plan where we say perpetual shouldn't be first class, we don't go into that level of specificity on cloud because it's so customer-driven. -- I'll leave it there. Thanks again.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session today. I would like to turn the call over to Ken Tinsley for any final remarks. -- Thank you, Carmen, I appreciate that. Thanks, everybody for joining us. Have a great evening and enjoy the holidays.Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we thank you for participating in today's conference.

However, shares have a much more attractive setup here, as the risk is more well-defined.I like SPLK here so long as shares are over the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, or ~$106.Truly, as long as SPLK is over the 50-day and downtrend resistance (blue line), the stock is fine, but I don't want to take on that much risk. A close below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages and investors may want to reassess the setup.

Let's face it, the world is undergoing an explosion of data, such as from smartphones, IoT (Internet-of-things), wearables, AI (Artificial Intelligence) and machine learning.Actually, for just about any company to compete and thrive nowadays, there needs to be a Big Data focus. It's a strategic imperative.

So here's a look at seven:Source: Shutterstock (NYSE:  ) operates a knowledge platform, which includes a network of about 150 data providers like  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). For the most part, the company organizes data in ways to help businesses achieve goals, such as getting more customers or providing a better service.At the heart of this is intelligent search, which is based on context and intent. There is also AI (Artificial Intelligence) that helps provide more relevant results.The next generation of this technology, called Yext Brain, launched in late October. The system allows customers to sync their data with AI-enabled services like search, voice assistants and chatbots.In terms of growth for YEXT, it has been robust.

To be sure, increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence solutions have already permeated our lives, whether we're talking about self-driving vehicles, the effortless interactions we have with new smart-home devices, or the algorithms underlying a seemingly simple internet search.In the same way that products featuring AI are more complicated than they seem, it's not easy to find the best AI-centric stocks. So we asked three Motley Fool contributors to each discuss an artificial intelligence stock investors should be watching this month. Read on to learn what they had to say about  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NYSE: IBM) , and  (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .Image source: Getty Images. Judging by Splunk's more than 20% pullback from its all-time high set in September, you'd think something had happened to derail the operational intelligence platform leader's success. But that couldn't be further from the truth.Rather, Splunk's drop came on broader weakness in the stock market, with high-flying tech names taking the biggest hit in recent weeks. Splunk's decline also came despite multiple analysts  last month regarding expanding use cases and continued high interest in Splunk's platform -- both happy consequences of cutting-edge machine learning capabilities the company recently implemented into its core products.Splunk is set to announce its next quarterly results in less than two weeks, on Nov. 29. When it does, it will aim for its  of exceeding guidance, which this time calls for revenue to climb more than 30% year over year to between $430 million and $32 million, and for adjusted operating margin of 13%.Of course, if Splunk does make it 16 straight, with the market so accustomed to its relative outperformance, the gravity of another beat and the movements of the broader market will likely determine where the stock is headed in the short term. But for patient, long-term investors who recognize that Splunk is still in its early stages of growth, I think the stock is definitely worth considering this month. Big Blue has been dabbling in artificial intelligence for decades. You knew that the company's interest was getting serious by 1997, when its Deep Blue system defeated chess world champion Garry Kasparov. These days, the so-called Watson platform sits at the very heart of IBM's business plans.The transformation from a one-stop IT shop to an AI-centric specialist in faster-growing fields has been long and painful, leaving us IBM investors with a negative return of 34% in the last five years. Over that span, we missed out on a 52% gain in the broader market, as measured by the  benchmark. data by  .But IBM's so-called  have been collecting more than half of Big Blue's quarterly sales all year long. At long last, the company is ready to reap the benefits of that difficult strategy shift.Mr. Market is still not sure about any of that, leaving the stock for sale at a hugely affordable 9.9 times trailing earnings and 11 times free cash flow. Peers in the technology sector often trade at twice or thrice those multiples, and the fun part about earnings valuations like that is that IBM would unlock stronger earnings and cash flows in the process.On top of all that, Big Blue is acquiring cloud computing and open-source software veteran  (NYSE: RHT)  . That company is a serious challenger to the AI crown in its own right, giving IBM a serious leg up on the competition. I can't wait to see Red Hat and Big Blue working up some purple solutions in the cloud and AI spaces.So we have a leader in the AI market trading at a massive discount and investing heavily into expanding an already-impressive market position. Any one of those three arguments would be enough to make IBM a strong ticker in the artificial intelligence market. All three together makes it nearly unbeatable. The tech giant has its hands in many types of technologies, but artificial intelligence is taking up more and more of the company's attention these days. Alphabet uses AI to find the most relevant search results for its users, uses it in text-to-speech applications for its language translation app, and has even designed its own AI chips for its Google Cloud servers.But one of the most notable ways Alphabet is betting on AI is through its  Waymo. The company uses artificial intelligence that allows its autonomous vehicles to recognize and analyze images in real time and determine whether they are road signs to be followed, pedestrians to be avoided, or fellow vehicles.To date, Waymo's AI-powered vehicles have racked up 10 million miles of real-world road tests and more than 7 billion miles in virtual tests. The company's latest phase of testing is its Early Rider Program in Phoenix, Arizona, in which members of the public use the self-driving vehicles to travel to and from work and school, pick up groceries, and run other errands.Waymo's autonomous AI cars are more than just a side project for Alphabet, though. The company will launch a commercial  , and some analysts forecast Waymo will be  -- or potentially even $140 billion, by less conservative estimates.Waymo's self-driving service will be one of the first ever of its kind, and it would be a testament to just how serious Alphabet is about making money from its artificial intelligence investments. Considering Alphabet's shares are down about 13% since the beginning of October, now is a good time for investors to consider snatching up shares of this AI leader.Most artificial intelligence is still young. But it seems clear that AI is poised to continue positively disrupting the world as we know it in the coming years. From Splunk's recent pullback and upcoming quarterly report, to the growing influence of IBM's strategic imperatives, and the impending launch of Waymo's commercial self-driving vehicle service for Alphabet, we think investors would be wise to keep a close eye on these three companies in November.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

To the contrary, at least two analysts weighed in with  notes even as it fell.On Oct. 4, 2018, for example, KeyBanc analyst Liz Verity increased her per-share price target by $12 to $132 -- a nearly 40% premium from today's prices -- and reiterated her \"outperform\" rating on Splunk stock. Verity cited the potential for Splunk to continue gaining customers by expanding use cases for its leading operational intelligence platform.The following day, BMO Capital's Keith Bachman reaffirmed his own \"outperform\" rating and $133-per-share price target, echoing the use case argument and noting that double-digit percent growth in attendees of Splunk's latest user conference indicates continued high interest in its products.It likely didn't help that Splunk had already soared 40% through the first nine months of 2018, including a  following its 15th straight quarterly earnings beat. Of course, Splunk could resume its upward trajectory if it makes it 16 straight with its next (fiscal third-quarter 2019) report later this month. Until then, however, I think long-term investors would do well to remember that Splunk's decline last month had nothing to do with the relative strength of its underlying business.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The consensus mark for revenues currently stands at $536 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 51.2%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Momo is benefiting from an expanding paying user base and improving engagement levels, driven by solid content and product innovation.In the last reported quarter, monthly active users (MAUs) were 108 million, increasing 18% year over year and representing a 4.7 million net addition from the previous quarter. Per user time spent per day grew 11% on a year-over-year basis. | Moreover, value-added service revenues for the Momo app more than doubled on a year-over-year basis. The addition of Tantan along with strong demand for virtual gifting businesses is expected to drive revenues.Additionally, the momentum in live video business is expected to continue based on growing number of paid users and professional broadcasters.However, weakness in the mobile games business is a headwind. Further, operating expenses, particularly marketing expenses, are expected to jump due to Tantan.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  . The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Momo has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Here are some companies, which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Burlington Stores  has an Earnings ESP of +2.95% and a Zacks Rank #2.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of software that helps companies collect and analyze internal data is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +82.4%.Revenues are expected to be $432.27 million, up 31.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Splunk, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +10.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Splunk will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Splunk would post earnings of $0.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.08, delivering a surprise of +60%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Splunk appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new December 28th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $94.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $102.84/share today.Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SPLK stock at the current price level of $102.84/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $104.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.96% if the stock gets called away at the December 28th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPLK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SPLK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $104.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $104.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

But slow and steady can be a bit boring. Investors looking for stocks to buy, as a rule, should focus on high-quality, and preferably, lower-risk issues.Still, there's room in any investor's portfolio for higher-risk, higher-reward plays - as long as those risks are understood.In that vein, here are 10 stocks to buy that offer potentially significant rewards \u2026 and almost as much risk. None of these stocks should be a core part of a portfolio, and all have the potential to blow up in your face.But taking those risks also creates the possibility of a major reward. It's likely at least a few of these stocks will wind up big winners going forward. (NYSE:  ) is doing a lot better this year - up just shy of 20%.Yet, Teva has too much debt and too little growth. Its key drug, Copaxone, which treats multiple sclerosis, is facing generic competition from  (NASDAQ:  ), among others. Bankruptcy likely isn't a near-term scenario - but the current trajectory suggests it could occur down the line. In short, TEVA is a classic contrarian, \"buy when there's blood in the streets\" type of play. And there are reasons to take the risk in TEVA stock.While pressure has persisted on generic drugs, but it won't last forever.The company has sold assets to clean up its balance sheet, which has de-risked the story somewhat. In my opinion, Teva is a better version of Valeant, but with an easier path back to normalcy.It's a risky path, but if it works TEVA could gain another 20%-plus simply by reaching a higher multiple and removing bankruptcy fears.The story already has played out somewhat at  (NASDAQ:  ), which has corrected 50% so far this year. But the growth story isn't necessarily over.Only a few years ago, Scientific Games was a sleepy, low-growth provider of lottery tickets and terminals. But in quick succession, SciGames acquired slot machine manufacturers WMS Industries and Bally Technologies, the latter coming only months after Bally bought equipment maker and gaming table designer Shuffle Master. Scientific Games became the dominant supplier to the casino industry worldwide - a \"one-stop shop\" for casino floors.It also became one of the most indebted companies in the U.S. markets - and still is. The company has a whopping $8 billion in debt, and even with improved results, its debt-EBITDA ratio is above 6X. The combination of that debt and careful cost controls at casinos, particularly in the U.S., kept SGMS stock below $10 as recently as a year ago.But it now looks like the long-awaited \"replacement cycle\" of slot machines is arriving - and that could be hugely beneficial for Scientific Games and its smaller, similar rival  (NYSE:  ). And considering how much leverage is still on the balance sheet, there's a case for SGMS to clear $100 - yes, $100 - if profit growth accelerates.That's not a guarantee, obviously, but it's the nature of highly indebted companies. Leverage is a weight when those companies struggle, and it's a springboard when they grow.In the case of  (NYSE:  ), leverage has been a weight. And after optimism about stable energy prices and Chesapeake's improved balance sheet boosted CHK stock last year, it's been nothing but downhill. CHK now trades at a seven-month low.But I still think CHK is the best, if riskiest, play on higher energy prices. At the least, Chesapeake has bought itself more time for those prices to work higher. It's also worth pointing out that Chesapeake bonds actually have been rather stable so far this year. Efficiency improvements at the wellhead have lowered costs as well.Chesapeake is a risky play, but the combination of debt on the balance sheet and leverage from higher energy prices mean that with a couple of changes, CHK could soar. (NASDAQ:  ), on the other hand, isn't the cheapest stock in its space - or anywhere else. The high-flying \"operational intelligence\" software provider still trades at nearly 8X revenue, and 81X 2018 analyst EPS estimates.The valuation alone shows the risk in SPLK, which has pulled back from brief early-2014 highs above $100. But since that pullback, SPLK stock actually has been rather stable, as investors give the company time to grow into its valuation. And grow it does, with fiscal Q2 revenue growth of 32% driving a  .Meanwhile, Splunk continues to be a likely acquisition target, with  (NASDAQ:  ) cited as a potential buyer in June and  (NYSE:  ) long thought to be a logical acquirer.Splunk is a classic growth stock in that it, too, is high-risk and high-reward. But it looks like one of the better growth stocks in what might be an over-aggressive market at the moment.The shipping space generally has been a \"Bermuda Triangle\" for investor capital, but  (NYSE:  ) might be the exception to the rule.There's likely to be some near-term volatility, as  (NYSE:  ) files for bankruptcy in the coming weeks. And Ship Finance's dividend, which currently yields 11%, could be at risk in that scenario.But this also remains one of the best plays in shipping, available for a modest premium to book value and at low-teens multiple to earnings. The industry alone, and a heavily leveraged balance sheet, both show the risk.But if Ship Finance can make it through some choppy waters over the next few months, there's likely a nice return for shareholders on the other side.There's no sector of the market more boom-and-bust than biotech and drug development.  (NASDAQ:  ) doubles down on that volatility by developing its drugs from marijuana.But GW Pharmaceuticals isn't some fly-by-night penny stock based on legalized weed. It's a $2.6 billion pharmaceutical company with a legitimate lead product candidate in Epidiolex, aimed to treat Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Sativex, used to treat multiple sclerosisSativex, used to treat multiple sclerosis spasticity, already is on the market. And another compound has potential uses to fight epilepsy and treat autism spectrum disorders.Like most drug development plays, GWPH is high-risk. But there's reason for investors to hold long-term optimism toward the company's pipeline. Success in getting those drugs to market likely would make GWPH an acquisition target at some point. That in turn, would suggest likely significant upside from current levels for GWPH stock, which analysts see surging near 30%.That in turn, would suggest likely significant upside from current levels for GWPH stock.Considering that solar power actually is gaining an increasing share of the U.S. market, in particular, it's surprising that solar stocks including  (NASDAQ:  ) actually haven't done all that well. SolarCity had to be rescued by  (NASDAQ:  ).  (NASDAQ:  ) is down from multi-year highs despite the recent strength.There are risks for CSIQ, in particular. \"Commoditization\" and price pressure could hit margins. The company is rolling out a \"yieldco\" in Japan later this year, which will bring in cash - but a poorly-received IPO of that REIT could impact valuation.Still, demand for CSIQ equipment is growing, the stock isn't terribly highly valued, and it's lagged of late while FSLR, in particular, has risen. Solar stocks are likely to stay choppy for a while - but CSIQ should have some room to run if it can get through the second half of the year. (NYSE:  ) is trading at its lowest levels in six years. And yet shipments of the company's aluminum wheels hit a record in the second quarter.There's a reason for the disconnect. Auto parts stocks as a whole have come down of late, driven by  in the space. Superior itself has had a couple of missteps that impacted margins, and profits. And with SUP one of the more indebted companies in the sector, both factors have had an amplified impact on Superior's share price.But there's a reason to see a reversal as well. Near-term auto sales may be coming down, particularly in the U.S. A recent acquisition of European supplier UNIWHEELS improved Superior's position overseas. And there is room to improve execution, and hopefully, margins, going forward.SUP does have potential downside risk, particularly if global macro concerns arise, pressuring auto sales and dropping SUP earnings further. But for contrarians who think the auto parts selloff is overdone, SUP is one of the more intriguing plays. (NYSE:  ) is another growth stock with a high valuation and a big opportunity. The company began as an online textbook rental company. But it wound up outsourcing that business to another provider and since has focused on becoming the dominant digital platform for U.S. college students.And Chegg is having some success. Revenues are growing and adjusted EBITDA has turned positive after years of losses. The company's tutors and study services businesses are growing rapidly, and it's becoming a fixture in the college landscape.There are risks here beyond valuation. Like so many companies, Amazon is a potential competitor down the line, given its efforts to offer free Prime services to college students. But at this point, it might simply be easier for Amazon to buy Chegg, rather than expend the resources to try and fight it.With each passing quarter, Chegg gets more and more entrenched. And that only serves to strengthen the bull case for CHGG stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["mid uncertainty surrounding the trade war and mid-term election, the technology sector, which saw brutal trading this month, is sizzling hot once again following the mega merger deal. This is especially true given that International Business Machines  has agreed to acquire the software company Red Hat Inc.  for $34 billion in all-cash deal in in the biggest acquisition of its 100-year history.Under the terms of the deal, IBM would be paying $190 per share in cash for Red Hat, nearly 63% premium to the Oct 26 closing price and a roughly 7% premium to the 52-week high that it set in June. The transaction, expected to close in the second half of 2019, has been approved by the boards of directors of both IBM and Red Hat but is yet to get approval of Red Hat shareholders as well as U.S. regulators (read:  ).If approved, this would be the third-largest tech deal after Dell Technologies buyout of EMC for $67 billion in 2016 and the $41 billion acquisition of SDL by JDS Uniphase in 2000, excluding the AOL-Time Warner merger.The deal will be a big leap for IBM and is a game-changer in the fast-growing and lucrative cloud market. Per IBM Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, \"IBM will become the world's #1 hybrid cloud provider, offering companies the only open cloud solution that will unlock the full value of the cloud for their businesses.\" IBM said it remains \"committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings\" and will target a leverage profile consistent with \"a mid to high single-A\" grade.Additionally, the acquisition will reinforce IBM's high-value model. It will accelerate IBM's revenue growth, gross margin and free cash flow within 12 months of closing. It also will support a solid and growing dividend. However, the tech giant intends to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021.Though the acquisition is the best way for IBM to capture a greater share of the cloud market in the coming years per CEO Ginni Rometty, the huge premium paid for the deal pushed the IBM shares to the lowest level since Feb 11, 2016 at the close. The high price is view as reducing spending, cutting share buybacks, and has even drawn negative attention from credit rating agencies. The S&P downgraded IBM to A from A+, following the merger announcement while Moody's placed its A1 rating under review for downgrade. IBM saw massive trading volume of 20.5 million on the day compared with average daily volume of 5 million.On the other hand, Red Hat shares spiked more than 45% to close the day while share volume of nearly 31 million crushed the average daily volume figure of 1.9 million shares (see:  ).The news led to the surge in software stocks like Pivotal Software  , Splunk  , Hortonworks  , Nutanix  , Workday  , Dropbox  and Zscaler  in anticipation that number of cloud M&A might be on the way. The premium valuation for Red Hat makes them more attractive.The announced acquisition has put the spotlight on the ETFs having higher exposure to the IBM. Below we have highlighted these in detail and could be compelling choices to tap the IBM-Red Hat deal.This fund provides exposure to dividend payers within the technology sector by tracking the Nasdaq Technology Dividend Index.

The tech sector has endured some pretty tough times of late. Even  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ), the big tech daddy, is now down on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile  (NASDAQ:  ) has lost a whopping 22% in just the last three months.But if we put these troubles aside for a moment and focus on the longer-term outlook, a different picture emerges. Stretching out to 2025, some of these big-name tech stocks begin to look very attractive indeed - especially at current price levels.In order to pinpoint which tech stocks will be leading the way seven years from now, I turned to a recent report from RBC Capital. Its \"Imagine 2025\" portfolio selects the tech stocks the firm believes will be winning on a long-term basis. \"We believe the following names are best positioned to outperform over a seven-year time horizon through 2025\" writes the firm.What does this mean for now? It means longer-term investors should think twice before selling the stocks listed below, while other investors may want to keep a close eye on the following stocks as potential buy on the dip opportunities.So as we head towards the end of a rocky 2018, here are the top tech stocks primed to outperform over the next few years. Let's take a closer look now:As I said above, Alphabet has not been immune to the market's recent choppiness.But at the end of the day this is still a killer stock pick with a \"strong buy\" analyst consensus on  . This is with a $1,347 average analyst price target (27% upside potential).\"AMZN and GOOGL, in particular, appear to have invested the most in AI competencies and have the Big Data access and Compute Power infrastructure to benefit most from AI and ML developments\" writes RBC Capital.And Google has an extra string on its bow: its self-driving car unit Waymo. Alphabet most recently disclosed that Waymo reached the 10 million miles of autonomous vehicle driving milestone.\"GOOGL appears particularly well situated to lead autonomous vehicle innovations, given its substantial investments in Waymo autonomous vehicle technology\" cheers the firm.Luckily for Alphabet, RBC believes autonomous vehicles will be arguably one of the biggest applications of AI. Interested in GOOGL stock?  (NASDAQ:  ) is pushing the boundaries of technology - and this should pay off over the years to come.Even though Nvidia is suffering short-term setbacks (i.e. weak fiscal Q4 guidance due to high GPU inventory from soft crypto demand) the long-term picture remains very compelling.For example, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis (  ) calls the January quarter a setback. However he says Nvidia remains \"a top play on secular themes\" in AI, gaming and autonomous vehicles. He tells investors to \"buy the confession.\" Indeed his $246 price target suggests near-60% upside potential from current levels.\"While there are no guarantees of a winner in the AI race, we think Nvidia is well ahead of its peers and is continuing to gain traction due primarily to the value of Cuda software\" says RBC Capital. It estimates over one million engineers working with Cuda and calls it \"the secret sauce that underlies the entire ecosystem.\" You probably aren't surprised to see  (NASDAQ:  ) on this list. The e-commerce company is consistently innovating for the future, be it through acquisitions, technology or entering new markets.One interesting advancement for the company is in the field of robotics. \"Amazon appears particularly well situated to lead robotics innovations, given its ongoing investment in Kiva logistics robots\" points out RBC Capital.The company already deploys something to the tune of 100K Kiva robots - basically a robot army. And it's now looking increasingly likely that a very large percentage of Amazon's distribution workforce will be complemented with these robots by 2025.As RBC concludes, the impact of this should be greater operational efficiency for AMZN stock.Another interesting trend to consider: AI-powered Voice Recognition will likely improve significantly from current levels, allowing even better use of internet apps via voice commands. Again, Amazon should be a major beneficiary of this trend.Notably, AMZN boasts one of the best ratings on the Street. Out of 37 analysts polled, only one is sidelined on the stock. This comes with a $2,165 average analyst price target (36% upside potential). If you are looking for a cheaper long-term stock, look no further.  (NASDAQ:  ) uses a unique data- and analytics-driven approach to cyber security. And it is currently looking like a steal at under $30.The stock is highlighted by RBC as an attractive name in the cybersecurity space, particularly following the recent acquisition of Komand. The company snapped up Komand in 2017 to boost its security orchestration and automation offering.\"The need for well-designed security and IT automation solutions is acute; resources are scarce, environments are becoming more complex, all while threats are increasing,\" says Corey Thomas, CEO of Rapid7.\"Security and IT solutions must evolve through context-driven automation, allowing cybersecurity and IT professionals to focus on more strategic activities.\"Plus RBC's Matthew Hedberg (  ) has just ramped up his RPD price target to $42 (43% upside potential) citing rapid growth. \"Success has continued to highlight the power of the platform approach with impressive cross-sell metrics driven by combining security and IT Ops\" concludes the analyst. \"Within our software universe, we would highlight  (NASDAQ:  ) as a likely winner in the big data category\" writes RBC Capital.Splunk basically turns machine data into answers. It produces software for searching, monitoring and analyzing machine-generated big data, via a web-style interface.In part, these answers are generated through the firm's machine learning system. Splunk provides the Machine Learning Toolkit, a guided workbench to create and test flexible models that can handle any use case.\"A key value of creating models in Splunk is that users can seamlessly apply them to real-time machine data\" says RBC Capital.Plus RBC isn't the only firm singing the stock's praises. This \"strong buy\" stock is the recipient of 21 recent buy ratings vs just three hold ratings. Meanwhile the $134 average analyst price target speaks of upside potential of over 40%. If we turn to financial tech stocks, analysts are going crazy for \"strong buy\" stock  (NASDAQ:  ) right now. This is with a $100 average analyst price target (24% upside potential).First of all, PayPal offers massive scale. And second it boasts a unique two-sided model among tech stocks, with both consumers and merchants onside. This means the company can control the entire consumer experience.\"PayPal's unique assets enable the company to tap into the long-term global shift to digital commerce\" says RBC Capital.Plus the firm sees the company as a champion of democratizing finance around the globe. \"We believe its growing platform of assets will open up the ~2B people around the world who lack financial services.\"Similarly top Oppenheimer analyst Glenn Greene (  ) notes PYPL's \"unique\" competitive position. He is even more confident in the stock following recent partnerships, and anticipates high-teens revenue growth and 20%-plus EPS growth for the next several years.  (NASDAQ:  ) is trading down 20% on a three-month basis. You can blame worries of weak demand and threats of tariffs for Apple products - and yes, the controversial decision to hide individual iPhone sales data was hard to swallow.But nonetheless, RBC Capital sees a long runway for the stock. \"We think AAPL could be a major beneficiary of AI and VR/AR-related trends, which could generate significant tailwinds for its services business\" it writes. It notes that the latest iPhones are equipped with the ability to recognize patterns, make predictions and learn from experiences.What's even more interesting is that by 2025 we could be looking at the first real \"iPhone generation.\" 2025 is 18 years from the launch of the first iPhone. For people who grew up with iOS devices, Apple could have data on every app a person installed, on every flight, book and purchase, as well as academic records, health statistics, family background and more.Now imagine an AI trained on this data set. \"This AI would truly be a 'personal' assistant. A hyper -customized neural network that would be so powerful, it would make an existing services pool very strong and usher in a host of new offerings that can only be imagined\" says the firm. This chip stock is pretty much a guaranteed winner of future tech trends. Someone needs to design AI chips - and that someone is  (NASDAQ:  ).Synopsys is essentially an \"arms dealer\" for AI and all things chip related says RBC Capital.\"By helping design complex chips, Synopsys is in the thick of AI in terms of design\" the firm writes. And the best part is that it doesn't even matter what new companies come along - they will still need Synopsys.\"As new and existing companies continue to push the edge of technology, Synopsys will be helping the companies design each chip regardless of it being a GPU, CPU, FPGA, Digital Chip, Analog chip or otherwise\" the firm explains.Even now, the stock looks bullish with a \"strong buy\" analyst consensus and $109 average analyst price target (24% upside potential). A second chip stock to consider:  (NASDAQ:  ). All future trends result in data creation - and Micron is perfectly positioned for this with its DRAM/NAND memory portfolio.\"The incredible amount of data generated by AI, AR/VR and autonomous driving would require significantly higher memory, both NAND and DRAM, leading to strong and long-term tailwinds for MU\" writes RBC Capital.Plus we could be looking at a compelling entry point. Indeed, Deutsche Bank's Sidney Ho (  ) points out that shares appear cheaper right now. He has just reiterated his \"buy\" rating with a $60 price target (63% upside potential).After it has traded for nearly a year at 4x earnings, Ho believes that \"the market is pricing in consensus EPS estimates will have to come down from the current level, considering the stock historically has traded at a median of 8-9x P/E through the cycle.\"And the tech stock still retains its \"moderate buy\" analyst consensus rating. This is with a $61 price target (64% upside potential). Last but not least, make sure to make room for  (NASDAQ:  ). This is a company that ticks all the boxes when it comes to future trends.\"Leading hyperscale hybrid cloud platform with big runway of growth in AI, IoT, Gaming and other services\" explains RBC on the stock's inclusion in its 2025 portfolio.Like GOOGL and AMZN, MSFT stock benefits from 1) massive amounts of raw compute power; 2) large data sets; and 3) ability to hire the smartest data scientists on the planet.It picks Microsoft as the No. 1 AI company in the public cloud space. This is thanks to the company's rapidly growing Azure cloud platform.\"We believe Microsoft is in an enviable position vs other public cloud competitors as their customers can also leverage AI and ML capabilities on premise, something [Amazon's] AWS and [Google's] GCP can't deliver natively\" points out RBC Capital.Also note the stock's killer \"strong buy\" rating with 20 out of 21 analysts bullish on the stocks prospects. Top this off with a $124 average analyst price target for upside of 17% and I would say Microsoft is one of the most appealing tech stocks to buy and hold onto!

This is especially true given that International Business Machines  has agreed to acquire the software company Red Hat Inc.  for $34 billion in all-cash deal in in the biggest acquisition of its 100-year history.Under the terms of the deal, IBM would be paying $190 per share in cash for Red Hat, nearly 63% premium to the Oct 26 closing price and a roughly 7% premium to the 52-week high that it set in June. The transaction, expected to close in the second half of 2019, has been approved by the boards of directors of both IBM and Red Hat but is yet to get approval of Red Hat shareholders as well as U.S. regulators (read:  ).If approved, this would be the third-largest tech deal after Dell Technologies buyout of EMC for $67 billion in 2016 and the $41 billion acquisition of SDL by JDS Uniphase in 2000, excluding the AOL-Time Warner merger.The deal will be a big leap for IBM and is a game-changer in the fast-growing and lucrative cloud market. Per IBM Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, \"IBM will become the world's #1 hybrid cloud provider, offering companies the only open cloud solution that will unlock the full value of the cloud for their businesses.\" IBM said it remains \"committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings\" and will target a leverage profile consistent with \"a mid to high single-A\" grade.Additionally, the acquisition will reinforce IBM's high-value model. It will accelerate IBM's revenue growth, gross margin and free cash flow within 12 months of closing. It also will support a solid and growing dividend. However, the tech giant intends to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021.Though the acquisition is the best way for IBM to capture a greater share of the cloud market in the coming years per CEO Ginni Rometty, the huge premium paid for the deal pushed the IBM shares to the lowest level since Feb 11, 2016 at the close. The high price is view as reducing spending, cutting share buybacks, and has even drawn negative attention from credit rating agencies. The S&P downgraded IBM to A from A+, following the merger announcement while Moody's placed its A1 rating under review for downgrade. IBM saw massive trading volume of 20.5 million on the day compared with average daily volume of 5 million.On the other hand, Red Hat shares spiked more than 45% to close the day while share volume of nearly 31 million crushed the average daily volume figure of 1.9 million shares (see:  ).The news led to the surge in software stocks like Pivotal Software  , Splunk  , Hortonworks  , Nutanix  , Workday  , Dropbox  and Zscaler  in anticipation that number of cloud M&A might be on the way. The premium valuation for Red Hat makes them more attractive.The announced acquisition has put the spotlight on the ETFs having higher exposure to the IBM.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new December 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $87.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $96.22/share today.Because the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SPLK stock at the current price level of $96.22/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $97.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.02% if the stock gets called away at the December 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPLK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SPLK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $97.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $97.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.1, after changing hands as low as $94.78 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 37.4.

Even during some of the worst decades in the U.S. stock market (like the time period  of 2008), winners can be found if investors exercise patience.For some up-and-coming stocks, though, holding for years can mean returns that far outpace that of the broader stock market. It's all about finding names that are benefiting from long-term trends in the business world, and then giving them time to do their thing. Three such candidates are  (NYSE: TDOC) ,  (NASDAQ: SPLK) , and  (NYSE: VNE) . Here's why three contributors think they have a year's worth of clear skies ahead of them. Health care provider Teladoc is on a tear this year. The stock is up 84% as of this writing after pulling off of all-time highs that had its year-to-date return reach as high as 140% over the summer. The reason? The leader in phone- and internet-based health has been  -- up 41% over the last 12 months -- as it adds new insurers, employers, and participants to its platform.A compelling advantage Teladoc has over its competition isn't just its size; it's also the only comprehensive virtual healthcare provider that spans the globe. Teladoc has expanded its portfolio of services both organically and through acquisition, covering everything from general medical treatment to mental health to pediatrics and everything in between. Teladoc even boasts virtual-assisted lab testing, oncology, and medical triage.Teladoc's technology-driven platform helps save money, is convenient for patients, and is creating better patient outcomes -- all much needed in today's complicated and expensive healthcare landscape. Besides a shakeup of the status quo, Teladoc has something else going for it: It's still small potatoes. Its market cap is only $4.8 billion even after this year's big run-up, and trailing one-year revenues are at $329 million.Full-year 2018 revenues are expected to clear $400 million, though, showing that the days of fast growth are still here. Total paid membership is just under 23 million, and quarterly doctor visits and consultations barely clear half a million. That is a tiny fraction of the global healthcare industry. With momentum building for Teladoc's tech-enabled services, this company should be a lot bigger in a decade than it is today.Image source: Getty Images. : The internet provides a wealth of data and information.

It does so using artificial intelligence and machine learning, giving it the opportunity to quickly adapt its tools and processes to new situations. Splunk is so well regarded in its ability to turn data into insights and insights into actions that it's actually used to protect America's nuclear security at Sandia National Laboratories .Despite the fact that it has established itself as a leader in AI, machine learning, and leveraging data to help companies make better decisions faster, Splunk still has growth opportunities ahead of it. Analysts expect it to earn $1.10 per share in 2019 and to be able to compound its earnings at around a 35% rate over the next five years . That it's an already established leader with so much opportunity gives reason to believe that the next decade could provide some spectacular growth for Splunk. : It's been a tough October for Veoneer investors who have watched the stock price spiral lower.Data by  .While the plunging stock price looks bad, the truth is simply that investors were still figuring out how to value the stock after its Jun 29, 2018 spin-off from  . The spin-off was a smart move and enables Veoneer to  , but it also sent the stock into overvalued territory. Even after the recent declines, Morningstar.com still has Veoneer pegged at a 36% premium to its $24 fair value estimate.The recent decline came after management dropped a couple of gloomy notes during the third-quarter conference call. Production delays, harsher regulations, and slowing demand sent management's full-year sales estimates from a 3% decline to a steeper 5% decline. Management also noted the company was unlikely to hit its $3 billion sales target for 2020. But there was a silver lining in the bad news: Although Veoneer might miss its 2020 sales target, management actually sees upside to its $4 billion-by-2022 sales target.The upside to its 2022 target is based on the strength of its active safety portfolio -- think radar, cameras for driver assist systems, night vision, and other positioning/restraint systems -- which is expected to be the growth engine of the company. Its portfolio is positioned to thrive as the average active safety content in each vehicle is expected to jump to $225 by 2025. That's five times the current average value.Driverless cars are coming, and the need for innovative solutions to design and produce them will be in high demand. Veoneer recently hit a speed bump and might take a little longer to reach its growth goals, but as the active safety content in each vehicle increases, the company is definitely poised for huge growth over the next decade and longer.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Its key drug, Copaxone, which treats multiple sclerosis, is facing generic competition from  (NASDAQ:  ), among others. Bankruptcy likely isn't a near-term scenario - but the current trajectory suggests it could occur down the line. In short, TEVA is a classic contrarian, \"buy when there's blood in the streets\" type of play. And there are reasons to take the risk in TEVA stock.While pressure has persisted on generic drugs, but it won't last forever.The company has sold assets to clean up its balance sheet, which has de-risked the story somewhat. In my opinion, Teva is a better version of Valeant, but with an easier path back to normalcy.It's a risky path, but if it works TEVA could double simply by reaching a higher multiple and removing bankruptcy fears.The story already has played out somewhat at  (NASDAQ:  ), which has risen a whopping 150% so far this year. But that story isn't necessarily over - even if the elevated stock price might add a bit of risk.Only a few years ago, Scientific Games was a sleepy, low-growth provider of lottery tickets and terminals. But in quick succession, SciGames acquired slot machine manufacturers WMS Industries and Bally Technologies, the latter coming only months after Bally bought equipment maker and gaming table designer Shuffle Master. Scientific Games became the dominant supplier to the casino industry worldwide - a \"one-stop shop\" for casino floors.It also became one of the most indebted companies in the U.S. markets - and still is. The company has a whopping $8.2 billion in debt, and even with improved results, its debt-EBITDA ratio is above 6X. The combination of that debt and careful cost controls at casinos, particularly in the U.S., kept SGMS stock below $10 as recently as a year ago.But it now looks like the long-awaited \"replacement cycle\" of slot machines is arriving - and that could be hugely beneficial for Scientific Games and its smaller, similar rival  (NYSE:  ). And considering how much leverage is still on the balance sheet, there's a case for SGMS to clear $100 - yes, $100 - if profit growth accelerates.That's not a guarantee, obviously, but it's the nature of highly indebted companies. Leverage is a weight when those companies struggle, and it's a springboard when they grow.In the case of  (NYSE:  ), leverage has been a weight. And after optimism about stable energy prices and Chesapeake's improved balance sheet boosted CHK stock last year, it's been nothing but downhill. CHK now trades at a 14-month low.But I still think CHK is the best, if riskiest,  . At the least, Chesapeake has bought itself more time for those prices to work higher. It's also worth pointing out that Chesapeake bonds actually have been rather stable so far this year. Efficiency improvements at the wellhead have lowered costs as well.Chesapeake is a risky play, but the combination of debt on the balance sheet and leverage from higher energy prices mean that with a couple of changes, CHK could soar. (NASDAQ:  ), on the other hand, isn't the cheapest stock in its space - or anywhere else. The high-flying \"operational intelligence\" software provider still trades at nearly 8X revenue, and 81X 2018 analyst EPS estimates.The valuation alone shows the risk in SPLK, which has pulled back from brief early-2014 highs above $100. But since that pullback, SPLK stock actually has been rather stable, as investors give the company time to grow into its valuation. And grow it does, with fiscal Q2 revenue growth of 32% driving a  .Meanwhile, Splunk continues to be a likely acquisition target, with  (NASDAQ:  ) cited as a potential buyer in June and  (NYSE:  ) long thought to be a logical acquirer.Splunk is a classic growth stock in that it, too, is high-risk and high-reward. But it looks like one of the better growth stocks in what might be an over-aggressive market at the moment.The shipping space generally has been a \"Bermuda Triangle\" for investor capital, but  (NYSE:  ) might be the exception to the rule.There's likely to be some near-term volatility, as  (NYSE:  ) files for bankruptcy in the coming weeks. And Ship Finance's dividend, which currently yields 13%, could be at risk in that scenario.But this also remains one of the best plays in shipping, available for a modest premium to book value and at low-teens multiple to earnings. The industry alone, and a heavily leveraged balance sheet, both show the risk.But if Ship Finance can make it through some choppy waters over the next few months, there's likely a nice return for shareholders on the other side.There's no sector of the market more boom-and-bust than biotech and drug development.  (NASDAQ:  ) doubles down on that volatility by developing its drugs  .But GW Pharmaceuticals isn't some fly-by-night penny stock based on legalized weed. It's a $2.6 billion pharmaceutical company with a legitimate lead product candidate in Epidiolex, aimed to treat Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Sativex, used to treat multiple sclerosisSativex, used to treat multiple sclerosis spasticity, already is on the market. And another compound has potential uses to fight epilepsy and treat autism spectrum disorders.Like most drug development plays, GWPH is high-risk. But there's reason for investors to hold long-term optimism toward the company's pipeline. Success in getting those drugs to market likely would make GWPH an acquisition target at some point. That in turn, would suggest likely significant upside from current levels for GWPH stock.That in turn, would suggest likely significant upside from current levels for GWPH stock.Given that solar power actually is gaining an increasing share of the U.S. market, in particular, it's surprising that solar stocks including  (NASDAQ:  ) actually haven't done all that well. SolarCity had to be rescued by  (NASDAQ:  ).  (NASDAQ:  ) is down from multi-year highs despite the recent strength.There are risks for CSIQ, in particular. \"Commoditization\" and price pressure could hit margins. The company is rolling out a \"yieldco\" in Japan later this year, which will bring in cash - but a poorly-received IPO of that REIT could impact valuation.Still, demand for CSIQ equipment is growing, the stock isn't terribly highly valued, and it's lagged of late while FSLR, in particular, has risen. Solar stocks are likely to stay choppy for a while - but CSIQ should have some room to run if it can get through the second half of the year. (NYSE:  ) is trading at its lowest levels in six years. And yet shipments of the company's aluminum wheels hit a record in the second quarter.There's a reason for the disconnect. Auto parts stocks as a whole have come down of late, driven by  in the space. Superior itself has had a couple of missteps that impacted margins, and profits. And with SUP one of the more indebted companies in the sector, both factors have had an amplified impact on Superior's share price.But there's a reason to see a reversal as well. Near-term auto sales may be coming down, particularly in the U.S. But at less than 8x forward EPS, SUP stock isn't exactly pricing in explosive growth. A recent acquisition of European supplier UNIWHEELS improved Superior's position overseas. And there is room to improve execution, and hopefully, margins, going forward.SUP does have potential downside risk, particularly if global macro concerns arise, pressuring auto sales and dropping SUP earnings further. But for contrarians who think the auto parts selloff is overdone, SUP is one of the more intriguing plays. (NYSE:  ) is another growth stock with a high valuation and a big opportunity. The company began as an online textbook rental company. But it wound up outsourcing that business to another provider and since has focused on becoming the dominant digital platform for U.S. college students.And Chegg is having some success. Revenues are growing and adjusted EBITDA has turned positive after years of losses. The company's tutors and study services businesses are growing rapidly, and it's becoming a fixture in the college landscape.There are risks here beyond valuation. Like so many companies, Amazon is a potential competitor down the line, given its efforts to offer free Prime services to college students. But at this point, it might simply be easier for Amazon to buy Chegg, rather than expend the resources to try and fight it.With each passing quarter, Chegg gets more and more entrenched. And that only serves to strengthen the bull case for CHGG stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise more than 5% on the day.

The need to make sense of digital information is on the rise, helping Splunk strengthen its position as must-have software for today's enterprise. It's been a great run for the company in the last year, but its growth story is  .Data source: Splunk, Inc. YOY = year over year.The most important metric for the software company right now is its revenue growth. Concerns that sales were \"slowing\" cropped up in the  , but the current quarter's 39% headline represented an acceleration from the 37% at the beginning of the year. Also, the company signed up 550 new enterprise clients, handily topping the 460 brought on board at last report.Some of the names joining Splunk's platform included Southeast Asia's ride-sharing service  ,  , the U.S. Ministry of Defense, and  . The e-retail and cloud-computing giant was using Splunk piecemeal in various parts of its empire, but in the second quarter, it decided to sign an enterprise contract to use the data-parsing service across its whole business. That's a big win for Splunk -- and a vote of confidence in the value it brings to the table.Deals like these bode well for the company's continued strong growth. Recurring and renewable revenue, much of it in the form of  (SaaS), now makes up 72% of Splunk's total annual top-line, and it should reach 75% by year end -- a full year ahead of management's goal. While only a portion of subscription-based revenue is recognized up front, as Splunk brings more enterprises on board, it will enjoy more revenue later as customers pay their recurring bills.Image source: Getty Images.While sales are on a tear, the profit picture is a different story. Splunk has its foot on the gas to maximize its potential, and that means it's sacrificing the bottom line for now. Most of the elevated expense is related to sales force investment, which manifests itself as stock-based compensation. When you back that figure out, Splunk actually operates at a profit.The good news is that management has regularly reminded investors that this year would be a \"cash trough\" as it doubled down on efforts to support its transition to a higher recurring revenue model. Yet Splunk achieved  of $102 million through the first two quarters of the fiscal year. That's nearly double what it was last year, and management expects that number to continue to trend higher.Management has been very pleased with the early results from its  , VictorOps and Phantom.

In the company's second-quarter , management said new product and beta testing releases are forthcoming.As for guidance, full-year revenue estimates were bumped up to $1.685 billion (previously $1.645 billion).

But the real eye-popping growth numbers in the stock market come in multiples of years -- or decades. That's the time frame that better allows a company's competitive advantage to shine through and compound.With that ultra long term in mind, Motley Fool contributors today are turning the spotlight on a few stocks that they see as having a particularly promising outlook. Read on to see why  (NYSE: W) ,  (NASDAQ: SPLK) , and  (NASDAQ: JD) all deserve a spot on your watchlist. The home goods retailing market has a much smaller online penetration than other consumer categories like electronics and apparel. The niche poses difficult shipping challenges, after all, that make it tough to deliver consistently high customer service.Image source: Getty Images.Wayfair is making strides at meeting those challenges, in part by building out its own shipping infrastructure. And it is reaping the rewards in terms of significant market share growth. Sales have expanded by almost 50% in each of the last three quarters, accelerating to a 49% boost in the second quarter of 2018.The company isn't profitable today, and investors can expect management to continue prioritizing sales gains as Wayfair expands deeper into international markets. But that's not the same as saying any rival can achieve what Wayfair has.  tried to slow its growth through price cuts and increased marketing spending this year before quickly realizing that the challenge  .That's another piece of evidence suggesting Wayfair is building a durable business as its number of active buyers approaches 13 million and repeat orders  . Metrics like these point to continued market-thumping gains for the company as the home goods market shifts more toward online sales in the years to come. As the world goes digital and more devices get hooked up to the internet every year, Splunk's industry-leading big data parsing software only gets more lucrative. The company was founded in 2003, but the value of its  business has really found its groove in the last few years as enterprises try to make sense of the information their websites, digital systems, and devices create.Since the company went public in the spring of 2012, revenue has gone from about $100 million a year to $1.27 billion in 2017. The next big push is for $2 billion in annual revenue by 2020, and management expects to start turning an  for the first time later this year. As a result of all that growth, the stock has nearly doubled twice since its debut.Image source: Getty Images.The best could be yet to come for Splunk, though. The business is still relatively small, carrying a market cap of only $15 billion. However, that's big enough that Splunk has gotten hungry and went on an  streak over the last year -- scooping up smaller technology outfits to boost its own abilities in artificial intelligence and increase its efficacy in the fight against cyber crime. Plus, as high expenses to push all-out growth slowly begin to pare back, the bottom line could grow in dramatic fashion in the years ahead.With big data only getting bigger (the amount of digital information is supposed to grow by double digits for the indefinite future), Splunk looks like  .  The difference between JD.com and Chinese e-commerce rival  is that the latter is actually more like  than  .

But the e-tailer is going up against tough comparable sales numbers from the year-ago period and it just came off big promotional events in June and July.While it is true that Alibaba sucks a lot of the oxygen out of the room as it is estimated to control some 58% of all e-commerce in China, JD.com with a $47 billion market cap and $18.5 billion in quarterly sales is no shrinking violet. Further, even if its growth has eased up some, it's still posting phenomenal rates, and it has some important backing, including  ,  , and  .Its stock is down 36% from its 52-week high, marking a new low for the e-tailer, and it is trading at just a fraction of its sales.

Strong execution in the field drove great results in Q2, delivering $388 million in total revenue, up 39% over last year. Our success comes from new and existing customers expanding their adoption of Splunk as their platform for data analytics and machine learning, of course both on-prem and in the cloud.I'm on the road visiting with customers on a regular basis and the questions they ask revolve around leveraging their data to improve their customer engagement, secure their enterprises, deliver IT and app dev resiliency, and drive business results. All of their questions highlight the fact that if you don't know your data, you don't know your business. The real power of Splunk, what we do that no other technology does, is enable organizations to get answers from their data without having to know all the questions to ask beforehand. The answers come together as real insights to help them know their business.Data problems or requirements are constantly revolving so our customers need a solution that can adapt with them. The ability to investigate, monitor, and analyze all of their data across all of their technology in a continuous way that is constantly improving makes that possible. Our growth strategy of build by partner aligns this concept and we're investing to enable customers to effectively and quickly make decisions and to take actions in real time.In June, we announced our acquisition of VictorOps, a leader in DevOps incident management. By applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitoring, event management, and incident management data, Splunk and VictorOps will enable development and DevOps teams to more rapidly resolve incidents and learn from past actions to make proactive recommendations. We are thrilled to welcome the VictorOps team and to add another official Splunk site in Boulder, Colorado.Technologies such as VictorOps and Phantom play a big role as part of our broader Splunk story, empowering customers to detect a critical issue, alert the appropriate team, and take action automatically. I am pleased with the progress of how both companies are integrating into Splunk. Both the Phantom and VictorOps teams are a great cultural fit. They're talented, passionate about data, and focused on customer success.To make it easier to use Splunk and improve the time-to-value for our customers, we have released several updates to our Insights and Essentials offerings. Insights and Essentials decreased time-to-value for our customers as they address specific revenue or operating needs of an organization. And now they cover more than 200 specific use cases and have resulted in over 25,000 downloads from Splunk base.Our goal remains the same, which is to become the ubiquitous machine data platform, the standard in every organization, solving our customers' data challenges around IT operations and application delivery, security compliance and fraud, as well as business analytics and the internet of things. These markets are going through a shift to an analytics and machine learning based approach, where Splunk is uniquely poised to lead this challenge and deliver for our customers. It is increasingly apparent that Splunk's platform is the best solution for end-to-end investigations, which enable customers to gain operational intelligence by asking different questions of the same data across multiple use cases. I'm excited about the innovation that Tim and the product teams are working on. Stay tuned for more product and solution announcements at our upcoming user conference .conf.In Q2, we saw continued momentum, with our customers gaining value from both our Splunk platform and market group focus. Starting with IT ops and app delivery, wins in the quarter include ADP, a longtime customer who expanded their use of Splunk and Splunk IT Service Intelligence, or ITSI, to enable end-to-end business service visibility on key applications, to streamline product delivery, and to strengthen their overall offering. SMSGlobal, an Australian mobile messaging solutions provider, is using ITSI to help get full visibility into what their customers need and want, as well as understand system health. SMSGlobal is also using Splunk Enterprise Security, or ES, to support IT operations, improve security, and for PCI compliance.Moving to security, where we continue to help our customers migrate to an analytics-based approach. Security wins include California Public Utilities Commission, who expanded Splunk use by purchasing User Behavior Analytics. With UBA, the information technology staff expects to have better insight into known and unknown threats within their network.Grab, a Singapore-based ride-sharing service, is a new Splunk ES customer. Grab purchased Splunk for security monitoring and plans to expand its use cases in the future.The University of North Carolina at Greensboro has significantly expanded with Splunk, recently adding ES. We will help with increased operational and security intelligence and be a key part of meeting compliance and audit requirements.Long-time customer Worldpay bought ES and Phantom for the first time while also significantly expanding their use of Splunk Enterprise, all through the AWS marketplace. Splunk helps Worldpay improve merchant onboarding, rapidly resolve incidents, and better understand their customers by analyzing transactional data.Highlighting a handful of customers who standardize on Splunk as a machine data platform, Laboratory Corporation of America, or LabCorp, a leading healthcare diagnostics company, expanded their use of ES and ITSI to help ensure that their clinical laboratory network is always working and protected. With Splunk, LabCorp can keep their teams focused on innovation in key areas like patient testing for oncology, HIV genotyping, and more, and the company can consolidate the 130-plus tools they use today.The UK Ministry of Defence signed an enterprise adoption agreement for Splunk Enterprise, ES, and ITSI. The Splunk platform provides the Ministry of Defence one method of access to real-time protective and performance monitoring as part of its enterprise security and service management program.We also saw our cloud business continue its momentum. A sampling of our cloud wins in the quarter include Dartmouth College, who is a new Splunk Cloud customer. They replaced their previous data analytics tool because Splunk Cloud provides a platform that scales and can analyze data across their entire security and technology footprint. While Big Green will initially be using Splunk to improve their security analytics and sock efficiency, they also plan to utilize the platform in IT, as well as institutional research use cases.One of Australia's largest department stores bought Splunk Cloud to help protect their customers and their online shopping applications from cyber threats. Use cases include real-time security monitoring, advanced threat detection, forensics, and incident management.We also had some great wins in IoT. Belkin purchased Splunk in the quarter, as well as VicRoads, who is an Australian customer developing and managing the road network across Queensland. Splunk Enterprise and UBA help VicRoads protect their critical internet-connected road and infrastructure assets, including thousands of Bluetooth sensors that provide real-time monitoring and information on traffic congestion and throughput. The new expansion will enable VicRoads to help keep those IoT assets secure.Moving on to the ecosystem, longtime customer and partner Amazon signed an enterprise agreement with Splunk and our global partner Accenture expanded their use of Splunk by implementing our Phantom solution and piloting machine learning capabilities for their own operations, as well as for their My Wizard intelligent automation platform.I'm excited about the momentum around our strategic partnerships and also by the success of our reseller partners. Optiv, one of our top partners focused globally on cybersecurity, continued to experience accelerating growth at better than 5x the market growth rate for this segment. This growth is also a reflection of investments Optiv is making in their Splunk practice and the investments we are making in our partner ecosystem. SecureWare, one of the key channel partners in Australia, had a strong quarter, closing more than a dozen Splunk opportunities, including a new customer in the South Australian government.One of our top partner wins in the quarter was in South Asia by Bluesify Solutions, who won an opportunity with a large electric utility company in Malaysia. Bluesify replaced a legacy SIM by showing off the platform nature of Splunk and proving that Splunk goes far beyond security. Future potential use cases at this customer include IT ops and IoT.In summary, I'm proud of our first half performance and how we continue to deliver value to our customers, who, as always, remain our source of energy and inspiration. We are counting down to our biggest event of the year, .conf18, which runs from October 1-4 in Orlando, Florida. We are really excited about the innovation our product teams will be announcing, as well as welcoming our guest keynote speaker, Steve Wozniak. We hope to see all of you there.Again, thanks to all of our customers and partners and special thanks to all of our Splunkers. Now, let's turn the call over to our CFO, Dave Conte. -- Alright. Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I'm pleased to report that our momentum from the start of the year continued into the second quarter, with strong performance globally. I'm equally pleased to pass along that our transition to a mostly subscription or renewable model is accelerating faster than planned. More about that in a minute.On results, in Q2, total revenues were $388 million, a 39% increase over last year. Software revenues, which is the total of license and cloud, were up 43% from Q2 of last year, totaling $240 million. Cloud revenue was $39 million, up 90% over last year. Education and professional services represented 9% of total revenues and international operations contributed 31% of total Q2 revenues. And we added over 550 new customers and recorded 61 seven-figure orders during the quarter.Now, turning to profitability and other results, which are all non-GAAP. Operating income was $11.4 million, representing a positive margin of 3%, better than our plan, driven by our solid top line performance. Q2 overall gross margin was 82% comparable on a year-over-year basis. Net income was $11.7 million, or $0.08 per share using a weighted average share count of 151 million shares. Operating cash flow in Q2 was $34 million while free cash flow was $28 million. And we ended the period with about $900 million in cash and investments, reflecting the cash consideration paid for the VictorOps purchase during the quarter.As it relates to our go-to-market, since the beginning of the year we have continued our shift to a predominantly subscription or renewable model. Prior to fiscal '19, we realized between 40% and 50% of our software bookings from renewable or term and cloud contracts. As you know, we've been targeting a move to 65% renewable this fiscal year and 75% next year, driven by customer buying patterns and adjustments in our GTM and field incentive programs.Our efforts through the first half of the year have been more successful than we'd expected. Our year-to-date mix is already ahead of our full-year target and is, in fact, nearing next year's target. Specifically, for the first half of this year, our renewable mix for term and cloud transactions was 72% of total software bookings. Now, looking at the composition of our forecast, I expect this first half's success will continue through the second half of the year and expect we will achieve our 75% renewable target a year early.It's important to note that our customers are typically invoiced annually under a renewable contract versus up-front for perpetual transactions, consistent with our expectations for FY '19 cash flows, as we've discussed on prior calls.Now, a key benefit of mix overachievement is a more rapid build of our pool of cloud and renewable term contracts, which, as you know, provides higher predictability going forward. More importantly, these contract structures enable us to deliver on our No. 1 corporate priority around customer success by enabling our customers to ramp their use of Splunk in an efficient and predictable manner.So, with all the moving parts, what's the best way to evaluate our execution under 606? As I mentioned before, software revenue, i.e. the combo of license and cloud revenue, and RPO, or remaining performance obligation, are the best indicators of business momentum. Because RPO includes backlog, the total of revenue plus the change in RPO should provide a better estimate of in-period bookings than the traditional billings calculation.Now, on the RPO front, we ended Q2 with total RPO of $841 million, up from $525 million for Q2 of last year. For comparability, as we move into the second half of the current year, RPO in Q3 and Q4 of last year, fiscal '18, was $602 million and $801 million respectively. RPO for Q1 of fiscal '18 last year totaled $493 million. And, as you can see on the balance sheet, FY '18 RPO was about 20% higher than total deferred revenue, which is a good way to think about it.To provide additional 606 comparability, earlier this week we filed an 8-K, which contains full income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow detail by quarter for all of last year, all of which has been recast under 606. Okay. That's enough on 606.Alright, turning to guidance, we expect Q3 revenues of between $430 million and $432 million and non-GAAP operating margin of a positive 13%. For the full year, we're now expecting total revenues of approximately $1.685 billion, up from $1.645 billion, and we maintain our non-GAAP margin target of 11.5%. Since we expect to be non-GAAP profitable for the remaining quarters and for the full year, you should use fully weighted average share counts of 153 million in Q3, 155 million in Q4, and 152 million for the full year.In closing, the first half of the year was transformational in terms of our move to a highly predictable, renewable model, on the back of solid execution from Susan in the field and the company overall. As Doug mentioned, Tim and the product teams have been working aggressively on product innovations and are looking forward to having you all attend our upcoming .conf18, where we will showcase much of their work.Thanks so much for your time and interest. With that, we'll open it up for questions.Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press \"*1\" on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press \"#\". To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Strong quarter. Among other things, you did slightly increase the number of net adds. What are you doing in terms of go-to-market that's starting to work there? -- Hey, Michael. Thanks for the question. As we've said over and over, that whole framework of net news was a three-year cycle. And as we talked about over and over and over, coverage is the No. 1 thing that keeps me focused day in and day out. And what we've been doing on coverage, we've got this tough tension of the contribution from existing customers continues to be strong, and we want to maintain coverage within those customers, but we also have to free up coverage so that we can go after net news more effectively. And as I said, I think, in the Q4 or Q1 call, Susan has been moving for the past year and a half, and definitively at the start of this year, to start to carve out a true commercial segment that is predominantly, if not completely, focused on net news.So I think a chunk of that is we're seeing some of those field investments start to pay off, but we also have been working the product angle with Splunk Essentials, Splunk Insights, enhancements to Cloud, so that it becomes easier and more intuitive for customers that are not quite the deep dive experts that our current customers are to see value from Splunk. So I think the whole three-year framework was we know it takes time to shift field and field coverage. That's not something that is immediate. You can spring up business development teams, commercial teams, but they've got to come up to the productivity curve. And it takes time for the product enhancements to actually come to market and be tested and be adopted. So I think both of those, we saw the first light of that here this quarter and ideally we'll see that continued momentum as we continue to make those investments and learn and fine tune. -- Thanks, Dave. Excuse me, thanks, Doug. And, Dave, if I can get a follow-up. You obviously talked about the mix shift happening faster than expected. Should we be cautious at all about the impact on cash flow and/or that thing we don't talk about anymore called billings? -- Well, when we started the year and we thought about our objective around getting to a higher level of mix, 65%, we expressly said we think fiscal '19 to be a cash trough as a result. Again, because the multiyear contracts are typically billed annually versus a perpetual contract which is billed upfront. Now, we still feel the same way about fiscal '19 and what we think the ultimate cash flow yield will be, knowing we still have six months of the year to go. But that's based on, yes, we're getting to the mix rate higher but the delivery that Susan and the rest of the business gave us for the first half of the year support our full-year cash flow objective. -- Okay. Thanks very much, Dave. -- Alright. Thanks, Michael. -- Thanks, Michael.And our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hey, Doug, Dave. Thanks for taking our questions. This is actually David on for Raimo today. Also thanks for the disclosure on RPO. That's gonna be really helpful to comp against last year. You mentioned Splunk Insights earlier in the call, saying that you had already 25,000 downloads even though it is early days. I'm just wondering what are you guys hearing from customers and maybe more precisely from competitors in response to this new, lower price Insights? -- Thanks, David. This is Doug. And just for clarity, that 25,000 downloads is a combo of Essentials and Insights. And, again, just a reminder, I know that we kind of complicate things sometimes here at Splunk because of our multiple categories, but the way to think about Essentials is they are recipes or cookbooks for how to use the underlying Splunk Enterprise platform across a broader set of use cases and should, because of that, simplify the interface for some of our end users and customers, and, more importantly, allow them to rip out a new use case more quickly and reduce time-to-value.Insights are smaller premium apps. They tend to be targeted to departmental leaders, managers, and narrow the aperture on what they focus on. Splunk Insights for infrastructure, for example, was really targeted at monitoring and detecting problems around server infrastructure, which would be a subset of a premium app, like ITSI, the IT Services Intelligence app, that is providing a dashboard across the entire network operations or IT operations center, helping that broad-based organization understand and conceptualize the services hops across usually hundreds or thousands of software and hardware components that are the end journey the end user actually experiences or expects.And, as I said, between Essentials, which are free and just recipes, and our few Insights right now, with more to come, we now cover over 200 use cases out of the box for customers. What we are hearing -- and the Essentials have a little bit more volume of download right now, given that the security Essentials have been out for about a year and we've got a really robust set of IT ops and app dev insights that we rolled out the past quarter and a half -- was, \"Thank you, huge value for me. You're helping me prove within my account that, while I bought Splunk for 'x' or 'y,' it really is a platform that can help me with a whole multitude of use cases.\" So that whole point of customer success is our No. 1 priority. How do we make sure that we help customers on their success journey? Getting more data into Splunk to cover more use cases, but do that as rapidly as humanly possible. -- Makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. And maybe just a quick follow-up. When you're looking at the bookings for the overall quarter, anything that stands out in terms of vertical geographies that's worth pointing out here? -- As we've said over and over, we have such a horizontal technology that we're broadly distributed across verticals and I don't think that we saw any meaningful move, as far as verticals go. I was really pleased to once again see that the international team performed well and --specifically, as we've been talking about a number of quarters, EMEA -- continue to lean in and gain strength from that really strong sub-tier leadership team we were talking about. And I think Richard Timperlake as the head of that segment continues to add strength, consistency, and leadership capability. So that I would call as a standout right now. -- Alright. Thank you. Congrats again. -- Thanks, David. -- Thanks, David.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Thanks, guys, for taking my question and congrats on a great start to the year here. One of the things that really stood out outside of the -- can you hear me? Can you hear me? -- Yeah. Thank you. -- Sorry about that. Yeah, no, I was just saying congrats on a great quarter. And one of the things that really stood out to me again was the large deal metrics. I think David talked 61 seven-figure deals, obviously continued momentum there. Help us kind of think through just the big deals here. You've talked about the $10 million deals last year. You've talked the growth in the million dollar deals this year and last year. What is driving this momentum in large deals? Figure out sort of just the pricing versus volume schema negotiation there for these larger customers. Is it these curated experiences so you can get up and running faster and into more use cases? Kind of help us think through that and how you're thinking about the second half of the year, particularly from the mega deal perspective. -- Yeah. Hey, Phil, it's Dave. I'll give a brief response and I'll turn it over to Doug. Our model is not driven by the size of the customer order. So we report it as a metric because we think it's indicative of the success we're having around adoption and ultimately how much value we actually can deliver to the customer. There are lots of initiatives that we've done over time around pricing and EAAs and all those things. I think the desire for us to offer renewable contracts is really beneficial in terms of aiding the customer on their success journey and deployment of the product in a predictable way. So there are many things going into it. But from a product portfolio perspective, I think a lot of the work that Doug has mentioned -- and, Doug, maybe you can comment on that again for Phil. -- Yeah. Absolutely. I think we've been wrestling with this predictability element and I think that these term contracts really help organizations with predictability. And as we are able to give them a reasonable and ample swath of usage -- when you combine what we're doing with Insights, what Tim and the core platform-oriented folks are doing to enhance the investigative capabilities and monitoring and detection capabilities, more predictive ML capabilities and some of the new stuff that will be coming out to really, really make it easier to consume and respond, especially when you add in some of the characteristics of Phantom and VictorOps, I think all of those combine to illustrate the power to companies that the value and the total cost of ownership that they get from a very, very complete solution that covers investigation, monitoring, analysis, is simple to use, integrated, and broad-based, is a really effective investment. And the more that they use that platform, including the more data they put to that platform, the more rapid and expansive the value is back out to that account. -- Awesome. Thanks, guys. -- Thank you, Phil.And our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of UBS. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Doug, a question for you. Just a comment you made in your prepared remarks around the implementation of Phantom at Accenture. It sounds like a very strategic implementation they had there. So I'm curious what sort of go-to-market motions you've formalized around Phantom and if you can give us a sense of sort of contribution to the business and sort of pricing models that are settling up? And a follow-up for Dave, if I may. -- Yeah. When I think about Phantom, and I'll put VictorOps in the same category as far as how are we trying to enhance the platform capabilities, there are two aspects to both those acquisitions. One is they, for sure, give an immediate boost to the security or IT ops and app dev market groups. But the other aspect is, when you think about the overall data journey that customers take, the ultimate goal is to take some kind of action based on the \"aha\" moments and insights that they get. And they get those insights by having gathered a bunch of different data, which is difficult to do, and then making those correlations across the data. Where Phantom and VictorOps really play -- they play in a number of areas across find, transform, store, interrogate, and take action. But I think they're strongest on the take action front.And what we're seeing within many of our customers is we've been evangelizing this nerve center concept within security of Phantom, let's say. And have a group of partners that have integrated through now Phantom, but that have integrated with Splunk and the capability, so that the brain can signal activity and then understands what that activity and action was and how effective and efficient that activity was. For a strategic partner like Accenture to add Phantom to the fold, I think, is a statement to the benefit that that capability and team adds to the Splunk backbone and capability and characteristics. And I think you'll see that, you'll see Phantom being added to many of our partnerships already, as people understand that acting at the pace of machine action is important to their health and effectiveness. -- That's really helpful. And, Dave, just a question for you on seasonality in the business. And appreciate the ratability of the business is on the up. The full year guidance implies back half seasonality that's actually lower than what we saw last year. So can you help us sort of understand some of the puts and takes with respect to seasonality as you walk into the back half of the year and appreciating the greater ratable mix and with doing more term and EAA type business? And that's it for me. Thank you. -- Sure, Fatima, you bet. Our business, I think, has been pretty consistent in terms of, at least the way we think about it, first half and second half. We know last year, under either standard, 605 or 606, we had a really strong second half of the year. And, as Doug mentioned earlier, we were quite pleased to see the bench strength and the performance in Europe Q2, 3, and 4 of last year. And I think, again, that was feathered into our results. We look at this year, we're certainly very pleased with our momentum for the first half. And we're on top of our own expectations and it's been really nice execution in the field. Now, we've got some big numbers from last year in the back half. I think we've got a pretty strong forecast for Q3. It's indicative, in terms of our guide, for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we've got a lot of work to do. So we're looking forward to talking to you guys in three months and see how we did on the print and what our bottoms-up outlook is for Q4. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Fatima.And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Thank you very much for taking my questions. I've got a question for Dave and then a follow-up for Doug. Dave, so, listen, the results look really strong here. License grew 36% the last two quarters and that's under 606. And we're still trying to figure this out, right? And you've been really helpful on the way. Last year, license grew 27% for the year under 605. So I'm just trying to make sure I understand what's going on here because -- are the last two quarters a reflection of a positive inflection point in momentum for the company or is it simply more an accounting effect of 606, where you're recognizing the on-prem license upfront versus 605? I mean, regardless, these numbers look really good but I'm just trying to make sure I understand what's happened. -- No, it's a good question. I think, at the end of the day, the momentum in the business for the first half of this year certainly feels, and is, stronger than the momentum we had in the first half last year. And, of course, we were very transparent about not liking Q1 so much in Europe, where we had some inconsistent spots. A good bounce back in Q2 last year. We look at the body of work the first six months this year, really strong execution by the field and it's reflected in the results and in terms of the large orders that we're closing. In terms of comparability, there's the headwinds and tailwinds. Okay? And the tailwind is, look, you're moving up your number of renewable term contracts and you've recognized that revenue upfront. Well, we did the same thing last year.The headwind is the percentage of our business that is now perpetual has gone down materially and at a faster pace. And the absolute size of a perpetual order tends to be a bit larger than that of a term order. And that all has to do with duration. So just as a reference for everybody, our benchmark is for a term transaction to equal the same contract value of a perpetual contract action, it has to be 36 months in duration. Now, our duration has been moving up. We were about 33 months between term and cloud for the first half of the fiscal year but that still represents a headwind on a comparative basis. So as the percentage of renewables goes up, ultimately it would be great if it was all 36 months. But until it is, it does create a headwind. -- Okay, Dave, thank you for that detail and for the top line conclusion. The momentum sounds like it's improving from already strength. I guess, Doug, if I could follow up on Fatima's question about Phantom. This is an area, like orchestration, this is an area that makes a ton of sense, right? To me, anyway, it seems like a natural progression of the SIM market. I've heard it pronounced both ways. But it's always made sense though, right? It's just been really hard to do. Because you talk about it as the brain senses activity, but it also ideally will respond across disparate vendors. And I think that's the really tough part. Why do you think it'll work now or today? Why are we ready for it today versus -- it made sense like three years ago but no one's ever really been that successful with it. -- Yeah. And, again, I think there's two dimensions to Phantom. One is that orchestration automation continue to build out on the security front, but IT, business analytics, IoT ultimately have almost identical patterns, needs, and usages. The content is different, some of the UIs are different, but our capability across those four broad segments is because of the similarities in core underlying technology. I think what is helping make some type of orchestration automation more effective, you're seeing it on the IT side as well, is the amount of silicon across a business process continues to increase and the general programming standards today are to make sure that there's clear APIs and service-level addressability for each one of those different components.And Phantom, I think, has been very well architected. Oliver and Sourabh and the entire team, I think, did a really, really, really nice job on the thoughtfulness in the way that they approached the problem overall. So that you have layers to the technology and the meta data, the instruction set that tells the palliative firewall or helps to inform a palliative firewall, and they've got the APIs and hooks to be able to receive that set of information, that type of integration can be done with a lower effort, given that you understand the domain. And it has a degree of isolation from the movements of the underlying technology, both on the Splunk side and the third-party product side.So, I think, as an industry, we're just getting better at layering our solutions and everyone's getting much better at making sure that there's clear communications and interfaces with the components that they put out. And then underlying all that, because everything is now machine addressable, when you've got confidence that it's time to take action and you want it done incredibly quickly, that's really where the orchestration automation response framework comes into play. You still need humans involved in many aspects of that response. And that's where there's a break and a hold-up until you wait for humans to evaluate and decide what the next step should be. -- Great. That's helpful and it's logical and it'll be a breakthrough when this all starts to really come together. So, thank you. -- Thanks, John. I think the world needs this type of capability from Splunk and others. And we need to get much better at sense and response as all of the processes become more digital. And, for me, that really goes back to the core thesis of Splunk. We largely in the data world have been dealing with a set of manual processes and historical evaluation of what happened with sparse data. Where we sit with a lot of processes now is a flood of data coming in and going back out, a lot of that being much more real-time based, and the need to have more instantaneous processing, understanding, and then action. And, at the foundation, that's really what's driving the need and pull for a Splunk-like set of solutions. -- Great. Thanks, guys. -- Thanks, John. -- Thanks, John.And our next question comes from the line of Brian White of Monness Crespi. Your line is now open. -- Great. Doug, maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit on the Amazon deal that you announced this quarter. And also I noticed last week, BAE Systems came out and announced plans to integrate Splunk Enterprise into its government cloud solution. So I don't know if this is a new way deals are being done. It sounds like you're the machine data fabric in their cloud. Maybe you could touch on that also. Thank you. -- Absolutely. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we were really honored and thrilled to see that enterprise agreement with Amazon. We've been working with different pieces of Amazon, a little bit more in a piecemeal business, but I think seeing good success. At least, they tell us we're seeing good success into different pockets of the company, made ABS to other parts of the company over the past few years. And their willingness to lean forward -- as many of us know, they're a really competent engineering organization and, whenever possible, they choose to build versus buy. So really I'm very proud of the fact that they found enough value in Splunk that they thought it would be a usable tool set across all aspects of Amazon.And I think a lot of that speaks to the partnership as well. Why we've been, I think, so effective together in helping organizations that are joint customers or joint prospects get better visibility on these really complex systems environments and security environments they're trying to manage. And those leaders, the early leaders, the Accentures, the Amazons, or AWSs that understood the Splunk value proposition, I think, are helping others understand the value as well. And, for sure, given the complexity of most cloud environments, we expect to see more examples like BAE, where -- and we've seen those through the years -- where a large number of SaaS providers are really effective partners and customers of Splunk so that they can meet their SLAs and have the cyber and non-cyber visibility across their landscapes. So that was nice to see as a win as well. -- Okay. And just, Dave, revenues are beating significantly and you've had a couple phenomenal quarters this year and operating margins are staying the same. Is that simply you brought on a couple of deals, VictorOps and Phantom, and that impacts OpEx or why not a raise in the operating margin as well? -- Well, the insertion of the headcount from the transactions certainly is embedded in the OpEx, that's for sure. But we still have the back half of the year to go and we expect the back half to be seasonally larger so we'll see how that plays out in terms of the op margin. I think importantly, Brian, the opportunity for us in terms of our investment philosophy, and Doug talked about it earlier as it relates to the customer adds, it's just critical for us to continue to ensure that we've got the right coverage in the field, as well as all the innovation that we're working on extremely hard in terms of product portfolio. So when you look at this type of revenue delivery and we think about how large the TAM is for us, I think the long-term benefit from the way we're investing is really gonna pay off. -- Great. Thank you and congrats. -- Thanks, Brian. -- Thanks.And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. It looks like the needle is finally turning toward the red zone on the Red Barchetta. -- The wind's in my hair on this one, Kash. -- There you go. It's only convertible and it's been accelerating for three straight quarters so congrats, guys. One for Doug. How are you with sales capacity expansion? Are you going to be growing your sales capacity growth faster in light of what seems to be better attainment of quarters? Granted that it's still early in the game. And a couple for Conte. As the business model is stabilizing at 75% and you're achieving your goals one year earlier, so if this mix is stable next year, shouldn't we start to see the real operating leverage in the business start to show up next year in a way that's going to better than what you had anticipated earlier, because you thought the mix would still be evolving? But it looks like the mix is going to settle down this year. So talk to us about the implications for cash flow and margin and earnings relative to your previous expectation, given that the model is reaching that end goal. Thank you so much. -- Yeah. Hey, it's Dave. So I'll take that in reverse and I'll turn it over to Doug. We're very pleased with the success we're having in terms of our transition to primarily renewable. Getting to 75% a year early is testament to all the work the whole company is doing. Now, what I haven't declared is is that our long-term objective? So that was our bogey for fiscal '20. We are getting there early. We get through Q3, we look at Q4, and we start thinking about, in more detail, next year. I'll look to update everybody in terms of what they should expect a steady state should look like. Now, I agree with you philosophically that, when we get to steady state, then we're going to see the \"normalization\" of cash flow yield and margin delivery and all those types of elements. But I think we have to achieve that steady state and I'm not declaring that we're at it yet. -- And then on overall headcount, at the beginning of the year and our whole budgeting approach, we are always trying to give the most that we can based on absorption rate and productivity levels and our margin guidance to both product and sales. Given the TAM, there is so much product that we can still build and drive to help our customers achieve what they want to achieve and there is so much coverage that we have to drive that those two are always incredibly important for us to fuel. We're not changing our trajectory on either of those fronts over the course of this year versus what we had outlined at the beginning of the year. But we're very pleased at the rate of hiring that the entire company is doing.And just a callout to our HR organization, the training programs and the absorption rate and our enablement teams in sales continues to be pressured and I think is responding very well, so that we are able, across all the orgs -- facilities, HR, enablement -- to make sure that we have happy Splunkers and productive Splunkers. But there's a high growth of people that has been forecasted in advance this year that goes along with the growth that we're expecting on the revenue and the performance side. -- And, Kash, as you and I have talked about this over the years, the rate of adding capacity to the field is more art than science. And you have to be very thoughtful to not get sucked into the spreadsheet. The rate that, as Doug mentioned, you can absorb resources is very delicate, in terms of balance, to ensure that you're setting all of those folks up for success. So while it would be terrific, when I think about how big is our opportunity -- you've heard me say this. If I could snap my fingers, I would take the entire size of the company and that would just be the field. But if we added them all at a rate that was too accelerated, we would not be doing ourselves or those people justice. So the art of it is, as Doug said, think about a continuous rate of growth from where we've been. -- Thanks, Kash. We can go to the next question please. Mark, are you on?And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. I'll echo my congratulations on the strong quarter and especially, again, on the new customer adds. Looking kind of more to the opportunity within the base though, it seems like there's still significant opportunity there being underpenetrated. You're doing a lot better selling the EAA. Is there anything that can be done to accelerate the expansion on this side? And maybe when it might make sense to add a vertical sales overlay? -- Great see, Matt. And I agree completely with your statements. As excited as I am about the expansion within customers, we still -- those numbers tend to be weighted by the smaller numeric count of customers that are going all in with Splunk versus the larger numeric count that still are trying to figure out how broad to go with Splunk. We have a whole host of initiatives every year, which we think require a ton of heavy lifting to really effectively execute, and increased adoption rates is No. 3 in a list of nine for this year. And there's a bunch of stuff that we're doing on a leverage and on a manual basis, leverage meaning how do we increase the productivity of the human resources we apply to this. And a lot of that comes back to how do we use Splunk more effectively to understand patterns and usage, etc., within our customer base.But I am happy with the increasing rate of adoption. But I think there's so much more that we need to do to get there. Coverage is one of those elements. More solutions in the ecosystem is another, so that you can get more rapid time-to-value and people understand what the next viewscape should be. Product enhancements is certainly another. Increasing capability within cloud so that it's easier to immediately turn on Splunk and get immediate value. So there is a host of investments that we're making. And I think those also have a strong crossover with net news. So they pay in multiple different dimensions. And it's a strong focus for the company to keep those going in a very positive, up into the right direction. -- Thanks. And then maybe just a shorter one. If you can give us any insight on how you're thinking about the government vertical heading into the second half of the year. -- That was the second piece was the vertical. We have started to cluster in the strategic arena reps around verticals. So in New York, for example, there's a whole team that's dedicated to financial services. That's different than moving the sales organizational structure to be vertical first. I think we're still a ways away from that happening. That's an inevitability that most companies eventually get to when they get to a bigger and bigger scale. Public sector is the one standout, where, due to unique dynamics of most governments and certainly the U.S. government, we formed that up a long time ago, 2011 and 2012. Yeah, they've been a really strong performer for us over the many years and we continue to see good penetration and growth rates within public sector, much like the commercial segments, and keep adding to that team.As we all know, the fed year ends in September. The performance that we're expecting from that team is baked in on a year-over-year basis based on what we've seen in prior fed year ends. And there's a little bit more randomness that's happening now because of all the changes that are going on in the government. But the teams remain excited and optimistic and focused on the execution they need to do through Q3 to make sure that we get the type of performance out of public sector that we know is possible. -- Thanks for the time. -- Thanks, Matt.And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. -- Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. -- Of course. -- Yeah. So, Doug, at the Analyst Day, you and Susan talked about driving change internally, being willing to disrupt how you do things. And, by the way, I really want to try to outdo Kash here and make a reference to Permanent Waves. But, anyway, that aside, let me ask you about, in terms of disrupting how you do things and continuous improvement here, two different things I want to ask about, maybe stepping back, what can Splunk do better? The first one would be in the area of product integration from acquisitions and new product introduction. And in the second area, I'm curious what do you want to improve in the area of marketing? -- Hey, Steve, it's Dave. Before I let Doug answer, I'll just tell you it's all really key around the natural science, what we're trying to do. -- I will admit that I've seen Rush more in concert than any other band but that's still sub-ten times versus Dave's plus-50. So. -- Plus-50. -- Totally appropriate that Dave gets all the Rush accolades. So two good questions, Steve. And so many of the frameworks that we have within the company are based around growth mindset, the willingness to experiment, the need to constantly rethink what we do, given how big the opportunity is and how really evolutionary and emergent this whole data space is. And I'm excited to show how the way we have architected Splunk really fits the constant change that's necessary, the adaptability of the data space, as we get to .conf and how we're accelerating and accentuating some of those characteristics.And the two things you called out, I think, are two of the top elements that we have been focused on. As the product team has really cranked up and it is driving a ton of innovation right now, new product introduction becomes a more and more important thing for us to be effective with. I think we've made good strides there. We learned a lot as we started to come out with the use of these new SKUs, like ITSI, no how to orchestrate and coordinate more effectively internally and externally. And that is a strong focus area that principally Tim and Susan are driving, but really people within their teams, to make sure that the volume of innovation that's coming down is understandable to our customers and lands effectively. And you'll hear us talk about limited availability releases, betas, and a lot of standard and some nonstandard terminology that's really helping us assure that we can maintain the high quality bar and the customer success orientation that we have, even though it's a brand new product.And in marketing, the same thing. I very explicitly and consciously knew that we were diving into a marketing transformation and a lot of that transformation was to augment the really effective branding and high-level events that we're famous for -- t-shirts, Splunk Lives -- with much more of an online presence, a much more aggressive demand gen orientation that was filling top of funnel and tracking through top of funnel. And then there's a bunch of enhancements we've been making and have got to continue to get better on on this next generation of packaging, pricing, positioning that ties back to NPI but is a different set of competence that marketing needs.We've been growing the team sizes and both promoting and attracting folks with some really good competencies in both those areas. And I'm really excited about what we're seeing. Then that small tick-up that we saw in net news this quarter hopefully is the beginning of a continuous trend. I think marketing has had a big help there and I think some of the Insights and Essentials, which were part of the product orientation, also are contributing as well. -- Great. Thanks a lot, Doug. -- Thanks, Steve. -- Thanks, Steve.And our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So just maybe two quick ones for Dave. You mentioned average term contract durations being about 33 months through the first half of the year. I'm curious what that was last year, maybe for the first half, and how much are you seeing as a tailwind from durations on RPO. And then I've got a follow-up. -- Yeah. It's about 33 months for all of our renewable contracts the first half. It was probably about 25 months at this time last year. And while that might seem like it's a tailwind for RPO, with the move from 50% renewable to 75%, there's still a drag. The loss in perpetual actually isn't being fully replaced even though the duration is elongating. So, if it gets to 36 months, it'll be apples to apples but it's not quite there yet. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe, Dave, can you just maybe talk about how you're thinking about the guide for operating and free cash flow for the balance of this year? -- Well, I guess, in what context? We are certainly pleased with our first half performance. I think, as we look to the strength of Q3, that's reflected in the guide. I do think back to the comment that Doug and I made when I think Kash asked the question about the rate of hiring. We're certainly very disciplined about the rate that we look to add resources but also quite deliberate to ensure that we're continuing to invest in both coverage and product, primarily. So all of that is built in to the guide.I think cash flow yield, which, when we started the year, we identified our expectations with the shift to primarily renewable that fiscal '19 would be a cash trough. And I think that's still the case. We're still working on how much will cash flow be in the back half of the year but we think we'll hit our full-year target. And obviously there's work to be done when you're over-delivering on renewable contracts that tend to be billed annually. So we're really pleased with the success we're having in terms of getting to what we expect, full-year, 75%, a year early. But we do have to navigate what that means in terms of invoicing and what that cash flow yield will be. -- Got it. And then if I could just sneak one more in for Doug on -- and I apologize if this has been asked already -- on just the pace of EAA activity to your expectations. Clearly, on term, you guys have outperformed your expectations. I'm curious how you would categorize the EAA activity? -- I think it's in line with what we were expecting and hoping for. Maybe slightly above, and I think that's primarily because of the term orientation. I think that there are two elements to EAAs. One is the customer has got to be ready for it. There's been lots of questions about why can't you just give everyone these big, expansive pieces. And if you just don't understand yet the value -- they're not free. So there's a payment for the EAA and it's got to be correlated with value. And that usually means that there's enough use cases, enough end users, and enough value that they get why they would really want a more broad-based and end-to-end multidepartment type platform.And the other piece is the rep's willingness to lean forward and really try and drive an EAA. I think that the term approach has given a lot more comfort for the reps to move with these EAAs, because they know there's a renewal at some point in time and as long as the product engine keeps coming, there's always a reason to go back and talk to the customers about adding to their term contract and/or thinking about an early renewal. So I think the rep issue has kind of naturally started to go in our favor with that. But we always will still be dealing with the customer issue and that's where, again, the product portfolio is so important. How do we continue to make it easier to understand the value of Splunk? How do we get more and more ecosystem participation and use cases and applications? Given that people still wrestle with, \"I get that big data is important. I read it about it every single day. I know that data is growing. But what do I do with it? How do I get value out of it?\" It's still one of their biggest issues. And that, I think, also, over time, people are getting better with data so that's helping a little bit as well. -- Great. Thanks, guys. -- Thanks, Alex.And our final question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Thanks, guys. Dave, I know that you haven't revised that 75% and you're getting there a year early, but I guess, in the conversations that you've had with customers, has there been any friction? And I guess is there any reason why that 75% can't go to 85% or 90% over time? Is there kind of a barrier that you're seeing as you have these types of discussions? -- I don't know, Jesse, that there's necessarily a barrier. But when you're coming from a company born on-prem with perpetual licensing and you have very high adoption rates in the install base, it's a bit more work to change the composition as you go forward. So I do think, in fairness to everybody out there -- again, we're really happy and proud of our performance to get there early. But we do need to get through the back half of this year and get into some of the details, in terms of how we're thinking about next year, before I want to set any expectation about what should everybody think it's going to be next fiscal year. In summary, do I believe that that rate could and should go higher? Yes. Am I setting that expectation today? No. -- That's totally fair. Thank you. -- Alright, man. -- Thanks, Jess, appreciate that.And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Ken Tinsley for closing remarks. -- Perfect. Thank you, Mark. I appreciate your help today. And thanks for everybody's participation. Have a good night and we'll see you at .conf.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, recording an average beat of 10.4%.In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 83 cents per share matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure increased 29.7% from the year-ago quarter.Net revenues surged 31.5% from the year-ago quarter to $990 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $963 million. Non-GAAP core revenues (excluding the impact of currency and revenues from acquisitions completed within the last 12 months) increased 18% year over year to $999 million.For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company expects non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of $942-$972 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter are projected in the range of 72-82 cents per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $959 million and 80 cents per share, respectively.The stock has gained 49.9% year over year, outperforming the 42.5% rally of the  it belongs to.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company's continuous focus on launching new solutions for growth markets like 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), next-generation wireless, high-speed datacenters and automotive & energy bodes well for its top-line.The company's partnerships with the likes of Verizon Communications Inc and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm  are aiding it to achieve 5G commercialization related milestones.Keysight stated that orders for 5G solutions recorded double-digit growth year over year for the 10th consecutive quarter. Additionally, the buyouts of Ixia, Anite and AT4 Wireless have enriched the company's 5G solutions portfolio.In a bid to expand foothold in the defense and security space, Keysight recently announced the acquisition of Melbourne, Australia-based Thales Calibration Services, a subsidiary of Thales Group. The buyout is likely to expand the company's current electrical portfolio, paving the way for new prospects to support the defense sector in Australia.Moreover, IoT also presents significant growth opportunity based on the company's broad and diverse portfolio that effectively addresses the needs of customers related to power consumption, RF performance, interoperability and conformance testing.The growing demand for electric and hybrid cars also bode well for the company's product portfolio, which was enhanced with the acquisition of Scienlab.Further, increasing electronic content in vehicles, radar technologies for autonomous driving and high-power devices as well as applications are driving demand for the company's solutions in this end market. The company's recently inaugurated Detroit-based Automotive Solution Center remains another positive.We believe that the company's focus on expanding its software portfolio on the back of strong demand for its solutions is likely fuel growth. This along with key acquisitions in line with company's goals amplifies its growth prospects.However, competition from Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co.

Moreover, the company's revenues increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, out of which the last six recorded double-digit growth after a prolonged period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments' performance improved for the fifth straight quarter, after 2010.In the trailing four quarters, the company's results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and came in line on two other occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.17%.HP projects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 49 to 52 cents for the fiscal third-quarter.So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.HP's PC segment is delivering impressive performance, wherein the year-over-year increase in the last reported quarter can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues. The company's focus on product innovation, differentiation and enhancement of the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line is a tailwind.Notably, International Data Corporation, in its latest report on second-quarter 2018 PC shipments, stated that HP was the clear winner with 23.9% market share while per Gartner, HP shared the leading position with Lenovo, with 21.9% market share each.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PC segment revenues stands at $9.08 billion for fiscal third quarter, implying 8% year-over-year growth.The company's efforts to revamp its printing business have also been impressive. With the commencement of the shipping of A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP is likely to revive the company's printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market.It should be noted that the buyout of S-Print has helped HP in the $55-billion high-end copy-machine market where Xerox Corporation  is currently the leader. Additionally, the company's focus on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities also makes us optimistic.The consensus estimate for Print segment revenues is approximately $5.13 billion for the quarter to be reported, indicating 9.2% year-over-year improvement.However, increasing overall component and logistic costs for Personal Systems coupled with rising material costs in the Printing segment is an overhang on margins.

Company stock has doubled since 2017 as more and more enterprises  they have. Considering the massive growth in digital information being created every year -- a phenomenon which Splunk maintains is expected to expand at a double-digit annual rate for the foreseeable future -- this software company may have plenty of good years left ahead of it.Splunk's services help enterprises make sense of data being created by web pages, apps, and other digital systems. Much of the data being generated by both new and legacy systems doesn't get organized very well. Splunk changes that, helping organizations turn its previously unusable information into \"aha moments\" they can use to improve operations, get insight on customers, and prevent malicious activity.Numerable use cases for Splunk's machine data software have been found, including a recent push into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. Splunk went on a  in the last year, acquiring several complementary businesses to bolster its abilities to fight cybercrime. At the end of the company's fiscal  of 2019 (three months ended Apr. 30, 2018), it was nearing 16,000 total customers, and it's pushing for 20,000 customers and $2 billion in annual revenue by the year 2020.Image source: Getty Images.The company breaks its revenues into two segments: \"license\" and \"maintenance and services.\" Both are growing in the double digits, but the licensing segment -- which comprises mostly software as a service (SaaS) that generates recurring revenue from subscription fees -- is the more important of the two. Not only is its income more predictable, it also carries a much higher profit margin. Management stated that total software revenues increased 43% year over year to kick off 2018:\n  \nData source: Splunk quarterly earnings. P.p. = percentage points.The viability of Splunk's services is solid, yet the company still reports an operating loss every quarter. That's because of high operating expenses in the service of pushing total sales higher. For example, in the first quarter of 2018, Splunk spent $218.0 million on sales and marketing and $86.4 million on research and development. As a result, the company's operating loss was $121.5 million.Given the amount of money being dumped into the sales engine at Splunk, some context is needed to assess the stock. Splunk's earnings reports do some of the legwork for us by providing supplemental adjusted operating results that back out  and the amortization of intangible assets. When accounting for those items, the first quarter operating loss narrows to only $18.0 million. That's an operating loss margin of 7.9%, but management said it expects that adjusted margin to swing to a profit during the last two quarters of 2018.Things look even better when using  , or cash provided by adjusted operations less capital expenditures. By that measure, Splunk has been in positive territory for quite some time and continues to produce even more free cash flow every quarter.Data by  .Using price-to-free cash flow instead of the more common price-to-earnings metric (since the company runs at a net loss, price-to-earnings readings are problematic) yields a ratio of 52.0. That's a rich price tag, but the number has been getting smaller over time as the company expands and funnels less money as a percentage of revenue into expansion efforts.Thus, Splunk is investing heavily in itself now for a bigger payoff later on. The stock isn't for everyone, though, as even small changes in revenue and expense growth can cause shares to make some wild moves. Even so, annual sales have increased more than 500% since Splunk went public back in 2012, and the company is knocking on the door to profitability. Considering this, and the continued steep increase in digital data around the world, Splunk is a buy for those interested in holding on for the long haul.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Revenues outpaced the mid-point of the guided range by 2.4%.The narrower loss and revenues beat are positives for Pure Storage. Moreover, per IDC MarketScape: Worldwide All-Flash Array 2017 Vendor Assessment report, the company leads in the space, leaving NetApp  , Dell EMC and Hewlett Packard Enterprise trailing. This dominance of Pure Storage can be attributed to robust all-flash and NVMe portfolio.Pure Storage expects second-quarter fiscal 2019 revenues in the range of $296-$304 million.

During the quarter under review, it added more than 300 new customers, bringing the total base to 4800 organizations and reflecting a year-over-year increase of 45%.The company's strong product portfolio including the likes of FlashArray and FlashBlade business segments was the key catalyst. Additionally, its data platform for cloud is gaining traction.Cisco's tie-up with the company's FlashStack continues to significantly accelerate overall converged infrastructure and integrated systems markets. FlashStack is well poised for the future as the company continues to invest with its partners in full stack automation and simplicity.The company's data platform for cloud is gaining traction. However, intensifying competition owing to the presence of major players such as Amazon's Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") and Microsoft's Azure in cloud storage remains a concern.Management is optimistic about its scalable storage solutions in an era when the world is being driven by big-data, artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics based information.

NVIDIA is already a dominant player in the datacenter market. The company enjoys a first-mover advantage in the AI field and its expanding product portfolio is capable enough to leverage the growing adoption of AI in various industries.We believe NVIDIA's innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned. Higher adoption of NVIDIA's Volta processors is also expected to act as a catalyst.For the current quarter, NVIDIA predicts crypto-specific revenues to take a hit and be about one-third of the first-quarter level. However, higher-than-anticipated demand for its gaming chips is expected to drive results. Notably, sales generated from cryptocurrency miners were 9% of total revenues in the first quarter compared with gaming revenues, which contributed nearly 54%.Moreover, NVIDIA's operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, have shown a declining trend in the last three fiscals. NVIDIA's platform model has helped in reducing overall costs, thereby enhancing its operational efficiency. Improving gross margin and lower operating expenses are expected to drive the company's operating margin in the fiscal second quarter. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

In a contract between two parties, it's logical that specific performance obligations can be identified. It also makes sense that the contract's transaction price should be allocated between these obligations. The provider of a service should be able to recognize revenue in stages as each obligation is performed or satisfied.Among various guidelines that arise from the logic above, the new standard requires disclosure, in the notes to the financial statements, of a company's quarterly remaining performance obligations, or RPO. Here's how Splunk CFO David Conte defined the remaining performance obligation during the company's May 24 fiscal Q1 2019  with analysts:Now, Conte is simplifying things somewhat for the analysts on the call, but it's nonetheless a pretty good, succinct working definition: RPO equals deferred revenue plus backlog. , represents amounts that have been invoiced to a customer in advance of work being performed. It exists as a liability on the balance sheet, because it represents money collected, or at least invoiced and due, in advance of the satisfaction of an obligation.Deferred revenue also can be thought of as revenue that will hit the income statement once performance of obligations is completed. So, it's an important item to consider when looking at all factors influencing future revenue.\"Backlog,\" also known as \"revenue backlog\" in the world of software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, isn't found on the face of the financial statements. Backlog represents future performance obligations that haven't been invoiced. For cloud-based SaaS organizations like Splunk, subscription services are often the most significant component of backlog.Image source: Getty Images.To get a grip on this new metric, let's consider the basic example of a generic SaaS company that sells a cloud service and a related support contract to a customer, both for a one-year period. Suppose the customer prepays the full year's worth of the cloud service in the amount of $2,400. Separately, the customer agrees to be billed $25 on the first day of each month (with the transaction to be paid automatically via credit card) for the duration of the one-year support contract.After the first three months, representing one business quarter, the SaaS company will record one-fourth of the $2,400 cloud service, or $600, as revenue on its income statement. The remaining $1,800 of services, which has been billed but not earned, can be found on the deferred revenue account on the balance sheet.The company will also record $75 of support services on its income statement for the three completed and paid months. Since nine out of 12 months remain in the business year, the company has a revenue backlog of $225 ($25 multiplied by 9) arising from the support contract.Thus, the remaining performance obligation that ASC 606 requires to be disclosed in the notes to the company's financial statements equals the deferred revenue balance of $1,800, plus the revenue backlog of $225, for a total RPO of $2,025.\"Splunk Light\" dashboard. Image source: Splunk Inc.Now let's see what we can glean from Splunk's first quarter adhering to ASC 606. In fiscal Q1 2019, Splunk reported RPO of roughly $765 million, as Conte noted above. We can find the deferred revenue portion of this total on the quarterly balance sheet -- it's approximately $648 million. Subtracting deferred revenue from the RPO reveals a revenue backlog of $117 million.So, as of April 30, 2018, Splunk boasts $648 million of previously invoiced revenue still to be earned, and $117 million of additional contracted revenue to be invoiced and earned. According to the company's note disclosure, 90% of the RPO will be earned over the next 24 months.Remember that Conte disclosed that this RPO compares to $800 million in the previous sequential quarter, Q4 2018. The fourth quarter is Splunk's seasonally strongest quarter. We can now watch data points every three months to get a sense of the growth pattern of Splunk's RPO, and by this time next year, we'll have our first year-over-year quarterly comparison number to evaluate.What are other implications of the new RPO disclosure for Splunk and its SaaS competitors? For investors who have previously tried to make sense of \"billings\" (i.e., total amount of new invoices issued) in relation to deferred revenue each reporting period, ASC 606 provides a more intuitive way of understanding total contracted revenue. On the , Conte noted that Splunk would stop providing billings guidance, since ASC 606 makes billings analysis less relevant. He also suggested that RPO is a \"better\" metric than billings.I very much agree. RPO is a fine birds-eye metric as it foreshadows top-line growth or decay. Further, you can back out the deferred revenue component of RPO to derive the backlog, and thus get a measure of subscription sales strength or weakness. And for a cloud-based software merchant like Splunk, recurring, predictable, high-margin subscription sales remain the most coveted sales of all.

Investors reacted negatively to news that the company's growth rate will slow substantially, reflecting BlackBerry's decision to move toward a subscription-based model that will result in a one-time disruption to its top-line results. Most investors have gotten used to the idea that BlackBerry now wants to concentrate on higher-growth areas like automotive software in the budding Enterprise of Things space. Yet today's drop makes it clear that some shareholders are still coming to terms with exactly what BlackBerry's transformation will mean, at least in the short run.Image source: BlackBerry.J.C.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court overturned its previous decision and will now allow states to impose sales tax on online retailers. That arguably puts brick-and-mortar retailers like J.C. Penney on an even footing with their internet counterparts, and former J.C. Penney CEO Allen Questrom was positive about what impact the high court decision will have on the industry. Yet even if the company can win back incremental business from online retailers that had been able to claim a modest pricing advantage based on sales tax disparities, it will  against its department store peers in order to return to its former footing.Finally, shares of Splunk dropped 7%. The data analytics company likely felt pressure from  , which warned that results in the current quarter could deteriorate from previous growth rates. Also contributing to the declines was simply the fact that the stock had seen such dramatic gains recently, having roughly doubled between mid-2017 and earlier this month. Splunk isn't yet profitable, but its top-line growth rates are strong enough that positive earnings aren't too far away at this point. Given the utility of its services, Splunk has plenty of opportunities to grow even if Red Hat and some other companies in the space end up falling behind.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new February 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $115.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $104.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $117.46/share today.Because the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

The stock has more than doubled in the last year and a half, but the growth of big data could help its run continue.New customer additions have been and will continue to be a key measure of the company's success. The goal is to grow the customer base to 20,000 by the end of 2020, about a 25% increase from the current count. But it's about more than just a number. The size of new deals will increase in importance now that Splunk is pushing for $2 billion in annual revenues.To that end, a new metric was introduced by the company in its most recent report: the number of new million-dollar-plus deals. For the first quarter, there were 43 of them. That compares to 35 in the same period a year ago.This new measurement shows that, in spite of its meteoric growth in recent years, Splunk is still early in its growth story. Given the size of the data analytics industry -- which has doubled since Splunk went public in 2012 and is expected to continue growing by double digits in the foreseeable future -- signing big contracts is a must. Management said it believes it remains on track to hit its 2020 customer and revenue goals, so look to this new metric to gain importance in subsequent quarters.Image source: Getty Images.Despite a compelling story, many investors may shy away from Splunk because it is not yet a profitable enterprise. However, that may be about to change, at least as far as Splunk is concerned.Adjusted operating profit margin, which backs out certain items like  , was -4.7% in the first quarter. Last year, that margin was -9.2%. For the next quarter, management said it thinks adjusted operating margin will be 2%, and 11.5% for the full year.While paying employees with new shares of the company will likely continue to pull the unadjusted bottom line into the red, it looks like profitability is right around the corner. At least investors now know the company has the ability to pay its operating bills out of pocket.Another key to Splunk's growth has been the security industry. Enterprises have been using data analysis to spot anomalies in their digital systems and stop security breaches. To boost its presence there, Splunk purchased security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) outfit Phantom Cyber Corporation during the last quarter for $350 million.Keeping a business secure against cyberthreats is increasingly complex and difficult. Phantom's technology helps tie all the pieces involved in cybersecurity together. Adding Splunk's data-parsing tech to the mix can help strengthen those automation services even more. Splunk hopes that buying Phantom will help increase the pace of new customer adoption of its services.However, Phantom may also help increase the scope of existing customer relationships though it was too early for management to provide specifics in the recent conference call. Given how many organizations use Splunk to analyze their fast-growing amounts of data to increase operating efficiency, it could make sense to double the service as a security measure. Thus, that cross-selling opportunity could also feed into the aforementioned million-dollar-deal measure, pushing smaller relationships into that more meaningful metric as the company looks to hit its ambitious goals in the next couple of years.Overall, Splunk's start of its new fiscal year was a very good one.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. : The first thing you need to know -- this is the way I like to start my reviews -- is to note how the market has done in the last two years since May 4, 2016 when \"5 Winners in a Thinking World\" aired, and I'm just taking the closing prices from that day. And the stock market from 05/04/16 through 05/07/18 [Monday's close], the market is up 30.2%. That has been a great two years.You and I know that the market tends to average around 10% a year. Two years with a little compounding wouldn't be much more than 20%, so this has been an above-average period, and a great time to be invested. And, you know, a lot of people two years ago were saying, \"Market's going to sell off. It's going to be really bad in 2016 because it's been so good the previous years.\"And yet look what's happened. Let's not look backward. Let's look forward and let's look with the eyes of history as our guide. Yes, the stock market will sell off one year in three, and definitely there will be [and have been] some down times, so let's not get too carried away with trying to guess where the market's headed based on where it's been.Now, the five stocks were \"5 Winners in a Thinking World.\" I was positing two years ago this week that the world has moved. I was quoting Michael Bloomberg, entrepreneur and politician. He was talking about how historically humans had started as an agrarian species after our hunter-gatherer phase, so for thousands of years we were farmers. And then for a couple of hundred years, we entered the industrial age.But then he said [and, in fact, this was in his speech to graduating seniors at the University of Michigan a few years ago], that now we're entering the age of information. We're no longer farming as much. We're no longer as much about factory production. Now we're about the life of the mind, and the possibilities.And so, inspired by that, I looked across the 200 or so active recommendations which I've made in  and  , all brought together in what we call  [a service I hope many of you are enjoying]. And I looked across those 200 and I said, \"Which are five companies that will benefit from this increasingly [thinking] world that we're living in?\"And I also said, \"I'm not going to pick the obvious ones,\" two years ago. I said, \"I could definitely pick Alphabet, because Google of searching and all the life of the mind that's baked into that company. Or some of the other big companies like Amazon.\" I said, \"I'm going to restrict myself from taking those obvious, big internet players. Let's look for five other kinds of companies.\" And here's what they are and here's how they've done.Stock No. 1: The first one up, alphabetically, is Celgene. The ticker symbol is CELG. Celgene, two years ago, was at $101 a share. Celgene, as of Monday's market close was down to $84.57. So, not such a great stock pick of mine. Celgene down 16%. The market up 30%. So, we're going to have to log a minus 46% to start this review of my stocks from five years ago, as Celgene has dropped a little and the market, as we've already established, has done quite well.In case you don't know Celgene, C-E-L-G-E-N-E, this is a company that is really the worldwide leader in fighting blood cancer. Its drug, Revlimid, is the big dog and continues to be really relevant; however, the possibility of it running out of its patent and being copied by cheaper upstarts has given the market pause as it looks at Celgene stock.So, I turned to one of my fellow analysts, Karl Thiel, and he shared that and a little bit more with you. For those of us who are interested in Celgene, Karl wrote [and I'm just going to read it out, here], \"Celgene has for years, now, and without any significant stumble, put up a great financial performance. It has posted\" -- get this -- \"double-digit revenue growth every year since 1996. Even recent concerns about newer products like Otezla, struggling against competition, has been overblown. After a difficult quarter last year, they rebounded.\"But since so much rides on Revlimid, on track for $9.5 billion in sales this year, fears about patent expiration trumped pretty much all other concerns and, more recently, investor confidence has been shaken by some bad luck or unforced errors [a botched application for Ozanimod], an expected blockbuster in multiple sclerosis. Also, the failure of a late-stage Crohn's disease drug. Even some disappointment with a Revlimid label expansion. Management insists revenue will reach $19-20 billion by 2020, but investors worry what will happen next.\"Our feeling,\" Karl writes, \"is that even with stumbles and setbacks, the company is setting itself up well for the post-Revlimid world. It bought Juno,\" [which is another one of our  stock picks]. \"It owns a piece of what is perhaps  's most exciting drug, a CAR T immunotherapy drug for myeloma.\" By the way, Bluebird Bio is also a  recommendation.By the way, I call this Foolretsu sometimes. You may be familiar with the Japanese concept of keiretsu, where companies that might have the same capitalists backing them start to work with each other in sort of a networked, competitively advantaged way. Well, I see here, maybe, a new emerging term that I've used some over the years ... a Foolretsu ... when some of our recommendations, unbeknownst to us being to work together.Anyway, to close Karl's thoughts and then we'll go to the next stock. \"Long term, we're very confident that the company will succeed, grow, and prove to be undervalued. The problem is the transition is so uncertain, no one can be sure of when Revlimid generic competition starts. The worst case is the year 2020, with 2024 being more likely and 2026 being definitely. We can't be sure of every pipeline program, so there's definitely a bumpy road ahead as there can be with any biotech, even a gigantic one like this one.\" So, there's a little bit of a look back and forward at Celgene, which has started with a minus 46% in the loss column. Let's go to stock No. 2.Stock No. 2: Stock No. 2's ticker symbol is [DIS]. Do you know what that one is? I bet you do. It's Disney. Disney two years ago this week -- think about all the Disney  movies. Think about Marvel.  All those other Marvel movies. Think about Disney Princesses. Expansions with its theme parks. Think about all those toys produced. Think about the genius that Bob Iger has brought to overseeing this company. Two years ago, Disney was at $103.70. As of Monday's close this week, it is down to $102.48, so not down very much. Down 1%.But down 1% when the market was up 30% has me with a little egg on my face. Just a little. It's not just a yellow egg, because this is The Motley Fool, so it's kind of a multicolored spatter of egg on my face as I look backward, now, at my \"5 Winners in a Thinking World\" and see Celgene down 46% to the market and Disney down 31% to the market. So, if you're keeping score at home [and darn it, I sure hope you will], I'm going take it out to one more decimal. I'm down 77.8%. We'll call that a minus 78 after these two picks.I'm not going to spend as much time on Disney. It's a much better-known company than Celgene and some of these others. I think we can all continue to say that this is an iconic brand. This is a great, very profitable company. It is a massive company, far larger than any of the others on this list. It's a company that has guaranteed movie hits going forward about as far as I can see. Far more visibility than any other company in its industry. It's got all the great brands. It's got great management.It does have that ESPN legacy model which continues to drag the company down some [both in terms of its results and in terms of external perception of Disney], and I think that explains, in part, the underperformance.Disney I originally recommended not ever as Disney. The reason that it appears multiple times on  and has been a mega winner for our members is that I recommended Pixar a few times and Disney bought Pixar. And even more times than a few I recommended Marvel [since way back in the day when that first  movie came out]. Those have been just tremendous performers, but I have six positions in  on Disney, and none of them was ever picked as Disney.So, it kind of hurts that the stock which I picked in June of 2002 and is up 54x for our members since then; that this stock would underperform for my podcast over the last couple of years and put me deep in the hole at minus 78% before we hit our final three stocks.And before we get to those next three stocks, I want to mention [and again, if you're a regular listener you know this] that I have, I think, an unblemished record of always beating the market with all my five-stock samplers that I've done since July of 2015 on this show. In other words, we're something like 14 and 0, and right now we're staring at the possibility that we might have our first loss; although, I will point out we're only two years in with this group of five stocks and I was picking them for three-plus years. The big question at this point is will  -- will this podcast -- keep the streak alive?Stock No. 3: Stock No. 3's ticker symbol is SPLK. The company is Splunk. In a world of big data, think about a thinking world and how much data we're generating. Splunk is one of those big data companies whose tools allow people to conduct better business intelligence. What are people clicking on? How are they using your website? Splunk creates colorful pictures for employees right out there on the front lines and in the field, giving infographics and other industry-leading forms of help through its core business.Splunk is also a company with kind of a silly name, and one of my six Rule Breaker attributes is always when a company has a brand and within a space where you could just be Big Data, Inc. [BDI, let's say], this company has a little bit more personality and pep. Often a good sign of a potential Rule Breaker, and that has been Splunk.Now, before I tell you how Splunk's done in the last two years, I should note that before I picked it two years ago, it had done something unusual for one of my picks, because it had dropped 25% in the few months leading up to me picking it two years ago. Kind of a disappointment. The company that had been public for several years -- a good Rule Breaker pick -- was in the midst of a sell-off.Two years ago, it tipped the scales at $49 a share. On Monday it closed at $109.94. We could round that to $110, but I'll leave it hardcore and make it $109.94. That is a 124.4% gain, and that's 94% ahead of the market. So that minus 78% we were looking at just a few minutes ago all of a sudden just tipped to plus 16%.So, where has Splunk come from and where is it going? Well, for this one I tapped another one of my analysts, Simon Erickson, and I'm going to give you a little extra, just like I did for Celgene. These are lesser-known companies to many of us [Celgene and Splunk], and I'd love for you to get to know a company like this one a little bit better. After all, it's been pretty lucrative to be a Splunk shareholder these last couple of years and we like it going forward.When I asked Simon what had happened, he said, \"Well, the need for monitoring machine data is increasing, so think of Splunk as providing the peripheral vision for a company to understand how they're actually operating. They can keep an eye on their weblogs to detect hackers and malware. They can monitor equipment performance to keep them safe. They can optimize IT performance of the data center.\"And Simon says that one of his favorite use cases is how they're slicing data for Domino's, so they're monitoring in real time what pizzas people buy regionally and using that to inform their marketing promotions. There's a ton of data available out there. Companies need Splunk to find both problems and opportunities that they didn't even know they should be looking for.I'm going to skip some of his numbers, here. If you're a  member, you're getting this, anyway, but they're basically getting more from existing customers which is really helping their margins. They are a cloud-based company, as well.\"And probably the most exciting development for Splunk shareholders is that they've integrated into Amazon's AWS, Amazon Web Services, and Google's cloud environments. As an example, Splunk is now powering the Amazon Echo. I'm not going to say her name and trigger it if you're listening to this podcast over that machine [the Amazon Echo, for business]. So, customers are aggressively moving their applications to the cloud and now they can use Splunk to index all that machine data that they generate and in real time.\"And now back to me. Thank you, Simon, for that. That truly, to me, sounds like a winner in an increasingly thinking world. A quick side note. This company will report its first quarter earnings on May 24. So, Splunk [SPLK].Stock No. 4: Before I say the name of this one, I'll just mention that it had declined 70% in the year leading up to me picking it two years ago on this podcast. And I teased you, if you were listening back then, by mentioning it's a name and a platform that we all know. Whether or not you use it, it is pretty much and was a household name back then. I would say it's only even more popular today. The ticker symbol is TWTR and that means it's Twitter.Two years ago, Twitter was trading at $14.85. Today it's trading at $31.33. So, I was kind of on the precipice whether I'd beat the market or not. The game's not over yet, but Splunk took us over the hump and Twitter just stacked on [well, it's up 111%] 81% ahead of the market. Thank you, Twitter.And the biggest change for Twitter is, of course, that its last couple of quarters it's been profitable, and I think that's something you could have foreseen. This is a stock pick we've had in for years. It's been up and down. Down for quite a while more than up.But what I have always loved about Twitter is that it passes my \"snap test.\" That's a phrase I've used many times before on this podcast. Our snap test is if you were to snap your fingers and cause a company [and its products or services] to just disappear overnight, and the whole world wakes up the next day, the question the snap test has for us is would anyone notice? Would anyone care?And when you can give an emphatic yes to that; that always for me speaks to the potential strength of a stock, even a beaten-down one, which is what Twitter was. Down 70% before we picked it here for you two years ago. Twitter up 111% since then. The company has definitely become only more relevant. Only more solid. It had quite a run through the election. It has some popular politicians who tweet out. Whether or not you follow those tweets, there's something for everybody on Twitter.I use Twitter every day just to track some of the authors and people that I admire and see what they're thinking and sometimes doing. I love Twitter and I would recommend it to you as a user if you're not already. It's been a great stock in recent years and I like it a lot over the next five years.Stock No. 5: And that brings us to stock No. 5 before we start getting the stage cleared for Selim Bassoul. To close it out, here, the final stock is Zillow. The ticker symbol back then was [Z]. It's also [ZG] if you like. It's the same company. Just different classes of shares.Zillow two years ago was trading at $28. I'm absolutely delighted to let you know that as of Monday's close, it closed at $55.91. I'm tempted to round that to $56, so I would have a straight double from $28 to $56, but we'll keep it true. It's up 99.7% over the last two years. Just to do some quick math, then, you add its 70% of outperformance and this group of five stocks, despite the dark start that we got, is up 167% over the market.In other words, the market has averaged a 30.2% gain over the last two years, and these five stocks have averaged a 63.5% gain. If you want to annualize those [and why not, because it's kind of fun], those two-year annualized returns for the market 14.1% and for \"5 Winners in a Thinking World,\" despite a couple of clunkers, so far [and, again, this game's not over], that group is up 27.9% annualized, keeping [#TheRBIPodcastStreak] alive.Just a little bit about Zillow since it's been a hero stock. Really the last three have each just about doubled over the last two years. Rick Munarriz, one of my friends and fellow analysts, and a past guest on this show, says the stock has now more than made back the hit it took when it surprised investors by announcing that it would be expanding its Zillow Instant Offers segment, where it essentially buys and flips houses, which was announced in mid-April, just a few weeks ago. This week's quarterly report shows that Zillow's core business is growing just fine. Premier Agent revenue accounting for more than two-thirds of its entire business these days, matched the 22% growth in revenue for the quarter.Traffic always a big thing for Zillow. Traffic across its collection of sites up 15% over the past year. There will be acquisitions, or in the case of Zillow Instant Offers, new potentially questionable ventures that may seem to be distracting, but Zillow is proving that it can still explore related revenue streams without neglecting its bread and butter business.It remains to be seen if realtors will get ticked off if the platform that they lean on for leads starts turning into a rival, but Zillow has shown in the past that it can get the balance right. Zillow's guidance for 2018 calls for revenue growth of about 22-23% before accounting for its new-home segment, etc. This is a company that, like many of these I also own, I have good thoughts about for the year three, five going forward.In fact, even though when I did this two years ago Zillow was the smallest of these five companies by market cap, in some ways, it has the strongest competitive advantage of any of them. When I think of Zillow, if that's the Coca-Cola of the industry, it's really unclear to me if there is a meaningful Pepsi.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoExpected Earnings Release: 05/24/2018, After-hoursAvg.

But CRISPR, which stands for\u00a0Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is actually a potentially game-changing method of gene editing. And one of the top pioneering biotechs focused on CRISPR is Editas Medicine.Editas is using CRISPR gene-editing technology to target several diseases. The company's lead candidate is EDIT-101, which edits\u00a0a gene in\u00a0retinal\u00a0tissue\u00a0to treat Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10 (LCA10), the most common genetic cause of blindness in children. Editas plans to file for FDA approval to begin  of EDIT-101 in humans within the next few months.How promising is EDIT-101? Enough to attract the attention of  (NYSE: AGN) . The big drugmaker paid $90 million up front to Editas in 2017 for the option to license up to five of the small biotech's programs, including EDIT-101. Juno Therapeutics, which was acquired earlier this year by  (NASDAQ: CELG) , has also partnered with Editas to use CRISPR in genetically engineering T cells for cancer therapies.It's still really early for EDIT-101. However, for investors who aren't afraid of taking on significant risk -- and who can wait a few years for the biotech's technology to advance -- Editas Medicine could be a huge winner.

The expectation that the company can expand its paid-user base will be crucial to validating the bull case, but iQiyi looks to be having success on that front. Its paid-subscriber count has grown from 10.7 million at year-end 2015 to 50.8 million at the end of 2017. For comparison, Netflix has roughly 110 million paid subscribers.The Chinese film industry has seen rapid expansion over the last decade, and it's a good bet that direct-to-consumer streaming options will continue to see growth in the country as well. The average per-household discretionary spending among urban Chinese is expected to rise from roughly $4,000 in 2010 to $8,000 in 2020, and these middle class urban areas are also seeing rapid population growth -- meaning more people making more money. That's a trend that bodes well for entertainment-focused companies.Although iQiyi has yet to achieve profitability, it managed to increase sales roughly 57% year over year last quarter and is valued at just 4.3 times its 2017 sales. That's an attractive level given evidence of strong sales momentum and plenty of room for growth down the line. Also, iQiyi should benefit from its relationship with  , China's largest search engine and the company that iQiyi was recently spun off from. There may be some bumps in the road, but I think that iQiyi stock has the potential to be a big winner for long-term investors. The amount of data being created by billions of connected devices and systems around the world is only increasing every year. While numerous companies that deal in information may come to mind,  usually isn't on the list for most.That's because Splunk's services are for big enterprises. The company's software organizes unusable raw data into a format that can spot trends, recognize anomalies, and in general help an organization make decisions with its information. An artificial intelligence system is also offered, to use that organized data to make predictions. Splunk's abilities can be used in a wide array of applications, including cybersecurity, fraud protection, fleet and asset tracking, and website monitoring.Business has been on a roll; revenues have more than doubled the last three years. However, Splunk is still a relatively small company. Total sales in 2017 were just $1.27 billion, and total valuation based on market cap is at $15.6 billion as of this writing.Management thus feels it has plenty of room to keep expanding. The next milestone is $2 billion in annual sales and 20,000 total customers, both of which the company hopes to hit by 2020. If Splunk keeps rolling at double-digit growth rates, it could become more of a household name in short order.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new June 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $94.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $101.94/share today.Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.

If an investor was to purchase shares of SPLK stock at the current price level of $101.94/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.05% if the stock gets called away at the June 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPLK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SPLK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Big data isn't new, but many companies are only just beginning to embrace its value. That benefits this technology company, so there is reason to believe it's not too late to get in on the action.Massive quantities of data are constantly being created by web page clicks, applications, servers, and payment processing systems. Most of that data is unorganized and practically unusable, so Splunk developed a system to help businesses change that. Its cloud-based app  generated by an organization's devices, apps, sites, and systems, so it can look for trends and other useful items that help the business make better decisions. It also has machine-learning software that uses the newly organized data to make predictions.Splunk's software also has been put to use in cybersecurity and fraud protection, system failure detection, fleet tracking, and website monitoring. The company has a high rate of retention and has been expanding relationships with current customers, but new ones are quickly being added, too. Over 570 customers were added in the  , bringing the total to over 15,400, which keeps Splunk on track to hit its goal of 20,000 by the year 2020.All of that has led to big revenue gains, the primary driver of the stock at this point. The company exceeded $1 billion in revenue for the first time last year and is pushing to hit $2 billion by 2020.Data by  TTM = trailing 12 months.It looks like those lofty goals will be met in the next few years. Splunk has momentum, and the amount of data out there is only growing -- there is expected to be 44 times more data produced in 2020 than there was in 2009. With that type of outlook, the stock is \"buy\" for sure, right?Image source: Getty Images.It's important to acknowledge that Splunk is not yet a profitable enterprise. In 2017, the operating and net losses were $254 million and $259 million, respectively. Though the stock has had a great run the last year, it is historically volatile because of big fluctuations in those bottom-line figures. So investors leery of roller coaster rides should pause before jumping in.For everyone else, though, Splunk actually reports a profit when adjusting for things like  and amortization. Adjusted earnings were $0.62, a 77% increase over the year prior. That adjusted figure puts its trailing-12-month PE ratio at a pricey 173. While paying for 173 years' worth of adjusted profits is a rich valuation by anyone's measure, things look better when using  -- money left over after basic operations are paid for, excluding investments back into the business.Data by Now, paying for 62 years of today's levels of annual free cash flow is still expensive, but Splunk might be worth it over the long term. Cash generated from the business is steadily on the rise as expense and investment growth are slowing, and share-based compensation is also falling. Management expects free cash flow to increase 14% to $275 million this year.If Splunk can continue delivering double-digit revenue growth and achieve the $2 billion mark in the next two years, those sky-high valuations may not be an issue, as profitability is right around the corner. The company is still relatively small, too, with a valuation of just over $15 billion. Over the longer term, big data will only get bigger, so there's no limit for this company. It could be a bumpy ride, though, so faint-of-heart investors may want to think twice before purchasing shares.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Welcome back to  !Got a special show lined up for you. This is Conscious Capitalism Month for  . I hope you enjoyed my interviews last week, first with Raj Sisodia and Alexander McCobin of Conscious Capitalism fame, and then the weekend extra with my friend Ed Freeman. What a delight it was to share those three with you and the message that business, maybe in contrast to what you often hear, is arguably the most powerful way to elevate humanity.The beauty of capitalism well done is it's a win-win-win-win situation. Businesses offering products and services that you and I like enough that we would actually pay for them. Enabling those businesses to expand as they take in our payments and hire people. We hope creating great places to work. And then if you're a partner or supplier, you're excited to work with that business.And if you're a shareholder of those businesses, they tend to do awfully well over time, and I think we've demonstrated that very consistently at The Motley Fool, picking stocks through  . My picks through  over the years. Lots of you, I know, are already members. But if you're not a member, I hope you'll think about joining one of our services.The most obvious starter service for most people is our cheapest entry-level service -- you can often find it for less than $100 a year --  , and many of the companies that I talk about on this podcast were, in fact, first picked by me, or my brother Tom, or somebody else through one of our services. Oftentimes  , our longest-running service, destroying the stock market averages since March of 2002.In fact, [I just spoke] at Princeton University as part of their Last Lectures Series just earlier this week. This is a series of lectures where people come in from the outside and speak to graduating seniors who somehow block out some extra time away from their senior theses, and wrapping up the end of their school years, to come and hear a lecture. I really enjoyed speaking to the kids this week about Conscious Capitalism. About thinking about what wins in business and why business is such a wonderful thing to help elevate humanity when it's done right.Now, certainly there are many examples of business done wrong, both historically [especially historically], but certainly in the modern day, as well. Those aren't the companies I would suggest you invest in. That's not what we're about at The Motley Fool. And I know you with your Fool cap and me with mine, that working together as we always have we'll continue to find the great ones and continue to invest in them.Now, speaking of great ones, I have two great things for you this week. The first is we're going to review, as I always do, past stocks picked on this show. Two years ago, this week, I picked five stocks which I labeled \"5 Winners in a Thinking World.\" The big question is whether they have won and what can we learn from that? That's exciting item No. 1 this week.Exciting item No. 2 is that I'm joined by one of my favorite CEOs, Selim Bassoul of Middleby Corporation. Again, many people in the world have never heard of Middleby Corporation, and yet if you're an investor, especially if you're a  member, I bet you may already be invested in Middleby Corporation; the maker, initially, of commercial ovens for kitchens of pizza joints and all kinds of restaurants.But increasingly, as it acquires and grows other companies, whether it's Viking [going into the homes], or more automated types of futuristic ovens, Middleby Corporation is the leader, both domestically and, I think, worldwide. My brother first discovered [Selim] when he picked the stock for  about 14 years ago. Selim Bassoul is one of our favorite people [not just in business, but one of our favorite people], and it will be a delight to share my brief interview with Selim at the Conscious Capitalism Conference in Dallas this month. That's what I have on tap for you.But before I start our review of \"5 Winners in a Thinking World,\" I just want to recall one thing that I was able to share with the Princeton seniors this week, and it was something that I read out on an earlier mailbag this year. It was either January or February. Can't quite remember, but I love it so much I want to share it again. It's about the power of saving. It's a short anecdote and, again, if you're a regular, devoted listener [and if so, God bless you], you might already remember this one, and yet I think this is one of those that bears repeating, and not just to graduating seniors at one university, but how about all universities.This was the story from one of our longtime members, Dave, whose screen name is DaGecko in The Fool community, and this was the story that he told about how he learned to save as a young military officer. Here it is just one more time.\"Back in 1975,\" Dave wrote, \"one of my instructors took a few minutes to talk about finances. He had a recommendation. He suggested that when we graduated we take five dollars of our $625 per month that we were going to receive as Second Lieutenants and save it; and do so without fail or changing the amount every paycheck until we were promoted to First Lieutenant. He asked us how much we would have.\"Well, knowing it would take two years until we were promoted, we quickly figured [24 times 5] plus interest would be about $125. He commented that yes, it would not be much, but the goal of the first two years was to develop the habit of saving. He then suggested that upon getting a raise [and actually two raises, because we got one for the promotion and one for two years of service], that we save half of that increase and use the rest to pay additional taxes and increase our standard of living.\"He pointed out that if we could make ends meet on a Second Lieutenant's salary in our 24th month, then we could make it during the 25th month on that amount plus half of the increase. He said to do this throughout our career and we would have a sizable sum by the time we retired. It made sense to me,\" Dave wrote.He went on. \"I did not have a career of military service, but I followed his advice with my civilian pay. When I was about 55, my wife and I went out with another couple and the husband asked if we had saved anything, yet, for retirement. He said they were concerned, as they had not yet started. I related the story of my instructor's suggestion and said we were probably saving about 40% of my gross salary. They were shocked.\"The next day I came home, and my wife greeted me with music to any husband's ear. She said, 'You're right!' I had no idea of what she was speaking and was almost afraid to ask about what I was right about. She said that when she'd heard my story she thought it was quite an exaggeration to say 40%. She said she'd never added it up; but did so that morning. We had some money going here, and some going there. She was shocked to find out it added up to 42%.\"You know, two years ago this week when I did my \"5 Winners in a Thinking World\" show, one of the things I said on that show, since I listened to it again in preparation for this one, is that a wonderful thing takes place once you start saving and then investing and, of course, investing Foolishly, and enjoying the successes that you will surely have done patiently over time.And the wonderful thing that happens is as you start doing well -- as your money starts making money on its own through the stock market as you start doing well -- guess what happens? You start being inspired to save more money as you start to realize your money can make money at quite a decent clip. In fact, a 10% or so annualized return is pretty sweet, and we have a record of beating that through this podcast and a lot of our work, here, at The Motley Fool. Once you start doing that, you're like, \"Man, I want to save more dollars because those are going to be worth even more down the line, benefiting me, my family, and the world at large.\"That's the wonderful dynamic that I hope every graduating senior, this important month in their lives, recognizes, and even if it's just saying to a son or daughter, niece or nephew, granddaughter or grandson, \"Honey, save five dollars this year.\" In other words, be a net saver. And it's really hard with lots of student debt. And so, I understand in those contexts, it's not as easy.But how about that aspirational five dollars that our friend, Dave, and his instructor talked about 40 or so years ago? That would be such a great thing, because it establishes the habit of saving, and when you connect that in to the practice of Foolish investing, it's a pretty devastating one-two combo punch. Let's start reviewing two years ago.The first thing you need to know -- this is the way I like to start my reviews -- is to note how the market has done in the last two years since May 4, 2016 when \"5 Winners in a Thinking World\" aired, and I'm just taking the closing prices from that day. And the stock market from 05/04/16 through 05/07/18 [Monday's close], the market is up 30.2%. That has been a great two years.You and I know that the market tends to average around 10% a year. Two years with a little compounding wouldn't be much more than 20%, so this has been an above-average period, and a great time to be invested. And, you know, a lot of people two years ago were saying, \"Market's going to sell off. It's going to be really bad in 2016 because it's been so good the previous years.\"And yet look what's happened. Let's not look backward. Let's look forward and let's look with the eyes of history as our guide. Yes, the stock market will sell off one year in three, and definitely there will be [and have been] some down times, so let's not get too carried away with trying to guess where the market's headed based on where it's been.Now, the five stocks were \"5 Winners in a Thinking World.\" I was positing two years ago this week that the world has moved. I was quoting Michael Bloomberg, entrepreneur and politician. He was talking about how historically humans had started as an agrarian species after our hunter-gatherer phase, so for thousands of years we were farmers. And then for a couple of hundred years, we entered the industrial age.But then he said [and, in fact, this was in his speech to graduating seniors at the University of Michigan a few years ago], that now we're entering the age of information. We're no longer farming as much. We're no longer as much about factory production. Now we're about the life of the mind, and the possibilities.And so, inspired by that, I looked across the 200 or so active recommendations which I've made in  and  , all brought together in what we call  [a service I hope many of you are enjoying]. And I looked across those 200 and I said, \"Which are five companies that will benefit from this increasingly [thinking] world that we're living in?\"And I also said, \"I'm not going to pick the obvious ones,\" two years ago. I said, \"I could definitely pick Alphabet, because Google of searching and all the life of the mind that's baked into that company. Or some of the other big companies like Amazon.\" I said, \"I'm going to restrict myself from taking those obvious, big internet players. Let's look for five other kinds of companies.\" And here's what they are and here's how they've done.Stock No. 1: The first one up, alphabetically, is  (NASDAQ: CELG) . The ticker symbol is CELG. Celgene, two years ago, was at $101 a share. Celgene, as of Monday's market close was down to $84.57. So, not such a great stock pick of mine. Celgene down 16%. The market up 30%. So, we're going to have to log a minus 46% to start this review of my stocks from five years ago, as Celgene has dropped a little and the market, as we've already established, has done quite well.In case you don't know Celgene, C-E-L-G-E-N-E, this is a company that is really the worldwide leader in fighting blood cancer. Its drug, Revlimid, is the big dog and continues to be really relevant; however, the possibility of it running out of its patent and being copied by cheaper upstarts has given the market pause as it looks at Celgene stock.So, I turned to one of my fellow analysts, Karl Thiel, and he shared that and a little bit more with you. For those of us who are interested in Celgene, Karl wrote [and I'm just going to read it out, here], \"Celgene has for years, now, and without any significant stumble, put up a great financial performance. It has posted\" -- get this -- \"double-digit revenue growth every year since 1996. Even recent concerns about newer products like Otezla, struggling against competition, has been overblown. After a difficult quarter last year, they rebounded.\"But since so much rides on Revlimid, on track for $9.5 billion in sales this year, fears about patent expiration trumped pretty much all other concerns and, more recently, investor confidence has been shaken by some bad luck or unforced errors [a botched application for Ozanimod], an expected blockbuster in multiple sclerosis. Also, the failure of a late-stage Crohn's disease drug. Even some disappointment with a Revlimid label expansion. Management insists revenue will reach $19-20 billion by 2020, but investors worry what will happen next.\"Our feeling,\" Karl writes, \"is that even with stumbles and setbacks, the company is setting itself up well for the post-Revlimid world. It bought Juno,\" [which is another one of our  stock picks]. \"It owns a piece of what is perhaps  's most exciting drug, a CAR T immunotherapy drug for myeloma.\" By the way, Bluebird Bio is also a  recommendation.By the way, I call this Foolretsu sometimes. You may be familiar with the Japanese concept of keiretsu, where companies that might have the same capitalists backing them start to work with each other in sort of a networked, competitively advantaged way. Well, I see here, maybe, a new emerging term that I've used some over the years ... a Foolretsu ... when some of our recommendations, unbeknownst to us being to work together.Anyway, to close Karl's thoughts and then we'll go to the next stock. \"Long term, we're very confident that the company will succeed, grow, and prove to be undervalued. The problem is the transition is so uncertain, no one can be sure of when Revlimid generic competition starts. The worst case is the year 2020, with 2024 being more likely and 2026 being definitely. We can't be sure of every pipeline program, so there's definitely a bumpy road ahead as there can be with any biotech, even a gigantic one like this one.\" So, there's a little bit of a look back and forward at Celgene, which has started with a minus 46% in the loss column. Let's go to stock No. 2.Stock No. 2: Stock No. 2's ticker symbol is [DIS]. Do you know what that one is? I bet you do. It's  (NYSE: DIS) . Disney two years ago this week -- think about all the Disney  movies. Think about Marvel.  All those other Marvel movies. Think about Disney Princesses. Expansions with its theme parks. Think about all those toys produced. Think about the genius that Bob Iger has brought to overseeing this company. Two years ago, Disney was at $103.70. As of Monday's close this week, it is down to $102.48, so not down very much. Down 1%.But down 1% when the market was up 30% has me with a little egg on my face. Just a little. It's not just a yellow egg, because this is The Motley Fool, so it's kind of a multicolored spatter of egg on my face as I look backward, now, at my \"5 Winners in a Thinking World\" and see Celgene down 46% to the market and Disney down 31% to the market. So, if you're keeping score at home [and darn it, I sure hope you will], I'm going take it out to one more decimal. I'm down 77.8%. We'll call that a minus 78 after these two picks.I'm not going to spend as much time on Disney. It's a much better-known company than Celgene and some of these others. I think we can all continue to say that this is an iconic brand. This is a great, very profitable company. It is a massive company, far larger than any of the others on this list. It's a company that has guaranteed movie hits going forward about as far as I can see. Far more visibility than any other company in its industry. It's got all the great brands. It's got great management.It does have that ESPN legacy model which continues to drag the company down some [both in terms of its results and in terms of external perception of Disney], and I think that explains, in part, the underperformance.Disney I originally recommended not ever as Disney. The reason that it appears multiple times on  and has been a mega winner for our members is that I recommended Pixar a few times and Disney bought Pixar. And even more times than a few I recommended Marvel [since way back in the day when that first  movie came out]. Those have been just tremendous performers, but I have six positions in  on Disney, and none of them was ever picked as Disney.So, it kind of hurts that the stock which I picked in June of 2002 and is up 54x for our members since then; that this stock would underperform for my podcast over the last couple of years and put me deep in the hole at minus 78% before we hit our final three stocks.And before we get to those next three stocks, I want to mention [and again, if you're a regular listener you know this] that I have, I think, an unblemished record of always beating the market with all my five-stock samplers that I've done since July of 2015 on this show. In other words, we're something like 14 and 0, and right now we're staring at the possibility that we might have our first loss; although, I will point out we're only two years in with this group of five stocks and I was picking them for three-plus years. The big question at this point is will  -- will this podcast -- keep the streak alive?Stock No. 3: Stock No. 3's ticker symbol is SPLK. The company is  (NASDAQ: SPLK) . In a world of big data, think about a thinking world and how much data we're generating. Splunk is one of those big data companies whose tools allow people to conduct better business intelligence. What are people clicking on? How are they using your website? Splunk creates colorful pictures for employees right out there on the front lines and in the field, giving infographics and other industry-leading forms of help through its core business.Splunk is also a company with kind of a silly name, and one of my six Rule Breaker attributes is always when a company has a brand and within a space where you could just be Big Data, Inc. [BDI, let's say], this company has a little bit more personality and pep. Often a good sign of a potential Rule Breaker, and that has been Splunk.Now, before I tell you how Splunk's done in the last two years, I should note that before I picked it two years ago, it had done something unusual for one of my picks, because it had dropped 25% in the few months leading up to me picking it two years ago. Kind of a disappointment. The company that had been public for several years -- a good Rule Breaker pick -- was in the midst of a sell-off.Two years ago, it tipped the scales at $49 a share. On Monday it closed at $109.94. We could round that to $110, but I'll leave it hardcore and make it $109.94. That is a 124.4% gain, and that's 94% ahead of the market. So that minus 78% we were looking at just a few minutes ago all of a sudden just tipped to plus 16%.So, where has Splunk come from and where is it going? Well, for this one I tapped another one of my analysts, Simon Erickson, and I'm going to give you a little extra, just like I did for Celgene. These are lesser-known companies to many of us [Celgene and Splunk], and I'd love for you to get to know a company like this one a little bit better. After all, it's been pretty lucrative to be a Splunk shareholder these last couple of years and we like it going forward.When I asked Simon what had happened, he said, \"Well, the need for monitoring machine data is increasing, so think of Splunk as providing the peripheral vision for a company to understand how they're actually operating. They can keep an eye on their weblogs to detect hackers and malware. They can monitor equipment performance to keep them safe. They can optimize IT performance of the data center.\"And Simon says that one of his favorite use cases is how they're slicing data for Domino's, so they're monitoring in real time what pizzas people buy regionally and using that to inform their marketing promotions. There's a ton of data available out there. Companies need Splunk to find both problems and opportunities that they didn't even know they should be looking for.I'm going to skip some of his numbers, here. If you're a  member, you're getting this, anyway, but they're basically getting more from existing customers which is really helping their margins. They are a cloud-based company, as well.\"And probably the most exciting development for Splunk shareholders is that they've integrated into Amazon's AWS, Amazon Web Services, and Google's cloud environments. As an example, Splunk is now powering the Amazon Echo. I'm not going to say her name and trigger it if you're listening to this podcast over that machine [the Amazon Echo, for business]. So, customers are aggressively moving their applications to the cloud and now they can use Splunk to index all that machine data that they generate and in real time.\"And now back to me. Thank you, Simon, for that. That truly, to me, sounds like a winner in an increasingly thinking world. A quick side note. This company will report its first quarter earnings on May 24. So, Splunk [SPLK].Stock No. 4: Before I say the name of this one, I'll just mention that it had declined 70% in the year leading up to me picking it two years ago on this podcast. And I teased you, if you were listening back then, by mentioning it's a name and a platform that we all know. Whether or not you use it, it is pretty much and was a household name back then. I would say it's only even more popular today. The ticker symbol is  and that means it's  (NYSE: TWTR) .Two years ago, Twitter was trading at $14.85. Today it's trading at $31.33. So, I was kind of on the precipice whether I'd beat the market or not. The game's not over yet, but Splunk took us over the hump and Twitter just stacked on [well, it's up 111%] 81% ahead of the market. Thank you, Twitter.And the biggest change for Twitter is, of course, that its last couple of quarters it's been profitable, and I think that's something you could have foreseen. This is a stock pick we've had in for years. It's been up and down. Down for quite a while more than up.But what I have always loved about Twitter is that it passes my \"snap test.\" That's a phrase I've used many times before on this podcast. Our snap test is if you were to snap your fingers and cause a company [and its products or services] to just disappear overnight, and the whole world wakes up the next day, the question the snap test has for us is would anyone notice? Would anyone care?And when you can give an emphatic yes to that; that always for me speaks to the potential strength of a stock, even a beaten-down one, which is what Twitter was. Down 70% before we picked it here for you two years ago. Twitter up 111% since then. The company has definitely become only more relevant. Only more solid. It had quite a run through the election. It has some popular politicians who tweet out. Whether or not you follow those tweets, there's something for everybody on Twitter.I use Twitter every day just to track some of the authors and people that I admire and see what they're thinking and sometimes doing. I love Twitter and I would recommend it to you as a user if you're not already. It's been a great stock in recent years and I like it a lot over the next five years.Stock No. 5: And that brings us to stock No. 5 before we start getting the stage cleared for Selim Bassoul. To close it out, here, the final stock is  (NASDAQ: ZG) (NASDAQ: Z) . The ticker symbol back then was [Z]. It's also [ZG] if you like. It's the same company. Just different classes of shares.Zillow two years ago was trading at $28. I'm absolutely delighted to let you know that as of Monday's close, it closed at $55.91. I'm tempted to round that to $56, so I would have a straight double from $28 to $56, but we'll keep it true. It's up 99.7% over the last two years. Just to do some quick math, then, you add its 70% of outperformance and this group of five stocks, despite the dark start that we got, is up 167% over the market.In other words, the market has averaged a 30.2% gain over the last two years, and these five stocks have averaged a 63.5% gain. If you want to annualize those [and why not, because it's kind of fun], those two-year annualized returns for the market 14.1% and for \"5 Winners in a Thinking World,\" despite a couple of clunkers, so far [and, again, this game's not over], that group is up 27.9% annualized, keeping [#TheRBIPodcastStreak] alive.Just a little bit about Zillow since it's been a hero stock. Really the last three have each just about doubled over the last two years. Rick Munarriz, one of my friends and fellow analysts, and a past guest on this show, says the stock has now more than made back the hit it took when it surprised investors by announcing that it would be expanding its Zillow Instant Offers segment, where it essentially buys and flips houses, which was announced in mid-April, just a few weeks ago. This week's quarterly report shows that Zillow's core business is growing just fine. Premier Agent revenue accounting for more than two-thirds of its entire business these days, matched the 22% growth in revenue for the quarter.Traffic always a big thing for Zillow. Traffic across its collection of sites up 15% over the past year. There will be acquisitions, or in the case of Zillow Instant Offers, new potentially questionable ventures that may seem to be distracting, but Zillow is proving that it can still explore related revenue streams without neglecting its bread and butter business.It remains to be seen if realtors will get ticked off if the platform that they lean on for leads starts turning into a rival, but Zillow has shown in the past that it can get the balance right. Zillow's guidance for 2018 calls for revenue growth of about 22-23% before accounting for its new-home segment, etc. This is a company that, like many of these I also own, I have good thoughts about for the year three, five going forward.In fact, even though when I did this two years ago Zillow was the smallest of these five companies by market cap, in some ways, it has the strongest competitive advantage of any of them. When I think of Zillow, if that's the Coca-Cola of the industry, it's really unclear to me if there is a meaningful Pepsi.Well, enough with reviewing stocks that have crushed the market over the last couple of years. Let's next move to the other delight that I have for you this week, and that is our friend Selim Bassoul.One of my favorite people in business, Selim Bassoul is chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of The Middleby Corporation. As I mentioned earlier in the show, a leading developer and manufacturer of commercial cooking equipment, and food processing and packaging equipment.Mr. Bassoul is responsible for the strategic direction of the company and leading the senior management team. And, as you'll find out from our interview, at least two more things. First of all, he's responsible, in many ways, for a hugely winning stock over the last decade plus and he's a gentleman with a really interesting backstory.Without further ado, Selim Bassoul.__ It was, I'm going to say, February of 2013. My brother came back from an interview he'd done with a public company CEO and he insisted that all his executive team watch the full 60-plus minutes of this privately taped video interview that we eventually shared with our members. But Tom was so passionate about it. He said, \"I insist that all of my direct reports watch this.\" It was an interview with Selim Bassoul, the CEO of Middleby.And Selim Bassoul I'm very pleased to have with me here on  . Selim, I watched that video, I loved it, and then I noticed that no Motley Fool service at that moment was actively recommending Middleby stock.  Tom had started, found your company early on, and had a great run with it; but, somebody had sold it, I think, at some point. And so, I said, \"I'm going to recommend Middleby for  \" That was one month after, so it was March of 2013. The stock right then was around $49. Today it's around $125. It's been an awfully good five years. Selim, thank you for all that you've done [not just for investors and Rule Breaker members listening right now], but through your business for the world at large, and I want to try to talk about each of those three things as quickly as we can.Let me start by asking. How did Middleby start? Well, it started in the '80s by Bill Whitman. It was a company that had good brands. They were selling everything to everybody. They had ovens, and refrigerators, and mixers. And it was a company like everybody, a \"me too\" company. Almost growing (unclear 31:52). Not a lot of innovation and there was a lot of turnover. We had a lot of turnover of employees. There were a lot of turnovers of customers. We did not have a process. There was no culture.In fact, the smartest thing that Bill Whitman did was to hire me. He went and recruited me... [Laughs] ...to come in and change his company and change the culture. What year was that, Selim? It was in 1996. And he gave me free hand to set a new culture. And that's lesson No. 1. Lesson No. 1 is surround yourself with the best. When you are struggling and sinking, the best thing is to go find the best. At the time I was a rising star in the food equipment business. He approached me, and he said, \"Selim, I want you. I want you to come in.\" Lesson No. 2 is to give full empowerment to your employees to do what they need to do. No. 3 is he said to me, \"Selim, we do not have a culture. Create a culture.\" And Selim, you came as a rising star from another company. Did you borrow anything from that experience? What did you learn and what is the culture that you've now created? And the number I think is right -- 22 years later. David, I learned from being in healthcare that you cannot survive without speed, agility, and innovation. You can't. In healthcare, those are the three major factors of being able to be relevant. And I adapted that in every one of our businesses. Speed -- speed of execution. Speed of innovation. Agility -- remaining lean and efficient and agile.And No. 3 is just innovation. You have to innovate. You have to be ahead of your customers. Selim, as I think about the success that Middleby's had, you have been a master of acquiring other companies. You have great organic growth, and a wonderful vision. We're going to talk about your vision for the world at large in a little bit, but sticking with Middleby, here, you have grown the company through any number of acquisitions over years now. Integrating them.And the way that I cast it -- as we wrote up your stock five years ago -- tell me if we have this right. We always have things a little wrong, so correct me here, Selim. I was saying that Bassoul has this wonderful story that he can tell talented, up-and-coming companies.He said, \"You're great. I like you. If I like you you'll stay on and be within the leadership, but two things we can offer you. No. 1, we can make you global. Many of you are smaller companies or regional companies. We can take you and make you much bigger. And No. 2, we are a technology company, ourselves. We can improve your technology, so we can make you better and bigger.\"That, as it turns out, has been a siren song for dozens of companies that you've acquired over the years. Is that an accurate portrayal of the company? I know it's not fully accurate. What else needs to be said? I think this is quite accurate. I will go back and tell you what we do  do. We do not buy markets or competitors. We buy technology innovation. If you aim to acquire a market or to take out a competitor, you will always fail, so that has never been our model. A lot of people come to me and say, \"Selim, but if you buy this market, it's easy.\" I'd say, \"We can grow in the market organically. We don't need to buy somebody.\"No. 2: What we always do is find the people that fit us. They should be disruptive in their own world and they need to have a culture of winning.And the third is a culture of empowerment. So, I look at lots of entrepreneurs and I find that a lot of them have technology, they have a winning culture, but they are not able to empower their people. They have such control that they become control freaks. And many times, I walk away from this, because then the culture doesn't work for us.We do not embrace control freaks. It doesn't work. When you have only three layers of separation between me and the lowest-ranking employees, you have to create a lot of autonomy, otherwise we cannot do our job. We cannot grow. Maybe the hardest thing to do in business is to acquire something else. A different culture. Even if it's a like-minded culture, ultimately, it's a separate group of people. You've not met them before. All of a sudden, they're part of you. And so, this is not a fair question, but why would we ask fair questions on  ? Selim, could you give a 90-second or so short course, maybe with three points? A master class for those of us who would like to do our acquisitions better. How have you made it work? Ninety seconds or so. No. 1 is to make sure that you are able to get a return on your investment. That's No. 1. It's not how much you pay. It's how much you get back in terms of return. Our format is simple. We like to get back our cash in five years or less. Including synergy and everything else, if I pay $100 million for an acquisition, I want to get back all my cash in five years or less.No. 2, I want to be able to know that this company I can take globally. We do not buy regional players. At the end, this is not what we need. We need scale.No. 3, we need to make sure that the management team can stay with us; not only the founder or the family that owned it or the owner, but deep in the organization, because we want to have people on the bench. If we cannot keep that management team, we'll not buy that company irrespective of how good they are. That's really interesting. And many people take an opposite approach. I remember John Mackey of Whole Foods often says it's very hard for us as an acquisitive company [Whole Foods, over the course of a few decades], to let those CEOs in place. Usually when he buys, he lets them know that's going to be their last day on the job for that company.Of course, Warren Buffett, sounding a lot more like Selim Bassoul, here, prefers to find those great managers and put them in place. I guess it can work either way. We each need to find what is the music, what is the rhythm that works for us, and that's a brilliant master class in 90 seconds. Thank you, Selim.Now I want to broaden things briefly. Selim, you speak beautiful English, but the discerning listener will notice that Selim has an accent that he speaks with. Not everybody knows your story, and we don't have the time it deserves to hear your full story but, Selim, could you talk a little bit about where you came from and your family growing up? I grew up in Beirut, Lebanon from a modest upbringing. My father was an Olympic swimmer. My aunt was a Catholic nun and she was considered the Mother Teresa of Lebanon. And I grew up in an environment of love and passion. My father was passionate about being the best. He became an Olympic swimmer and my aunt created so much good around not only Lebanon but around the Middle East, so there was a lot of excellence in what my family [did].However, the Civil War broke and we became refugees ourselves. We were in the wrong part of town, and we were overnight displaced. How old were you at that time? A teenager. I was 15 or 16. And that taught me a big lesson. One, the world can change on you on a dime. Here we come from a lower-middle class with the home we're living in to overnight being asked or forced to leave our neighborhood and basically our community, and we became homeless. No home. We had to be dispersed. Split up, [broken] up as family, and go and find refuge among other family members in the other part of town. For a year it was tough.And I remember my father talking to my mother and saying, \"I have only twenty dollars in my pocket. What do I do? We have three children.\" And I will never forget that, and I opted that I would never be poor again. And briefly, what was the process by which you wound up in the United States of America? I ended up one, outperforming at American University of Beirut. I graduated with distinction. I was one of the valedictorians at the college, at the university. And then I started working with Ernst & Young at the time. It was called Ernst & Whinney in Beirut, and I became a rising star.And then I applied. I always wanted to come to the U.S. to learn business. It was my dream. So, I had a scholarship to go to the London School of Economics or to study in England, and I always wanted to go to the United States. When I applied to MBA, I got accepted at Northwestern, and that's what drove me to come to the U.S. Not hoping to stay here. Thinking that I would go back to the Middle East to work in the oil industry, or work in consulting. Maybe joining back with Ernst & Whinney or Ernst & Young.But I stayed. And then I went up to China. I went up to Asia. I went back to the Middle East. So, oneI've been in emerging markets and that's reshaped my thinking, watching the emerging markets. Selim, for you business is not just a calling. It's an opportunity not just to maximize shareholder value [and you've done a very fine job of that], but to reach outside of your own company and help the world. Could you describe, briefly [you told a great story, here, at the Conscious Capitalism Conference], about developing an oven for people who are in tough straits? I always wanted to change the world in a small way. If not in a big way, in a small way. I wanted to follow in the footsteps of my aunt. She did great work. I kept my antennas open, and I always did philanthropic work, like all of us. We did charity work. We helped in scholarships. We helped community colleges. We helped people in need, whether it's neighbors or distant family friends, or whatever. But I wanted something big. I wanted to affect thousands of people. So, I'd been looking for that thing.Ultimately, I found it was the refugees, and it was core competency. We do ovens. I found out that those refugees have nothing. They lost everything. They are fetching wood. And then from there I found out that there are 3 billion people on Earth that cook on open fires, and 450,000 of them die of toxic smoke.For me, this was a big calling. Taking my core competency, going out on the ground, and finding technology the way we find our customers to provide those people a sliver of hope. A dignified life. And you've given away how many ovens? Thousands, right now. We've given them in Lebanon to refugees. Syrian refugee camps. In Turkey. The hurricane that hit Puerto Rico. And to Haiti. And I think now we're going back into India, and Africa, and I would like to go to the refugee camp of Rohingya in Bangladesh, because there is a need there.I watch on TV those same things you do. There are a lot of people, today, that have lost a lot of things, and I want to help, at least with one accessory, which is the oven. Selim Bassoul, thank you for what you are and what you do! Thank you!__ And now coming out of that interview, what I love about so much of our work at The Motley Fool is not only are we focused on finding for you the winners over the only term that for me counts, which is the long term; but how about the human interest behind the people that make the great businesses of today work?Yes, much ink is spilled on big personalities like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos; but the Selim Bassouls of the world have a great story to tell, too. It's funny. As I was looking through Wikipedia to see what I could read about Selim's background; he doesn't even have a Wikipedia page, and yet here's a guy, now that you've gotten to know him, who deserves, I think, a lot more attention and I bet will get it in the coming years.Just a few housekeeping notes to close. First of all, we've got a  extra for you. That's right. As part of Conscious Capitalism Month, I had a dynamic conversation with a few younger entrepreneurs. Maybe a little bit lesser-known bright lights from the Conscious Capitalism world. You're going to get to meet them this weekend.If you have a little extra time for us this week [20 minutes or so], and you're looking for something fun on the weekend, this one gets a little racy. So, if that attracts you, you're definitely going to want to listen this weekend. On the other hand, if you tend to listen to  with your kids, you might occasionally want to think about putting your hand over their ear for what's coming up this weekend. It's a fun, lively conversation with three Conscious Capitalism entrepreneurs that I know you're going to enjoy.And next week we're going to go back to one of my favorite series, and that's our Great Quotes series. I'm going to be pulling quotes that I think are inspirational, thoughtful, challenging, interesting, and I'm going to specifically be pulling them from the Conscious Capitalism Conference that I attended earlier this month in Dallas. It's going to be the \"All Conscious Capitalism Quotes\" edition on next week's  podcast.In the meantime, have a great week. Maybe see you this weekend. Fool on!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Not too long ago, Splunk (  ) announced its Q4 FY '18 and full-year FY '18 results, and those results were generally received gleefully by analysts and investors alike. Jim Cramer, for example, hosted Splunk's CEO, Doug Merritt, on \"Mad Money\" and suggested that Splunk is still in the \"early innings\" in terms of growth.On March 27, 2018, the company held an Analyst Day to discuss its performance, forecast, and strategy moving forward. Broadly, the company laid out a revenue goal of $2 BB by FY '20, with non-GAAP operating margin growth along the way. Its underlying strategy - again, broadly speaking - revolves around a transition to subscription-based licensing, additional market penetration, sales coverage, and growing the company's cloud business.In this article, I attack elements of Splunk's outlook and strategy based on irregularities/risks that I believe are exposed through an analysis of the  discussion, the Analyst Day presentation/discussion, and the company's financial data.The  I published on Seeking Alpha - nearly eight months ago - discussed my reasoning against a Cisco (  ) acquisition of Splunk. For reasons beyond the scope of this article, I actually hesitated to publish it. Ultimately, I did publish, and it elicited, shall we say, a strong reaction. With most sentiment around Splunk fervently bullish, I expect this article and its decidedly bearish tone might evoke a similar reaction.So be it. I reiterate from the prior article that I don't believe Splunk is in its early innings of growth anymore, contrary to the position held by Mr. Cramer. That view, coupled with the risks I discuss herein, led me to recommend that existing investors think carefully about their position.As this article became a bit longer than I originally expected, I divided it into numbered sections. While the sections do relate to each other, some readers might consider \"moving between\" sections, as opposed to reading the article sequentially.The article index is as follows:1.0 Overview and Index (i.e. what you're reading right now).2.0 A Quick Look At The Numbers3.0 Operating Margin Is... Uh... What Now?4.0 Analysts/Investors Are Ignoring Risks Around Licensing Mix4.1 Subscription Renewals Are Not A Layup4.2 License Model Impact On Operations4.3 License Model Impact On Average Deal Size4.4 Summing Up The Risks Around Licensing Mix5.0 Market Strategy May Be Unrealistic6.0 Don't Count On Cloud7.0 A Quick Look At Insider Trading Behavior8.0 ConclusionFinally, Splunk Annual Reports, which I reference, can be accessed  I'm also including, along with the article, Splunk's  transcript and Analyst Day presentation, along with supporting financial data:Before we dive in, let's take a quick look at Splunk's Q4 '18/FY '18 performance as presented during its . Splunk's fourth quarter revenue was $419.7 million, up 37% year over year, fiscal year revenue was $1,271 billion, up 34% year-over-year, and billings also increased healthily in both periods. But GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $23.9 million, and GAAP operating loss for the full year is $259 million.Splunk noted during its  that \"for the full year, operating margin was 9.2% above our expectations due to the strength of our overall top line performance.\" The company went on to say,I had originally planned to discuss operating margin toward the end of this article, but let us begin our analysis there.Splunk's non-GAAP (keyword is \"non-GAAP\") operating margin was an important topic of discussion during the Analyst Day. Before diving into the margin discussion, I'd like to reiterate another point I made in my  discussing Splunk.I encourage readers to keep the point above in mind.Moving forward, the company, like most other software vendors selling subscription licenses, will report results under the new ASC 606 accounting standard vs. the \"old\" ASC 605 standard. Under this rule, software companies are able to recognize the full value of certain subscription licenses upfront. This is delineated in the slide below, presented during the Analyst Day:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThis accounting change impacts Splunk's reported income. For example, as per the slide below, under 606, total revenues for FY '17 decline from $950 to $944 MM, while revenues for FY '18 increase from $1,271 MM to $1,309 MM. We also see that non-GAAP operating margin for FY '18 increases from 9% to 14% under 606.Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThe purpose of this article is not to go into the intricacies of the new standard, although I urge readers to review the following for a good overview:  ).However, I do wish to highlight some irregularity in terms of how Splunk presented its operating margin results during the Analyst Day. The company presented this slide to highlight non-GAAP operating margin growth:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationNow, consider the data above in context with this slide:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationIn the slide above, on the left, Splunk illustrates the operating margin improvement for FY '18 under 606 from 9.2% to 14.2%. On the right, the company illustrates how it arrives at its forecasted operating margin of 11.5% for FY '19, again under 606.But now, look back at the operating margin leverage slide where the company appears to show non-GAAP operating margin growth. The company has mixed results from 605 and 606 accounting standards to create this growth curve. Specifically, in this slide, the 9.2% non-GAAP operating margin result for FY '18 is under 605, whereas the non-GAAP operating margin forecasts for FY '19 and FY '20 are under 606. This slide is misleading in my view. It's a bit like mixing GAAP and non-GAAP results together.In fact, if we normalize the last three data points in this slide under 606, we have the following (asterisk delineates forecast):\n  \nSo, non-GAAP operating margin is really not forecast to increase, it is decreasing between FY' 18 and FY '19 and actually roughly flat between FY '18 and FY '20. During the Analyst Day Q&A period, one of the analysts (Walter) pointed out that the company is staring at \"flat margins with the same profile of revenue,\" meaning the top-line goal of $2 BB by FY' 20 has remained steady over various Splunk forecasts. This analyst suggested that perhaps the \"missing link,\" in terms of why operating margin is flat, is the company's activity around reinvestment initiatives. Dave Conte, Splunk Senior VP and CFO, replied as follows, which I transcribed from the  :(If you'd like to listen to this particular question/answer, it is around the 3:41 mark - that is, 3 hours, 41 minutes.)Dave Conte's answer to the question seemed rather indirect to me. A simple answer would have been along the lines of \"Yes; operating margin is expected to be roughly flat between FY '18 and FY '20 due to reinvestment activity.\" Moreover, Dave Conte's answer does not explain why 605 and 606 accounting standards were mixed on the operating margin leverage slide, although, admittedly, he was not asked that specific question. Finally, it would have been helpful if his answer explained why the company has raised non-GAAP operating margin guidance for FY '20 from 12% to 14% (the 12% figure was presented in FY '17).I'm concerned as to why the company appears to obfuscate margin performance on the operating margin leverage slide, in an effort to create the appearance of growth.Also, Splunk has provided through its own commentary some reasons to think that operating margins are at risk. As we will discuss further in the article, Dave Conte has stated that he expects subscription license durations to ease down. If that is so, an investor should wonder if that fact is in conflict with the increased guide for FY '20. After all, the company has indicated they intend to reinvest the main expense benefit that they receive under 606 (i.e. commission expense). So, if you are reinvesting your main accounting benefit, and subscription contracts - which will dominate your license mix (we'll discuss this in detail in a moment) - are expected to be shorter in duration and therefore lower in value, where is the increased operating margin guide coming from for FY' 20?I also would remind investors of Splunk's GAAP operating margin performance from FY' 2012 through FY' 2018:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY '13 - FY '18, Chart Source: Yves SukhuGAAP margin has been trending in the right direction over the last few years, but given the discussion on non-GAAP operating margin above, I'm concerned about a possible reversal.I reminded readers at the outset of this section that Splunk backs out its rather large stock-based compensation expense to generate non-GAAP results. In fairness, the company indicated during the Analyst Day that this expense is normalizing:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationWhile this may be so, it is the approach of backing out the expense, and not necessarily the expense itself that is concerning. Given the approach to calculating non-GAAP results and given how the non-GAAP operating margin figures were presented/discussed during the Analyst Day, I personally am led to believe that there may be substantial risk around future operating margin performance (both GAAP and non-GAAP).During the earnings call, Splunk noted that its \"largest tailwind is term license bookings.\" By \"term license\", the company is referring to on-premise software licenses with a fixed duration (e.g. one year, two years, etc.), which of course is in contrast to a perpetual license that a customer owns forever. To be clear, Splunk also sells cloud-based licenses which also have a fixed duration but are (obviously) used in the cloud, and not on premise.Splunk is moving from a dominant perpetual license model to a dominant subscription license model, with term and cloud licenses expected to comprise 75% of bookings by FY 2020.Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThis is not surprising, as the enterprise software industry in general is moving in the direction of subscription-licenses over perpetual licenses. However, let me inject a bit of personal anecdote here which is relevant to the discussion: No software company \"wants\" to move to subscription-based licensing over perpetual licenses if the latter was how they were previously selling. They are doing it because they don't have a choice.Analysts on the earnings call, as well as those participating during the Analyst Day, seemed to be generally pleased with Splunk's growing percentage of subscription-based licenses since none brought up any major objections/concerns. It's reasonable to assume that analysts believe Splunk will grow its subscription-license revenues at an increasing rate that exceeds the declining rate of perpetual licenses. On the surface, revenue and sales data seem to support that belief. First, Splunk's top line has continued to grow at an impressive rate, and software license growth specifically has grown at a 44% CAGR since FY 2012.Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationSource: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationSecond, Splunk's average sales price has increased steadily.Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThese trends have occurred as the license mix has been shifting. However, a deeper analysis exposes potential issues that analysts/investors may be overlooking and avoiding.Stating the obvious, customers like subscription-based licenses since they allow costs to be spread out over time (i.e. versus a single up-front payment for a perpetual license).Customers also like subscription-licenses from the standpoint of limiting their \"lock-in\" with any given vendor. Arguably, customers are less likely to leave a technology for which they have a perpetual license, given the nature of the license itself, as well as the (likely) large, upfront cost that they paid to acquire the license. Since subscription licenses are temporary by definition, customers may be more inclined, at the end of their license terms, to consider their options.As I see it, herein lies the challenge for Splunk (and many other software companies) given the shift to more subscription-based licenses.The company's re-subscription rate \"may\" fall over time as competitors and new market entrants give customers pause before committing to another subscription period. In its FY 2017 Annual Report on page 19, Splunk states:As mentioned above, customer preferences have shifted toward subscription-based licensing precisely because they do not want to be locked into technologies over multiple years. Perhaps executive management indirectly makes this point on the FY '18 Q4 earnings call where David Conte stated:He goes on to say:As best I can tell, Splunk does not provide data on their retention rates for subscription licenses. But, the \"law of competition\" dictates that retention rates \"should\" decline over time. Of course, by how much and how fast is difficult to answer. From a top-line perspective, Splunk's growth in subscription revenue must obviously be greater than any declines due to subscriber loss.Moreover, Splunk may come under pressure to renew customer subscriptions at an increasing frequency if subscription periods continue to \"ease down.\" You might argue that the subscription period will eventually reach a \"bottom\" because Splunk simply will not write subscription contracts for less than a given duration (e.g. one year). I agree with that argument. However, let us again think about the possible effect of competitive pressures. If competitors opt to move into shorter-duration subscription contracts (e.g. month-to-month), Splunk may have no choice but to follow suit.Granted, what I have written above is speculative. But I'd argue that it is \"reasonably probable.\" I believe analysts and investors are assuming (incorrectly) that subscription-based revenue will continue to grow without any significant subscriber loss. This is a risky assumption, to say the least, in the face of a highly volatile and competitive market.To close this section, I note that not one analyst on the earnings call, or during the Analyst Day Q&A period, asked about subscription retention rates (historical or forecasted).Let's also think about the move to a subscription-dominant licensing model from a structural perspective. Splunk presently has a \"heavy\" direct sales force, with sales/marketing costs accounting for nearly 64% of total revenues in FY '18. It may prove difficult to support that kind of sales model on a preponderance of short-duration contracts because of the potential variability in revenue. If the revenue mix is going to favor shorter-duration subscription-based contracts moving forward, then Splunk will likely incur pressure on its current sales model. It would seem Doug Merritt, Splunk CEO and President, hinted at this point on the earnings call, again - without stating it directly, saying:(Readers are encouraged to review the full transcript for context.)   As we see above, sales and marketing has been Splunk's largest operating expense. Does Splunk need a direct sales model to survive? Presumably yes, unless they've enjoyed setting a match to piles of money over the last several years. Moreover, as will be discussed later in the article, Splunk intends to sharpen its focus on markets outside its core IT Operations (ITOM) and Security markets via sales coverage.It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that sales and marketing expenses will continue to be the largest operating expense moving forward. It should be pointed out that historically Splunk's ability to support such an expensive sales force has rested on a licensing mix that was dominated by perpetual licenses. So, the company's ability to maintain its current sales structure on a preponderance of subscription licenses is unclear and \"untested.\" That's not to say that it cannot be done. But, it is a significant risk.Let's revisit the slide that Splunk presented on Average Selling Price:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationIt's an impressive chart, especially as average selling price has more than doubled since FY '12. As the company implies in this slide (and states explicitly elsewhere), increased customer adoption over time is driving the growth in ASP. Perhaps even more impressive is the chart displaying the number of deals over $1 million:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationNaturally, an abundance of large deal sizes helps to increase the overall ASP. Evidently, Splunk believes the trend in ASP growth will continue in spite of the change in licensing mix. ASP is extremely important, as it is a key input into maintaining/growing operating margin. Will Splunk's trend in ASP continue?I see four potential problems.1. The first problem lies with the ability for the company to continue driving enterprise adoption agreements (EAAs). The company defines EAAs as follows in its FY '17 Annual Report:Per the last slide, Splunk has done a good job demonstrating growth in these types of contracts. And the company might well continue this trend. However, there are a couple potential issues with EAAs:A decline in EAA revenue volume will drag on ASP. In fact, Dave Conte acknowledged that \"bubbles\" are possible with EAAs in his presentation during the Analyst Day. But he also indicated that he personally believed Splunk's EAA growth will continue.2. The second problem lies in the average value of subscription licenses. Average subscription license value will be less than the average perpetual license value, and Splunk noted during the Analyst Day that their financial models are built on the assumption that subscription licenses will be roughly two-thirds the size of a perpetual license. (I do leave open the possibility that there could be some unusually large subscription license sales.) If perpetual licenses become the smallest piece of the \"license pie,\" then, under one scenario, the average perpetual license deal size will have to increase to compensate to maintain ASP. Simply, the dynamics of the new licensing mix may make it more challenging for Splunk to maintain, much less grow its ASP.3. Competitive pressures are likely to drive down the average value of all license types (subscription and perpetual). Consider the following statement from Splunk's FY '17 Annual Report:These pricing and licensing moves suggest a reaction to competitive pressures, unless, of course, Splunk was feeling particularly generous in 2015. These pressures will only get worse.4. Splunk had an unusually large number of \"mega-orders,\" larger than $10MM in FY '18:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThese \"mega-orders\" were not backed out when calculating ASP. Arguably, the ASP for FY '18 is artificially high due to the influence of these very large orders, which obviously show great variation in terms of their number year over year in the slide above. As with EAAs, there's a certain subset of Splunk's overall customer base that can \"absorb\" such a large transaction. I have no idea how large that subset is, so perhaps Splunk has many more opportunities to sell such large deals. An analyst (Jesse) inquired about the unusual number of large orders in FY '18 and asked why it happened and if investors should expect that kind of large order performance moving forward. Dave Conte replied that he could not say it was a \"new normal\" and offered no explanation as far as why so many large orders were processed in FY '18. Accordingly, investors should be prepared for volatility in terms of the number of these transactions executed year over year.If we aggregate the main points of sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, Splunk's top-line, operating margin, and actual operating structure (among other things) are at risk as the company shifts toward a subscription-dominant license model. Certainly, and contrary to everything I have presented in this section, the company could:My main issue is that the licensing model risks carry a weight that's not reflected in analyst questions/discussions with Splunk. Yes, some analysts participating in the Analyst Day hinted at some licensing mix concerns, as discussed above. But none truly challenged the company, which I think was a disservice to investors.Splunk repeatedly called attention to its total addressable market opportunity during the Analyst Day. Here is the slide presented:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationAlmost every data-centric company has a slide like this. The narrative is always the same:This kind of thinking is misleading, and investors should be wise to it. As any market expands, competition will intensify - barring a monopolistic opportunity, which Splunk does not have in any market. So, while the overall market size grows, the \"slice of the pie\" that any particular market participant can attack may actually be getting smaller. So, the slide above is really  from an investor's standpoint without the context of a detailed competitive analysis. It is notable - not in a good way - that Splunk did not offer any substantial discussion on competition during the Analyst Day, nor did any of the analysts challenge the company in regard to competitive pressures.Splunk calculates its current TAM by summing the estimated market size of the five main solution areas that the company is targeting. Splunk also mentioned the size of these markets in the prior fiscal year (FY '17) to emphasize not just the sheer size of their TAM but the strong growth rate as well. The data presented from the Analyst Day is as follows:\n  \nWithin its two largest markets, IT Operations (ITOM) and Security, the company noted during the Analyst Day that it has only achieved 2% and 6% penetration, respectively. (Assuming they mean that in terms of sales volume, then Splunk generated roughly $460 MM for IT Operations use cases and roughly $660 MM for Security.)All of this, according to Splunk, means the company has a massive opportunity in front of it.But I'm confused by Splunk's strategy which is to \"play\" in all five markets of the table. I come back to my comment about intensifying competition. Let's look at Splunk's two largest markets of IT Operations (ITOM) and Security where - in their words - they have only just started to penetrate and capture market share. Splunk is hardly alone in either of these markets. While they are deservedly a leader in both areas, consider some of the other \"heavyweight\" players in both markets:\n  \nAs an investor, would you not expect that all of the companies above are going to continue to aggressively compete in these markets as they grow? Why would any of these companies willingly cede any ground/market share to Splunk? And these companies are just the heavyweights. There are any number of startups/niche players that want a bigger piece of the pie. For example, for the Security space (specifically, the SIEM space where Splunk is a leader), here's Gartner's magic quadrant:There are quite a few niche players who presumably want to move \"up and to the right.\" If Splunk has only penetrated the ITOM market at 2%, the Security market at 6%, has significant market size in both markets but also has significant competition in both markets, wouldn't it make sense to double down and focus on these markets? Moreover, both the ITOM and Security markets are changing from a technology perspective. As a (possibly oversimplified) example, security has moved from once-upon-a-time simple event capture/monitoring to complex activity analytics where software is tasked with interpreting the \"meaning\" of various system/network activity and data to detect threats. The latter is not easy to do and is why Splunk has made certain investments in the Security space over the last few years, including the recently announced acquisition of Phantom (an InQTel backed company).I don't understand why Splunk would try to attack five markets, when:One analyst (Michael) offered one question along this line of thinking during the Q&A section of the Analyst Data, asking \"why now\" in terms of emphasizing a focus on business analytics and IoT markets. Doug Merritt broadly responded that the company \"really hadn't put anyone on business analytics and IoT\" and that Splunk needs to \"put (its) money where (its) mouth is, and find repetitive patterns in those expansion areas.\"In terms of business analytics, Splunk has had this market on its radar since its first year as a public company. The following is from the company's FY '13 Annual Report:So, here we are several years later, and the company is suggesting that business analytics hasn't been a focus, nor have they established a repeatable sales pattern for this market. If that's true, what makes Splunk think they can even be competitive in the business analytics market now? Business analytics is hardly a nascent market, and has become terribly saturated. Some of the major players include:\n  \nThe list above doesn't even consider players like Salesforce.com (  ), which introduced its Wave Analytics offering not too long ago, and Amazon Web Services (  ), which contracted with Zoomdata (another InQTel backed company) to develop its QuickSight offering. Perhaps this saturation is reflected in Splunk's own data, as the TAM table shows flat growth in the business analytics market.So, why is Splunk targeting a market where:It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.In regard to the IoT market, it is so nebulous right now that it is hard to know what it is, and what it isn't. Last year, I had written a  about General Electric (  ) where I pointed out the huge variations in IoT market size estimates. I should note that GE, in fact, has a partnership with Splunk for its own IoT initiative. There's little doubt that, as the sheer number of connected machines and devices grows, then the data volume they throw off will grow. But, to reiterate, it is somewhat difficult to quantify the opportunity here. For example, edge computing is another buzzy buzzword these days, where machine/device data is not \"sent\" to a central store like Splunk for analysis but is rather analyzed/interpreted \"near\" the machine/device, or on the machine/device itself. So, just because the volume of data is growing does not necessarily mean that all that data is going to be transmitted, stored, and analyzed in aggregate. The broader point in my article on GE - which I think is also relevant here - was that the company (GE in that case) was throwing around (what I perceived as) ridiculous numbers in regard to their IoT market opportunity.The application development market offers similar characteristics to the business analytics market in that it has achieved a certain level of maturity and features several heavyweight players.With a combined $34 billion market opportunity in its core markets (using Splunk's own numbers), I'm at a loss why the company would even consider stretching its resources. Think about this from the standpoint of research and development (R&D):Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY '13 - FY '18, Chart Source: Yves SukhuThe trend in Splunk's R&D spend relative to revenue is clear. Investors should ask themselves: How can the company effectively spread these limited R&D resources across five distinct markets, each of which demand specific R&D investment and are highly competitive?As per Doug Merritt, the company intends to put resources on expansion markets. Since the company clearly believes in a direct-sales-oriented approach for attacking markets, will Splunk hire more salespeople to focus on business analytics, application development, and IoT? Where will the money come from for that? How will the company maintain its operating margin guidance if it expands sales?I'm forced to ask: does Splunk have or foresee problems with its core markets (ITOM, Security), e.g. saturation, intensifying competition, etc.? If so, that would be worrisome to say the least from an investor standpoint.Splunk touted its cloud business numerous times during the Analyst Day presentation and during the associated Q&A section. The company is relying on the cloud business to compensate for declining perpetual license revenue, and to also help it capture more customers.Let's focus on the revenue aspect of this business first. Splunk estimates its cloud business will be generating $250 MM by FY '20:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationI have some doubts about this. First of all, the company appears to be extrapolating a trend based on two major data points (i.e. FY '17 and FY '18 performance). So, their experience/history with significant revenues from their cloud business is limited, which - one would think - makes it difficult to forecast. Further, think about one of the defining characteristics of cloud-based solutions: .Did Amazon Web Services (AWS) become the 800,000 pound gorilla that it is by charging MORE for the various services it provides? No, of course not. It captured share by dramatically under-cutting traditional IT solution providers. I remember signing up for AWS in the early days, when I'd receive - every couple weeks or so - an email detailing a continued price reduction of some particular AWS resource.I seriously doubt Splunk will be able to maintain its pricing in the cloud. Investors should expect significant competition, because, after all, it is the \"easiest\" environment for competitors to enter due to such a low barrier to entry. Today, Splunk enjoys a strong relationship with AWS, but, let me pose another question to readers:Think about Splunk in terms of core capabilities: It is essentially a system for data collection, data storage/retrieval, data correlation, and data visualization. AWS has capabilities in all these areas, and more. They have greater development resources than Splunk. So, again, why shouldn't they kill Splunk altogether?Doug Merritt didn't exactly make this point on the Q4 earnings call, but he noted \"AWS' job is to continue to offer more and more services, both infrastructure and platform services, to the community.\" He goes on to correctly note \"and our job is to keep adding more value on top of those services so that people would still want to do business with Splunk in addition to, or with, AWS. And that's just - that's a game that we all know how to play in tech.\" Mr. Merritt is 100% right in his comments. But, if I were an investor in Splunk, I would be deeply concerned that the company, which is telling me cloud is core to its future growth strategy, could be killed off by its biggest cloud partner. Splunk's \"competitive moat\" around its cloud business does not look deep or wide.Naturally, if Splunk is forced to drop pricing in the cloud due to competitive pressures, then the company will have to sell more deals to make up the same amount of revenue.Splunk also is counting on the cloud business to help the company achieve its customer target of 20,000 by FY '20. As we see below, the rate of growth in Splunk's customer count has decreased and flatlined somewhat:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY '13 - FY '18, Chart Source: Yves SukhuOne analyst (Ramo - I'm not sure about the name spelling) commented about this during the Analyst Day Q&A stating that he was \"struggling\" with the fact that Splunk has been adding (more or less) 2,000 extra customers per year. He specifically asked: \"What's the thing that's keeping that number where it is? Is it lead generation? What's the driver to bring that higher?\" Splunk provided numerous answers to the question, but the answer relevant to this section came from Sendur Sellakumar who commented that Splunk looks at its partnership with AWS as a mechanism to capture new customers. Additionally, and discussed earlier during the Analyst Day, Mr. Sellakumar, remarked that one of the strategies to drive business growth with AWS is to have \"(Splunk) reps talk with their reps.\" This strategy is logical, but not necessarily sustainable.It's entirely likely that the realized trend in new customer acquisition via AWS decreases over time for the reasons discussed above. I concede that such a dynamic may not happen in FY '19 or FY '20, but I think it is still probable. With respect to the approach of driving a strong relationship between the respective AWS and Splunk sales forces, this makes sense But, don't you think that every other AWS partner wants to do the same thing? As long as AWS remains \"king of the cloud,\" everybody will \"want a piece\" of their sales team to drive promotion and sales of their products/solutions. Splunk will be competing with many vendors for the \"mindshare\" of AWS reps.Splunk has painted a rosy picture of its cloud business. But I believe it is likely not to perform or grow with the strength or robustness that has been communicated. It may not be sustainable over the long term.Given all the risks I have pointed out in this article, I was curious to explore insider trading activity for Splunk. In effect, I wondered if there were any patterns that might imply insiders are concerned about risk. I looked at activity from April 2012 (the month Splunk stock first traded) through today, using data from  .I found that:In regard to the first bullet, we all know insiders usually acquire shares via grants/options. So, the fact that no insiders made any open exchange purchases might strike investors as a \"nothing to see here nothing-burger.\" Still, if these insiders believe so strongly in the company's opportunity and prospects, one might expect to see at least some open market share purchases. In regard to the second bullet, it is obviously common for insiders to enter into predefined disposition plans. But that's not to say that an insider has to enter into a disposition plan. Again, assuming there's strong belief in the company's long-term opportunity, why enter into an aggressive disposition plan in the first place?Splunk's stock price over the last 12 months has reflected an almost cult-like enthusiasm from investors and analysts:Source: InveyoFrankly, it would not surprise me to see the stock continue to test new highs throughout the remainder of the calendar year. But I believe such price movements would be entirely disconnected from the underlying business and associated risks.I believe Splunk's market opportunity and ongoing operating structure may not be as viable as offered by the company and analysts alike. Further, many analysts, particularly those on the FY '18 earnings call and participating during the Splunk's Analyst Day, seem to lack a willingness to truly challenge the company on points discussed in this article. Consequently, major risks are not - in my view - being properly discussed and analyzed by the investment community.Lastly, I'm troubled by the company's presentation of non-GAAP operating margin results during its Analyst Day which I felt was misleading. It suggests to me that ongoing operating performance may be at risk.With current market conditions for the tech sector overwhelmingly bullish, a bearish voice is likely to be drowned out rather quickly. So, I expect much of what I have laid out here to be entirely ignored. Nonetheless, for the small minority of Splunk investors looking beyond price momentum, I urge you to be cautious.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 8th expiration.

But this looks more like noise. Keep in mind that - for the past 12 months - SPLK stock is still up a sizzling 57%.Now, the company does face some challenges. Perhaps the biggest one is the intense competitive environment. Let's face it, there are many fierce rivals in the cybersecurity and real-time operational intelligence markets. Just some include  (NASDAQ:  ),  ,  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ).Another issue is that SPLK has yet to hit GAAP profitability. This is notable since the company has been around since 2003!Oh, and yes, SPLK stock is not necessarily cheap either. Consider that the price-to-sales ratio is about 11.However, despite all this, I still think a bullish case can be made for SPLK stock and that the latest drop in the shares presents an attractive entry point.So let's take a deeper look at the company:SPLK certainly has a powerful set of technologies, which allow companies to collect, search and monitor their data. Such features have been critical for not only cybersecurity but also business analytics, compliance, applications management and IoT (the Internet-of-Things). As a result, customers can improve service levels, mitigate risks, lower costs and improve decision-making.The Splunk platform also does not require intensive setups to scour data. There are sophisticated systems to automate the process.Granted, Splunk has been late to the cloud. But, interestingly enough, this has turned out to be an advantage. The reason is that Splunk's technology can deal with hybrid environments, which is a must-have for many large organizations.As seen with the latest quarter, SPLK continues to grow at a robust pace, with total revenues jumping by  . The cloud has been a nice driver. For the past year, the revenues nearly doubled to $94 million. In fact, SPLK believes that they will hit $160 million for fiscal 2019 and that billings will be about $270 million.The company has been able to generate strong operating cash flows too. For Q4, they came to $146 million. In all, there is $1.2 billion in the bank.No doubt, SPLK has also seen quite a bit of uptake with customers, as there remains continued innovation in the product line. During the past year, there were 2,300 six-figure deals, 270 seven-figure deals and 10 eight-figure deals. Before this, there were only six eight-figure deals since the company's inception.And the growth is likely to continue for the long haul. According to the latest SPLK investor  , the addressable market is about $62 billion.Cybersecurity is a strategic priority for most companies. After all, a data breach can wreak havoc on a company, leading to higher costs and a tarnishing of the brand.So, yes, major tech operators have been moving aggressively into the cybersecurity market, which has led to a surge in M&A activity. According to  , there were $41 billion in deals during the past couple years.OK, then, might this mean SPLK stock could be buyout bait? Well, I think it's reasonable. The company has a customer base of over 15,000, a strong set of core technologies and is targeting various large market opportunities. The market cap on SPLK is also affordable, at $13.8 billion.As Argus' analyst Joseph Bonner recently  , it is \"exactly the kind of company\" that would get the interest of a large tech operator.

It's a momentum growth stock, plain and simple. And right now, Shopify stock has got plenty of momentum to go around. The question is, will it help propel the SHOP stock price to even more new highs, or will it fade into support?Both scenarios are possible, but the higher Shopify stock goes, the worse the risk/reward becomes. As a trader looking to play Shopify, risk/reward is all it comes down to. Because of that, let's look at the charts.SHOP stock had pretty strong support from May 2017 until the start of the year. But rather than seeing that support fade in 2018, it turned out to be gasoline on the fire. In other words, Shopify stock began rocketing higher at a faster and faster rate.The way Shopify stock has been setting up, new highs over $150 shouldn't be a surprise. It's clearly got the wind at its back right now. The highest price target on Wall Street currently sits at $160. That's about $10 per share or 6.6% above current levels.However, I'd rather wait for a  and buy for even more upside. Here's the rationale:Click to EnlargeWe can see the previous channel (black lines), where prior resistance has now become support. However, a separate and steeper level of trend-line support has formed, too (blue line).If SHOP stock pulls back, both levels could act as great buoys of support. Despite it requiring a 7% to 10% pullback to get there, it would be  bullish to see a decline to these levels and for support to kick in.Rallies followed by pullbacks into support often lead to longer and more sustainable rallies. Especially when compared to stocks that rally significantly too far, too fast.Additionally, the stock's RSI, which measures how overbought or oversold a stock is, is closer to the former than the latter. While currently at just about 66, it admittedly needs to go higher to signal an overbought condition. That said, it's not necessarily low at the moment, either. Also, SHOP's MACD (orange line at the bottom of the chart) signals that momentum could be fading.Like I said, new highs wouldn't be surprising. Maybe Shopify stock will surge to $160 before ultimately pulling back. Remember both new highs and a pullback are possible. However, the probabilities just don't favor buying Shopify stock right now. The risk is too high, and the reward is too low, plain and simple.Fading momentum near overbought levels and notably far from support does not signal a buy sign. At least in my mind.I don't mind chasing a stock if I love the fundamentals. Despite how great the growth is at Shopify, I just can't  (NASDAQ:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  ).Analysts expect a whopping 48% sales growth this year and another 37% in 2019. That's amazing growth that shouldn't be overlooked. But valuing a company at $15.5 billion for just under $1 billion in sales is a high valuation. Particularly for a company that's not profitable on a GAAP basis. While gross profit surged 82% in 2017, Shopify sports gross margins of just 56%.Admittedly, these aren't terrible gross margins. But for the valuation, better margins would surely be welcome.For instance,  (NASDAQ:  ) sports gross margins of  , while most of its costs are tied up in marketing and sales expenses. In other words, it grosses an insane $80 out of every $100 in revenue. It then  its sales channel even more to bolster its future profit.All of this isn't to say Shopify is a bad company - only that for its valuation and steep stock rally, I do not feel compelled to chase it at these levels. Instead, I'd rather wait for a pullback into support. If it holds, I'm a buyer of SHOP stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and others,  (NASDAQ:  ) has been on fire.

Sales grew a whopping 32% year-over-year (YOY), while subscription revenue and its backlog also tallied YOY gains north of 30% for the quarter. This rate is working well for Workday, which also grew operating cash flow ~33% for the year. Impressively though, free-cash flow exploded 41% in fiscal 2018.There's clearly momentum in Workday's business and that's translating to momentum in WDAY stock. With that in mind, how high can Workday stock go?Since the company's earnings report, there have been several analyst re-ratings. A number of targets now rest between $120 and $140, with the average analyst price sitting at $128.27. Because of the stock's 7% rally since its earnings and 33% rally so far on the year, this target is actually about 5%  Workday's current stock price.However, there is a lone target up at $150, up about 10% from current levels. Can Workday stock rally to this point?Analyst Scott Berg from Needham was  by Workday's recent quarterly results. Specifically, his note cites the company's 34% increase in backlog orders, along with the 40% rise in billings. These results came despite the difficult YOY comps. Further, he says Workday could be at an \"inflection point of modern financials platform adoption.\"This should aid in further momentum to its business.As it stands, analysts expect revenue to grow about 25% in fiscal 2019 (this year) and 23% next year. So while this is a drop from fiscal 2018's results, Workday is expected to churn out another eight quarters (at least) of strong sales growth. While gross margins seem to be plateauing, operating and net margins are still climbing. So, as long as that remains the case for the next 24 months, Workday's bottom line should continue to swell.If its cash flow situation is any indication, that very well could be the case. That's likely one reason investors have been bidding the stock higher.On a GAAP basis, Workday is not yet profitable. On a non-GAAP basis, it is. Analysts are looking for 17.5% earnings growth this year and 36% the following year. For 2018, they expect earnings of $1.21 per share, meaning Workday stock trades at more than 100 times this year's earnings.Between a high valuation and  (NASDAQ:  )  readying a corporate training product of its own, investors may become worried about WDAY's future prospects. After all, Amazon Web Services is one of the biggest players in the cloud and that could negatively impact Workday moving forward.So, what do the charts say? While Workday stock may have the wind at its back, shares seem ripe for a pullback. From May 2017 through January, WDAY stock was trading within a rising channel. However, in February, shares broke out of this range and went on a steep rally.At the end of February, Workday stock pulled back and found support along the upper edge of this channel. That was a bullish move, as confirmed by the stock's 12% rally since.Click to EnlargeThe stock's MACD indicator, which measures momentum, looks to be losing steam (green circle). The RSI measures how overbought or oversold the stock is (blue circle). While the reading no longer supports an overbought reading, it could still unwind some more while WDAY stock pulls back or consolidates.Finally, a retest of the upper channel line should be in the cards. This level could quickly turn to trend-line support, which would be very bullish for Workday stock. Particularly if the rising 50-day moving average comes into play as well.So how do we play this? Look for a pullback in WDAY stock into the $126 to $130 area.For now, the trend is definitely higher despite its rich valuation and possible AMZN threat. Should the top of this channel hold as support, shares should continue higher and it will put Berg's $150 target in play as well.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["uying and holding high-quality growth stocks is one of the best ways to predictably generate wealth over the long term. But finding the market's best growth stocks is easier said than done.To that end, investors need to be able to recognize opportunities before the rest of the world catches on. So we asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a growth stock that they believe forward-looking investors can appreciate today. Read on to learn why they chose  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NASDAQ: PTLA) , and  (NYSE: SMG) .Image source: Getty Images. I've watched Splunk for years as it emerged the top operational intelligence platform on the market, helping its nearly 14,000 customers make sense out of their growing mounds of unstructured machine data. So I was elated when I got the chance to travel to Splunk's  to talk about their recent integration of artificial intelligence and machine-learning tools across their portfolio of products.One thing that shined through in that meeting was Splunk's insistence that they still enjoy a \"high ceiling\" for growth despite their recent success.To be sure, even though Splunk already counts 85 members of the Fortune 100 among its clients, and  last year alone, its growth is only just beginning. The company estimates its total addressable market currently stands at $55 billion, which would mean expanding to between 300,000 and 400,000 customers in the coming years.For investors willing to bet that Splunk will steadily grow its share of that market, and even with shares up 76% over the past year as of this writing, I think Splunk is a winner that will keep on winning. 2018 was supposed to be a breakout year for Portola Pharmaceuticals. Bevyxxa, which is the company's anticoagulant that was just launched in January, looks poised  . Meanwhile, a potential blockbuster drug called AndexXa is set to hear a go/no-go decision from the FDA in early May. The thumbs up on AndexXa would most certainly cause shares to soar.Unfortunately, the year isn't exactly coming together the way that investors had hoped. Portola's shares were  after investors learned that AndexXa's approval timeline might have to be expended. On its most recent conference call with investors management stated that European and American regulators have requested additional data to support their approval decision. The move is expected to delay an announcement in Europe until the back half of this year. It is possible that the company's PDUFA date of May 4 may be delayed, too.While a potential AndexXa delay is certainly not good news, I still believe that the odds of an eventual approval are favorable. What's more, you could argue that the company's current market capitalization of $2 billion is justified based on Bevyxxa's sales potential alone. If I'm right then Portola's stock represents a great buy right now for investors who can take the long-view. As you can probably imagine, the home gardening industry in North America is highly seasonal. Unless you own a greenhouse, your green thumb is probably covered by warm gloves during the colder winter months. While that has resulted in revenue and earnings being incredibly lumpy during certain quarterly periods, it hasn't really affected the performance of Scotts Miracle-Gro stock over the years. In fact, shares are up 139% in the last five years including dividend payments, well above the 95% total returns of the S&P 500.Nonetheless, years ago management moved to smooth out some of the seasonality in its business by acquiring a hydroponics and indoor gardening company called Hawthorne. A continuous stream of acquisitions in the space have bolstered the Hawthorne segment since, and the emerging opportunity in legalized marijuana has certainly helped, too. The result: Scotts Miracle-Gro generated 10.8% of total revenue from its hydroponics unit in fiscal 2017, compared to just 4.8% in fiscal 2016.In other words, in addition to providing non-seasonal revenue, Hawthorne provides a high-growth opportunity with plenty of potential for the foreseeable future. That provides a great one-two punch for Scotts Miracle-Gro. After all, the core business is still providing leading brands to the consumer gardening market. That includes Scotts, TomCat, Roundup, and many others -- most of which have an impressive track record of  . Throw in strategic investments in and partnerships with craft brands, such as Bonnie Plants, and it's clear the core business is no slouch.After divesting all business units outside of North America (which contributed declining revenue and had lower margins), Scotts Miracle-Gro can now focus all of its bandwidth and resources on its most important opportunities. So long as the company can continue growing earnings and cash flow, then it should be able to continue providing above-average growth for investors.There's no way to absolutely guarantee that these three stocks will beat the market over the long run. But whether we're talking about Splunk's massive addressable market, Portola Pharmaceuticals' seemingly temporary setbacks, or Scotts Miracle-Gro's renewed business focus, each company enjoys a unique advantage that could mean enormous gains for investors ready to seize the opportunity.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Splunk wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n recent trading, shares of Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $108.65, changing hands for $110.01/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 26 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Splunk Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $73.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $123.00. The standard deviation is $10.803.But the whole reason to look at the  SPLK price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SPLK crossing above that average target price of $108.65/share, investors in SPLK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $108.65 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Splunk Inc:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell. This article used  .  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["On March 1st,  (NASDAQ:  ) beat on fourth-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. Since the report, SPLK stock is up more than 15%. For the year, it's already up a whopping 30%. With that in mind, and with positive Splunk news seemingly everywhere, is it time to take profits or buy more?If you ask the analysts, there may be more upside left.Over the last few weeks, there has been a number of price target increases. The highest now sits at $123 from Needham's Jack Andrews. Andrews' target implies about 14% upside. However, a number of other targets poured in too, with many sitting between $115 and $120-per-share.Based on the Splunk stock analysis from these analysts, many see the company's momentum continuing. The robust billings growth from the latest quarter should continue throughout 2018. Andrews points out that the company saw a 21% increase in orders over $100,000, while the average selling price for the company's typical license sale rose to $95,000 from $69,000 in the same period a year ago.Argus analyst Joseph Bonner makes the case that SPLK stock trades \"at a 13% discount to the enterprise value to revenue multiple average of its peers.\"While some analysts may tout Splunk stock as being cheap compared to its peers, it's not cheap by traditional standards. When a company continually dumps a bulk of its gross profit into growing the business, it's hard to get a feel for how much it's worth. In that sense, it's like  (NASDAQ:  ) in its younger days.So what's the deal with Splunk? For the year, Splunk generated $1.27 billion in sales, a 33.7% increase from 2016. The sales growth wasn't the impressive part though, it's the company's gross profit of $1.01 billion. This equals out to gross margins of ~80%. A further breakdown of Splunk shows just what happens as that money filters through its income statement down to the bottom line. Because somehow, the company ends each year with a net loss. How can this be?Almost 80% of its gross profit is expensed to marketing and sales costs. In other words, For every $100 Splunk makes, it retains $80 of it. It then spends $64 (80%) of that $80 on marketing and sales initiatives to drive more revenue into its channel. Now left with just $16 out of every $100 in total sales, there's not much left to go around for other costs. In that sense, it's easy to see why it doesn't have a positive bottom line.That's not always bad though, because we know the company can generate a profit if it simply lowered some of this spending. But why do that when management can continue to grab market share and gain customers with recurring billing?There's no reason to lower its current growth rate and thus hinder its future profit potential simply to show a more robust bottom line right now. That's why investors continue to bid up SPLK stock. Of course, some investors will see a $15 billion market cap company with only $1.27 billion in sales and say, \"no way!\"But there are a lot of positives here. Guidance for next quarter and the full year came in ahead of expectations. Additionally, both operating cash flow and free cash flow continue to soar. At $200 million a year ago, free cash flow now sits at $263 million for the last year of business. Operating cash flow has grown even more impressively, now at $242 million and up from just over $150 million 12 months ago.In short, momentum with the business is strong \u2026 and so is the stock price.Splunk stock recently took out its all-time trading high (blue line), as well as its all-time weekly closing high (black line). Because we're using a five-year weekly chart, the 50-day moving average is not shown. However, that mark currently sits at $94.I would love for a pullback down to this level. The 50-day will likely act as support, while the $90 to $95 level should be strong support as well.

And it's only going to get worse.\"Since then, CYBR stock is up 17%, but that's not what I'm excited about.No, what gets me juiced about Cyberark's future is what Bank of America analyst Daniel Bartus recently said about the company's Privileged Account Management (PAM) product, which helps keep out undesirables from a company's most important information and data.By 2020, Bartus suggests  of large enterprises will be using some kind of PAM product, up from 45% today. He expects Cyberark to be a big part of that growth - and so do I.Also based in Israel,  (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the big players in firewalls, a critical component to any business's cybersecurity protection.It's not a big grower by any means, but if you're looking for stability in your cybersecurity stocks, Check Point provides that in spades.In fiscal 2017, Check Point's revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by  and 13%, respectively to $1.9 billion and $5.33 a share. Its operating cash flow in the past year was $1.1 billion, an 18% increase over a year earlier. It has no debt and $3.8 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet.As anyone who follows the tech industry knows, the business is moving to a subscription-based model as opposed to a product-driven one; in fiscal 2017, CHKP grew its subscription revenue by 23% to $480 million or 44% of its overall revenue. Five years ago, it was just  of revenue.So, despite only growing overall revenue by 7% year-over-year, it's routinely able to deliver double-digit earnings growth as it grows subscription revenues. It's a winning model.I have quite the history with  (NASDAQ:  ) stock.First, I  in January 2017, that FEYE stock would never make it back to $20 - at the time it was trading around $13, falling from over $80 just three years earlier - but softened my stance thanks to an email from an employee who got me to look at the bigger picture.A few months later in June 2017, I presented a more optimistic picture of the cybersecurity stock.\"It certainly is headed in the right direction. The question is whether it's growing fast enough to merit a $20 valuation,\" I  . \"I'm not convinced FEYE is there yet, but unless the company has a real stinker of a quarter in fiscal 2017 or the tech correction turns into a meltdown, I see a better-than-50/50 chance of hitting $20 within the next 12 months.\"A couple of months after that I suggested that hitting $20 wasn't going to happen in 2017, which it didn't, hitting a high of $18 in October. I really felt like the company needed to demonstrate that it could continue to grow its subscription revenues, overall gross margins and show that it was cutting its operating expenses.In fiscal 2017, it grew subscription revenues by  , gross profit margins by 230 basis points to 64.2% and lowered its operating expenses by 16% or $146 million.Not surprisingly, it went from negative operating cash flow to positive in 2017.Next stop, $30?One look at the solutions  (NASDAQ:  ) provides and it's easy to see why its stock's gained 518%, since it went public at  in April 2012. Back then it had 4,800 customers using its data analytics and security platform; today, that's well over  , including 85% of the Fortune 100.At the end of 2017,  (NASDAQ:  ) announced it was acquiring Shazam, a music app that allows users to enjoy a deeper content experience, for  . That's peanuts for Apple, but for Shazam, the tie-up allows it to use more of Splunk's products to be the best music app it can be.By multiplying that usefulness over 14,000 customers, Splunk was able to grow its revenues and free cash flow by  and 55% respectively in 2017. While it's still losing money on a GAAP basis, a couple more years of growth like it had this past year and you can bet that's going to change in a hurry.I just love companies that are generating positive cash flow without resorting to debt. Of all the cybersecurity companies on this list, Splunk might have the best potential because of its business analytics capabilities.If you're not a techie but want to invest in cyber-security stocks,  (NASDAQ:  ) could be right up your alley.In January 2017, LogMeIn made a transformational acquisition buying GoTo from  (NASDAQ:  ) for  in LogMeIn stock, a move that allows LogMeIn to penetrate further the cloud-based connectivity market which provides services for customers to work and collaborate remotely with other users.It operates a subscription-based business model, GoTo's conferencing products added $617 million in revenue to LogMeIn's top line over the final 11 months of 2017; representing two-thirds of the company's overall revenue. In February, it made a slightly smaller add-on acquisition buying Jive Communications for  .\"We believe the combination of Jive's award-winning voice, video, contact center and mobile applications with our leading collaboration products will give LogMeIn one of the best and most comprehensive UCC offerings in the market,\" said LogMeIn CEO Bill Wagner. \"The result is a deal that will accelerate our overall growth, set a new standard in the UCC market, and provide us with a foundation upon which we'll build the next generation of LogMeIn's UCC portfolio.\"Jive operates in the United Communications-as-a-Service market (UCaaS), which is said to be seven times larger than the web conferencing software market where it currently operates.A work in progress, LOGM could be the surprise winner among cyber-security stocks in 3-5 years. If you want the security of a really large company behind your cyber-security investment,  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) might be your best bet.Google  Chronicle in January, a business dedicated to selling cyber-security software to Fortune 500 companies. It believes that its experience with artificial intelligence and machine learning will make it a better detector of cyber threats than traditional cyber-security software.With the global cybersecurity market worth an estimated $100 billion, Google sees its machine learning software digging through a company's data faster and more effectively than current leaders such as  (NASDAQ:  ).Interestingly, Chronicle is led by former Symantec COO Stephen Gillett.\"We think we'll be able to help organizations see their full security picture in much higher fidelity than they currently can,\" Gillett  in Chronicle's Jan. 24 blog post. \"We hope that by making this mix of technologies available to more companies at affordable prices, we can give 'the good guys' an advantage and help us all turn the tide against cybercrime.\"This would be my recommendation if you're worried about the risk of owning a money-losing cyber-security stock.What would be a collection of cybersecurity stocks without an ETF option? \"The world's first cybersecurity ETF,\" the  (NYSEARCA:  ) from ETF Managers Group LLC, is a reasonably inexpensive option - it charges an MER of 0.60% - to capture the potential growth of the cyber-security market without having to guess who the ultimate winners will be.HACK  the performance of the Prime Cyber Defense Index.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new April 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $92.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $92.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $87.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $93.83/share today.Because the $92.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SPLK stock at the current price level of $93.83/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $95.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.79% if the stock gets called away at the April 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPLK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SPLK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $95.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Yet, take a look at the bullishness:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the table above is from 1 to 5, where 1 would be a consensus Strong Buy and 5 would be a consensus Strong Sell. In the middle, 3 would be a Hold. So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment. The average rating of 1.42 for SPLK leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the SPLK price target paints a different picture. Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at Splunk Inc. Of course, the average price target is just that - a mathematical average, and is only one metric. There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $115.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $71.00. The standard deviation is $10.757.But the whole reason to look at the  in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes - much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the  guess tends to be very close. And so with SPLK trading so far above that average target price of $87.96/share, the -3.58% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good \"signal\" to investors in SPLK to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Splunk Inc.

Sure, an expensive market means that a good number of stocks are priced for perfection, but that doesn't mean every company out there is near its peak. There are always those with room to run in just about every market.So we asked three of our contributing investors to each highlight a stock with a long runway of growth ahead. Here's why they picked  (NYSE: W) ,  (NASDAQ: SPLK) , and  (NYSEMKT: CQP) .Image source: Getty Images. Over the recent peak holiday shopping week, someone purchased a 3,875-pound storage shed from home furnishings specialist Wayfair. The e-commerce giant's list of notable holiday orders also included a single delivery of two tons of flooring, along with the thousands of bulky items (hot tubs, pool tables, rugs, and sofas) it shipped across its national sales footprint.You don't have to rely just on anecdotal evidence like that to believe the online home furnishings niche has a lot of growth ahead of it. Wayfair's sales are up 37% over the last nine months, and its $4.2 billion of revenue in the past year is more than four times its 2013 result.And it could just be the beginning of a long-term expansion. The share of sales taken by online players in the home-goods sector is still relatively small, in part because it's so expensive and time-consuming to deliver bulky and fragile products as compared to things like apparel and consumer electronics.Wayfair believes it can help solve that problem with its own shipping network that promises to slash delivery times, reduce damage, and increase customer satisfaction. The cash it dedicated to this initiative is already producing results as its active customer base just passed 10 million, up 39% year over year.The company predicts the online home-goods segment will expand at a 15% compound annual rate between now and 2025, and its early leadership position should help it achieve more than its fair share of that growth. With its shares  , and guidance calling for revenue to increase 25% to $1.55 billion this fiscal year, I think Splunk easily qualifies as a \"high-growth\" stock. It also already has an enviable stable of over 13,000 customers -- including 85 members of the Fortune 100 -- who rely on its operational intelligence platform to derive actionable conclusions from their hoards of unstructured machine data.But Splunk is only just getting started. At its investor and analyst meeting early last year, management increased its estimate for the company's total addressable market by more than 20%, to $55 billion. And over the long term, it sees the customer base growing to a range of 300,000 to 400,000.After all, as cloud computing and the number of connected devices continue to proliferate, the data generated in the process should grow exponentially, leaving more customers turning to Splunk's products to help make sense of it all.That's not to say it's guaranteed to be a smooth ride. Any hiccups in its growth in the coming quarters will almost certainly mean a sharp pullback. But Splunk is also known for its habit of underpromising and overdelivering. If it can sustain its momentum in grabbing as much of its TAM as possible over the next several years, its share price should follow suit for long-term investors willing to patiently watch its story unfold. data by  . We're a little less than a decade into the market phenomenon that is shale gas in the United States. With that much time in the spotlight, one would assume that companies and investors have already realized the benefits. Sure, we're producing more, exporting gas via pipelines, and prices are much cheaper. However, what hasn't quite come to fruition are the other opportunities such as liquefied natural gas (LNG).Cheniere Energy Partners and its parent company,  (NYSEMKT: LNG) , have been at the forefront of this phenomenon with the nation's first LNG export terminal. As of the most recent earnings release, the first phase of the company's Sabine Pass LNG terminal is nearly complete as it commissions the fourth liquefaction processing train as we speak. Even with only the first three process trains operational, management was confident enough in its cash-generating ability to increase its distribution to shareholders.This would suggest that Cheniere Energy Partners' business has matured to a point that growth could get harder to come by. That isn't really the case, though. Management  and has submitted paperwork for a sixth train at the facility. These two alone could increase Cheniere Energy Partners' production capacity by 50%. There is also the possibility that the parent company could drop down its Corpus Christi facility to the partnership once it has completed construction and is generating cash.With ample supply of gas hitting the U.S. market, Cheniere Energy Partners is in a great position for the future. It has a cheap source of gas and customers with a large appetite for more LNG in the future. With today's stock giving investors a distribution yield of 5.8%, there is a good chance for investors to reap large profits from this master limited partnership.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The three stocks we look at below are all possible hedge fund picks. Indeed, these stocks already boast a very bullish outlook from the Smart Money based on last quarter\u2019s trades.To scan for top stocks we used the powerful . The screener has a database of over 5,000 stocks as well as multiple filter options. Here we scanned for stocks with the double whammy of a positive hedge fund signal and a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 best analyst consensus. These are the analysts that consistently score the highest success rate and average return.Using our big data analytics, we can also track exactly why analysts are so bullish on the stock- and how far the stock can potentially spike from the current share price. Bearing that in mind, let\u2019s now take a closer look at these 3 top stock picks:: Leading payment processor Vantiv now processes more debit and credit transactions than any other acquirer in the US. And it seems like hedge fund managers want a piece of this explosive action. The stock has a \u2018Very Positive\u2019 hedge fund signal with hedge funds increasing holdings by 5.6 million shares in the last quarter. Big name hedge funds initiating new positions in VNTV include legendary fund manager Daniel Loeb of This Point LLC with a $193 million stake. But the biggest holding still belongs to Diamond Hill\u2019s Ric Dillon with $309 million.Vantiv sealed a $10.4 billion takeover of UK payment processing company Worldpay back in August. \"With e-commerce revenue synergies boosting the top line outlook to 10+%, we believe VNTV will become the merchant acquirer to own over the course of 2018 and we want to be early,\" says Buckingham Research Group analyst . This four-star analyst ramped up his price target from $77 to a bullish $90 and upgraded his rating to Buy on December 8.Chris Brendler isn\u2019t the only convert to the VNTV story. Top Wedbush analyst  also upgraded Vantiv at the beginning of December. He says the Worldpay acquisition provides exposure to the UK and the Asia Pacific region, which are both high-growth, potentially more profitable regions. At the same time the deal also drastically cuts its national merchants exposure.TipRanks shows that this top stock has a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 analyst consensus rating. This breaks down into 11 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings over the last three months. On average, these analysts are projecting upside potential of close to 8% from the current share price.: Why have one payment stock when you can have two? It\u2019s also worth checking out worldwide online payments system PayPal. Hedge funds increased holdings in PYPL by 6.6 million shares in the last quarter -- giving the stock a very bullish outlook from the Smart Money. Currently the stock\u2019s no 1 fund manager is Carl Icahn with a whopping $630 million position. But notably Lone Pine Capital\u2019s  made his own sizeable play on the stock in the third quarter with a brand new $429 million investment.It isn\u2019t so surprising hedge funds want a piece of the PayPal pie given that year-to-date the stock is up by an impressive 85%. And according to the Street the stock still has plenty of upside potential left to run. PayPal has just announced an agreement with Synchrony Financial () to expand their strategic consumer credit relationship. Top Oppenheimer analyst  boosted his price target from $75 to $80 on the news.He says: \u201cSimply, the transaction de-risks PYPL's balance sheet, while substantially boosting its capital flexibility. Trading at ~28.5x our adjusted FY19E EPS, the shares remain attractive, in our view.\u201d He also likes PYPL's unique competitive position within the large online payments market, and its accelerating volume/revenue growth.Note that Glenn Greene seems to know what he is talking about when it comes to PayPal. On TipRanks he is ranked #3 out of over 4,700 analysts, with a very impressive 85% success rate and 20.6% average return across his stock ratings.In total analysts have published 23 buy ratings and 7 hold ratings on this \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 stock over the last three months. We can see the average price target of $79.57 stands at about 8.6% upside from the current share price.San Francisco-based Splunk produces software for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated big data. In the third quarter, both George Soros and Ray Dalio initiated brand new positions in SPLK. However, the stock\u2019s biggest fund owner remains five-star Frank Sands of Sands Capital Management with a huge $540 million position.Following strong fiscal Q2 results, five-star Canaccord Genuity analyst  sees the stock breaking out and soaring higher. He acknowledged that the stock was \u2018wildly expensive\u2019 during its early 2014 peak. But the situation now vs 2014 is very different.Davis says \u201cSince then, this firm has done nothing but execute \u2013 that means product enhancements, business model improvements, and forthright management commentary \u2013 and the multiple has compressed. It\u2019s to the point now where SPLK shares look comparatively cheap, both on a revenue and cash flow basis, which is why we think this stock is one of the best mid-cap growth opportunities in software.\u201d He has a $90 price target on the stock.Overall, Splunk has the backing of 23 out of 26 analysts in the last three months. This \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 stock has an average analyst price target of $85 (7% upside).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["uying and holding great stocks is the best way to predictably create wealth over the long term. But few companies have effectively done so as well as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) over the years. After all, shareholders who bought a piece of the video streaming leader shortly after its IPO in 2002 have seen the value of their investment multiplied  as of this writing.That raises the question: Are there any other stocks that feel like Netflix did in 2002?So we asked three top Motley Fool investors for their thoughts to that end. Read on to learn why they think  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NASDAQ: CTAS) , and  (NASDAQ: EDIT) fit the bill.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES With the company having over 13,000 customers at the end of last quarter, including 85 members of the Fortune 100, you might wonder if Splunk has already realized the bulk of its growth potential. But its leading operational intelligence platform is poised to continue processing mind-boggling amounts of machine data being produced by businesses around the world.To be sure, Splunk is still growing rapidly. Revenue last quarter jumped more than 34% year over year to $328.7 million,  . And the company not only raised its guidance for the current fiscal year (to between $1.239 billion and $1.241 billion), but also told investors to expect sales next year to climb another 25% to $1.55 billion.But we can't forget that earlier this year, Splunk also estimated that its total addressable market now sits at roughly $55 billion, helped by new-use cases and the expanded implementation of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms making its platform that much more effective. Over the longer term, that would mean its customer base could grow to as much as 400,000. As such, I think investors willing to buy now and watch Splunk's growth story continue to unfold stand to be handsomely rewarded in the process. In 2002, Netflix was \"just\" a DVD rental-by-mail service, but its stock didn't really take off until years later, when it got into the related-but-not-exactly-the-same business of online streaming. That reminds me a lot of another rental company, Cintas, which has already seen stock price gains of 270% over the last five years and looks poised for even more.Cintas began in 1929 as a company that collected used rags from factories and washed and returned them for a fee. In the 1950s, it moved into the related-but-not-exactly-the-same business of uniform rental, washing the uniforms and returning them for a fee. That's the business that took off, allowing the company to set up a nationwide network of distribution centers. It used those centers to add on other related-but-not-exactly-the-same business services, including floor mat rental, restroom restocking, and fire and safety equipment servicing.These other services only represent 18.6% of overall company revenue at present but are growing more quickly than uniform rental, with 10.7% year-over-year  in the most recent quarter. So far this year, the company has upped its guidance, gobbled up competitor G&K Services, and raised its dividend by 21.8%. And while digital streaming uniforms are unlikely to ever become a thing, Cintas -- like Netflix -- is a rental company that should reward its shareholders for years to come. : As dominant as Netflix is today in streaming TV, it's easy to overlook that the company wasn't into streaming at all back in 2002. Its business revolved around a subscription plan for DVDs, which were shipped via mail. But the potential was certainly there to grow into something much larger, which is exactly what Netflix did.I think Editas Medicine is in something of a similar position as Netflix was in 2002. The company is a pioneer of gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9. This technology could  , with its ability to repair gene mutations that cause life-threatening diseases.There are plenty of other companies and researchers using CRISPR/Cas9, so what makes Editas special? It holds the licenses to patents claimed by the Broad Institute for use of the gene-editing approach in humans. If any company develops a drug using CRISPR/Cas9, it will have to pay Editas.Right now, no drugs have been approved using this gene-editing technique. However, Editas is researching use of CRISPR/Cas9 in treating several genetic diseases, including rare eye diseases, cancer, and cystic fibrosis. The company has also attracted partnerships with big drugmaker  (NYSE: AGN) and up-and-coming biotech  (NASDAQ: JUNO) .Editas isn't profitable. The company faces plenty of risks, but it has an incredible opportunity ahead -- just like Netflix in 2002.We can't guarantee, of course, that Splunk, Cintas, or Editas Medicine will live up to the lofty bar set by Netflix. But with each of their massive market opportunities and long runways for growth, we like their chances of doing just that. So for investors who don't mind buying, holding, and enduring some volatility along the way, these three promising companies could deliver life-changing returns.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's quite expensive when compared to historic norms, which is making it hard for die-hard stock pickers like me to find compelling opportunities.However, even in today's pricey market, I think I've found a wonderful stock to buy:  (NASDAQ: APPF) . This software-as-a-service provider is growing fast, well managed, and still has plenty of room to run. Here's why it's a stock that I'd be happy to pull the trigger on right now.Image source: Getty Images.AppFolio is a  business that focuses on the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. The company got its start by catering to the unique needs of property managers. To this day more than 90% of total revenue is still earned from its property management business.Why would a property manager choose to do business with AppFolio? The answer lies in the company's all-in-one, cloud-based solution. Once a customer gets setup they can manage all facets of their business with AppFolio's platform. This includes scores of mission-critical tasks like contracting, billing, collections, reporting, background check, tenant screening, and more. These features make it easy for property managers to keep their assets performing at the highest level possible.Image source: AppFolio.How does AppFolio  ? In three primary ways:While the company's property management software accounts for the lion's share of revenue, AppFolio also has a growing business that caters to the needs of small law firms. Called MyCase, this solution helps lawyers with tasks like secured file sharing, time tracking, billing, and more.Are AppFolio's services catching on? Here's a look at the company's customer count over the last few years:\n  \n*As of September 30, 2017. Data source: AppFolio.The growing customer count has allowed AppFolio's revenue to soar from $47 million in 2014 to an estimated $140 million to $141 million in 2017. That's a lightning-fast pace.And yet, as great as these numbers have been, there's still reason to believe that AppFolio's growth engine is just getting started. Management estimates that its market opportunity within the property management business exceeds  in the U.S. alone. You can tack on another $2 billion when adding in the opportunity ahead of MyCase.Many high-growth software companies are happy to sacrifice near-term profits for explosive user growth. While this growth-at-any-cost strategy can work out well for investors in some cases -- just take a look at a long-term chart of  , or  for proof -- running at a loss on purpose also greatly increases a company's risk profile.Thankfully, this isn't a trade AppFolio's management team has to contemplate anymore. AppFolio has been profitable for four quarters in a row, which suggests that the company has reached enough scale that it can invest for growth and still generate profits at the same time. That's an attractive combination that I believe helps to reduce the company's risk profile substantially.What's more, AppFolio also boasts a rock-solid balance sheet that has $64 million in cash and no debt. That's a war chest that gives this company plenty of financial firepowers to keep the growth pedal to the metal.Moving forward, AppFolio's profits should expand at a faster rate than revenue thanks to favorable  . Investors should applaud that fact.Another factor that makes AppFlolio a compelling long-term investment is its vibrant and engaged workforce. The company earns a strong 4.6 out of 5 stars on  , and CEO Jason Randall boasts a 100% approval rating. Given these numbers, perhaps it isn't surprising to see that AppFolio has won numerous awards, including best places to work and highest-rated CEO.I also like that AppFolio's founders -- Dr. Klaus Schauser and Jonathan Walker -- are still heavily involved with the business. They currently occupy the roles of chief strategist and chief technology officer, respectively.Image source: Getty Images.I'm a big believer that cultivating an energized workforce can do wonders for talent and customer retention rates in the long term. That bodes well for this company's continued success.Between its rock-solid business model, strong leadership team, wonderful financial statements, and huge growth opportunity ahead, AppFolio is a company I greatly admire. In fact, the biggest knock I have against AppFolio is that Wall Street has caught on to this company's growth story. Shares are currently trading at more than 10 times sales and more than 77 times next year's earnings estimates, both of which are pricy figures. If the company fails to deliver eye-popping growth numbers, then its shareholders could be in for a world of hurt.Despite the high price tag, I'd still think AppFolio is an attractive enough business to warrant a purchase today. In case you think those are empty words, you should know that I plan on  as soon as the Fool's trading rules allow.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and AppFolio wasn't one of them!

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  ,  and  .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: is riding the demand for RVs and towables to new records. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) just posted its best quarterly revenue and profitability in the Company's history.Thor is the world's largest RV manufacturer in the world. Headquartered in Indiana, it makes RVs and towables under the popular brand names of Airstream and Jayco, among others.On Nov 27, Thor reported its fiscal first quarter results and crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 63 cents, or 35%. Earnings were $2.43 versus the consensus of just $1.80.It was the third straight beat in a row.Revenue was an all time quarterly record of $2.23 billion as gross profit margins rose to 14.9% from 13.9% a year ago.Towable RV sales jumped 33.7% to $1.62 billion from $1.2 billion a year ago driven by strong demand for more affordably-priced travel trailers.Towable backlog jumped 75.2% to $2.46 billion from $1.4 billion a year ago due to strong momentum in the industry for its travel trailers in advance of the calendar 2018 selling season.On the motorized RV side, first quarter sales gained 22.8% to $566.6 million from $461.5 million a year ago. It saw growth in the moderately-priced Class A and Class C motorhomes, particularly in Class C, which are smaller motorhomes. Both are in demand from its dealers and consumers.The motorized RV backlog jumped 59.1% to $1.12 billion from $706.4 billion in the year ago period due to continued robust demand for its smaller gas Class A and Class C motorhomes.This has been a record time for the RV makers as it has seen growth due to the Baby Boomers retiring, with their stock portfolios at record highs, along with demand for the towables from Generation X and Millennials who are buying to travel into the national and state parks.The strong stock and housing markets have likely helped towable sales as well.Industry demand remains \"exceedingly strong.\" Thor has been adding production to keep up with demand. : is in the one sector that still isn't seeing economic improvement: agribusiness. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is still struggling as the fertilizer market remains weak.The Andersons was founded in 1947 by Harold Anderson in Maumee, Ohio with a single grain elevator. It has grown into an agribusiness company with numerous business segments across North America, including in grain, ethanol, plant nutrient and rail.On Nov 28, The Andersons announced that its President of the Rail Group, Rasesh Shah, would retire in July 2018.He's to be replaced by Joseph McNeely, who would be familiar to railroad car investors as he was CEO of FreightCar America, which makes a diverse group of different railcars.This announcement comes shortly after announcing that Jeffrey Blair would join the company as President of the Plant Nutrient Group effective Dec 4 due to the retirement of Bill Wolf in that position.That is two high-profile management changes in two of its four business segments during the same month.On Nov 6, The Andersons reported third quarter results and missed on the Zacks Consensus by 7 cents. Earnings were $0.09 versus the Zacks Consensus of $0.16.It was the second consecutive earnings miss for the company.The quarter was mixed, with some segments seeing more improvement than others.It sold two of its former retail properties so that it could exit the retail business completely.But its Grain Group business saw better year-over-year results with good margins on corn and soybean sales and strong space margins for wheat.However, the Plant Nutrient Group saw a pretax loss of $7.9 million as there is simply too much fertilizer on the market and the farmers, who are still struggling under falling income, aren't buying.The Rail Group was also mixed in the quarter, as it saw improvement but the overall market still remains soft.It's not a surprise that it's seeing management changes in its two weakest areas.The analysts continue to be pessimistic about 2017 and 2018, although the earnings \"low\" looks to have been in 2016.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has fallen to $1.08 from $1.41 in the last 60 days.One estimate was also cut for 2018 which has sent the Zacks Consensus Estimate falling to $1.83 from $2.33 in the last month.Technology stocks are rebounding after a sector-wide selloff Wednesday, suggesting that tech's strong rally still has some life left in it. The tech sector has dominated Wall Street for the majority of 2017, and as we look at the year's highest-flying stocks, most of the recognizable names are dominant and innovative technology brands.Considering the current state of the world, tech's leadership makes sense. Cloud computing and the Internet of Things have already revolutionized our everyday life, and now we are on the cusp of artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicle revolutions that could redefine what it means to be human.In response to these changing times, investors have poured money into the tech sector in search of the next explosive stock. In November alone, we witnessed plenty of noteworthy tech companies start to pick up momentum, including several that are sporting strong Zacks Ranks and other key metrics.Check out three tech stocks that soared this month to buy now:Avid Technology develops, sells, and supports a wide range of software and systems for creating and manipulating digital media content. Shares of Avid gained more than 55% in the month of November, and the stock is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Even with this rapid price expansion, Avid still has a P/E ratio of 13.77 and a P/S of 0.64, meaning that its earnings and revenue should be able to support further share price growth. The company is also generating cash flow growth of nearly 140% right now, so it is clear that management is improving its financial position.Marvell Technology is a leading designer of mixed-signal and digital-signal processing circuits, and its \"EZ-Connect\" IoT platform is used by a variety of global customers in a number of industries. Marvell shares have popped over 25% within the past month. The stock should continue to be a strong growth pick, with full-year earnings projected to surge 81% and an additional 11% in 2018. What's more, management has met or surpassed earnings estimates in six consecutive quarters, so the stock could be one that soars again on the back of another surprise report. MRVL is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Splunk provides a software platform, which collects and indexes data and enables users to access and analyze that data in real time. Shares of Splunk have soared nearly 20% in the month of November, primarily because of the company's strong earnings report. Earnings of 17 cents per share beat our consensus estimate of 14 cents, and revenues of $329 million crushed expectations of $310 million. Because of these solid results, Splunk has seen an influx of positive estimate revisions, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Every day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform (Bull) or underperform (Bear) the markets over the next 3-6 months.Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 27 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Splunk Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $70.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $105.00. The standard deviation is $8.626.But the whole reason to look at the  SPLK price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SPLK crossing above that average target price of $82.48/share, investors in SPLK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $82.48 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

If that wasn't enough, Splunk once again increased its outlook for the full year, and offered an encouraging view of what's to come in fiscal 2019.With shares up more than 13% in after-hours trading as of this writing, let's dig deeper to see what Splunk accomplished over the past few months.IMAGE SOURCE: SPLUNK.Data source: Splunk. *For the quarter ended October 31,2017.As Splunk CEO Doug Merritt stated:For its fiscal fourth quarter, Splunk expects revenue to be between $388 million and $390 million -- comfortably ahead of the $383.6 million Wall Street was modeling -- with adjusted operating margin expanding to 16%.Thus, for the full fiscal year, Splunk now expects revenue to be between $1.239 billion and $1.241 billion (up from previous guidance for between $1.210 billion and $1.215 billion), billings of roughly $1.485 billion (up from $1.450 billion previously), and adjusted operating margin of 8.5% (up from 8% before).Finally, Splunk introduced guidance for fiscal 2019 revenue of roughly $1.55 billion (for year-over-year growth of 25%), with adjusted operating margin increasing to 10.5%. Here again, that top-line outlook was comfortably above analysts' view for fiscal 2019 revenue of $1.52 billion.In the end, this was another straightforward beat-and-raise scenario from Splunk, capped with an equally optimistic prediction for its continued growth in the coming year. So even with shares up more than 35% so far in 2017, it's hard to blame the market for so aggressively bidding up the stock again in response.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I am happy to report a strong Q3, delivering revenue of $329 million, up 34% over last year. Our growth continues to come from a combination of new customers and our existing customers expanding their deployments on prem and in the cloud. We saw strength across all of our regions as strong demand for Splunk Solutions continues to grow. With the U.S. federal year-end in September, I'm happy to call out the public sector team and report that they had a great finish to their year with multiple large orders. I also want to congratulate the leadership covering the EMEA theaters for delivering another fantastic quarter.As I've said many times, our market opportunity is massive, and we're still early on the Splunk adoption journey, even within our largest accounts. Q3 also allows me to thank the 7,000 customers, partners, and Splunk fans who joined us at .conf, our eighth annual user conference. Hundreds of innovative use cases were presented. Two of my favorites were Dubai Airports, where Michael Ibbitson joined me onstage to share how they are using Splunk as their data and analytics platform at one of the world's busiest international airports. The team uses Splunk to analyze sensor data in every corner of the airport to drive efficiencies and improve the passenger experience. For example, they're monitoring security stations to ensure passengers get through in less than five minutes; analyzing data from the baggage system to deliver bags on team; Splunking the Wi-Fi network to remove rogue hotspots and guarantee high-speed access; and even keeping bathrooms clean with alerts on bathroom centers. Next up, Dubai Airports is working to save $25 million per year by monitoring its energy consumption. What an amazing showcase for the creativity of our consumers and the power of the Splunk platform.Another great use case came from the Global Emancipation Network, one of our Splunk Pledge recipients, who's using Splunk to identify and work toward eliminating human trafficking activity around the world. In partnership with our Splunk4Good team, the Global Emancipation Network analyzes seemingly disparate datasets from across the Internet, public and private organizations, and other sources to identify trafficking activity, and then teams up with law enforcement to take action. This organization is a fantastic example of applying the power of big data analytics and machine learning to solve one of the world's most complex problems.At .conf, we also showcased our latest product releases, including new versions of Splunk Enterprise 7.0, Splunk Cloud, IT Service Intelligence 3.0, Enterprise Security Content Updates, and User Behavior Analytics 4.0. We are widening our lead in the market with the 7.0 release of the Splunk platform. With our new native support for metrics, which are numerical data points captured over time, Splunk Enterprise is doing to metrics what we did to event data. Our customers can now seamlessly unify, correlate, and visualize logs and metrics in the same platform, enhancing their ability to analyze, monitor, and investigate their environments. With 7.0, our customers can leverage their metrics data with better TCO and at massive increase in speed -- at least 20 times faster. This capability is particularly relevant to the monitoring portions of IT ops and apps delivery, and also for IOT use cases, where telemetry generated by the increasing number of connected devices is metrics based. Finally, this capability creates a launching point for new products and solutions, such as Project Waitomo, which we previewed at .conf. This solution will combine metrics and logs to make infrastructure monitoring easy, specifically built to help systems administrators and site reliability engineers who may have never tried Splunk and need to get it up and running in minutes.Following .conf, we announced two acquisitions this quarter. SignalSense, which offered cloud-based, advanced data collection and breach text and solutions powered by machine learning, and selected assets of Rocana, which provided analytics solutions for the IT market. These additions will further advance our data platform and our machine learning capabilities across Splunk's portfolio. Technologies like these and the teams behind them fit into our broader strategy of leveraging the ecosystem around us as an extension of our internal R&D efforts.We also introduced new advancements of our premium solutions Splunk IT Service Intelligence 3.0, which is revolutionizing event monitoring by combining service context with machine learning. ITSI's new event analytics capabilities broaden the use cases that we can address within IT operations. Our Enterprise Security Content Update is a new subscription service that regularly delivers dynamic, prepackaged security content for Splunk ES customers. User Behavior Analytics, or UBA, 4.0, enables customers to create and use their own machine learning models to identify custom anomalies and threats via a new software developers kit.And we debuted Splunk Essentials for Fraud Detection, a free app that guides customers in how to use Splunk to identify and investigate different types of fraud. This is another example of our ability to leverage the flexibility of our platform to quickly introduce a new solution that helps our customers deal with a critical pain point. I'm proud of our product teams, who delivered an awesome set of releases.We also showcased new solutions developed with our partner ecosystem. Let me begin with AWS, where we continue to deliver on our commitment to provide a comprehensive range of AWS integrations that meet our customer's needs. As just one example, we delivered a new release of the Splunk app Creative US with major enhancements around ingestion speed and usability. We also announced the general availability of Booz Allen Hamilton's Cyber4Sight for Splunk, a solution empowering security analysts and threat hunters with actionable threat intelligence. We released new integrations between Splunk and Puppet, including the Splunk app for Puppet Enterprise, and Splunk ITSI module for Puppet Enterprise to help customers address issues in real time through machine learning. And we showcased multiple Accenture offers powered by Splunk, including Accenture's cyber defense platform and Accenture's POS Zoom, which is a Splunk-based analytics solution for retail customers. Using POS Zoom, retailers can leverage analytics to unlock growth and future customer value.In addition to the rich customer and partner content, we unveiled our next set of activities related to our Splunk4Good initiative, including three training programs to help military veterans and youth train for careers in technology. I'm thrilled that more than 2,200 people have already signed up for this training.Stepping back, with the move to digital, e-commerce, mobile, and social, organizations are now increasingly using machine data to provide critical context to transactions they typically stored in their databases and data warehouses. Splunk's platform is the best solution to enable customers to harness this largely unstructured data and use it to make real-time decisions. Our goal remains the same: to become the standard for machine data in every account -- the ubiquitous machine data platform solving our customer's big data challenges, and IT operations, and application delivery; and security, compliance, and fraud; as well as in business analytics and the Internet of Things. These markets are going through a shift to an analytics and machine learning-based approach, where Splunk is uniquely positioned to lead this change and deliver for our customers.During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in both our Splunk platform and in our premium apps. Starting with IT ops and app delivery, wins in this quarter include SunTrust Bank, who expanded its use of Splunk Enterprise and ITSI to gain real-time visibility into potentially fraudulent digital activity; monitor mission-critical KPIs, like customer response times; and ensure compliance. Thanks for our partner Trace3 for our help with this win.Longtime customer Vodafone Egypt expanded its use of Splunk Enterprise to gain 360-degree visibility across all customer touch points, from their websites, mobile app, and customer call centers. Deakin University, a leading university in Australia with our 53,000 students, expanded with Splunk Enterprise to manage its IT operations and networking environment. Other notable customer wins include Defense Health Agency, BCD Travel, Hong Kong's Li & Fung Limited, and Johns Hopkins University.Moving to security, where the market opportunity is being driven by an ongoing SIEM replacement cycle, as well as a multitude of security events in the past several months. Security departments are increasingly realizing the need to shift to an analytics-based security strategy, an approach that Splunk has been defining and driving for years. We are leading and helping our customers with this migration from structured legacy SIEM to an analytics-based approach.Notable wins in the quarter include the Smithsonian Institution, who upgraded its use of Splunk to improve threat detection and mitigation across its world-famous museums and research centers; a large federal agency who expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise and ES to meet their strict compliance requirements. Thanks to our partners at Spear and Cumulus for their work on this opportunity. Daimler, the German automotive group, signed a multi-terabyte deal to replace its legacy SIEM with Enterprise ES. The group will use Splunk as its nerve center for security, providing insights across the entire organization.The University of Leeds, one of the largest higher education institutions in the UK, expanded its use of Enterprise and ES as their SIEM. The university is already using Splunk and IT ops to monitor their networks. Thanks for our partners at Softcat for their contribution to this expansion.Splunk is the strategic technology at the Department of Homeland Security, which made a major expansion to replace its legacy SIEM with ES and DHS datacenter. Other notable customer wins include the CallidusCloud, Domo, U.S. Army, Arizona State University, the UK's Derbyshire Fire & Rescue Service, and Banner Health.And we continue to see our champions expanding their use of Splunk to monitor critical business services to understand the increasing amount of data coming from centers and connected devices. The Dubai Airports use case I mentioned earlier is a great example of that. Another example in Q3 was our customer Norsk Helsenett, a service provider for Norway's healthcare sector. They made a large expansion of enterprise to move beyond IT and security to monitor the usage of their healthcare services to drive care improvements to their customers. I was lucky enough to be in the Nordics to sign the contract with Norsk in person this quarter, and we look forward to seeing them again at our upcoming Splunk Live in Stockholm.And as we do each quarter, we highlight a handful of customers who standardize on Splunk as their data platform. A few of this quarter's customers include 21st Century Fox, a Splunk customer for nearly five years, who signed an EAA to standardize on Splunk, and will now use the platform on AWS across all IT and business operation centers to gain visibility across the company in IT, security, and in the business.Our longtime customer Atlassian expanded its EAA in Q3 as well. Atlassian uses Enterprise and ES for security globally. This expansion moves Splunk further into IT to help ensure that Atlassian products, such as JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket, and their recent acquisition, Stride, are always available to the customers and their staff.Nutanix is another great example of a new technology alliance partner who is also leveraging Splunk to improve IT and security within their own organization. Nutanix quadrupled its use of Enterprise for visibility across IT and security. As you'd guess, the team is running Splunk on Nutanix software and driving great scale on TCO. Thanks to our partners at Avant Garde, who were instrumental in the deal.And leading software development platform Github expanded their use of our solutions to ensure their platform stays online and is secure. In engineering, Github will increase use of Splunk throughout their development and operations life cycle. And in security, the instant response team will use Splunk to identify and respond to attacks.Our cloud business continues to grow, with Q3 being our largest quarter ever. Our customers are leveraging the Splunk platform to analyze their data, regardless of its location, on prem or in the cloud. A few of our cloud wins this quarter include PIMCO, the investment management firm, who's adding Splunk Cloud to provide visibility and insights into its business critical applications; and ATB Financial, a new Cloud customer who signed a multiyear agreement to use Splunk to improve customer experience by ensuring availability of its online banking systems. A few other cloud wins include Blackbaud and the Texas Department of Transportation.In addition to the joint partner solutions we unveiled at .conf and the customer wins with our partners that I mentioned above, I want to call out a few go to market wins in Q3, starting with AWS, for a large European pharmaceutical company purchased Splunk Enterprise and ES through the AWS marketplace to replace the legacy SIEM. AWS was also instrumental in closing a large rental car company as a new Splunk Cloud customer, again through the AWS marketplace.On the security side, we had several joint wins with our managed security partner, the Herjavec Group, including two new Splunk Cloud Security customers. We've seen an increase in demand for skilled managed security service providers that support hybrid offerings, and we're continuing to invest in our managed service security providers like the Herjavec Group.We were humbled with new recognitions and awards in Q3. One in particular to call out is Fortune Magazine naming Splunk to its inaugural Fortune Future 50 List, which highlights the most forward-looking, innovative companies in the world.In summary, it was a strong quarter, and as always, I'm very proud of our Splunk team. We have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. We are delivering high value to our customers, who are expanding their adoption of Splunk as their platform for machine data analytics and for machine learning, both on prem and in the cloud. Splunk is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, and we are pursuing it aggressively. Thanks again to all of our customers and partners, and thanks to everybody who works at Splunk.And now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Dave Conte. -- All right. Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In Q3, we exceeded our overall plan, and as Doug said, we did so on the strength and outperformance across all regions. Q3 revenues totaled $329 million, a 34% increase over Q3 of last year. Total billings were $382 million, up 38% over last year. Cloud revenues totaled $24.4 million, and overall software revenues, which include license and cloud revenue, grew 34% year-over-year.Customer success remains our top priority, and adoption of our platform and solutions are driving software bookings growth, where more than 80% came from existing customers. We also added more than 450 new customers in the quarter, and we recorded 581 orders over $100,000.00. At our analyst meeting in January, I outlined a number of metrics to follow on our path to revenues of $2 billion in fiscal '20, one of which was ASPs. Consistent with our cohort, as customers continue to realize value from our product, their adoption of Splunk from one to many use cases increases, ultimately leading to our goal around standardization on our platform, like the EAA examples Doug just walked you through.Consistent with adoption overall, in Q3, the ASP for the 581 orders greater than $100,000, which includes two of the largest cloud transactions we've ever recorded, was this highest in our history, reflected continued value delivery from our platform. We'll update you on the full year ASPs once the year is complete, but I expect we'll be on track to our fiscal '20 annual ASP target.In Q3, international operations represented 24% of total revenues, consistent with previous levels and comparable on a year-over-year basis. Education and professional services represented ten% of revenue in Q3, which is typical for the quarter in which we hold .conf.Now, turning to margins and other results, which are all non-GAAP. Q3 overall gross margin was 84%, consistent with our expectations and reflecting improving cloud gross margins. Operating income was $32.3 million, representing a positive margin of 9.8%, better than planned, due to our outperformance on the top line. Q3 net income was $25.1 million, and EPS was $0.17 per share, based on a fully diluted weighted average share count of 144.4 million shares.Now, turning to cash generation and liquidity. Cash flow from operations was $52.3 million. Free cash flow was $46.9 million, and we ended the quarter with about $1.1 billion in total cash and investments, which reflects approximately $42 million paid during the quarter for the two acquisitions.Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we expect Q4 total revenues of between $388 million and $390 million, with a 16% non-GAAP operating margin. This translates to full-year revenues of between $1.239 billion and $1.241 billion, up from our prior high-end guidance of $1.215 billion. And we're increasing our full-year cloud revenue estimate to $90 million, up from our prior guidance of $85 million. We're also raising our full-year billings estimate to $1.485 billion, up from $1.450 billion, and we're raising our cloud billings estimate to $170 million, up from the $150 million we previously guided. With our increased full-year outlook and reflecting our performance through the first nine months of the year, we now expect operating margin to be closer to 8.5%, up from our original 8% estimate. Now for EPS, remember, because we expect to remain profitable on a non-GAAP basis for Q4 and the full year, full-year EPS calculations, you should use a fully diluted share count of approximately 146 million shares in Q4, at a 144 million shares for the full year.Looking beyond this fiscal year, we're excited about the success our customers are realizing from our offerings, and we expect that success to be reflected in our financial performance. With that, I wanted to provide top-line estimates for the next two years. We expect next year revenues to total approximately $1.55 billion, and we reiterate our fiscal 2020 total revenue target of $2 billion. As we continue to scale our product and field capabilities to capitalize on our market opportunity, we will accelerate these and other investments while maintaining our spending discipline and delivering about a 200 basis point margin expansion in fiscal 2019. This should result in non-GAAP operating margin of around 10.5% next year, on pace to achieve our fiscal '20 target of 12% to 14%.Now turning to the new revenue recognition accounting standard, 606, which we'll adopt next year, our fiscal '19, the seasonality revenues will be different than what we've experienced historically. Specifically, total revenues have typically been split between 42% to 58% first half to second. Under 606, we expect this will steepen some and be closer to 40%-60%, with almost all of the impact in our seasonally smallest Q1. As we conclude the current year and finalize our 606 adoption, we'll update you with more specifics to help ensure our models reflect the momentum we see in the business. More to come on this topic, obviously, in the near-term.In closing, our team continues to execute on our mission to deliver high value to our customers, and we're committed to driving the best possible customer experience through continued investments in our products, solutions, the cloud, our global reach, and, of course, our people. Overall execution and results in Q3 were excellent, and I'm looking forward to a strong finish to the year. Thanks so much for your time and interest.With that, let's open it up for questions.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you have a question, please press the * then the number 1 key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from the line of Brian White from Drexel. Your line is now open. --  -- Okay, great. Great quarter, guys. When we think about the quarter and the outlook, it's probably one of the strongest outlooks we've seen in a long, long time from Splunk, and now you're going out to even fiscal '19 in giving guidance. Maybe just give us an update on the competitive landscape. It seems like you're really starting to show more momentum than we've seen in recent memory. -- Thanks. Yeah, it was a really nice quarter. The competitive landscape remains really similar to what we've seen. Our win rates against the track competitors are generally in the 80% to upwards to 95% rate. And it just feels like there's a growing understanding of the value of Splunk, especially when you get to high intensity, production-oriented use cases, and you deal with more and more of the issues of a really broad and complex set of data. And I think our solutions-oriented strategy continues to help us as well with solutions like Enterprise Security, ITSI, UBA, and others, helping our customers understand what we do, how to use Splunk, and how to get quick time to value. --  -- And just a follow-up, on 606, Dave, is this a revenue headwind in fiscal '19? You gave numbers, but is that a headwind, a tailwind? And just remind us how we should think about the impact on deferred revenue. I remember we talked about $300 million or something in that range. -- Yup, yeah. Hey, thanks, Brian. The headwind, tailwind, is ultimately going to be dependent on the ending balance sheet. And, as you mentioned, when you adopt 606, there's an impact where you remove a certain amount of deferred revenue. The absolute number -- again, at Analyst Day, I used 300 as an example. We've got to get to the end of the year to actually quantify what that impact will be. So, headwind, tailwind, you get the detriment of a removal of deferred revenue; you get the benefit of upfront revenue on our ever-increasing subscription business. But we really have to get to the end of the year to quantify that. --  -- Okay, great. Congratulations. -- Thanks, Brian. -- Thanks, Brian.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. --  -- Thanks very much and congrats, guys. It's phenomenal, phenomenal results. -- Thanks, Brad. -- Thanks, Brad. --  -- Sure. So first for Doug. Doug, in the quarter you put out a press release elevating Susan St. Ledger's role. I guess this quarter's result is early evidence of that. What, if anything, changes operationally in elevating her? And then related, on go-to-market, what's the latest update on leadership in EMEA? -- Good questions, Brad. So with Susan being promoted to President, she's now President of Worldwide Field Operations, and we added in a few areas like marketing to her responsibility. The core driver of that is, as we're looking to the next phase of our growth, beyond $2 billion, it's really important for us to gain leverage and scale across every single customer touch point that we have. She had a broad scope. I think we've broadened that a little bit more. Where I think it becomes even more important is when you add in the significance of our transition to a subscription focus, then elements like self-service, touchless transactions, from initial awareness on broad-based, above the funnel market orientation all the way through to support and renewals become just a critical portion of the machinery that needs to execute flawlessly on that horizontal basis across these different functions. I think moving -- ensuring that all those customer touch points are under one leader, and that she's got the job title and responsibility within the company clearly distinguished to make whatever moves were necessary is a good thing, and she's doing a fantastic job, as we all saw this quarter.On Europe, as you saw, we had a really nice quarter in Europe again. I think a lot of that is the luxury of the strong bench that I'd highlighted in Q1. I thought that we had some strong sub-theater leaders, but many of them are early in their tenure, and we spent a lot of time building out that management structure across EMEA and also across APAC, so we can get that scale in the international region that we're seeing and enjoying in the public sector in America's theaters. And she's had a really nice in-bound set of demands and interests for that position. She's down to the finalists, and I'm -- hopefully, you'll see an announcement coming out relatively soon. --  -- Awesome. And if I could just ask one follow-up for Dave. Dave, cash flow came in a little bit lighter than we had expected. If I look at DSOs, they look like they're a bit higher than trend. Other than linearity, is there anything we should be thinking about here and anything you might be doing to improve collections or better manage linearity of the business over time? Thanks. -- Yeah. No, we're pretty satisfied with the performance for the quarter, and candidly, for the year. We obviously had almost 600 greater than $100,000 orders. Those can impact linearity, as you would imagine. We think about cash flow on an annual basis. We don't guide it quarterly. And I guess I'm on a live call, Ken. I can go ahead and say we feel that we're on track for $250 million of operating cash flow for the year. So, I just want to echo Doug's commentary. The performance in the field was obviously quite strong, and we're very proud of the transactions that we closed. And I don't think there's anything to read into DSOs or quarterly cash flow. --  -- Great to hear. Thanks again, guys. -- All right. Thanks, Brad. -- Thanks, Brad.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is now open. --  -- Hey, guys, strong quarter. One for Doug and one for Dave. So, Doug, can you drill down on security demand? You mentioned that there was some impact, it sounded, from both the upgrade cycle on SIEM as well as recent events. How much of an impact do you feel like you've had from both Ransomware and Equifax from this summer, and what changes have you seen in terms of the shift in spending to SIEM? -- Good question, Michael. Yeah, we've been, I think, uniquely touting -- I think we probably started this trend four or five years ago on moving from an independent product-driven messaging to the need for broad-based security analytics, for people to really get a feel and understanding of anything that could be happening across the constantly changing cyber landscape that these guys have got to -- have to defend and be familiar with. And I think that the fundamental power of Splunk as a machine data platform, the schema-on-read architecture we always talk about allows multi-use case opportunities within the security departments, obviously, and outside security as well, is really resonating a little bit more clearly with these guys, as the attacks were coming fast and furious from multiple different areas, from ransomware, to kind of classic breaches, to insider threat, and other behavior analytics you can be driving as well. And as we all know, security is a boardroom topic. It is a critical agenda item for the exec team in most companies. And I think we're definitely seeing that with our execution in the security space over the past couple quarters. --  -- Okay. And then, Dave, obviously it's fine on billings too. It didn't look offhand like a mix shift, but license was particularly strong. So, was there any mix shift or less mix shift toward subscription at all this quarter and consequent positive impacts on rev rec? -- Again, we think about mix annually, as you know. I mentioned in prepared remarks, we recorded our two largest cloud transactions in our history. I raised our outlook for cloud revenue and cloud billings for the year, so I think we're feeling confident with our execution around our move toward subscription overall. Obviously, that -- we laid it out as a three-year journey back in January, and I think we're tracking well. Obviously, with the seasonally strongest and largest Q4 just ahead of us, as you guys know, individual transactions can move what will ultimately be our full-year metric, but the execution in the field around satisfying customer demand for how they consume our products, whether it's on prem with the subscription license or in the cloud with our SaaS service, has been really strong. --  -- Okay, Dave, thanks a lot, and congrats again on the quarter. Great job. -- Thanks, Michael. -- Thanks, Michael.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. --  -- Great. Thanks, guys. for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. One question for the team and just one follow-up specifically for Dave. Obviously, you touched on the curated experience down at the analyst session at .conf, and obviously, you talked tonight about security, ITSI, UBA, but wondering if you could give us just some more color in terms of how you think those curated experiences, those curated apps, are impacting business now. Any of those newer ones starting to inflect? And then as you start to scroll forward, '19 and '20 year guidance, I mean, how do you think about those curated experiences driving growth? Will it be free experiences just driving the base platform or add-ons? And then just one quick follow-up for Dave. -- Thanks, Phil. We're seeing increasing uptake around a few of these, but they're still early on. And those curated experiences aren't solutions; and again, we have lots of terminology around the thickness of the solution at Splunk. But different clustering of data visualizations, dashboards, alerts, remediations, some light workflow that specifically answer the needs of a set of users within the account so that they're not starting from scratch with the underlying Splunk Enterprise platform. They obviously can still do that, but they get what they need much more cleanly out of the box.This Project Waitomo that I talked about, again, on the call and that we previewed at .conf is a good example of one of these, where we're combining the metrics to our capability with the classic streaming log orientation of Splunk to really help systems administrators and site reliability engineers get up and running literally in minutes. It's a really cool experience as far as immediate power of Splunk. And we actually, for Waitomo, strip out things like our -- the flexibility of the search and investigate piece. It is a purpose-built view on top of Splunk Enterprise.I think that will increasingly be the way that we see our land opportunities happen in the coming two years. And the whole point is, let's get that -- first, let's make it easier to get that first set of data in, increase the time to value or decrease the time to value, increase the time to power for our different customers, so that we accelerate that use case journey across multiple different departments to eventually drive that more EAA platform-ish type sale that we're seeing with some of our bigger accounts. That said, I think the answer is it will depend on the account and the segment with the larger strategic accounts by getting a little bit less velocity on some of these curated insight experiences, and the newer accounts and more mid-size accounts probably getting a lot more of those and demanding those more strongly. --  -- Got it. Thanks, Doug. And then, Dave, at one point last year you talked about Splunk Cloud being about a five-point headwind to its margins. I'm wondering if you can give us an update into just about how that business is scaling from a margin perspective. -- Yeah. Hey, Phil. We're feeling good about the trajectory for Splunk Cloud from a margin perspective. Recall last quarter, I reported that we hit a milestone in Splunk Cloud in Q2 of 30% positive gross margins, and that we expect it to be about that level for the remainder of the year. And that held true for the third quarter. So, good progress, good scale, and heading in the right direction. --  -- Got it. Thanks, guys. -- Thanks, Phil. -- Thanks, Phil.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. I have a question for Doug and maybe a follow-up for Dave. And Doug, my question is actually a follow-up to Mike's question, to Michael Turits' question. So these are really strong results, as a couple of people had said so far today, and we're seeing decent results from a lot of software names, but not so much in the security space. I mean, that's been a little bit mixed. Can you talk a little bit about the strong aggregate momentum we're seeing here in your numbers relative to what we're seeing in security? It sounds like security is doing pretty well, but are you seeing better results in the other areas, or is security keeping up, which would kind of you make you somewhat of an anomaly given some of the recent reports? -- Hey, John. So this quarter's security actually did really well for us. We talk about it being in the 40% to 50% range. It was over 50% for us in this quarter. And the IT sector is still healthy, growing, and vital to our future, and we see these trade-offs back and forth every quarter. A lot of these security wins I talked about, they started with IT operations and then moved over to security, so we see it moving both ways. But just going back to what do we -- there was a mixed bag in the security arena right now, and what we're -- where I see people leaning in for Splunk is we provide an abstraction layer with Splunk Enterprise and then solutions like ES that is agnostic to the typically hundreds of different security solutions that most decent-sized organizations have across their security landscape.And what I hear from a lot of CSOs is, yeah, I mean, it'd be nice to get the benefits of a next generation X, Y, or Z in the security landscape, but what I really need is, I need to be able to tie all of those together into a platform, into what I had called the nerve center of the brain, so I can take advantage of all the capability, and data, and strength of the multitude of different solutions I've already paid for and deployed. And I think that's why we're seeing some good traction. And I think the SIEM replacement cycle works to our advantage as well. -- Got it. Okay, that makes sense. Thanks, Doug. And, Dave, if I could -- actually, another follow-up for Brad's question. I think I understood where you're kind of saying. I know you don't guide to cash flow, but as he pointed out, AR was greater than -- was a greater use of cash than we anticipated anyway, and I assume he did, too. But I just want to make sure I understand. You've signed the -- Doug mentioned a lot of large deals, a lot of enterprise agreements. Those are typically signed -- not all of them. They're typically signed at the end of the quarter, and I just want to make sure -- I mean, I would expect to see those receivables be collected next quarter benefiting cash flow in that period. And the reason for the question is, I mean, every number looks really strong. It doesn't look bad. It's just a little low. It's the only one that's a little lower, more than where people were estimating. -- Yeah. Again -- hey, John -- I feel very good about our cash collections, the process, the age of our receivables. We had the benefit in the quarter from a DSO perspective that federal year-end is September, as we all know. And the government tends to pay on time. Not always. But I don't think there's any -- there's no news. There's no there as it relates to DSOs or cash flow. It was a really strong quarter. You can see that across all of our financial -- relevant financial metrics. And the benefit is in receivables, and you bet we're gonna collect it next quarter.So, for the year, we're on track for our $250 million of operating cash flow. And in any particular quarter, one large order comes in on one timeline versus another, can affect the quarterly DSO. But overall, the review that we do internally, the quality of the balance sheet is really high. And again, you see it on the P&L. -- Great. That's all clear. Nice job, guys. Thank you very much. -- Thanks, John. -- Thanks, John.Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open. --  -- Hey, thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. Doug, one for you. Can you talk a little bit toward the AWS relationship? You mentioned a couple of interesting wins this quarter, which is great. I'm just wondering, your relationship with them seems to be different than a lot of the other vendors. For example, they offer Elastic, and Elastic is kind of probably hurting because of that. They do the Hadoop, and their works are hurting. Well, you actually seem to have a very good kind of working relationship where they are actually pushing you. So, can you talk to kind of the motivations there and how you see that evolving? And then just one quick one for Dave. I assume your '19 guidance in terms of revenue and margins is all 606 based. Just to clarify that, so that there's no kind of confusion there. Thank you. -- Yeah. Hey, Raimo. Yes. Our outlook for fiscal '19 and fiscal '20 are based on 606. -- And then on the AWS front, yeah, I mean, we're really happy with our relationship. As I've said for a couple of years, they still continue to commission and quota credit their reps, and any of these partnerships are a true multi-year journey. The number of reps at AWS that actually understand Splunk now grows quarter after quarter. As our AWS-dedicated team spends more time educating those folks, we get more lunch and learns, and drink nights, and just have the reps at the field level get to know each other. And we're seeing an increasing cadence of deals come in through that AWS reference approach. And with our marketplace footprint, I think we'll see even more. And ideally, more of those being touchless as people go through the marketplace itself.I think what's a little bit different about us versus the core open source components is that at the heart of Splunk is a semantical layer above different aspects like file systems, storage, vehicles, transport mechanisms. And a lot of what I've been talking about with the data orientation long-term for the company is it doesn't really matter long-term whether we transport data through a Splunk Forwarder or through a cost interface. It doesn't matter whether we store data in the Splunk Index or store it in another format. And because of that, within the AWS landscape, I think we add unique value on top of the different services that they offer. And the message that we are continuously trying to harp on, and you might see a little bit more of that from our marketing department, is Splunk and. Now, Splunk and the Hadoop open source ecosystem, Splunk and data warehouses, Splunk and Palo Alto. And as long as we keep that ability to add value around the core components other people offer, then hopefully, customers will continue to feel like we're worth being a strategic vendor for them. --  -- Perfect, thank you. Congratulations. Again, great quarter. -- Thank you, Raimo. -- Thanks, Raimo.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nate Cunningham from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. --  -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us a rough sense of what the attach rates are looking like on new business for both ES and ITSI? -- No, I don't think that we disclose those. -- Yeah. Hey, Nate. It's Dave. We obviously monitor that pretty carefully, but we don't disclose that as a metric externally. We might do so on an annual basis, but not for the quarter. What we can say, though, is the attach rate is increasing. And you hear it in a lot of the examples that Doug talks about in terms of security, the move away from the legacy SIEM folks, just in terms of breadth of capability. So, both in security with ES and in IT with ITSI, we're pleased with the attach rate. We've got plenty of room to go. --  -- Okay, fair enough. And as we think about the fiscal '19 guidance, are you assuming any change in the velocity of new customer addition? -- Well, our goal is by 2020, that we reach the 20,000 customer milestone. So, as we think about new customer acquisition, obviously, to get to that number, we do expect to see an uptick in terms of the annual addition, which, of course, means the quarterly addition, yeah. --  -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thanks, Nate.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. --  -- Hi. Thank you very much. Dave, the first question is for you. Really strong billings results this quarter and acceleration, very strong acceleration to call it 38%. And yet, if I look at the guidance for the year, it would suggest that you're anticipating that year-over-year billings would perhaps be back below a 30% growth rate. Was there something, for instance, in the Q3 results, government or otherwise, that would suggest such a deceleration, or is there something missing, perhaps, in terms of why billings would break perhaps below 30% for Q4? -- Yeah. I mean, I think, first and foremost, as you would expect, Q4 is a tougher comp than any of our other quarters, typically. We obviously had an extremely strong quarter in the public sector space, as you would imagine. But also, a significantly strong performance with our cloud business. And that performance in the quarter certainly led to a billings contribution. Two of our largest -- our largest cloud transactions in our history were recorded in the quarter, and was a basis for me to actually raise our full-year revenue and billings guidance for cloud. So, we'll see how the composition comes in the fourth quarter. That's always been part of the fun here in terms of that mix estimate -- how much is cloud, how much is term, how much is perpetual. That obviously can have some impact on billings. --  -- Okay. Okay. All right, fair enough, then. I also wanted to revisit on the customer acquisitions. I think in this press release you indicated 450 new customers. I don't know what the net customer count -- I think it was just under 15,000. And so, you've been flat for the last -- call it three quarters, round numbers. What do you think causes you to get to that 20,000 number in '20, because I think you need a little bit of acceleration, which so far, this year really hasn't experienced? What do you think changes that? -- Let me step back. And to just make sure I start with my happiness around the adoption in growth rates within our current customers. It's a great feedback signal that they understand the power of our offerings and the strategic nature of Splunk as a data platform that can really power a whole host of use cases across a multitude of different departments. However, I agree with you. I definitely would like the number of new customers to be higher. We've targeted a higher number of new customers over the course of that three-year guidance period that we talked to you guys about. And we are making continued investments in the global reach of our field to increase capabilities and appeal to new customers.We've got to continue, also, to invest in the customer success. That's our number one corporate priority. But really, as Dave has said for as long as I've been listening to these calls, before I even became a Splunker, that coverage is his number one concern area. And it's a choice every year on where we rotate coverage to make sure we can continue to drive that cohort that we're so proud of, of increasing adoption with end customers, as well as dedicating enough overall resourcing, both direct and indirect, for that net new customer piece.We have been making a lot of investments this year. Like so many of these, I think it takes a few quarters to get people onboard, to get them trained, put the programs in place, experiment and figure out what's really working and what's not. But it is a top priority for us through FY '19 and into FY '20 to ensure that we get to that 3,000 or more customers per year that we told you guys about at Analyst Day. --  -- Okay. Well, many thanks to you guys. Sounds like it was a really good quarter, particularly in the security area. Best of luck. Cheers. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. --  -- Yeah, thanks, guys. Just one question for me. Doug, with several different purchasing and deployment options, do you find that deal cycles could start to accelerate going forward, as the pricing model, or where Splunk's deployed -- is it an inhibiting factor or friction for additional adoption? -- I mean, that is another one. When we think about what -- how do we continue to drive the velocity for that $2 billion target and the increased number of transactions and customers, that is part of what we're focused on. These insights, packages, what's so-called the curated -- or what we'd probably describe as the curated experiences at Analyst Day are one of many vehicles that we're looking at, which is how do you create a pricing mechanism for underlying Splunk Enterprise that adheres to the solution that's on top and create a quick bundle that can do even a simpler job of landing into new accounts. And I think moving to subscription, so that customers increasingly just have the choice of one, two, or three-year terms. And the only big decision is, do I want to run it in my own private cloud, or I do want to run it in their public cloud? I think that's another big lever for us to cut down on the cycles that many of our reps have to go through to walk our customers and prospects through all of the options that they have with Splunk. --  -- Great, thanks. Congrats again. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Matt.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Let's go to the next question, please.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anne Meisner from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. --  -- Thank you, and congrats on the great quarter. -- Thanks, Anne. --  -- So, you guys called out two very large cloud transactions, and you increased your guidance there, so it sounds like cloud is really performing nicely, ahead of your own internal expectations. Are there one or two specific items that you can point to that are really driving the business? So, for example, is it the prepackaged app functionality for cloud, such as the AWS functionality, that's really starting to drive that acceleration? -- I honestly think that it is the acceleration of cloud across the enterprise sector that's dragging us. And then I think that some of the work that we've been doing to have the specific AWS apps, we now have a number of them in AWS, is a great landing point for people going to AWS, as well as, I do think it's easier for us and our customers to understand what an ES and Splunk bundle looks like, ES and Splunk Enterprise, or an ITSI and Splunk. And I think the more that we can get to a focused solution delivery for our customers that, of course, drags in Splunk Enterprise behind it, but it is something specific to the needs of that buying center or user, the better velocity we have, and the quicker that our customers understand the power of Splunk and get an ROI on their investment. And it's a little bit easier in cloud just because we can kind of preassemble all the bits for our customers, and instead of having the classic arrival of hardware, PS, or a ProServ, or some other consulting assistance that goes with an on prem piece. --  -- Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. -- Thanks, Anne. -- Thanks, Anne.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. --  -- Yeah. I have one for Doug and a quick follow-up for Dave. Doug, to follow up on Anne's questions, the two large cloud transactions in the quarter, I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail about those. First, what was the use case? Was it security, or do you have any visibility into that? And were these existing on premise customers that moved to the cloud, or are they in a hybrid environment, or new customers, or something else? Just curious there. -- So, on the use case basis, I think one was security-focused, and one, I think, is multi-use case, and one was a net new cloud customer, and one was an existing customer. -- And I think from an existing perspective, there was some on prem. -- Yeah, I think the existing one is hybrid. -- Yeah, but it's a minimal amount. I mean, they were really looking for Splunk to help them with their data that they were hosting in the cloud. So, that's where we became more applicable. And to Anne's earlier question, why we had great momentum is, customers were looking to associate our solutions with proximity to where their data resides, which is why it's so important that we can provide both cloud and on prem in a hybrid environment for many of these customers. -- Now, I think that gets even -- that becomes even more important in an IoT world. It's like you've got -- I think we'll all see multiple layers of delivery of technology, with public cloud still being incredibly important and obviously growing like crazy, like we see it growing, but there are needs for many different deployment types based on the use case and the technology architecture. --  -- Gotcha. That's very helpful, guys. And to follow up on the earlier question about ratable mix, are you still on target for the full-year to be 50% ratable, Dave? Thank you. -- Yeah, hey, Jesse. Obviously, again, great success in the quarter. Increasing our outlook for cloud is all going to contribute toward ratable mix for the full year. With our largest seasonal quarter -- today is the 16th -- we've still got the balance of Q4 ahead of us. We've got to get those transactions closed to finally quantify what is the mix for the year. But we're -- again, I think the execution by the field and collectively, the company, around enabling customers to consume our products both subscription and perpetual was really strong in the quarter. So, looking forward to the balance of the quarter and updating you guys in February. --  -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Jesse.Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. --  -- Thank you. Appreciate your squeezing me in. And I know you've heard this a lot of times, but it can't hurt to hear it again. Congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions. The first one is, could you talk about what you've seen in terms of demand for term licenses so far this year, especially the past couple of quarters, and maybe what you're thinking about for next year? And then a follow-up. -- Yeah. As part of that journey, too, we want to get to a minimum of 65% subscription by the end of '19 and 75% by the end of '20. That's very dependent upon continued growth in cloud and obviously a high growth rate on true term. Yeah, so true subscription, I guess I'd say -- on prem subscription. We've been emphasizing that this year. We're seeing good traction with customers and our sales force being excited about and leaning forward with subscription on prem contracts, and we definitely expect that to continue to grow next year and the year after, especially as we continue to come out with additional packaged solutions that take advantage of some of the term architectures. --  -- Excellent. And then, given the partnerships in new products, can you give us some color on how you think about or what you're expecting from the partnerships in terms of driving new customer adoption, how we should think about all that? -- Yeah, I mean, we've been focusing on building out an effective ecosystem, including the solutions on Splunkbase, for a while now. I think most of those have been free, interesting accompaniments. And we hear from a lot of customers that one of the things they love about Splunk is when they need a solution for X, Y or Z, they can go to Splunkbase and find it. But that turn that we started to make with Booz Allen, with Accenture, with some of the apps that we're developing or co-developing with AWS is, I think, that next leg, that next generation. And what we're seeing with those three in particular -- the AWS, Booz Allen and Accenture -- is a higher preponderance of net new customers.

On the bottom line, that translated to adjusted net income of $25.1 million, or $0.17 per share, up from $0.12 per share in the same year-ago period and above investors' expectations for $0.14.IMAGE SOURCE: SPLUNK.Splunk's top-line growth was comprised of a 28.7% increase in license revenue to $179.8 million, and 41.7% growth in maintenance revenue to $148.8 million.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Splunk is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SPLK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 15 cents per share for SPLK, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SPLK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +7.60% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that SPLK has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see  .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Splunk, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

The company's market opportunity is growing on the back of its software, which is traditionally used for IT operational intelligence, security, fraud-detection, app analytics and other related cases.Splunk announced a number of new and updated versions of existing products in the third quarter, which include Splunk Enterprise 7.0, Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) 3.0 and Splunk User Behavior Analytics (UBA) 4.0. We believe this will help it to expand its customer base. The company's continuous updates to Splunk Cloud are also a positive.Moreover, Splunk also acquired some assets of San Francisco, CA-based Rocana last month. The acquisition is expected to enhance Splunk's machine learning capabilities and data management platform.We note that Splunk is well poised to benefit from the ongoing shift to modern analytics-based security information and event management (SIEM) from a traditional structured data legacy-based one, which drove large security orders for the company.Splunk Insights for Ransomware launched in the second quarter is a step toward that direction.

With Splunk exploring and expanding into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins.Also, growing competition from established players such as International Business Machines  , SAP, Amazon  and Microsoft  , all of which are vying to get a bigger share of the market, is a concern. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

Peer-to-peer lending platform Lending Club is finally starting to show signs of growth after several quarters of stagnant loan originations.

Revenue grew by an impressive 35% from last year, and profit margins improved tremendously. What's more, Lending Club's CEO said that the company could approach GAAP profitability as we head into 2018, which would be a major improvement from the first half of the year.In the third quarter, Lending Club is expecting more impressive growth, with revenue growth of at least 10% over the second quarter.Lending Club's loan portfolio is currently about $11.1 billion in size, which may sound like a lot, but consider that the U.S. nonrevolving (loan) consumer lending market has more than $2.7  in outstanding balances, not including mortgages, according to the Federal Reserve. To say that there's room for growth would be a huge understatement.While it's too early to say whether Lending Club's growth will continue, the potential is certainly there, and the recent data has been extremely positive. So, Lending Club could be worth a closer look for investors with a relatively high level of risk tolerance. Data analytics is evolving from even just a few short years ago when everyone seemed to be climbing aboard the so-called \"big data\" train. Yet being able to effectively transform the massive amounts of data that corporations produce into something usable that they can act is still a viable and growing industry.Splunk is one of the more dynamic players in the space that helps businesses capture, store, analyze, and curate the information they generate. While it was dealt a bit of a blow after software giant  decided against buying the company because it viewed Splunk as being overvalued, there is still tremendous opportunities for the big data player ahead.In its  , Splunk added over 500 new customers to its roster, giving it more than 14,000, and revenue recently surpassed $1 billion in trailing-12-month sales.

One of the biggest keys to eBay's success was its moat: the network effect. As more and more sellers went to the platform, more buyers visited the site. And as more buyers visited, more sellers flocked to the platform. It was a virtuous cycle.Shopify isn't in the auction business -- it focuses on helping small and medium-sized businesses develop an e-commerce presence and handle the logistics of bringing customer packages to their doorstep -- but it is protected by an equally powerful moat: high-switching costs.Any small business  spend most of its time focusing on what makes it special. If employees are spending too much time focusing on e-commerce interfaces or delivery logistics, they aren't focusing enough on meeting their bigger goals. Because of that, and the actual costs associated with switching to another e-commerce platform, most companies would be loath make a change once they've signed on with Shopify.That's why the company's growing user base is so important: Once customers sign on, they are largely locked in. When the company went public in 2015, it had 162,000 merchants signed on and revenue of $123 million. Fast-forward just over two years, the company now boasts over 500,000 merchants and trailing revenue of $509 million.

And while 2017 has been good thus far for company, it may not be too late for investors to jump on board.Data by Splunk specializes in  , allowing organizations to monitor and analyze data created by their machines in real time. Whether it's deployed for computers, payment processing terminals, websites, or other electronic equipment, Splunk's cloud-based platform helps organize massive amounts of information into a usable format.For example, if your business operates a high-volume call center, knowing things like who is calling and where they live might be helpful. If you have many customers from a specific geographic region calling all at once, that could be especially helpful information to stay ahead of a potential snafu. Splunk can help a company recognize operational trends like that to get a leg up.Though the stock has been a bumpy ride since an initial run-up in price post-IPO in 2012, revenues have been steadily growing and recently surpassed $1 billion in trailing-12-month sales. That has been supported by a fast-growing pool of customers that subscribe to Splunk's software. During the last quarter, over 500 new customers were added, bringing the total count to over 14,000.Data by The \"big data\" company has big ambitions, and wants 20,000 total customers by 2020. If it hits that goal, it thinks it can also hit $2 billion in annual revenues. That's ambitious, but Splunk is taking great strides to make it happen. With that kind of growth, the company is surely a buy, right?Image source: Getty Images.To investors who just look at the bottom line, what jumps out immediately about Splunk is that there are no profits. While that may present a problem for some, there's more to the story here before writing Splunk off.First off, the company offers up an adjusted bottom line that excludes the impact of non-operating items like  to employees and the  of intangible assets. By that non-GAAP measure, Splunk turned an $0.08 per share profit last quarter, up 60% from the $0.05 reported the same time in 2016. In the last four months, total adjusted earnings per share is at $0.44.With those adjustments, Splunk's adjusted price-to-earnings (  ) ratio is still at 155, and while paying for 150 years' worth of current profits is rich by anyone's valuation, the picture gets better if we use  . Put simply, that's the money left after basic operations are paid for.Data by Splunk has been steadily increasing its free cash flow for years. As a result, the company continues to get cheaper when measured by its price-to-free cash flow ratio, which currently sits at 54.That's still a steep price to pay, though. So why would an investor consider Splunk? It's all about the future. As previously mentioned, the company has a lofty target of doubling revenues to $2 billion in the next few years. In the first six months of 2017, $522 million has been reported.By year's end, though, management thinks annual revenue will slightly exceed $1.2 billion. That's a 26% increase over $950 million last year, and if that pace continues, the company will hit $2 billion by its goal of 2020. When using total billings, which adds in money that customers have committed to spend but haven't paid yet, Splunk says the figure will be $1.45 billion this year. That's a good indication that sales will continue to track higher.For Splunk stock, it's all about the runway for sales growth. Investors have to believe in where the company is going and how it's going to get there. Higher share prices can be justified now as long as management can keep delivering double-digit revenue growth. If it misses the mark, though, the roller-coaster ride that has been the last few years will resume.However, with the number of devices in the world growing, and therefore growing the amount of data in need of analysis, demand for Splunk's service looks like it will continue to increase. For those willing to stomach some uncertainty, this stock could be a reasonable pickup right now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Splunk also reiterated its expectation for full fiscal-year adjusted operating margin of roughly 8%.All things considered -- and though it shouldn't be terribly surprising, given Splunk's propensity for under-promising and over-delivering -- there was nothing not to like about this report from an investor's perspective.

But slow and steady can be a bit boring. Investors looking for stocks to buy, as a rule, should focus on high-quality, and preferably lower-risk, issues. Source: Still, there's room in any investor's portfolio for higher-risk, higher-reward plays - as long as those risks are understood.In that vein, here are 10 stocks to buy that offer potentially significant rewards, and almost as much risk. None of these stocks should be a core part of a portfolio, and all have the potential to blow up in your face.But taking those risks also creates the possibility of a major reward. It's likely at least a few of these stocks will wind up big winners going forward. (NYSE:  ) is a mess right now. The company still has no permanent CEO, with interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg Teva's fourth boss this  . The company  after its second-quarter report, leading TEVA stock to plunge. It's since reached a fourteen-year low.Teva has too much debt and no growth. Its key drug, Copaxone, which treats multiple sclerosis, is facing generic competition from  (NASDAQ:  ), among others. Bankruptcy likely isn't a near-term scenario - but the current trajectory suggests it could occur down the line. In short, TEVA is a classic contrarian, \"buy when there's blood in the streets\" type of play. And there are reasons to take the risk in TEVA stock.TEVA is extraordinarily cheap, trading at about 4Xearnings. Pressure has persisted on generic drugs, but it won't last forever. The company is starting to sell assets to clean up its balance sheet, which would de-risk the story here somewhat. Basically, TEVA is a less well-covered version of the story at  (NYSE:  ) - and, in my opinion, a better version, with a cheaper stock and an easier path back to normalcy.It's a risky path, but if it works TEVA could double simply by getting back to 7X to 8X EPS multiples and removing bankruptcy fears.The story already has played out somewhat at  (NASDAQ:  ), which has risen a whopping 150% so far this year. But that story isn't necessarily over - even if the elevated stock price might add a bit of risk.Only a few years ago, Scientific Games was a sleepy, low-growth provider of lottery tickets and terminals. But in quick succession, SciGames acquired slot machine manufacturers WMS Industries and Bally Technologies, the latter coming only months after Bally bought equipment maker and gaming table designer Shuffle Master. Scientific Games became the dominant supplier to the casino industry worldwide - a \"one stop shop\" for casino floors.It also became one of the most indebted companies in the U.S. markets - and still is. The company has a whopping $8.2 billion in debt, and even with improved results, its debt-ebitda ratio is above 6X. The combination of that debt and careful cost controls at casinos, particularly in the U.S., kept SGMS stock below $10 as recently as a year ago.But it now looks like the long-awaited \"replacement cycle\" of slot machines is arriving - and that could be hugely beneficial for Scientific Games and its smaller, similar rival  (NYSE:  ). And given how much leverage is still on the balance sheet, there's a case for SGMS to clear $100 - yes, $100 - if profit growth accelerates.That's not a guarantee, obviously, but it's the nature of highly indebted companies. Leverage is a weight when those companies struggle, and it's a springboard when they grow.In the case of  (NYSE:  ), leverage has been a weight. And after optimism about stable energy prices and Chesapeake's improved balance sheet boosted CHK stock in late 2016, it's been nothing but downhill. CHK now trades at a 14-month low.But I still think CHK is the best, if riskiest,  . At the least, Chesapeake has bought itself more time for those prices to work higher. It's also worth pointing out that Chesapeake bonds actually have been rather stable so far this year. Efficiency improvements at the wellhead have lowered costs as well.Chesapeake isn't going anywhere, except perhaps down, if oil and gas prices don't improve. And a \"lower for longer\" scenario could raise solvency questions down the line. It is a risky play. But the combination of debt on the balance sheet and leverage from higher energy prices mean that with a couple of changes, CHK could soar. (NASDAQ:  ), on the other hand, isn't the cheapest stock in its space - or anywhere else. The high-flying \"operational intelligence\" software provider still trades at nearly 8X revenue, and 81X 2018 analyst EPS estimates.The valuation alone shows the risk in SPLK, which has pulled back from brief early-2014 highs above $100. But since that pullback, SPLK stock actually has been rather stable, as investors give the company time to grow into its valuation. And grow it does, with fiscal Q2 revenue growth of 32% driving a  .Meanwhile, Splunk continues to be a likely acquisition target, with  (NASDAQ:  ) cited as a potential buyer in June and  (NYSE:  ) long thought to be a logical acquirer.Splunk is a classic growth stock in that it, too, is high-risk and high-reward. But it looks like one of the better growth stocks in what might be an over-aggressive market at the moment.The shipping space generally has been a \"Bermuda Triangle\" for investor capital, but  (NYSE:  ) might be the exception to the rule.There's likely to be some near-term volatility, as  (NYSE:  ) files for bankruptcy in the coming weeks. And Ship Finance's dividend, which currently yields 13%, could be at risk in that scenario.But this also remains one of the best plays in shipping, available for a modest premium to book value and at low-teens multiple to earnings. The industry alone, and a heavily leveraged balance sheet, both show the risk.But if Ship Finance can make it through some choppy waters over the next few months, there's likely a nice return for shareholders on the other side. There's no sector of the market more boom-and-bust than biotech and drug development.  (NASDAQ:  ) doubles down on that volatility by developing its drugs  .But GW Pharmaceuticals isn't some fly-by-night penny stock based on legalized weed. It's a $2.6 billion pharmaceutical company with a legitimate lead product candidate in Epidiolex, aimed to treat Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Sativex, used to treat multiple sclerosisSativex, used to treat multiple sclerosis spasticity, already is on the market. And another compound has potential uses to fight epilepsy and treat autism spectrum disorders.Like most drug development plays, GWPH is high-risk. But there's reason for investors to hold long-term optimism toward the company's pipeline. Success in getting those drugs to market likely would make GWPH an acquisition target at some point. That in turn, would suggest likely significant upside from current levels for GWPH stock.That in turn, would suggest likely significant upside from current levels for GWPH stock.Given that solar power actually is gaining an increasing share of the U.S. market, in particular, it's surprising that solar stocks including  (NASDAQ:  ) actually haven't done all that well. SolarCity had to be rescued by  (NASDAQ:  ).  (NASDAQ:  ) is down from multi-year highs despite the recent strength.There are risks for CSIQ, in particular. \"Commoditization\" and price pressure could hit margins. The company is rolling out a \"yieldco\" in Japan later this year, which will bring in cash - but a poorly-received IPO of that REIT could impact valuation.Still, demand for CSIQ equipment is growing, the stock isn't terribly highly valued, and it's lagged of late while FSLR, in particular, has risen. Solar stocks are likely to stay choppy for a while - but CSIQ should have some room to run if it can get through the second half of the year.Superior  (NYSE:  ) is trading at its lowest levels in six years. And yet shipments of the company's aluminum wheels hit a record in the second quarter.There's a reason for the disconnect. Auto parts stocks as a whole have come down of late, driven by  in the space. Superior itself has had a couple of missteps that impacted margins, and profits. And with SUP one of the more indebted companies in the sector, both factors have had an amplified impact on Superior's share price.But there's a reason to see a reversal as well. Near-term auto sales may be coming down, particularly in the U.S. But at less than 8x forward EPS, SUP stock isn't exactly pricing in explosive growth. A recent acquisition of European supplier UNIWHEELS improved Superior's position overseas. And there is room to improve execution, and hopefully, margins, going forward.SUP does have potential downside risk, particularly if global macro concerns arise, pressuring auto sales and dropping SUP earnings further. But for contrarians who think the auto parts selloff is overdone, SUP is one of the more intriguing plays. (NYSE:  ) is another growth stock with a high valuation and a big opportunity. The company began as an online textbook rental company. But it wound up outsourcing that business to another provider and since has focused on becoming the dominant digital platform for U.S. college students.And Chegg is having some success. Revenues are growing and adjusted ebitda has turned positive after years of losses. The company's tutors and study services businesses are growing rapidly, and it's becoming a fixture in the college landscape.There are risks here beyond valuation. Like so many companies, Amazon is a potential competitor down the line, given its efforts to offer free Prime services to college students. But at this point, it might simply be easier for Amazon to buy Chegg, rather than expend the resources to try and fight it.With each passing quarter, Chegg gets more and more entrenched. And that only serves to strengthen the bull case for CHGG stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["op Technology Stocks:MSFT: +0.4%AAPL: +0.5%IBM: flatCSCO: +0.3%GOOGL: +0.4%Technology shares were mostly higher in Friday's pre-market trade.In sector news, Splunk Inc.

That's fair enough, as many value stocks fit in quite well with this typically conservative train of thought.But a value stock can be any business that trades at a discount to what it's really worth, and sometimes you need to think outside the box to find truly compelling buys. So we asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a value stock that they believe  investors might appreciate. Read on to learn why they chose  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NYSE: CMG) , and  (NYSE: KMI) .IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. With shares of Splunk trading at a whopping 77 times this year's expected earnings, the operational intelligence software company certainly doesn't look like a \"value stock\" -- at least in the sense that most people think of the term. But investors need to keep in mind that Splunk purposefully forsakes bottom-line profitability, choosing to instead invest for revenue growth and taking market share in these early stages of its long-term story.It seems an understatement to say that its efforts to that end are succeeding. Splunk's most recent report in late May marked its  of exceeding its financial guidance; revenue and billings each climbed 30% year over year, and the company added 500 new enterprise customers, bringing its customer base to over 13,000. All told, 85 members of the Fortune 100 already rely on Splunk's cutting-edge operational intelligence platform to help them put their growing piles of unstructured machine data to use.But Splunk is only just getting started. Earlier this year, Splunk increased its estimated total addressable market by $10 billion to $55 billion, noting that figure represents a possible customer base of 300,000 to 400,000. In the meantime, Splunk maintains a goal of increasing revenue to $2 billion to 2020, up from its latest guidance for 2017 revenue of just under $1.2 billion.So, if you're willing to buy and hold Splunk as its long-term growth story plays out, I think you'll look back and realize it was a value stock in disguise all along. Just when it seemed the fast-casual Mexican eatery had really put the food-borne illness issues of 2015 in the rearview mirror, Chipotle  after more than a dozen customers reportedly caught the stomach bug norovirus at a Virginia location. Needless to say, Chipotle's stock tanked on the news and now trades near its lowest price in the past year; shares are down 28% in two months.While there's certainly some risk in doing so, bold investors could take this as an opportunity to buy shares of the company at what could be a bargain price. It may sound crazy since Chipotle trades for more than 106 times its trailing-12-month earnings, but hear me out.At its peak in 2015 -- before the E. coli food scare and unrelated norovirus outbreak soon after decimated sales -- Chipotle delivered $16.76 in earnings per share. At the recent $344 share price, Chipotle trades for 20.5 times this peak earnings. Since, the company has opened over 400 locations, 20% growth that should give the company far greater earnings potential. Furthermore, management intends to continue growing the store base around 10% annually  factoring in any growth potential for Tasty Made or Pizzeria Locale.Bottom line: There's risk that this latest scare will drive customers away again, causing the company to lose much of the ground that it's made up. But if you're willing to stomach that risk, today's price could prove to be a real value in another couple of years. Shares in pipeline giant  (NYSE: KMI) have had a rough time since the company slashed its dividend in late 2015 to  . Before the cut, its shares traded as high as the mid-40s, but since then, they've been languishing at around half that value or less.Still, for bold investors able to look past that prior cut and toward the company's future, today's Kinder Morgan looks like a reasonable value for a business that's even stronger than it was before. The company made very smart financial choices with the cash it freed up by cutting its dividend, leaving it with far greater flexibility and a firmer foundation than it had before.Its debt coverage is stronger, leading Moody's to upgrade its outlook to stable from negative. It's funding about $3 billion of its growth this year from the cash flow it freed up, which will ultimately deliver  cash to the company and its owners, unencumbered by debt service payments on it. And as importantly for shareholders who were burned by the late 2015 dividend cut, the company hopes to be able to announce the ability to resume increasing its dividend later this year.It's a bold choice to look for value in a company whose most recent dividend move was to slash its payout. In Kinder Morgan's case, the excellent moves the company has made since that cut to shore up its balance sheet and fund its expansion from internal sources may very well justify that choice.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Within that, new hardware sales climbed 14.8% thanks to strong demand for  's Switch products.

While ITOA registered an increase of 32.9%, Event and Log Management grew 23.5%.Reportedly, this was the third consecutive year when Splunk gained the top spot in the rapidly growing ITOA software market, outplaying established players such as International Business Machines  , Microsoft  , VMware, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, CA Technologies and BMC - all of which are vying to grab a bigger share of this fastest-growing IT market.Splunk's market share in ITOA touched 32.2% in 2016, per IDC. According to IDC report author Tim Grieser, \"Splunk supports prepackaged content and visualization for a variety of use cases including IT operations and APM. This is making Splunk-based analytics available to an increasing variety of IT and business users.\"In the IT Event and Log Management Market Shares report, Splunk's \"rapid growth is based on core capabilities for big data capture, indexing, management, search and visualization that extend across a wide variety of machine-generated data sources including metrics and logs\", cited Tim Grieser.

The company's latest quarterly total revenues for the first quarter fiscal 2018 (Q1 FY18) increased 30% y-o-y, outperforming market consensus estimates.Since going public in 2012, Splunk has shown a knack for steadily raising full-year guidance over the course of a fiscal year. The company's fiscal second quarter 2018 (ending Jul 31, 2017) sales guidance of $267-269 million is only in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $268.7 million.Currently, Splunk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of Splunk have generated a return of 15.8% on a year-to-date basis, compared with the  's gain of 15.6%.A better-ranked technology stock in this industry is AppFolio, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

In the first quarter, the company added 500 new customers and stated that it remains on track to have a customer base comprising 20K customers by fiscal 2020. | However, increasing investments in research and development coupled with higher operating costs are anticipated to be a drag on profitability. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins.Also, growing competition from established players such as International Business Machines  , SAP, Amazon  and Microsoft, all of which are vying to get a bigger share of the market, is a concern.In the past one year, shares have vastly underperformed the industry.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new October 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $57.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $60.66/share today.Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SPLK stock at the current price level of $60.66/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $62.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.07% if the stock gets called away at the October 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPLK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SPLK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $62.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

(NYSE:  ),Splunk (NASDAQ:  ) and Pure Storage (NYSE:  ).Last week we saw things slow down for tech stocks the earnings calendar eased back a bit. Next earnings reports slow down again to only 58 names and a $1.2B market cap gets you in the top 20. Clearly, the big boys have all reported, so we are seeing some stragglers coming down the line. One strategy is to intentionally be a straggler, and end your quarter a month later (or really start your quarter a month later) and that allows you the chance to get in the spotlight.I see several names that I want to talk about for this week, so I am just going to give some quick hits on each one. Let's start from the top and work our way down.Broadcom (NASDAQ:  ) is the biggest company set to report and the Street is looking for $4.46B on top and $4.03 on bottom. The stock was weaker closing the previous Friday just below $245 and trading $240 that day. This past week has been rather good to the stock, running higher on Monday and Tuesday and finally cooling off a little on Wednesday. Despite the potential for iPhone delays, this stock should still get a lot of attention as it hasn't missed on top or bottom in any quarter for the past two years.Salesforce (NYSE:  ) is the next largest tech stock set to report at $64B in market cap. Analysts are calling for sales of $2.52B and EPS of $0.32. CRM is also on a win streak, beating the bottom line number in each of the last five quarters while revenues have topped expectation in every quarter for the last two years. On August 1, Credit Suisse started coverage of the stock with an Outperform and $110 target. A few days later, Coatue Management, an influential hedge fund noted in a 13F filing that they owned 1.09M shares of stock. This followed some comments back in late June that T Rowe Price held this stock as its biggest position in one of its funds with the Portfolio Manager coming on CNBC to say that he believes the stock could double from here.HP Inc. (NYSE:  ) is further down the list but still a bellwether name in the tech space. Recently, Meg Whitman stepped down from the board as HP split in two. HPE is HP Enterprises and since the split shares have appreciated about 20%. HPQ on the other hand is down 30% since then, and the buzz around town is that she might jump shit to take over Uber. As much as I am really a numbers guy, this one is all about Meg as the stock could recover is she is removed.Splunk (NASDAQ:  ) is a data center play and at $8B it is the 12th largest tech stock slated to report. Wall Street wants $268M on top and $0.06 down below. In June the stock was downgraded by Wedbush and upgraded by Guggenheim. Last quarter the in line report sent the stock lower by 7% or so, this time should be different.Pure Storage (NYSE:  ) is a stock that I really like. Last quarter the stock rose 9.5% after a solid beat and continued to run after that. All told, for the week of earnings the stock was higher by nearly 30%. At the time, the options market was looking for a 12% move, and this time around, you guessed it, there is the same 12% implied move based on the price of a straddle about a week ahead of the report. It is likely that the implied price move continues higher into the print. Wall Street is looking for $218M on top and a loss of $0.14 on the bottom. Maxim recently lowered their rating on the stock to hold and slashed their price target from $20 to $15, they might have been looking for an increase in guidance at a recent analyst day event. I think this stock could be a big winner down the road.With fewer reports, the list of beat and raise stocks is down as well.

In a world increasingly reliant on the processing of big data, the company is well positioned for growth. What happened, and what does the company have planned?Data by We live in a world that generates more data than ever before. Countless numbers of human decisions and interactions happen every day, and businesses have a need to collect and analyze that information.Enter Splunk, which operates specifically within the \"machine data\" area of big data. Machine data deals with the information generated by a company's IT equipment, be it employee computers, payment processing terminals, or industrial machinery with an internet connection-enabling device. Here's a  explaining what machine data is.Much of that information that businesses collect goes unorganized and unused. Splunk's software helps businesses sort, organize, monitor, and gain insight on that data. That ability can help an organization increase the efficiency of operations, see what's happening in real-time, and monitor potential threats to the business.Image source: Getty.Splunk was founded in 2003 and became a public company back in 2012. In a short five year time span, the company has grown from about 4,800 customer and $100 million in revenue to over 13,000 customers and $1 billion in revenue as of the last earnings report.Management's new goal is to reach 20,000 customers and $2 billion in revenue by the year 2020. To pull that off, a few changes were needed. The first had to do with adjusting sales strategy to favor subscriptions instead of license agreements and cloud-based services rather than on-premises software. The hope is that will make revenue more stable and predictable.A slew of  were also made in the company's salesforce to help make the way for those 7,000 new hoped-for customers. In spite of those changes, first quarter results showed operating losses narrowing to $97 million from $98 million last year, halting what was a growing divide between the companies top and bottom lines.Data by For the next few years, Splunk is all about to squeezing as much growth out of its business model as it can, and it will worry about profitability later. Revenue grew 30% year-over-year during the first quarter on the back of nearly 500 new clients and expanded service agreements with existing customers. Q2 revenue is expected to come in about 25% higher than last year and about 26% higher for the full year.The major catalyst for Splunk since going public has been strong revenue growth, but that trend is starting to slow down. Revenues were up 80% in 2012 when the company went public, but during its investor presentation back in January management said to expect that number to slow to about 25% to 30% through 2020.Those are still great numbers, but Splunk's improving profit margins provide an even more compelling reason for it to resume its rise.

Next earnings reports slow down again to only 58 names and a $1.2B market cap gets you in the top 20. Clearly, the big boys have all reported, so we are seeing some stragglers coming down the line. One strategy is to intentionally be a straggler, and end your quarter a month later (or really start your quarter a month later) and that allows you the chance to get in the spotlight.I see several names that I want to talk about for next week, so I am just going to give some quick hits on each one. Let's start from the top and work our way down.Broadcom (AVGO) is the biggest company set to report next week and the Street is looking for $4.46B on top and $4.03 on bottom . The stock was weaker closing the previous Friday just below $245 and trading $240 that day. This past week has been rather good to the stock, running higher on Monday and Tuesday and finally cooling off a little on Wednesday. Despite the potential for iPhone delays, this stock should still get a lot of attention as it hasn't missed on top or bottom in any quarter for the past two years.Salesfore (CRM) is the next largest tech stock set to report next week at $64B in market cap. Anlaysts are calling for sales of $2.52B and EPS of $0.32. CRM is also on a win streak, beating the bottom line number in each of the last five quarters while revenues have topped expectation in every quarter for the last two years. On August 1, Credit Suisse started coverage of the stock with an Outperform and $110 target. A few days later, Coatue Managment, an influential hedge fund noted in a 13F filing that they owned 1.09M shares of stock. This followed some comments back in late June that T Rowe Price held this stock as its biggest position in one of its funds with the Portfolio Manager coming on CNBC to say that he believes the stock could double from here.HP Inc (HPQ) is further down the list but still a bellwether name in the tech space. Recently, Meg Whitman stepped down from the board as HP split in two. HPE is HP Enterprises and since the split shares have appreciated about 20%. HPQ on the other hand is down 30% since then, and the buzz around town is that she might jump shit to take over Uber. As much as I am really a numbers guy, this one is all about Meg as the stock could recover is she is removed.Splunk (SPLK) is a data center play and at $8B it is the 12th largest tech stock slated to report next week. Wall Street wants $268M on top and $0.06 down below. In June the stock was downgraded by Wedbush and upgraded by Guggenheim. Last quarter the in line report sent the stock lower by 7% or so, this time should be different.Pure Storage (PSTG) is a stock that I really like. Last quarter the stock rose 9.5% after a solid beat and continued to run after that. All told, for the week of earnings the stock was higher by nearly 30%. At the time, the options market was looking for a 12% move, and this time around, you guessed it, there is the same 12% implied move based on the price of a straddle about a week ahead of the report. It is likely that the implied price move continues higher into the print. Wall Street is looking for $218M on top and a loss of $0.14 on the bottom. Maxim recently lowered their rating on the stock to hold and slashed their price target from $20 to $15, they might have been looking for an increase in guidance at a recent analyst day event.

DATA SOURCE: SPLUNK.Splunk CEO Doug Merritt maintained his focus on customers, saying:For the current fiscal second quarter of 2018, Splunk expects revenue between $267 million and $269 million, while adjusted operating margin should improve to roughly 4%.As such, Splunk increased its guidance for the full fiscal year of 2018 to call for billings of $1.425 billion (up from $1.4 billion previously), and revenue of $1.195 billion (up from $1.185 billion previously). Splunk continues to expect full fiscal-year adjusted operating margin of 8%.In the end, investors can't ask much more from Splunk as it continues to invest heavily to take market share and drive revenue higher in these early stages of growth -- except, perhaps, an  more pronounced beat and raise than it delivered to start its latest fiscal year. But it's also worth noting that the market offered a similar modestly negative reaction to Splunk's equally solid fourth-quarter report in February, only for the stock to resume climbing as the market absorbed the news. So patient, long-term investors can take solace in knowing that regardless of whether the reaction to this report indicates as much, Splunk's growth story appears to remain firmly intact.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's a major advertising platform and news delivery gateway, just to name a few things. Certainly, Mark Zuckerberg didn't envision Facebook the way it's turned out when he was sitting in his Harvard dorm room, but its evolution into something woven into the fabric of our everyday lives is an achievement nonetheless.We've asked three of The Motley Fool's top contributors to share companies that remind them of Facebook.

Finding the next Facebook is nearly an impossible task because Facebook does so many things incredibly well. The company's brilliance often makes other genius companies in Silicon Valley second-rate.

And in a world where we're more interconnected and growing our digital footprints, connecting consumers to relevant advertisements at a higher conversion rate using big data is an intriguing business model. While Criteo is a long way away from being the next Facebook, it's tough to find another young company creating such a strong business model from advertising.Image source: Getty Images. China is unlike every other country on Earth. Because the government guards what's available on the internet, it can be hard for foreign tech giants to gain a foothold. That's a big reason local Internet giants such as  ,  , and  have managed to build up such a stranglehold in the region.One Chinese Internet company that I have my eye on is Momo. This company built up a big user base through the rollout of location-based online data. However, the company recently made a decision to go after the  . That strategy change has turned Momo into a true powerhouse.Last quarter, Momo's overall revenue grew by 421% to $265 million on the back of surging revenue from its live streaming service. What's more, the number of monthly active users grew 18% year over year to 85 million, while those who are paying to access the service grew to 4.1 million. These massive growth numbers caused Momo's bottom line to soar 633%, and they show that consumers are rapidly flocking to its platform, just as they have been doing with Facebook for years. Meanwhile, the number of internet users in China is estimated to be well above 700 million and growing, so Momo still has plenty of room left for expansion.Looking ahead, Momo believes that its hyper-growth rates are poised to continue. Next quarter, management is guiding for top-line growth of at least 186%. Given the massive opportunity ahead for Momo, I think the company's top and bottom lines could continue to rise rapidly for quite some time. That makes this a great stock for growth investors to keep their eyes on.Image source: Getty Images. Turning the massive amounts of data that corporations produce into something usable that they can act on remains the focus of businesses such as Splunk. This company helps businesses capture, store, analyze, and curate the information they generate. We don't hear the term \"big data\" quite as much as we used to, but the operational intelligence specialist continues to profit from its existence.In its fiscal 2018 first-quarter earnings report, Splunk said revenue rose 30% and GAAP and adjusted losses both narrowed for the period, as almost 500 new enterprise customers were  during the quarter. data by Like a certain social-media network in its early days, Splunk is taking an existing platform and transforming it into a next-level opportunity.

I give management a lot of credit for realizing the changes they are making may negatively impact the company's results in the short term and being willing to share that information with investors. Shareholders have been able to tune in to management's words from an analyst day in January, a conference call following the quarterly earnings report in February, and a presentation a few days later at a conference. At all three events, management has talked about the transition underway in the company's sales force and product direction. Let's dig in to what we've learned.Image source: Splunk.Splunk makes software for analyzing machine data. As the company explains: \"Machine data is one of the fastest growing and most pervasive segments of 'big data' -- generated by websites, applications, servers, networks, mobile devices and the like ... By monitoring and analyzing everything from customer clickstreams and transactions to network activity and call records -- and more, Splunk turns machine data into valuable insights no matter what business you're in. It's what we call operational intelligence.\" Splunk started fiscal year 2018 on Feb. 1. In the year just ended, the company grew revenue by 42% to $950 million. It guided for 25% growth and $1.185 billion in revenue for the current year and targeted $2 billion in sales by fiscal 2020.To achieve the goals, management is taking a step backward to take two steps forward.There are two fundamental changes that the company is making. One is related to product direction and the other is related to reorganizing the sales team to meet the new product strategy. The company sells both perpetual license agreements and subscriptions for its software products. It wants to transition to selling more subscriptions as this will produce a steadier and more predictable stream of income for the company. The chart below shows the company's subscription bookings as a percentage of total bookings by fiscal year. By fiscal 2020, the goal is to have 75% of bookings from subscriptions, otherwise known as software as a service, or SaaS.Image source: Splunk. The Splunk sales force is facing myriad changes this year. Everything from its organizational structure to its account focus and incentive plan are changing. Couple that with having to learn about new products and change sales habits, and you have the underpinnings for a chaotic fiscal 2018. Splunk is revamping account coverage to reduce the number of direct accounts it serves down to 25 per salesperson. In comparison, three years ago, each rep had 75 customers to serve. All other accounts will be moved to the third-party distribution channel. The new structure will require a far greater knowledge of strategic selling for all the Splunk account sales personnel. Each salesperson has fewer accounts and will be expected to have the time to fully develop the sales potential of the customer by selling at higher levels of management and across all departments. Splunk management recognized its sales incentive plan was skewed toward selling perpetual licenses and away from selling software subscriptions, the opposite of management's goal. So the plan has been changed. Changing financial incentives to create a change in behavior can be tricky. Management will have to keep a sharp eye out to see how it effects the first-quarter results and if any further tweaking to the plan is required. The company also wants its salespeople to sell more cloud-based subscriptions as opposed to the on-premises product. By selling more cloud-based products, the company can expand its market from just managing data within a customer's firewall. The ideal solution would be to sell a customer a hybrid subscription product that will encompass data both on-site and in the cloud. The chart below shows the company's cloud bookings in relation to overall subscription bookings.Image source: Splunk.Splunk needs to expand beyond selling to customers that are familiar with Splunk -- the low-hanging fruit. To do so requires salespeople to break out of their comfort level and develop more departments within current customers as users of the product, create relationships at higher levels within a customer's executive suite, and find altogether new accounts. This takes training, time, effort, and skill.At the end of January, Splunk management announced it had 13,000 customers. The plan is to grow the customer base to 20,000 accounts by the end of fiscal year 2020.There are many companies that have transitioned from $1 billion to $2 billion in revenue size. As a shareholder, it is important to recognize that this is not easy. It is not a sure thing. If the company hits some speed bumps this year, it may miss quarterly guidance, which could very well result in a hit to the share price. By understanding the complexity of what the company is doing beforehand, you can keep things in perspective and avoid selling shares if the company misses its quarterly guidance. In fact, if you believe in the company's long-term prospects, a shortfall in a given quarter may give you the opportunity to add to your holdings at a discount.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As the Internet of Things (IoT) grows, so does the amount of machine data, and companies need help using the information. That's where Splunk's software comes in, helping companies sort and analyze all the machine data so that it is intelligible and actionable.Image source: Pixabay user geralt.Splunk has an excellent reputation among its customers. At its recent analyst day, management told investors that it had a net promotor score (NPS) of 66.8 for 2016, up from 50 in 2015. A company's NPS (on a scale of -100 to +100) says something about customer loyalty and growth prospects as it measures customers' willingness to recommend a company's products or services.Splunk produced $1 billion in revenue this past fiscal year and has set its sights on doubling to $2 billion in three years. To do that, it must accomplish two goals to produce more revenue:Let's take a look at where the company is headed.Splunk finished fiscal year 2017 at the end of January with more than 13,000 customers, up a couple of thousand from the prior year. Here's how President and CEO Doug Merritt described the accomplishment:The company counts 85 of the Fortune 100 companies as customers.Splunk customers typically find out about Splunk when they have a problem. It is not unusual for an individual department within a large company to contact Splunk looking for a solution. Once Splunk creates the solution, word migrates to other departments that may have similar needs. The Splunk sales force promotes Splunk within the customer company and looks for additional opportunities. The goal is to drive enterprise adoption throughout the customer's organization.Splunk reorganizes the territory covered by its sales force every year. To give its salespeople time to develop the accounts Splunk already does business with, management has been reducing the number of customers served by each member of the sales team. Three years ago, the ratio was 75 accounts per salesperson. This year that number has been reduced to 25 customers per sales rep.Below is a table showing Splunk's customer total at the end of each fiscal year, revenue for the year, and total revenue divided by the number of customers. The increasing revenue number per customer is the trend investors want to see.\n  \nData source: Splunk.The chart below shows Splunk's customer growth over a longer period of time, up through the most recent third quarter, and its estimate of how it will climb to 20,000 customers in fiscal year 2020.Image source: Splunk.The importance of developing more customers cannot be overstated. Today there are 18 states that do not have a Splunk-employed sales representative. To manage the accounts that do not have direct Splunk sales coverage, the company has set up a two-tier distribution channel. The company invests resources into developing these channel relationships that will drive new accounts. Over time the goal is to grow the account to a size and a level of importance where it will be migrated out of the distribution channel over to Splunk direct sales coverage.Tracking the number of customers that Splunk serves is an excellent way to gauge the effectiveness of the company's ability to maximize its revenue potential. Out of today's small accounts will come tomorrow's enterprise-level customer.Monitoring Splunk's quarterly reports should give investors much of what they need to know regarding Splunk's progress toward meeting its fiscal 2020 strategic goals of $2 billion in sales and 20,000 customers. The company has created a short-term milestone of $231 million to $233 million in revenue for its next quarter ending April 30. The company also announced it brought on 700 more customers last quarter, which it should exceed this quarter.Knowing Splunk's focus on sales allows us to monitor what is important to the company on a quarter-by-quarter basis. If the company exceeds management's expectations by selling more to current customers or developing new customers faster than expected, investors may benefit from share-price gains.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.4, after changing hands as low as $57.68 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 61.1. A bullish investor could look at SPLK's 29.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of SPLK shares:    Looking at the chart above, SPLK's low point in its 52 week range is $50.60 per share, with $69.23 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $58.27.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SPLK makes up 3.11% of the First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (Symbol: CIBR) which is trading lower by about 2.5% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he transition for a software company from selling a perpetual license with a maintenance agreement over to a software as a service (SaaS) cloud-based subscription model can be tricky.  (NASDAQ: SPLK) is in the process of making that transition.The concept of SaaS is easy to understand. If you have ever used  's Office product, you may have bought a CD version or a download of the product and installed it on a computer. That software was paid for all upfront and used in perpetuity by the user. The one-time cost for the product is about $150.The SaaS version of Microsoft Office is called Microsoft 365. It is purchased on a monthly or an annual basis for about $7 per month or $70 per year. This product updates continually over the life of the product so the buyer is always running the latest version of the product with the newest features.Image source: Splunk.Prior to this fiscal year, which began on Feb. 1, Splunk incentivized its sales force to sell perpetual licenses for its software along with an annual maintenance agreement. The customer would buy the software upfront and then pay for the maintenance over time. When a new version of the software became available the customer could pay an additional fee to upgrade to the latest version. The customer would host the software on its own servers on premises.Although the sales team had the SaaS version of the product available, it was personally more lucrative for them to sell the perpetual license product as customers paid for the product upfront.Splunk management changed the sales commission plan this year to get the sales force to focus on selling the SaaS product instead of the perpetual license product. This will hurt Splunk in the short term as initial revenue for a SaaS sale is much lower than for a one-time software purchase.Splunk charges customers per gigabyte (GB) of data that the customer runs through the Splunk platform. The chart below shows Splunk's pricing for one GB of data per day.\n  \nData source: Splunk. Table by author.Splunk's plan is pure genius, although at first blush you may question the company's sanity due to the postponement of upfront revenue. Look at the chart below and you can see how over time the SaaS offering is more lucrative for Splunk. Additionally, the customer derives the benefit of always having the latest and greatest Splunk software working for them and paying a much lower initial payment to work with Splunk. The company can run the software for the customer in the cloud, saving the customer the IT infrastructure expense of having to host the software.Data source: Splunk. Chart by author.Two other companies that have made this SaaS conversion and are in a business comparable to Splunk are  and  Adobe began selling its SaaS product in April 2012, and its stock has more than tripled since then. Autodesk turned completely to the SaaS model in February 2016. Its stock has almost doubled. data by  .Splunk management has created a goal for the company to reach $2 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2020, roughly double its sales for its just ended fiscal 2017. The company wants to have $1.5 billion of that 2020 revenue to be SaaS, as compared with less than $500 million for the past year -- a tripling of the SaaS sales!Image source: Splunk.This is the type of change that could drive the stock price higher. The short term may be a bit bumpy as upfront revenue is diverted toward a longer stream of income. That longer stream of income should be quite sticky as customers always receive the newest version of the software. Splunk's pricing also allows the customers to simply add more gigs of data to the plan by increasing the subscription rate, which is good for Splunk.Splunk's revenue will become more predictable as the migration goes forward and the cost of retaining customers should drop as the customer manages more of their needs over the cloud-based SaaS product. This looks like a win for the customers, a win for Splunk, and a win for shareholders.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nonetheless, share of the operational intelligence platform company are down around 6% in after-hours trading as of this writing.Let's take a closer look at what drove Splunk's results as it capped its latest fiscal year, as well as what investors can expect from the company going forward.Splunk's enterprise software solutions. Image source: Splunk, Inc.*For the quarter ended Jan. 31, 2017. Data source: Splunk.Splunk CEO Doug Merritt added:For the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended April 30, 2017), Splunk expects revenue between $231 million and $233 million -- curiously below the $241.4 million investors were expecting -- with adjusted operating margin between negative 2% and negative 4%.Even so, Splunk simultaneously updated its previous guidance for the full fiscal year of 2018 (ended Jan. 21, 2018). As it stands, Splunk now expects fiscal 2018 revenue of $1.185 billion, above Wall Street's estimates for $1.18 billion and marking a slight increase from prior guidance (provided at the company's annual investor day last month) of $1.175 billion. Within that figure, cloud revenue is expected to be around $85 million (up from $47.8 million last fiscal year), while adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2018 should be roughly 8%.This was another strong quarter from Splunk as it continued to purposefully forsake bottom-line profitability in favor of investing to take market share and scale its business. Apart from from its slight top-line guidance shortfall (at least relative to Wall Street's expectations) for the current quarter, there were no negative surprises that should have raised the market's ire.That said, shares of Splunk had climbed nearly 90% in the year leading up to this report. And given the company's nine-quarter streak of beating expectations, perhaps the market has grown accustomed to its propensity for underpromising and overdelivering. But even so, I think Splunk investors should be both happy with where their company stands today and excited for the road ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tech companies often succumb to competitive pressures as rivals pump out similar products faster and more cheaply. Other firms flop when their inventions turn out to be too far ahead of their time. And sometimes the emergence of new technologies renders their products obsolete. You may have to contend with steep valuations, too, as euphoria for new technologies sends stocks soaring far beyond what their earnings will ever justify.Still, many of today's tech leaders are riding high on more than Silicon Valley pipe dreams. The industry is humming with companies that are. We've listed 13 companies that are producing real sales and fast-growing profits and have immense potential to cash in on the future.Share prices, returns and other data are as of January 31. Click on ticker-symbol links in each slide for current prices and more.In the auto industry, the biggest potential gains belong to the companies supplying carmakers with artificial-intelligence brains, semiconductors and sensing technology. At the forefront of this trend is chip maker Nvidia. The company has long dominated the market for powerful graphics-processing chips that are used in computers and video-game systems. Now those processors are becoming hot sellers in the car market, too.Fusing data from onboard sensors, cameras and laser-based systems, the firm's new Drive PX 2 technology can \"understand\" a vehicle's environment and help guide the car down the road. At full power, Nvidia says, the system can process \"24 trillion deep learning operations per second\"--enough AI brainpower to replace a human driver. Nvidia says Tesla plans to deploy this mini supercomputer in its vehicles, and other carmakers are buying versions of the technology.Nvidia's automotive sales amounted to $359 million for the nine-month period that ended last October--less than 10% of total sales, most of which come from gaming chips. But auto-related sales climbed 60% from a year earlier and should increase steadily as more carmakers buy Nvidia's chips. Nvidia recently announced deals with Audi and Mercedes-Benz to include its technology in forthcoming models.Chip maker Qualcomm is racing into the auto industry, too. The firm's Snapdragon lineup of processors runs \"infotainment\" systems and applications such as 3-D navigation. Qualcomm's auto business could get a big lift, too, from its planned merger with NXP Semiconductors (  ), the world's largest maker of automotive chips and sensors (the deal is expected to close later this year).Outside its automotive business, Qualcomm makes chip sets for the wireless industry and earns hefty royalties from licensing CDMA technology--a critical component of wireless devices and mobile networks around the world. Qualcomm faces lawsuits and charges that its licensing practices are anti-competitive, and the stock tumbled 18% in January because of fears that the highly lucrative licensing business may not be as profitable in the future. If more legal issues arise, the stock could slump again.Still, Qualcomm's deal for NXP should be a big winner, helping to boost the firm's sales and profits in the automotive space and other high-growth areas, such as security and networking. The company should also retain its \"pole position\" in wireless technology, says Sonu Kalra, manager of the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund. Trading at just 11 times earnings, the stock looks inexpensive. As a bonus, the shares possess a healthy 4.0% dividend yield.Built through a series of mergers, Broadcom sells a wide assortment of chips, sensors and other high-tech gear, much of it related to wireless communications, data storage and networking.Those technologies are at the core of Internet of Things (IoT) -- the vast world of digitally connected objects, from traffic signals to much more prosaic items, such as trash cans. Research firm Gartner estimates that 6.4 billion \"things\" were connected to the internet last year, up 30% from 2015. By 2020, Gartner estimates, the figure will rise to $20.8 billion. IDC Research sees spending on IoT-related goods and services jumping from $737 billion in 2016 to $1.29 trillion in 2020.Broadcom sold some of its IoT-related technology to Cypress Semiconductor (  ) in 2016. But the deluge of data created by IoT devices is lifting demand for Broadcom's products, especially from data centers, where companies are upgrading networking gear and computers to handle the digital flood. Broadcom is the 800-pound gorilla in data centers, says Paul Wick, comanager of the Columbia Seligman Communications and Information Fund. The firm's profits are zooming, too.Software maker Splunk should also benefit from the IoT and related spending on cloud computing.The firm's software translates machine data into visual form, helping businesses identify and analyze digital trends in real time and diagnose problems in industrial networks. Customers pay Splunk based partly on the quantity of data coursing through its system, a setup that should lift revenues as more data flows through, says Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson. Because Splunk is spending heavily to build its business, it isn't profitable yet. But most of Splunk's customers have moved only 20% to 25% of their machine data to Splunk's system, estimates Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That should leave plenty of room for growth as the IoT expands and Splunk signs up more businesses.A leader in the burgeoning field of robotic surgery, Intuitive Surgical has sold more than 3,800 of its da Vinci machines over the past 15 years. Physicians use the da Vinci's arms to perform minimally invasive surgery, which usually is easier on patients and can be more precise than traditional operating techniques. Da Vinci is now used in more than 80% of prostate cancer surgeries in the U.S., and it's being deployed for scores of other operations, such as hysterectomies and coronary bypasses. Intuitive estimates that more than 700,000 robotic medical procedures were conducted in 2016, an increase of about 15% from the previous year.Despite that impressive growth, Intuitive isn't close to saturating the market. The company launched a more advanced da Vinci system in 2014, expanding its potential uses and fueling sales growth as hospitals upgrade older systems. The company is also making money selling accessories and services, and it should continue to expand as doctors become more comfortable with the system and consumers increasingly request robotic surgery, says Fidelity fund manager Kalra.Another U.S. company riding the automation wave is Cognex. The firm makes machine-vision technology, such as cameras, lenses and software, for bar-code readers, industrial equipment and \"vision-guided\" robots. These sophisticated machines are playing a greater role in assembling cars, computer chips and other precision-engineered products, and they can take over dangerous industrial work, such as manipulating parts on a metal-cutting saw. Cognex recently bought two 3-D vision companies to boost sales in the automotive, electronics and logistics industries. Factory automation now accounts for more than 95% of its revenues, which are climbing steadily.Behind the scenes at many big companies, a game of digital cat and mouse goes on day and night. Hackers try to breach a computer system, cybersecurity police chase them down, and the process repeats itself. With data breaches and cybertheft growing more prevalent, spending on security products is expected to rise steadily. CyberArk Software should thrive in this heightened-threat climate.Based in Israel, the company sells software to thwart hackers who try to breach \"privileged\" accounts in corporate computing networks. Closely guarded in the digital world, these accounts often provide access to sensitive corporate data, holding the \"keys to the IT kingdom,\" as CyberArk puts it. If attackers do penetrate, CyberArk can lock down and isolate the accounts, preventing data theft or damage to corporate computer systems.Although the firm competes against much larger cybersecurity outfits, it dominates the privileged-account niche with a \"unique\" technology, says Columbia Seligman's Wick. Analysts expect revenues to increase 22% this year and profits to climb almost 13%.Another Israeli firm, Check Point Software Technologies offers broader solutions to cyber threats. It sells bundles of devices and software to create \"unified threat management\" systems that, ideally, can protect an entire global network of computers, applications and data.Check Point is now targeting small and midsize businesses with its cybersecurity bundles, and it's expanding into areas such as \"advanced threat protection\" for mobile devices and \"virtual\" desktops--a burgeoning business as more employees work remotely.llumina, the leading maker of gene-sequencing machines and related products, stands at the forefront of the DNA revolution.Researchers are using its technology to investigate the genetics of people, microorganisms and diseases such as cancer, resulting in more-precise diagnoses and more-personalized treatments. Illumina is now launching a new generation of machines that it says will be able to sequence an entire human genome in less than 24 hours for as little as $100, a development that could vastly expand the technology's reach. The company is also teaming up with firms such as IBM (  ) and Dutch conglomerate Philips (  ) to develop more medical diagnostic tools that should extend sales in the health care field.Illumina's growth isn't a slam dunk. Sales could slump if labs curb spending on genetic testing and research. The company is battling rivals such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (  ) and Qiagen (  ) in the gene-sequencing space. Illumina's sales growth has slowed sharply in recent years, too. But don't be discouraged, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Illumina now has \"the pieces in place\" to return to \"mid teens\" revenue growth by 2018, says Merrill, which rates the stock a buy.Among drugmakers, BioMarin Pharmaceutical should flourish as a leader in treatments for rare genetic diseases. The company sells medicines for illnesses such as Morquio A syndrome (a cellular disorder) and PKU (a metabolic disease), and it may win approval this year to sell a medicine for Batten disease, an often-fatal pediatric neurological disorder. Also in the works are another drug to manage PKU and a treatment for dwarfism.Perhaps most exciting is BioMarin's experimental gene therapy for hemophilia A, which afflicts up to one in 5,000 males worldwide. Patients with this disease now rely on infusions of blood-clotting agents to survive. BioMarin's technology replaces a missing gene that hemophiliacs need for blood clotting, potentially reducing or eliminating regimens of injections. Although the gene-therapy product is still in early development, the firm plans to mass-produce it for more-extensive clinical trials in 2018. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young estimates that, if approved, the drug could eventually deliver $1 billion in annual sales, nearly as much as BioMarin's total forecast sales of $1.3 billion in 2017.The big risk with the stock is that BioMarin's experimental drugs won't pan out. If they do eventually reach the market, though, they could be worth $4 billion in annual sales, says Young. The company possesses one of \"the most diversified and promising\" pipelines of potential products among midsize drugmakers, she says, making the stock a buy.Many investors dream of winning the lottery with a small company that hits the big time. But technology giants can pay handsomely, too. Trends such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence \"are reinforcing the power of the largest players,\" says Kennard Allen, manager of the T. Rowe Price Science & Technology Fund. Big companies can exploit these trends, he says, and \"enjoy their fruits\" more than firms with fewer resources.Leading the way is Amazon.com. Not only is it dominating online shopping, but it is also building other high-growth businesses. Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing division, could generate $100 billion in annual sales by 2027, estimates Allen, up from $12.2 billion in 2016. Amazon is also betting on artificial intelligence: Its Alexa virtual assistant gets smarter every year, \"learning\" thousands more skills (well beyond shopping and home-control tasks). Topping things off are Amazon's plans to field more package-handling robots in its warehouses and to scrap delivery trucks in favor of home-delivery drones. \"I see Amazon as the biggest company in the world eventually,\" says Allen, who expects the stock to double over the next five years.These trends also favor Alphabet. The parent of Google is investing heavily in artificial intelligence that it hopes will manage data centers, electrical grids, homes and health care systems--and play a greater role behind the scenes of Google's many online businesses.Alphabet has wrapped its tentacles around the wireless industry with its Android operating system (running nearly nine in 10 mobile devices worldwide), and it is developing sensors and software for self-driving cars. Wall Street adores all this--along with Alphabet's hefty profits--granting the company a market capitalization of $558 billion, second only to that of Apple. But Alphabet's many products and growth prospects warrant a higher stock price, says Credit Suisse, which sees the shares hitting $1,100 over the next 12 months.Sure, it's been around a long time. But Microsoft has generated immense sales and profits from its Windows operating systems and applications software, which run on more than 90% of the world's personal computers.Microsoft is now plowing that cash into high-growth areas, such as its thriving cloud-computing business (Azure), a new machine-learning division, and products for the Internet of Things. All told, Microsoft should benefit from most of the major tech trends, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to report earnings after hours on 02/23/2017.

Here's a rundown on what to expect and items to look in the report and when management holds its quarterly conference call.Splunk management has guided investors to expect the following for the quarter and the full year.\n  \nData source: Splunk. Table by author. Non-GAAP = adjusted. GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles.The following table comes from 35 analyst estimates.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. table by author.Last quarter, Splunk management set the stage for what appears to be shaping up as an exciting year for the company. Investors learned that the company would be  to focus on fewer customers and sell more of its cloud-based real-time operational intelligence software throughout more departments within its largest accounts. Smaller accounts would be outsourced to third-party partners for sales coverage. The goal is to make big customers even bigger and the company more profitable by moving them from onsite solutions to cloud-based products with an emphasis on selling software subscriptions in place of perpetual software licenses.Image source: Pixabay.Because of all the  Splunk is undertaking at the beginning of its new fiscal year, there's the possibility the company may miss its revenue guidance.The company stated last quarter that it expects fiscal 2018 to follow a similar pattern to past years, with approximately 42% of the revenue coming in the first half of the year and the remaining 58% coming in the second half.Once the Q1 revenue numbers come out, it will be important to watch whether the company adjusts the guidance for the full fiscal year. If Q1 revenue is light and the company keeps or raises its full-year guidance, that is a sign that management believes the transition is working and may simply be taking slightly longer to implement. If Q1 revenue exceeds guidance, management might raise guidance. That would be a very good sign that the company will have a strong year.Based on past quarterly reports, the company typically updates numbers for total customers at the end of each quarter, giving shareholders insight into how many new customers have come on board.Here's a look at the number of new customers Splunk added by quarter over the past two years:\n  \nYou can see that Splunk's new customer additions track the revenue seasonality. The second half is typically stronger.The company ended last fiscal year with 13,000 total customers and 700 new customers added for the fourth quarter. Last year, the company brought in 500 new customers in its Q1. Anything less than 500 new customers may be viewed as a disappointment and indicate turbulence in the transition of smaller accounts to the third-party sales channel. It could also signal that Splunk's own sales team is slowing down in adding larger accounts.Bookings will give us insight into whether the sales team is following management's direction by selling more subscriptions and more cloud-based solutions.The company expects to have 75% of its business from subscriptions by fiscal 2020.

Splunk is one of the leading \"big data\" businesses, providing a real-time operational intelligence software platform that enables its customers to search, monitor, analyze, and visualize machine-generated data coming from websites, applications, servers, networks, sensors, and mobile devices. Its software transforms machine generated data into valuable insights in areas such as security and fraud, IT operations, log management, business analytics, and application delivery. Splunk's growth is being propelled by the explosion of \"big data\"-data volumes are growing at roughly a 50% rate (with machine-generated data growing closer to 80%) and this data can now be captured, stored, and analyzed to extract actionable business intelligence. Growth in the frequency and severity of cybersecurity breaches are accelerating demand for security monitoring software, which represents around 40% of Splunk's bookings, as many customers have made Splunk the \"nerve center\" of their security operations. The emerging Internet of Things should dramatically accelerate the growth and analysis of machine data. Splunk is undergoing a transition from a perpetual software license model- where the software is paid for upfront and loaded behind a customer's firewall-to cloud-delivered and ratable pricing models.

Splunk posted a negative surprise of 17.54% in the last quarter. The company has also posted an average negative surprise of 11.97% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Splunk has been strengthening its product pipeline to benefit from the growing data and analytics market. Over the past few years, the cloud and data analytics market has seen strong growth especially in the enterprise domain, which is a positive for the company. Also, the company has been seeing an increase in the numbers of customers.However, due to the ongoing transition, the license bookings businesshas started to slow down. Also, increasing investments in research and development coupled with higher operating costs are anticipated to be a drag on profitability. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins.Also, growing competition from established players such as International Business Machines  , SAP, Amazon and Microsoft  , all of which are vying to get a bigger share of the market, is a concern.For the fourth quarter, Splunk expects revenues in a range of $286 million to $288 million and non-GAAP operating margin in a range of 8% to 9%. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Splunk is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

Even with TWLO more than 50% off late September highs, the stock still trades at over seven times the midpoint of its 2017 revenue guidance. And that multiple excludes the company's $300 million in cash. Meanwhile, the price-earnings ratio for Twilio stock is infinite because the company is unprofitable, and rather sharply so. 2017 guidance implies an operating loss of $13 million to $17 million on a non-GAAP basis. Source: In other words, for every dollar of revenue Twilio generates this year, it expects to lose at least 4 cents, plus another 3 to 4 cents in stock-based compensation. (That dilution is excluded from Twilio stock's non-GAAP figures.)So if  (NASDAQ:  ) is overvalued at 62 times earnings, TWLO stock must be even moreso. And that should make Twilio stock a tempting target for short sellers.But it's not that simple. TWLO is a growth stock after all, and growth stocks can stay elevated for a long time. Short sellers indeed have targeted TWLO stock, one reason shares have declined so sharply of late. But as those same short sellers say, \"Valuation is not a catalyst.\" And recent history proves them right.Value investors, in particular, often criticize stocks like TWLO, with more than a bit of frustration in their voice. \"I guess, for growth stocks, the numbers don't even matter.\" (AMZN shareholders surely are familiar with that sentiment.)But that's not the case. A company like Twilio isn't  to be profitable yet. It's not even a decade old, which isn't a long time in the competitive tech space. It's investing money in attracting new customers to its cloud communications service, which is what it should be doing. There's no need to forego that spend for profits now, when that spend can drive far more profits later.Purely from a valuation standpoint, it's too simplistic, particularly in the PaaS/SaaS space, to look at profits without context. It's better for Twilio to spend a dollar on sales and marketing now - even if that adds to its net losses - if that dollar is worth $3 in sales later. And the reason cloud stocks have been so hyped - and so highly valued - is that $1 upfront doesn't just lead to $3 later \u2026 Rather, it leads to $1, or even $2, for years and years and years.So there are investors who are taking the long term - and, dare I say, fundamental - approach toward Twilio stock. TWLO's valuation is based not on what it's doing in 2017, but what it can do in 2020, or 2025. That leads to quite a bit of volatility, as seen in TWLO's short time on the public markets. But that volatility doesn't mean TWLO longs aren't paying attention, and it doesn't mean TWLO is failing. Most notably, for short sellers considering TWLO, it doesn't mean Twilio stock will  going down.Of course, there are fundamental arguments for TWLO stock to continue to tumble. Unlike more well-known cloud plays, Twilio has relatively low gross margins since it still has to pay network providers who transmit calls and text messages. Revenue growth is guided to slow in 2017, to 33%.With similar deceleration, sales wouldn't double again until 2020. $700 million-plus in sales at even 15% operating margin still implies barely $100 million in operating profit. That, in turn, probably puts EPS under $1 - and TWLO stock's 2020 P/E multiple above 35.But investors should look at recent history in the cloud space. Pretty much every high-flying SaaS or PaaS stock has had similar concerns. And pretty much all of them have held up just fine.  (NYSE:  ) bottomed in early 2016 near $50; it's since rebounded sharply, and now trades at over 10x revenue.  (NYSE:  ) was a popular short seller target in 2015; it's at all-time highs, with sales multiples similar to that of TWLO.  (NASDAQ:  ) is near a 52-week high - and trades at over 8x revenue on an enterprise basis. A high valuation doesn't mean a bad stock - at least in the short term.So there are two concerns when shorting a stock like TWLO. The first is that as long as near-term performance is enough to keep bullish investors happy on the long-term prospects, the stock is unlikely to come down. With Twilio coming out of a strong Q4 that beat expectations, that sentiment seems likely to stay positive for at least the next couple of months.The second is that a short seller on TWLO can be right and still lose badly. \"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent,\" the old saw goes.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $40 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.45. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.1% return against the $40 commitment, or a 6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to SPLK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $40 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Splunk Inc sees its shares decline 28.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $37.55 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.45 from $40), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $40 strike for the 6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Splunk Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.99) to be 49%.

Moreover, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise stands at a positive 12.45%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Shutterfly generally incurs loss in the first three quarters and makes profit in the final quarter of every year because of the seasonal nature of its business. Thus, for the fourth quarter, the company expects earnings per share in the range of $2.57 to $2.86. Net revenue is anticipated to be in the range of $557.0 million to $587.0 million, a year-over-year increase of 1.6% to 7.1%.Shutterfly's strategic acquisitions, improved offerings in the growing mobile e-Commerce segment, aggressive promotions and easy-to-use products are its strong points and should continue to boost results in the to-be-reported quarter. The company's Shutterfly 3.0 initiative, under which it aims to create a platform and device-agnostic memory management as well as personalized e-commerce solution, should further drive the quarter's performance.However, higher costs associated with strategic initiatives to increases its production capacity may somewhat hamper the quarter's profits, while unfavorable travel industry and consumer spending trends might limit revenue growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Shutterfly is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Shutterfly has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.73. : Shutterfly has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some restaurant companies to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:GoDaddy Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Also, they explain why once-disruptive companies often lose their game-changing luster with time, why it's so hard to predict future markets, what  (NASDAQ: FB) and  (NASDAQ: NFLX) did so right, and more.A full transcript follows the video.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . Welcome to  , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, Sept. 2, and we're talking innovation and disruption. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined in the studio by Fool premium analyst Simon Erickson. Simon, how's it going? Great, Dylan. Two of the finest words in investing right there: innovation and disruption. I love it already. Have you tried to reach out to people at dictionary.com and get your face directly next to those definitions? I really need to. That's a great idea. Yeah, one of these days. This should be a really fun show. We're basically going to go through the Fool's introduction to disruption, like Disruption 101 class. Thankfully, I have Professor Simon Erickson to help me out. Simon, when I say this is a class, I'm not kidding. This is something we've institutionalized a little bit. That's true. You gave a presentation a couple months ago to Fools, whoever wanted to show up and hang out and listen, check it out. This discussion we're going to have is also a part of what the analyst development program on the investing team side, what those people go through as cohort when they come in and learn how we invest, and become part of our program. So, this is kind of a look behind how our investing team thinks about some of the stuff, and, I think, a cool thing to be able to share with listeners. Yeah, and it's really a neat field. It's all based on a book called  written by Clayton Christensen back in 1997. We incorporate it into our investing process. You see it a lot in our  service, our  premium service. It's basically an understanding of, why do these huge companies, like the  s and the  s of the world  just keep getting bigger and bigger and more efficient and taking over the world eventually? There's something that changes along the way, and disruption, to a very large extent, explains what's happening. Yeah, and it's something that's near and dear to the Fool's heart. Like you said, a lot of the very successful stock picks from our newsletters have been highly disruptive companies. We've been able to benefit from having folks identify these hot spaces and the companies operating in them fairly early on, and hopefully helped out investors along the way. Listeners, the idea with this show is, we're going to outline, basically, what it truly means to be disruptive. There may be a little bit of a misconception out there. Also, why investors should care, and some of the principles that Fools use to identify disruption and some of the companies that are leading the charge in some of these spaces. Simon, to kick it off, what is disruption as you define it here, and as Christensen defines it? Disruption is based, first, off of technology itself. Technology, the definition of that is really just a process that changes labor, money, materials from something of a lower value to a higher value. You see examples of this all the time.  takes radios and processors and compiles them all into an iPhone, which is of much higher value for somebody than all those pieces together.  does the same thing. They take a world-class inventory management system and can work with vendors all over the globe to put those products into a discount retailer. Technology is how you bring something from a lower value to a higher value.The interesting part is that technology changes over time. We call that innovation. There's really two types of change in technology. One is sustaining innovation. That's basically, we're doing something kind of similar to what we did before, but it's a little bit better and a little bit higher tech. So, when Apple comes out with the iPhone 7, probably in September -- Hopefully, fingers crossed. -- it's probably going to look a lot like the iPhone 6. It's going to have, probably, a better camera, better processors, stuff like that, but still based off the way Apple packages products. And that type of innovation, to me, sounds much more iterative. The idea of being like, \"OK, we can kind of project where this is going.\" It's easy to see what the next phase of this might look like. Exactly. And the other side of that, to answer your question in the most long-winded way I possibly could, is sometimes, we have disruptive innovation, where you do not base it off of an established product or process. It's completely doing something differently. It brings new value to customers through a new technology or a new business model. We can go more into that a little bit later in the show. Yeah, we'll dive deep into that. But, something to keep in mind as you see outlets or podcasts or anyone talking about something that is disruptive, think about whether it's something that slightly changes what we already know, or is truly coming out of a new space. Looking at why investors should care about disruption -- we touched on some of the great  picks, some of the great picks from the Fool universe have been highly disruptive companies. Any color you want to add there, Simon? It's interesting. The sustaining innovations, the improvements that are complimenting existing technologies out there, really benefit the larger firms. They already have, maybe, a plant built out. Maybe they have a huge process that makes them a lot more efficient than smaller companies can be. So, typically, they'll shy away from disruption, which is what makes it so interesting -- disruptive innovation favors the newcomers that have a different set of glasses on, are able to see things differently, bring a new business model out there.I think the reason why you should care, if you're a big company, about disruption is ... Let's not forget that Cisco, for many years, was the largest company on the stock market. I believe it had a $500 billion market cap, at some point. And now, it's definitely a shade of that, because the business world changes, and you have to keep pace with those changes, and sometimes disrupt yourself, if you're a big company. So, for big companies, small companies, investors, it's definitely something that we should all be paying attention to. And your point about Cisco -- even if you're not someone who is a highly growth-oriented investor, and you don't like the idea of playing and more nascent spaces, you want to see that some of these stalwart companies that you're invested in are at least considering this kind of stuff. Whether it's a small department that's working on projects like this, or through acquisitions, just, that they aren't going to be passed by by technological change. Exactly. The really interesting part, Dylan, is that these companies aren't doing anything wrong. It's hard to call the managers of these multibillion-dollar segments of these companies -- they're not idiots. They're smart guys that are making great rational business decisions. It's just, disruption looks at, why does that not always work? What is it that they didn't see coming that changes the business out there? And in some cases, there are characteristics of the business that make it tough to really engage in some of these markets. With that said, why don't we look at a couple of the principles that you and some of the investing folks use to identify spaces that are, maybe, ripe for disruption, or companies that are ready to turn the world on its head. Like you said, there's five principles you could look for to predict when disruption is going to hit an industry or a certain company. We can walk through those, for this podcast, one at a time. The first is what Christensen calls the theory of resource dependence. He really says that it's not companies, but it's their customers and their investors that dictate how they're spending their money. Which is crazy, right?You think about it, companies are always allocating capital, \"We're going to do this and that.\" A lot of times, it's the investors saying, \"We want you to make this acquisition to juice your return on equity.\" Or, your customers might be saying, \"We want a slightly better product, that we'll pay a little bit more for it,\" and that guides your allocation decisions. But the concept is, a disruptive company will look at where the market is headed, and is not as subject to their own customers or their existing investors telling them how to spend that money.I have an example for it. Is it OK if I throw in an example? Drop an example, absolutely! One of the great examples -- we have a lot of these on our scorecards from The Motley Fool -- it's Netflix. Netflix, as you and I discussed before the show, had a very profitable DVD-by-mail business. Reed Hastings, of course, went out and said, \"Guys, I think the future is in online streaming. I'm going to get a lot more data about what shows people are watching and build this recommendation engine.\" And a lot of people thought he was crazy for spending money on a market that really didn't exist yet. But he, in essence, disrupted his own business, and it's proved very profitable in the long run for Netflix. Yeah, and you hear a lot of businesses talk about how you want to cater to the customer, and deliver what the customer wants. There are a lot of instances where the customer doesn't know that they want something until it's available. Then, it's \"How do I live without this? What am I going to watch on Saturday night if I can't stream Netflix?\" And that's something that wouldn't have even been a thought 10 years ago. Sometimes, companies have to be willing to anticipate what people want rather than respond directly to it. Very true, both of those. On top of that, what is available in the market at the time? Until people really had high-speed broadband internet, streaming movies over the internet was almost impossible. When that enabled digital streaming, Netflix really took off. It was in the right place at the right time. I see No. 2: Small markets don't solve growth needs. You want to elaborate on that a little bit? Say that you're  , you're Warren Buffett. Buffett has famously said that he can't go after small fish anymore. He can't go after small-cap companies as investments because they're just not going to move the needle for Berkshire Hathaway. He has multiple hundreds of billions of dollars in divested capital that he has to go after the  s  and the IBMs as investments. It's the same thing with businesses. If you're wildly successful, doing $100 billion a year, you have to find a market that's existing today that's a $10 billion market for you to grow 10%. A $100 million company just has to have $10 million to do the same thing.Disruptive companies, a lot of times, will look at markets that big companies are not looking at. The example for this one is a  ' recommendation,  (NASDAQ: UBNT) , that's setting up wireless access points to get onto the internet. When you think about the internet service providers we've typically had, they lay a lot of cable, they go and want to dominate a market. Maybe if you have an apartment complex in the D.C. area, you're locked into one certain provider. I know that game very well. Huge costs, huge sales forces like to go in and dominate areas. Ubiquiti has no direct sales force, and very little marketing costs. They basically have customers come to them and say, \"Hey, I would really like this kind of product spec. Can you build it for me and tell us how much we'll pay for it?!\" It's been really successful in universities and sports stadiums and emerging markets. A very, very profitable business. Yeah. Very interesting. No. 3, moving along: Markets that don't exist can't be analyzed. I think this might be one of the most interesting points that we'll raise during this show. It's my favorite of the five, actually. Can I ask you, how did he come up with the name  ? Do you know what that actually refers to? I don't. It's an interesting thing.  is, if you want to get into something new, you don't have the data to support that decision, necessarily, because it's new. You don't know if it's going to work or not. So, the idea is, you're working on a hunch and not much more, in some cases. Yeah. It would be a no-brainer if all the data told you, \"Hey, this new market that nobody's going into is going to be wildly successful.\" You don't get that. You have to jump out there ahead of the pack. And, in fairness, if the data suggested it, everyone would be doing it. Exactly. So, that's the beauty of  . It's always forward-looking, it's not looking at financial ratios. A lot of what Wall Street lives and dies by is things like margins, return on equity, return on invested capital. This is always a framework looking forward. Even something like addressable market, which is something that we like to look at when we can, but if you don't even know what a market is going to look like, or what the scale of a technology might be, it's kind of a Fool's errand to even put a number on it. Exactly. And let's go back in time to 2004, 2002 -- social media, social networks, Facebook is the example for this one. This was something that most people didn't understand. You had MySpace and a couple others trying to figure this out out there. But Facebook was so far ahead of the game of the larger competitors in the traditional space that they learned a lot more about what people wanted to do on social networks, then they collected that data and did targeted advertising. Of course, now, it's a more than $300 billion market cap company. I will say, I saw an interview that Zuckerberg did recently with the founder of  Y Combinator. He asked him, \"What was one of the tougher things you experienced as CEO and in the development of Facebook?\" And he said \"People not seeing the vision that I see.\" These weren't external folks. These were people that were internal employees, members of the management team, that were disappointed when Facebook decided to shun early buyout offers.He saw this huge potential to get beyond colleges, to become this huge platform that connects everybody, and they didn't. And a lot of them actually left when they decided to reject that buyout offer. So, this is not something that's limited to your average investor or mom and pop at home. This is something that even people in the space might not be 100% capable of grasping market size. And just like you said, it has to be the right person. You have to have the right vision, and not somebody that's leading you in the completely wrong path that maybe they think is the future of the business that really isn't. Good point on that. And even beyond the platform itself, we can look at the idea of, markets that don't exist can't be analyzed, or can't be totally grasped -- with Facebook, in the context of its pivot to mobile. A lot of people were pretty skeptical of Facebook's ability to monetize mobile audiences when they saw that that's where the majority of web traffic was going. Clearly, it's worked out for Facebook. They, basically, quintupled in value as they've really successfully pivoted to mobile. Now, mobile makes up, I think 84% to 85% of their total revenue take. So, this is not even necessarily something that is limited to when a company is first starting out. It can be something that, similar to the idea of streaming video with Netflix, happens as a company sees opportunities, and maybe leaves some of the market behind because they don't. Yeah. It turns out, interesting as this might be, that predicting the future is actually pretty hard. It's not so easy to have a crystal ball and say, \"We're going to put billions of dollars behind this new market that doesn't exist yet.\" A story I love to tell when talking about this is back in the year 1980,  hired McKinsey to do a study of how many U.S.-based cellphone subscribers they thought there would be by the year 2000. 20 years in the future. Put yourself back in 1980, say, \"There's this new thing called a cellular phone. How many subscribers do you think it could possibly reach by the year 2000?\" Any shot on what the estimate was? Do you have any idea what the population was back then, so I can kind of anchor to it? You know, I'm going to say 40 million. Good guess. The actual estimate that McKinsey -- one of the best consultants in the world at the time, keep in mind -- they said it would be about 900,000 people. Wow! The actual number by the year 2000 was 109 million, just in the United States. It just shows how hard it is to look even five years in the future, and predict where the market is going to head. But you do have to look, at some point, at smaller companies that are going in a path that everyone else is not going in. I think that segues very nicely into No. 4 on our five-point principle list here. Capabilities define disabilities. I think this plays into the idea of smaller companies maybe being able to be a little bit more nimble, and there being a certain stodginess with being a larger company, and being a little bit more fully formed. Yeah, that's right. It's kind of an interesting way, how you can define culture in a bunch of different ways. But one way to possibly define culture is how decisions get made at a company. There's typically certain metrics that in the boardroom of a business, managers and bigwigs of the companies, are using to base whether a decision is good or bad. Does this bring in a certain amount of cash flow? Is this a good return on our investment today? Do we have customers lined up that are ready to do this kind of stuff?That's interesting because those capabilities, how a business is making decisions, its culture, and how it's deciding on things, can actually handicap it in looking at all of the stuff we're talking about today. An example of this is the large regulated utilities. When utilities spend billions of dollars to build a new power plant, they mandate a certain return on equity and a return for their investors that they can pass along to shareholders. It's heavily regulated by the states. That's how business is done. These are huge decisions.Then, you have this small, scrappy company called  . Oh, I think I've heard of them. Maybe a time or two before. One of my favorite companies -- apparently  also like them, they're trying to acquire them right now. Yeah, Elon Musk seems to really like them. That's right. They said, \"It doesn't have to be this way. If you can figure out how much electricity one house needs, you can size a solar panel on the rooftop and have that produce all of the electricity you need for that one house. You can size those accordingly.\" And if people pay on a monthly basis for that power, you don't have to put up the $20,000 to $30.000 to build it yourself. Totally disruptive idea. Didn't have the same metrics they were using to make decisions, because they weren't building these giant power plants. A very disruptive company to the energy industry. Yeah, and that is a little bit of an inside example, one that maybe needed to know the industry a bit better, understand how it works, to fully grasp. I think, to go back to Netflix, they're another example of a company that, even by name, shows that they weren't limited to the business structure that they had when they first started.I've heard David Gardner make this point before, and it's a very bright one -- they're called Netflix. They were not called  . That would have been redundant. But, they weren't tethered to this idea of being a by-mail company. They were a digital company that pivoted when they saw the opportunity. And their name suggested that. So, that's tougher to recognize, but something to keep in mind. I don't know how many examples will show themselves like that. There are different ways that businesses indicate, I think, their flexibility and how nimble they are. Any indicator you can find there can be helpful in looking for some of these more disruptive companies. And David has many times called Reed Hastings the smartest guy in any room that he's in, which is a telling sign of exactly what you said, that he saw changes in the industry to take advantage of. Yeah, I certainly wouldn't fight that. Our last one here, No. 5: Technology supply versus market demand. You want to dive into that one? Yeah. A lot of times, companies get really excited about their technology, and try to push it to the limit. They say, \"We have the greatest-in-the-industry widget that's going to do something 10 times better than you even need it to do in the first place,\" which sounds great, but it's actually completely inefficient. You want a technology to meet the market's demand, and do exactly what the market is asking you to do. Otherwise, you're probably spending way too much money of your [research and development] efforts on developing something that isn't even needed in the first place.The trick is to see, what is it that your market wants your industry to do? What is the value that you're bringing to your customers? What are they asking you for, and how can you hit that right in the sweet spot so you're not overspending or underinvesting, but going right after what they're asking you to do? I'm curious what you think about applying that type of approach to Tesla. They started with a very elite, luxury product. The difference is, they went small market first and created an excellent product, reached the high-value markets, then slowly have decided to make it more accessible, build out their scale. Would you say that might be an example of a company being limited in the scope of technology, and maybe not spending as much in R&D as they would have, had they been more ambitious, but doing it in a smart way? Interesting example. Actually, electric vehicles were talked about in Christensen's original book in '97. That's early on. Exactly, right? I think Tesla, early on, was more about the brand than the car and its performance. They really went after the highest end so they could start at the top of the market, and get everybody to want a Tesla, that all the movie stars like Leo DiCaprio had. And if you had a Tesla at the mid-market, or the lower end, one that was affordable, you were buying into a luxury vehicle. I mean, it's a Tesla, this thing is awesome. Even though it might have cost, I think the next one is supposed to be $35,000, the Model 3.The one I like, Dylan, is actually a company called  (NASDAQ: SPLK)  that can just look at a ton of data out there and distill it down into a very simple dashboard for their customers to understand. Examples of who they're working with -- the San Francisco 49ers -- Oh! I was not expecting a sports example! Yeah! What Cokes and what hot dogs people are buying in different sections, maybe they can market to them.  uses Splunk to know what, regionally, is selling better. If the jalapeno pineapple pizza is only selling in Cleveland, Ohio, then maybe you go after more marketing there. I have a feeling it's not Cleveland, Ohio, for jalapeno pizza. I know Sean O'Reilly, host of the  show, has one of the blandest palates I've come across at The Fool, and he's from Ohio. You might have to ask him if he would eat it, pineapple jalapeno pizza. I'll follow up with him after the show. OK. Probably not the best example on my part, then. But, the idea being, they're teasing out insights from data, and helping businesses make smarter decisions. Yeah. And if you're in a board room, maybe you're a CEO, you're a decision-making manager, you don't want a whole lot of data that doesn't mean anything to you. You want to say, \"OK, what is this going to matter to me?\" And Splunk does a great job of distilling all of that down, and saying, \"What are you trying to accomplish? Let's look at what the data is telling us, and let's move forward from that.\" Again, hitting the sweet spot. What is the market demanding? What do they want your product to do? Companies going out with the technology to achieve that. Yeah, I think sometimes you can overdeliver on the tech side or the capability side, and it's just extra. Or, your customers aren't seeing the value, and you've spent all this time and ramp up getting it there and it might not even be a very useful feature or add-on. So, definitely something to keep in mind. Absolutely. So, those are our five points. Anything else on the topic of innovation or disruption that you want to give for listeners here, Simon? I guess, to wrap it all together, Dylan, there's only three points that I try to have as my key takeaways when we're looking at disruption.The first is, how does the industry define value? What is it important that your company needs to achieve that is valued by your customers? That's a really hard question to answer, especially for markets that don't exist. That's one of the keys of whether your company is successful or unsuccessful -- are you correctly going after the things your customers want you to be going after? If you're achieving them, there's a high likelihood that you will be a disruptive, successful company.The second one is, what is the position of the incumbents? What is going to be their reaction to what you are doing? Are they going to come in and just crush you and do it better, because they already have an established process? Or, is there truly something that's keeping them from pivoting to what you're trying to do?And then, the third one, I always say is, who's in the captain's chair? Who's the leader? You were talking about Mark Zuckerberg, or Reed Hastings. Who's making these decisions, and are they valuing the future of the company? Or are they just looking backwards? And that plays a huge role in whether it's successful or not.So, those are my three key takeaways for disruption. Yeah. These different principles we outlined are great, but they're only as good as they're eventually being an end customer, or not being an \"a-ha\" moment from a big company, and then just coming in and squashing them. I think those are good things to keep in mind, and nice caveats to have. Simon, you've obviously drawn quite a bit of inspiration from Clayton Christensen. I understand that you're going to be interviewing him. Yes. Later this month? Next month, October. OK. I know he's written some other books. He has another book coming out. Do you want to talk about that a little bit? He does, he has another book coming out right now. I don't believe it's been published yet, so I don't want to talk too much about it. But keep in mind, he has influenced all of this thinking. I think he's just a real visionary guy, very forward-looking guy, an author, started as a Harvard Business School professor, still teaching there today in addition to writing books and influencing business leaders.We're really looking forward -- I can't tell you how excited I am about this interview. We're going to be posting it all over our sites. It's definitely going to be influencing our  service and our  services. But really, for anybody that's a growth-minded investor, I think this is something you at least have to keep an eye on and be aware of. So, folks who are looking for some more information on this, stay tuned. I will probably steal Simon again and have him talk about the interview that he did with Clayton Christensen, as a little follow-up, in a month and a half or so. But, if you're interested in learning more, I would certainly read  , and I would check out his other books. That's another great place to jump off and dive into this topic a little bit more.

Fresh off the  firing from the  (NYSE:  ), Iacocca did whatever it took, including creating the now ubiquitous minivan, to revive the fortunes of the Motor City's No. 3 carmaker.This is the stuff that legends are made of.On the brink, down and out, struggling to survive, Jobs and Iacocca will always be viewed as great leaders despite their human failings. At a time when we give thanks, it's important that we remember their great work. Who are the turnaround messiahs of today? Those CEOs whose companies are losing money, but are one big break away from salvation.During Thanksgiving week, it's appropriate that we consider seven feast or famine stocks to buy.It's been a little more than a year since the data storage company went public, and even though  (NYSE:  ) proclaimed at the time to have the fastest growth in  PSTG stock has floundered, down  since its Oct. 5, 2015, IPO.Big Data is a huge deal, so it's certainly playing in a potentially explosive segment of the technology sector. Unfortunately, when you have enterprises continuing to debate how to store all their information, you never know if you're one hit product away from success or failure.Since launching its FlashArray product in 2012, Pure Storage has racked up more than $600 million in operating losses over 42 months. Yet, you can't help but be impressed by its revenues, which have grown tenfold in the past two years alone. In the second quarter of 2016, PSTG increased revenues  year-over-year to $163.2 million, growing its customers by 107% year-over-year to more than 2,300.The big news: It began shipping FlashBlade, its follow-up product to FlashArray. Despite the significant operating losses it's racked up, PSTG could finally deliver the promise so many believed it had coming to market last October.With the stock down 13 months after going public, now is the time for it to really break out. FlashBlade could be just the ticket to make that move happen.The serial acquirer of transportation and logistics businesses - more than a dozen acquisitions since 2011 - including Con-way Inc., which it acquired last year for  - recently sold Con-way's truckload business to Canadian trucking firm  (OTCMKTS:  ) for $558 million in a move to reduce the $5 billion in debt taken on to make all of these acquisitions.Not a pivotal piece of Con-way's business, TransForce's offer was simply too good to pass up.If you thought Pure Storage was a big revenue grower,  (NYSE:  ) is out of this world, having growing its revenues from  in 2011 to a top ten global transportation and logistics company with  in revenue through the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 and estimated full-year revenues of more than $15 billion.Most importantly, XPO generated free cash flow in Q3 2016 of  and expects to be free cash flow positive for the entire year. Amazingly, it's got a good chance to reach its adjusted Ebitda goal of $1.6 billion by fiscal 2018. And only seven years after CEO Bradley Jacobs and investors put  into XPO, then called Express-1 Expedited Solutions, to gain majority control. Today, Jacobs Private Equity owns approximately 15% of XPO's shares and 23% of the votes.On the precipice of making money, XPO Logistics shareholders can expect more good things to happen with Jacobs at the helm.How you view  's (NASDAQ:  ) latest quarter depends on whether you're a glass half-full or glass half empty type of person. The maker of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems announced its  earnings Nov. 1; it lost 22 cents per share on $148.6 million in revenue.If you're a half full kind of person, you'll view its 41% year-over-year increase in revenue and 55% reduction in its quarterly loss to $18.6 million, as real progress towards sustainable profitability. If you're a half empty person, in the red is in the red, no matter the number. Working on bringing its CGM systems to the diabetes world since 1999, DexCom has yet to make a profit, but whose revenues will likely hit $1 billion within the next five years. If hope were all you needed to make money on a stock, DexCom would be at the top of anyone's list.DexCom's argument when it comes to managing diabetes is that intermittent, finger-stick glucose monitoring isn't enough. Patients tend to spend a great deal of their day outside a healthy glycemic range between  for every deciliter of blood. So, constant monitoring is the better alternative.There are three million insulin intensive patients in the U.S. - 30 million patients if you include T2 non-insulin and non-intensive patients - and only a small percentage of those patients are using CGM. Despite intense competition from  (NYSE:  ), DexCom continues to improve its gross margins and generate free cash flow, a key ingredient to most successful and profitable businesses.Good things are just around the corner.Earlier this year,  (NASDAQ:  ) stock traded in the low $30s, a level not seen since early 2013. If you were lucky enough to have bought SPLK stock at those prices you've done well, because it's doubled in value since then.What happened to reignite the analyzer of big data?Like many software companies, it's in the middle of transitioning from software licenses to the cloud. That transition's been anything but smooth in terms of both top- and bottom-line growth. In early February, as some other cloud companies delivered disappointing  , Splunk stock went splat in sympathy with those stocks.However, the downward trend was short-lived.Splunk  Q1 2016 earnings in late February that were much better than analyst expectations. And SPLK stock was off to the races, gaining 12% in March alone. But now analysts fear the move to the cloud has become a big headwind to Splunk's historical growth - revenues have grown  in past five years - and expect its Q3 2016 results to be a big disappointment leaving SPLK stock to flounder once more.Splunk Cloud uptake will limit upside and expect  MKM Partners' analyst Kevin Buttigieg recently said about Splunk's upcoming Q3 earnings. \"While investors had understood that the transition to the cloud could have a negative effect on margins, they are now grappling with its negative effect on top-line growth as well.\"Still not making money on an annual basis, but generating positive free cash flow, SPLK stock might be expensive at 10 times sales, eventually, the opportunities in Big Data analytics will pay handsomely. Splunk included.The maker of 3D modeling software made the decision to transition to a subscription-based business model from a licensed-based one back in  . As part of that transition, it's accepted operating losses, as the price it has to pay to remain competitive.Since 2013,  (NASDAQ:  ) operating profit has disappeared going from $305 million, or $1.32 per share, in fiscal 2013 to a company projected loss of at least $608 million, or $2.74 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, it's less painful, with an estimated loss of between 55 cents and 70 cents per share. But it's a loss nonetheless.The subscription model, when done well, can lead to higher revenue and profits.  (NASDAQ:  )  to a subscription-based model starting in 2013, operating profits went from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2012 to $413 billion in fiscal 2014 - then the turnaround took hold. Adobe will likely generate operating profits of  or more in fiscal 2017, with operating margins returning to historical norms.The big problem for Autodesk: It needs to speed up the transition. Adobe's subscription revenues really took off over the past two fiscal years -  in 2013 to $3.2 billion in 2015 - while maintaining operating expenses at the same level. Over the past two years, Autodesk's subscription revenues have increased by  or about 20%. It has got to do better.Keep the faith, ADSK shareholders. A couple of figures in its Q2 2016 report provide hope.First, new model annualized recurring revenue increased  in the second quarter to $371 million. That's a sign customers are slowly getting on board. The second sign things will get better is deferred revenue - up 23% to $1.5 billion in Q2 - the subscription fees to be paid in future months in order for customers to continue to use the software.If these two keep going up on a quarterly basis and at a decent clip there's no reason why it too can't generate record profits just like Adobe.Are you starting to sense a pattern here? It seems all of these cloud companies are growing revenues at a significant pace without much hope for immediate profits or even those on the horizon.  (NYSE:  ) definitely fits into that category.The cloud-based enterprise software company was founded in 2005 and went public in October 2012 at  per share. Trading above $80, IPO investors still holding have done well although WDAY stock has traded in a fairly tight range since April 2014. What's going to get it unstuck?Continue to grow subscriptions while slowing the amounts spent on marketing and product development which accounted for about  of its Q2 2016 operating expenses. Cut both of those by 25% while increasing subscription revenues by 30-40% per quarter and presto, you've got significant operating profits, not losses.Financially, Workday's business is getting stronger. Its trailing 12-month free cash flow is $178.1 million or about  of its revenue over those same 12 months. Adobe's current trailing 12-month free cash flow is  of revenue. Clearly, WDAY has work to do (no pun intended) but it's getting there.As it continues to win  customers in both the human capital management and financial segments, many of whom are global powerhouses, WDAY should gain pricing power as its customers become attached at the hip to its cloud-based products.When that happens, and it will, and Workday continues to maintain control over its expenses, the margins will go through the roof. And so will WDAY stock.It's hard to believe but  (NASDAQ:  ) actually made a profit in the third quarter, its first in more than three years. More importantly, it generated  in free cash flow from the production of 25,185 vehicles. Its business is getting profitable just in time to begin producing the Model 3, Tesla's version of the commuter car.Orders for new Model S and Model X vehicles were up 68% in Q3 while actual production jumped 92% year-over-year. Tesla expects to deliver 50,000 new vehicles from June 2016 through the end of the year with slightly more than half that number in Q4.So, although Tesla generated its first profit in a long time and business is looking up, it's still going to lose in the order of $800 million in 2016, a substantial amount. Not to mention its profit only came after a $139 million in California zero emission credits which are almost  pure profit.CEO Elon Musk has rolled the dice merging  for  figuring the two businesses go together like peanut butter and jelly. It remains to be seen whether his vision will be correct. What we do know is they'll both require a lot of cash until the potential synergies can be effectively - and profitably - exploited.Of all the seven feast or famine stocks, Tesla is easily my favorite.

This is something that should also serve Splunk well by giving its employees a greater sense of loyalty and purpose.In the end, I agree with Splunk's assertion that \"big data can make a difference,\" to both the world and investors who want to own a piece of this socially responsible business. : The home improvement and construction industry can be very wasteful, generating huge amounts of material that ends up in landfills every year, and a slew of chemicals ranging from solvents to paints to sealers that can be difficult to dispose of. Trex Company is making a positive impact on one area of home improvement with its wood alternative decking material.Image source: Trex.Trex is the market-share leader in wood alternative decking, making its product from a combination of recycled polyethylene plastic and wood, leading to an end product that's 95% recycled content. There's even more benefit, because Trex's decking is designed to last significantly longer than traditional wood decking, and it also doesn't need the annual waterproofing or staining that wood decks require in order to stand up to Mother Nature. Not only does this save the homeowner money and time, but it's a far more environmentally friendly way to improve your home.For investors, Trex's financial performance has been incredible. Since the beginning of 2013, revenue has increased 50%, earnings per share have gone up a whopping 3,150%, and the share price has more than doubled. And there's plenty of reason to see Trex continuing to make for a fantastic investment.The company may be the market share leader with over 40% of alternative wood decking sales, but it only accounts for about 6% of total decking sold in North America. In other words, there's huge room for the company to grow its market share for years.Put it all together, and Trex is a wonderful company to invest in, and it also is making a positive impact on the environment.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

As just one example, roughly 90% of the world's data has been created in just the past two years alone, according to  .To manage this explosion of data, a new crop of publicly traded  has come to market in recent years, many of them relatively new IPOs. Big data stocks like  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  (NYSE: CRM) , and  (NYSE: WDAY) offer ways to invest in the long-term growth of the big data industry.\n  \nData source: Google Finance.These names each tap into the power of big data, some in obvious and direct ways and others in more subtle ways. However, in total these companies offer a useful snapshot of the varied and important ways software companies are harnessing the power of big data to help drive their business results.Though it might sound flimsy, big data powerhouse Splunk's business is to make something out of nothing -- or perhaps to say it more precisely, to yield insight when once there was none. As a bit of background, conventional data analytics platforms as we commonly know them rely on what's referred to as structured data, sets of information that have already been organized in some way -- think the market capitalization figures above, which are already organized around a central theme. That's structured data. However, the software that Splunk licenses to its customers operates further upstream in a company's digital reporting efforts, taking unstructured data -- the unorganized and disorganized digital noise produced by connected devices -- and parsing it for insight.It's a tremendously hard technological task, and Splunk's leadership position has already earned it a legion of customers and the enviable moniker of \"the Google of the Internet of Things.\" Much like the Big G, though, Splunk's budding empire will take some time to fully establish itself. As is common with similar growth companies, Splunk remains unprofitable at present, but it continues to grow sales like a weed.Revenue is expected to rise 36% this year and 28% next year, by which point the analyst community expects the company to have reached regular profitability. Looking further into the future, Splunk's earnings per share is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 38% over the next five years. It's easy to get turned off by Splunk's admittedly aggressive valuation -- 9.7 times LTM sales and 117 times NTM EPS -- but Splunk's overall business opportunity and leadership within its market make it a strong contender to grow into and beyond its valuation today.Cloud software giant Salesforce.com might not seem like an obvious big data play. However, as is happening throughout the cloud software industry, Salesforce has moved quickly to integrate big data functionalities into its suite of products.Salesforce is best known for pioneering cloud-based software for corporate sales teams, known as customer relationship management (CRM) software in industry parlance. The company has in more recent years added a suite of other software offerings aimed at addressing other business verticals. Today, four main reporting segments drive Salesforce's revenue -- sales cloud (43% of sales), service cloud (29%), app cloud (17%), and marketing cloud (11%). None of these offerings explicitly deals with big data, but that is changing in important ways for both Salesforce and the broader industry.Last May, the company launched its Salesforce Analytics Cloud platform to help integrate big data into its broader software offerings. The platform leverages AI and machine learning to parse data from a company's connected data sources to uncover trends that might otherwise go overlooked and recommend the most productive actions for sales and marketing teams. In this way, though Salesforce isn't a pure-play big data firm, it stands as a useful counterpoint to the likes of Splunk as an example of the way cloud software platforms are increasingly turning to big data to drive value for their customers, a trend further exemplified by Workday.At its core, cloud HR and finance platform Workday might not seem like a big data play either. However, big data remains very much a part of Workday's mission to dominate the back office's cloud computing future.Founded by software industry veterans, Workday's two best-known areas of operation are its cloud-based HR and finance software products. Though this area has become more diverse in terms of the actual software providers and the kinds of companies to which they cater, Workday explicitly aims to sell its products to large organizations like  and  . This strategy has helped fuel explosive growth: Workday's revenue has grown roughly 1000% since 2012, and the company's customer-centric business model should help cultivate strong recurring revenue, subscriber retention, and eventually profitability in the coming years.In terms of Workday's big data chops, the company has continued to emphasize adding big data and analytics capabilities to its suite of services. In 2012, Workday unveiled its original Big Data Analytics toolkit. The cloud-based big data platform aimed at serving HR and finance departments integrates Workday's applications with other third-party enterprise software to -- as the company phrased it -- \"make more informed business decisions based on a holistic view of worker and financial information.\" The company has continued to add to its big data capabilities via acquisition as well, acquiring operational analytics and data discovery start-up Platfora this summer, as just one example.As you can see, big data is impacting tech companies both new and old, and we've only witnessed the beginning of this big-ticket trend. Thankfully, there are any number of ways investors can cash in on this increasingly important trend, as the examples above demonstrate.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

And, they give an example of one disruptive company that's helping companies across the world target their audiences more effectively today.Check out Simon's five principles that are based on Clayton Christensen's  :No. 5: Technology Supply Versus Market DemandA full transcript follows the video.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . No. 5: Technology supply versus market demand. You want to dive into that one? Yeah. A lot of times, companies get really excited about their technology, and try to push it to the limit. They say, \"We have the greatest-in-the-industry widget that's going to do something 10 times better than you even need it to do in the first place,\" which sounds great, but it's actually completely inefficient. You want a technology to meet the market's demand, and do exactly what the market is asking you to do. Otherwise, you're probably spending way too much money of your [research and development] efforts on developing something that isn't even needed in the first place.The trick is to see what is it that your market wants your industry to do? What is the value that you're bringing to your customers? What are they asking you for, and how can you hit that right in the sweet spot so you're not overspending or underinvesting but going right after what they're asking you to do? I'm curious what you think about applying that type of approach to  . They started with a very elite, luxury product. The difference is, they went small market first and created an excellent product, reached the high-value markets, then slowly have decided to make it more accessible, build out their scale. Would you say that might be an example of a company being limited in the scope of technology, and maybe not spending as much in R&D as they would have, had they been more ambitious, but doing it in a smart way? Interesting example. Actually, electric vehicles were talked about in Christensen's original book in '97. That's early on. Exactly, right? I think Tesla, early on, was more about the brand than the car and its performance. They really went after the highest end so they could start at the top of the market, and get everybody to want a Tesla, that all the movie stars like Leo DiCaprio had. And if you had a Tesla at the mid-market, or the lower end, one that was affordable, you were buying into a luxury vehicle. I mean, it's a Tesla, this thing is awesome. Even though it might have cost, I think the next one is supposed to be $35,000, the Model 3.The one I like, Dylan, is actually a company called  (NASDAQ: SPLK) ,  that can just look at a ton of data out there and distill it down into a very simple dashboard for their customers to understand. Examples of who they're working with -- the San Francisco 49ers -- Oh! I was not expecting a sports example! Yeah! What Cokes and what hot dogs people are buying in different sections, maybe they can market to them.  uses Splunk to know what, regionally, is selling better. If the jalapeno pineapple pizza is only selling in Cleveland, Ohio, then maybe you go after more marketing there. I have a feeling it's not Cleveland, Ohio, for jalapeno pizza. I know Sean O'Reilly, host of the  show, has one of the blandest palates I've come across at the Fool, and he's from Ohio. You might have to ask him if he would eat it, pineapple jalapeno pizza. I'll follow up with him after the show. OK. Probably not the best example on my part, then. But, the idea being, they're teasing out insights from data and helping businesses make smarter decisions. Yeah. And if you're in a board room, maybe you're a CEO, you're a decision-making manager, you don't want a whole lot of data that doesn't mean anything to you. You want to say, \"OK, what is this going to matter to me?\" And Splunk does a great job of distilling all of that down, and saying, \"What are you trying to accomplish? Let's look at what the data is telling us, and let's move forward from that.\" Again, hitting the sweet spot. What is the market demanding? What do they want your product to do? Companies going out with the technology to achieve that. Yeah, I think sometimes you can overdeliver on the tech side or the capability side, and it's just extra. Or, your customers aren't seeing the value, and you've spent all this time and ramp up getting it there and it might not even be a very useful feature or add-on.

The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm's prospects in both the short and long term. | In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have narrowed from a loss of 60 cents per share to a loss of 57 cents per share, while current year estimates have narrowed from a loss of $2.49 per share to a loss of $2.44 per share. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is also a favorable signal. You can see  .So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Splunk.

Of course, not every company that promises growth will actually deliver, which is why investors need to be quite picky about which stocks they choose to buy.To aid you in your search we asked a team of Fools to share a growth stock that they think is a strong buy right now. Read on to see which companies they selected and why. : Low interest rates have been the bane of savers looking to generate more income from their investment portfolios, but they've been a boon to the mortgage industry. Lenders have been able to woo investors with rock-bottom interest rates, spurring successive waves of refinancing activity and stoking a new upward movement in the housing market. For  (NYSE: ELLI) , the new housing boom is a huge positive, because it provides the software platform that an increasing number of financial institutions are using to track and manage their mortgage loan portfolios.In its most recent quarter, Ellie Mae continued its strong pace of growth, with revenue climbing by 37% to send adjusted net income up by more than a third as well. CEO Jonathan Corr pointed to the increasing acceptance of technology to help mortgage lenders handle their business, and the company also boosted its guidance for the remainder of the year. With substantial recurring revenue coming from its Encompass system and new features attracting potential customers, Ellie Mae has developed a smart game plan for future growth. Ellie Mae is in a great position to benefit from what appears to be the new normal of low interest rates for the foreseeable future. : For years  (NASDAQ: BWLD) has posted revenue and profit growth in excess of 20%, which propelled its stock ever high. That growth has been powered by a combination of new store openings and continuous increases in same-store sales as the company's concept has developed a loyal following.However, we've recently witnessed that trend come to an abrupt stop. Although total revenue grew by 15% last quarter, same-store sales  by 2.1% at company-owned restaurants and 2.6% at franchised outlets. That was the second quarter in a row of declining sales, which has caused shares to drop by about 13% over the last year.Image source: GettyMore specifically, shares fell as much as 12% the day after Splunk told investors revenue increased 43.4% year over year, to $212.8 million, and adjusted net income came in at $7.3 million, or $0.05 per share. Analysts, on average, were only looking for adjusted net income of $0.03 per share and revenue of $200.5 million.And it's not as though there was some hidden bad news driving Splunk stock lower. CEO Doug Merritt insisted the quarter was \"solid,\" citing both existing customers expanding their use of Splunk's platform and the addition of over 500 new customers. And new and expanded customer relationships included the likes of  ,  ,  , and Subway. Merritt also described \"increased cloud momentum,\" as Splunk enjoyed a significantly better-than-expected 200% increase in cloud bookings during the quarter. And finally, Splunk increased both ends of its full-year revenue guidance range by $18 million, to a new range of $910 million to $914 million, which was also well above Wall Street's expectations for full-year revenue of $897.5 million.So all things considered, I think Splunk will be just fine as it continues to add new customers and carve out its niche. And for patient investors willing to deal with some volatility along the way, I'm convinced the pop will prove a compelling buying opportunity. : Growth stocks are everywhere, but finding quality growth stocks can take some serious digging. If you're looking to pick up a beat-up but far from broken growth stock in September, my suggestion would be  (NASDAQ: ALXN) , whose shares are down 28% year-to-date.Alexion Pharmaceuticals essentially ran into two brick walls in 2016. First, the beginning of the year sell-off whacked biotech stocks, and they've yet to fully recover. The other issue was its top-line release of data from its late-stage REGAIN study in early June. Within REGAIN, Soliris failed to meet its primary endpoint in refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMC), which essentially meant no label expansion to gMC in the drugs' immediate future. Investors took both events as a reason to sell this high-growth biotech stock.Now here's why you should buy.First, we're talking about a company with a prime focus on rare and ultra-orphan diseases. Focusing on rare-disease drugs means contending with little competition, having plenty of orphan drug protection, and generally having excellent pricing power. For instance, in the second quarter total revenue jumped 18% to $753 million, with Soliris leading the way with 10% sales growth to $701 million. There are still plenty of opportunities for Alexion to deliver organic growth with Soliris, and especially its acquired therapeutic Kanuma for the treatment of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency.Secondly, we've probably witnessed an overreaction to the REGAIN trial results. Though Soliris failed to meet its primary endpoint,  reports that physicians may still opt to use Soliris off-label since no alternative medications currently exist for the rare disease. Furthermore, Soliris did hit its secondary endpoints, all three of them, and narrowly missed the primary endpoint. In the end, Soliris could still see a nice boost from gMC, even if it doesn't get a nod of approval from the Food and Drug Administration.Fundamentally, Alexion is also attractive. Between 2015 and 2019 Wall Street pegs the company to double its sales from $2.6 billion to $5.2 billion, while nearly doubling its full-year EPS from a reported $4.99 in 2015 to a forecasted $9.78 by 2019. Its current PEG ratio of 1.5 suggests modest upside with more aggressive growth possible if Soliris and Kanuma outperform.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Splunk posted a negative surprise of 6.78% in the last quarter. The company has also posted an average negative surprise of 10.13% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Shares of Splunk have been on a downward trend on a year-to-date basis. The stock generated a negative return of 0.82% compared with the Zacks Computer-Software Services Industry gain of 3.82%.Splunk has been strengthening its product pipeline to benefit from the growing data and analytics market. Over the past few years, the cloud and data analytics market has seen strong growth especially in the enterprise domain, which is a positive for the company. Also, the company has been seeing an increase in the numbers of customers. In the last reported quarter, it added 500 customers.However, due to the ongoing transition, the license bookings business will start to slow down. Also, increasing investments in research and development coupled with higher operating costs are anticipated to be a near-term drag on profitability. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins in 2017. For the second half of fiscal 2017, capex is estimated in the range $35 million to $45 million.Also, growing competition from established players such as International Business Machines  , SAP, Amazon and Microsoft  , all of which are vying to get a bigger share of the market, is a concern.For the third quarter, Splunk expects revenues in the range of $228 million and $230 million and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 5% to 6%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Splunk is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

Shares of  (NASDAQ: SPLK) fell as much as 9.8% early Friday, and traded down 8.5% as of 11:00 a.m. EDT despite the operational intelligence software platform company releasing  yesterday after the market close. Quarterly revenue increased 43.4% year over year, to $212.8 million, including 31.5% growth in license revenue, to $115.7 million, and 60.8% growth in maintenance and service revenue, to $97.1 million. Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) -- and keeping in mind Splunk consciously forsakes bottom-line profitability in favor of top-line growth in these early stages -- that translated to a net loss of $86.6 million, or $0.65 per share. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which excludes items like stock-based compensation, Splunk's quarterly net income was $7.3 million, or $0.05 per share.For perspective, Splunk's guidance called for lower revenue of $198 million to $200 million. Analysts, on average, were looking for revenue of $200.5 million and adjusted earnings of $0.03 per share.Splunk CEO Doug Merritt called it a \"strong\" quarter, crediting both the addition of 500 new customers and existing customers expanding their use cases of Splunk's products.Splunk also increased its full-year guidance, telling investors to expect fiscal 2017 revenue of $910 million to $914 million. That's up from Splunk's previous outlook for full-year revenue of $892 million to $896 million, and well above analysts' consensus estimates for revenue of $897.5 million. For what it's worth, this marked Splunk's seventh straight quarterly revenue beat, so perhaps the market is simply accustomed to the company's propensity for outperformance. What's more -- and with the usual caveat that past performance is no guarantee for future success -- note shares also fell around 8% the day after Splunk's equally exceptional  in May, only to climb more than 20% in the ensuing weeks as investors had time to absorb Splunk's results.So, while the market's reaction might not indicate as much today, I think patient, long-term investors should be more than happy with where Splunk stands.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

To be one of them,  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["If you follow the financial media, you've likely noticed that stock prices often react to Wall Street's upgrades or downgrades. The majority of these adjustments are tied to a professional analyst raising or lowering a price target for a particular company, which is based on linear assumptions about performance. This could include statements such as \"sales will increase 10% for seven years,\" or \"earnings per share will grow 5% for a decade.\"As such, it's also expected that a company's stock price will grow linearly over time, which would look something like this:For stable, predictable businesses, there's nothing wrong with these forecasts. Management for companies like  or  might set a budget for how many stores they plan to open in a certain year. The profit stream that flows from each one of them tends to be fairly predictable.This information is also universally available, and most analysts have figured out what to look for in stable companies' earnings calls. The steadiness of their business is already baked into their stock prices. This is why -- major financial crises aside -- you never see Starbucks knock it out of the park in a particular quarter. In fact, the company has  consensus earnings estimates in three of their past four quarters.But for innovative companies in evolving markets, the profit stream is significantly less predictable. Founders and managements are making decisions to gain a foothold in markets that may not even exist yet. Customers are still familiarizing themselves with the new products and figuring out how best to incorporate them into their existing processes. The inputs for Wall Street's spreadsheets have a high degree of uncertainty, which can result in price targets that are all over the place.In short, it almost never works to forecast based on linear assumptions for growth companies.As such, when a growth company \"beats estimates,\" it often does so in spectacular fashion. Once the mass market starts adopting the company's products, sales and profits can shoot up quickly over a short period of time.The accelerated growth phase leads to a company's performance and stock price resembling an \"S curve,\" which looks more like this:If a company reaches the middle section of the S-curve, other investors get more comfortable and jump onboard as well. This tends to push the stock price even higher.This is a phenomenon that is to the advantage of the growth investor. Our goal is to find and buy companies today that exhibit signs of reaching the middle of the S-curve tomorrow.This brings us to a difficult, yet very important question:  It should be performance-related and predictive of future stock returns, yet still be upstream of traditional metrics like earnings or cash flows.The answer lies in a company's business model. If we can figure out where and how a company generates their profits, we can find signs of whether it's on the right track. For example, if a company's profit margins come from the upfront sale of products, it'll need to find a market that desperately needs new solutions and is ready to buy. If the company is selling subscriptions, it'll need to sign up lots of new users and show high retention rates.We can also look for things that are more philosophical than hard-and-fast metrics. Developing competitive advantages -- such as a strengthening network effect or increasing switching costs -- are important to keep the competition at bay. Higher-level questions such as --  (on the web vs television) or  (the convenience of two-day shipping vs lower price) -- are also highly relevant.Let's take a look at a few actual recommendations in our Motley Fool universe, which have reached the middle of the S-curve and produced high returns for long-term investors. (NASDAQ: AAPL) made a name for itself as a personal computer manufacturer. But it was actually the launch of its mobile devices -- like the iPod in October 2001 and the iPhone in June 2007 -- that really cranked up the volume of the stock returns. Apple's meticulous attention toward design, in building the supporting iTunes ecosystem, and getting subsidies from US telecom carriers allowed management to price products at a premium. Investors who recognized the potential impact of this strategy early on have seen a nearly 10,000% gain since 2001. (NASDAQ: NFLX) began by mailing DVDs to members across America for a fixed monthly subscription fee. But it was the launch of its online streaming service  that really drew investors' applause. Broadband internet had finally reached the mass market, which enabled high-definition movies to be streamed instantly, directly into customers' living rooms. With content and infrastructure costs largely fixed, new users could be added at a very low cost. Investors who saw Netflix's growing user base as a sign of surging profits reaped big rewards: The stock is up more than 2,000% since January 2007. (NASDAQ: FB) began as a collegiate social network, which quickly grew its user base as it expanded to additional universities. Users voluntarily provided their interests, which served as the foundation for targeted advertising that provided advertising customers with an excellent return on their investments. Early shareholders who believed in the potential of Facebook's rapidly growing  user base saw great returns, as well. Mobile now accounts for 84% of Facebook's revenue, and the stock is up more than 200% since going public in May 2012.There are other companies who also appear to show signs of approaching the S-curve but haven't seen the story play out just yet. Consider the following as a few additional examples from our  and our Watch List, which we think we're ahead of the curve on. (NASDAQ: ILMN) makes two-thirds of revenue from consumable material sales related to genomic sequencing tests. The number of genomic sequences run globally has increased from 40,000 in all years up to 2013 to 200,000 in 2014 and 600,000 in 2015. We believe this accelerated growth rate will continue -- driven by state-sponsored  and the fight against cancer -- which would result in a high-margin future profit stream for Illumina. (NYSE: VEEV) is a software-as-a-service provider that makes sales and R&D more efficient for the life sciences industry. Veeva's workhorse CRM software has brought more than 400 customers onto the company's platform, including the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. Customers are expanding their licenses to include other products as well, with management guiding for 100% growth this year in \"non-CRM\" products (such as Vault and Network). Successfully upselling an existing customer base is an excellent formula for success and a way to quickly expand margins and shareholder profits. (NASDAQ: SPLK) makes sense of messy data, which is exactly what many companies need these days. Internal and external unstructured data (Splunk's playground) were the two most popular forms of data that organizations planned to collect last year. The company now has 12,000 customers and has nearly a half-billion dollars of deferred revenue. The number of large orders (>$100,000) is also growing, as customers are increasingly opting for Splunk's \"all you can eat\" Enterprise Adoption Agreements.Million Dollar Portfolio advisor Matt Argersinger and I traveled to Austin's  earlier this year, which featured some of the country's most forward-thinking companies. At the event, I'll never forget a quote we heard from  CEO Kevin Plank: I bring that quote up, because you'll notice a common theme in the companies mentioned here. They are all using data to get smarter and to get an edge over their competitors. It's the same strategy employed by  and Google parent company  , who have successfully developed two of the strongest competitive moats in the entire tech world.

(NASDAQ: SPLK) might be able to boast that it provides the world's leading real-time operational intelligence software platform. But the company isn't content hoarding all this high-tech innovation for itself. In a surprising announcement last week, Splunk promised to commit at least $100 million \"to bring technology resources to the world.\"More specifically, Splunk formed Splunk Pledge through its existing Splunk4Good initiative. As part of that pledge, Splunk will donate a minimum of $100 million over the next 10 years in software licenses, training, support, education, and volunteer work to both nonprofit and educational organizations, all with the aim to \"support academic research and generate social impact.\"Splunk CEO Doug Merritt added:First, Splunk Pledge will start with free licenses, training, and support to help nonprofit and educational organizations make the most of their existing budgets \"and deliver on their core missions.\"Then again, that's partly the point of Splunk's operational intelligence platform, anyway. Through Splunk Pledge, according to Splunk's press release, these organizations will not only save on the cost of that software and related training to use it, but also ultimately \"reduce operating costs, improve their cybersecurity posture, streamline IT operations, perform research, analyze diverse data sources, and gain visibility into their infrastructure.\"Also as part of the new initiative, Splunk announced that it will expand the Splunk Academic Program on a global scale. As it stands, the Splunk Academic program already reaches 339 institutions in the U.S., which collectively host over 5 million students through Splunk partner Internet2, an Internet research and education network.Finally, Splunk employees will together dedicate up to 60,000 hours of paid volunteer work each year, supporting \"organizations, causes and social issues they are passionate about.\"But however great its intentions, that $100 million admittedly seems aggressive at first glance for a company that's not only still investing heavily in top-line growth, but also operating at a loss based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Last quarter, for example, Splunk's revenue grew an impressive 43.4% year over year, to $212.8 million, and translated to a GAAP net loss of $86.6 million, or $0.65 per share.However, I've  that Splunk isn't alone in being perfectly content operating this way for now. It's not uncommon for companies in young, high-tech industries to forsake bottom-line profitability in favor of taking market share and increasing revenue in their early stages of their growth. Splunk also typically generates healthy operating and free cash flow each year, and ended last quarter with no debt and more than $1 billion in total cash and investments.What's more -- and even putting aside the fact Splunk won't remain unprofitable forever -- a large chunk of each years' $10 million pledge over the next decade will come in the form of free software. The incremental cost issuing free licenses of that software is relatively small for Splunk, and shouldn't significantly deplete its cash resources. In addition, through volunteerism and training, Splunk should enjoy the harder-to-measure benefits of allowing its employees to use their products for noble causes they care about, which should simultaneously increase morale and reduce employee turnover.Relatedly, there's the matter of watching Splunk simply doing the right thing, which speaks volumes about its culture and admirable long-term goals. For investors looking for a socially responsible business about which they can feel good owning shares, that's why I continue to believe Splunk is worth a look.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Let's take a look at the numbers.Yes, SPLK stock beat earnings. To top it off, SPLK now projects full-year revenues between $910 million to $914 million, well above the consensus for $897 million. Analysts were expecting 3 cents per share on revenues of $200.5 million. Instead, they were treated to per-share earnings of 5 cents on $212.8 million, an increase of 43% year-over-year. Wait \u2026 what?CEO Doug Merritt had this to say in the report:\"We had a solid Q2 and our success continues to come from a combination of our existing customers expanding across multiple use cases and from adding more than 500 new customers. We were pleased to see strength across each of our core markets, the continued adoption of the Splunk platform and increased cloud momentum.\"Perfectly normal for SPLK stock holders to react by selling shares down nearly 9%, right?Turns out investors are pretty bummed about the outlook for Q3, where Splunk anticipates sales in the range of $228 million and $230 million. That's right around the $228.9 million analysts expect. The market expected more, however.Light guidance may've started the fire, but Stifel's Brad Reback  , cutting Stifel's rating on SPLK stock from \"buy\" to \"hold.\" According to Reback, Splunk had a \"solid second quarter,\" but its license upside was a letdown compared to past results. This is despite the fact that Splunk's cloud products nearly doubled YoY.Reback considers the cloud boom as contributing to \"meaningful compression\" in the firm's licensing business, which posted its lowest billing growth in four years. Further, Walter Pritchard from Citi Research believes part of the decline stems from the difficulty in actually  from here on out:\"It appears strong growth trends remain on track as we can qualitatively drive math that adds 12 point of growth in excess of our 26% license bookings growth estimate.

(NASDAQ: SPLK) released fiscal second-quarter 2017 results Thursday after the market close. Though the operational-intelligence software specialist remains unprofitable as it prioritizes top-line growth, it also exceeded revenue expectations for the seventh consecutive quarter, and increased its full-year revenue outlook.More specifically, quarterly revenue grew 43.4% year over year, to $212.8 million, including 31.5% growth in license revenue, to $115.7 million, and a 60.8% increase in maintenance and services revenue, to $97.1 million.Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Splunk generated an operating loss of $83.6 million, good for operating margin of negative 39.3% and a net loss of $86.6 million, or $0.65 per share. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation, Splunk achieved operating income of $8.2 million, operating margin of 3.9%, and net income of $7.3 million, or $0.05 per share.By comparison, as I noted in my  earlier this week, Splunk's guidance called for significantly lower fiscal Q2 revenue between $198 million and $200 million, and adjusted operating margin between 2% and 3%. And though we don't pay much attention to Wall Street's demands, analysts' consensus estimates predicted that Splunk would deliver revenue of $200.5 million and adjusted earnings of just $0.03 per share.Splunk continued to plow resources into both sales and marketing (up 34.4% year over year, to $150.2 million) and research and development (up 39.2% year over year, to $67.2 million). That said, both figures represented a notable deceleration from spending in the two categories last quarter when it raised some analysts' eyebrows because sales and marketing and R&D climbed 42.3% and 50.7%, respectively, year over year.To its credit, Splunk's investments continue to bear fruit.\"We had a solid Q2 and our success continues to come from a combination of our existing customers expanding across multiple use cases and from adding more than 500 new customers,\" explained Splunk CEO Doug Merritt. \"We were pleased to see strength across each of our core markets, the continued adoption of the Splunk platform and increased cloud momentum.\"Among those new and expanded customer relationships in Q2 were the City of Los Angeles, Fruit of the Loom, Hulu,  , Subway,  ,  , and  . On the partnership front, Splunk's platforms were also featured this quarter in  's new Cyber Defense Platform, which integrates Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security with  and Tanium.On the product front, Splunk released Splunk App for AWS 4.2 during the quarter, allowing Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud customers to manage multiple  Web Services accounts and regions seamlessly from one device. In addition, Amazon EC2 Container Service added Splunk's native logging driver to its newest version, simplifying implementation of a comprehensive monitoring solution for running containers -- which are a sort of standardized unit of software development that \"contain\" everything that software applications need to run -- at scale.For the current quarter, Splunk anticipates revenue between $228 million and $230 million -- roughly in line with Wall Street's forecasts -- and adjusted operating margin between 5% and 6%. You can bet, however, that analysts will likely boost their expectations going forward given Splunk's propensity for under promising and over delivering.Finally, for the full fiscal year, Splunk now expects revenue between $910 million and $914 million -- an increase from previous guidance of $892 million to $896 million -- and reiterated its previous outlook for full-year adjusted operating margin of roughly 5%.In the end, this was indeed another strong performance from Splunk as it continues to invest in taking market share and growing revenue in these early stages of its long-term story.

(NASDAQ: SPLK) is set to release fiscal second-quarter 2017 results this Thursday after the market close. With shares of the data analytics company up more than 20% (as of Tuesday's close) on the heels of its  in May, investors won't be too surprised if Splunk makes it seven straight this week.Nonetheless, for perspective, Splunk's guidance calls for fiscal Q2 revenue between $198 million and $200 million, or year-over-year growth between 33.5% and 34.8%. Trending toward the bottom line, Splunk also told investors to expect adjusted operating margin for the quarter to be between 2% and 3%.Perhaps unsurprisingly given its track record -- and while we don't pay much attention to Wall Street's quarterly demands -- analysts' consensus estimates predict Splunk will achieve revenue of $200.5 million (slightly above the high end of guidance) and adjusted earnings of $0.03 per share.Of course, Splunk is about more than just its top and bottom lines. So what else should investors be watching this quarter?First, Splunk typically breaks its results down between license revenue (up 41% year over year last quarter to $101 million) and revenue from maintenance and services (up 57.9% last quarter to $85 million).Looking further down the statements of operations, note that Splunk still isn't profitable based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as it consciously chooses to invest instead in growing revenue and taking market share. As such, expect to see continued aggressive investments in both sales and marketing (up 42.3% to $145.2 million last quarter) and research and development (up 50.7% to $67.4 million).Splunk should also offer color on its global ambitions. Revenue from international operations stood at roughly 26% of Splunk's total last quarter, or a roughly comparable split with the same year-ago period. But going forward, Splunk insists it will keep investing in its international business to continue driving growth on a global scale.Relatedly, we should watch that cash flow remains healthy, namely at or above Splunk's long-term target for maintaining operating cash flow margin of at least 20%. Last quarter, cash flow from operations grew 24.7% year over year to $35.7 million, or 19.2% of total sales. But during the subsequent conference call, Splunk management also reiterated their expectation that full-year operating cash flow will be around 23% of this year's revenue.Splunk will also likely tout evidence that its investments are bearing fruit, both in the form of new product releases and new customers. Regarding the latter, for example, Splunk added more than 450 new enterprise customers in fiscal Q1, bringing its total customer base to more than 11,000, with notable new and expanded relationships including  ,  , and World Bank Group. And based on Splunk's press releases since then, we already know among this quarter's customer wins are an expanded deal with  in early May, as well as a multiyear Enterprise Adoption Agreement with  unveiled late last month.Finally, depending on the gravity of any out- or underperformance this quarter, as well as Splunk's visibility into the second half of the fiscal year, watch for any revisions to Splunk's full-year guidance. As it stands, that guidance calls for fiscal 2017 revenue between $892 million and $896 million, with adjusted operating margin of around 5%. Again, however, Wall Street wants more, with consensus estimates modeling full fiscal year 2017 revenue of $897.9 million.In the end, we'll need to hurry up and wait to hear whether Splunk was once again underpromising with the intention of overdelivering. But barring an unforeseen deceleration in Splunk's growth as it makes the most of these early stages in its long-term growth story, investors are right to hope for more of the same market-beating performance this week.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

That won't necessarily stop the Fed from pursuing its traditionally dovish policy of hesitating before moving rates upward, but it did at least raise a possibility that most investors had discounted almost entirely: A rate hike could come as early as September.The Dow and  finished down modestly, but several stocks performed much worse. Among them were  (NASDAQ: ULTA) ,  (NASDAQ: SPLK) , and  (NASDAQ: ACET) .Ulta Salon fell 6% despite having what many would have thought to be another strong quarter. The beauty specialist said that net sales jumped 22% to nearly $1.07 billion, with an impressive 14.4% rise in comparable sales featuring retail comps growth of 12.6%. The company also raised its guidance for the full fiscal 2016 year, including comps expectations of 11% to 13%, and earnings growth in percentage terms expected to be in the low- to mid-twenties.Yet even with its impressive performance, Ulta Salon didn't manage to satisfy investors' expectations for even stronger growth. Some concerns about rising overhead costs might have given shareholders pause, but more likely is that investors merely took the opportunity to take profits on what has recently been an extremely high-performing stock.Splunk dropped 10% after reporting its second-quarter financial results Thursday afternoon. Even though the company managed to boost sales by 43% during the quarter and topped expectations for earnings, the company's guidance for the third quarter wasn't quite as strong as investors had hoped.Analysts at Stifel raised concerns about Splunk, noting that even though growth from cloud-computing initiatives has been strong, it has also put pressure on the speed at which the overall business is growing its licensing revenue and its billings. In the long run, the emphasis on the cloud might well rule the day for Splunk, but right now investors are having to readjust to the short-term consequences of Splunk's strategic moves in the direction of the cloud.Finally, Aceto plunged 22%. The company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Thursday afternoon, and the maker of performance chemicals and various pharmaceutical ingredients and wellness products said that sales fell nearly 8% during the quarter. Aceto's net income got cut in half, and even on an adjusted basis, substantial declines reflected rising competition in its pharmaceutical business.Although CEO Sal Guccione said that he expects a return to healthier growth in 2017, investors didn't seem entirely convinced, and the CEO's warning that the first half of the new fiscal year would likely be weaker than the second didn't inspire confidence either. Despite some encouraging signs, including an 8% dividend increase to $0.065 per share on a quarterly basis, Aceto's stock will have trouble making substantial gains until the overall industry environment becomes more favorable.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Splunk posted a negative surprise of 16.31% in the last quarter. The company has posted an average negative surprise of 7.46% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Splunk has been strengthening its product pipeline to benefit from the growing data and analytics market. Over the past few years, the cloud and data analytics market has seen strong growth especially in the enterprise domain, which is a positive for the company.However, due to the ongoing transition, license bookings business will start to slow down. Also, the company has been seeing an increase in the numbers of customers. In the last reported quarter, it added 450 customers.However, increasing investments in research and development, coupled with higher operating costs, are anticipated to be a near-term drag on profitability. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins in the near term.Also, growing competition from established players such as International Business Machines  , SAP, Amazon and Microsoft  , all of which are vying to get a bigger share of the market, is a concern.For the second quarter, Splunk expects revenues in the range of $198 million and $200 million and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 2% to 3%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Splunk is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below : Its Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 59 cents. : Splunk carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. | Here is a stock you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dollar Tree, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of + 4.11% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $37.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.90. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.1% return against the $37.50 commitment, or a 3.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to SPLK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $37.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Splunk Inc sees its shares decline 40.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $35.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.90 from $37.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, and highlighting in green where the $37.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $37.50 strike for the 3.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Splunk Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $63.02) to be 50%.

As it has already initiated the divestment process, we believe there can be some impact on the company's business.Moreover, Groupon is investing quite a bit in the transition, which is expected to affect its profits in the near-term. Competition from giants like eBay and Amazon.com  and impending lawsuits are the other headwinds investors need to watch out for. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Groupon is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 7 cents per share. Groupon carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a company that has the right combination of elements, according to our model, to post an earnings beat this quarter:General Dynamics Corp.  has an earnings ESP of +2.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Source: Given the recent disappointment in the cybersecurity space,  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are the only three stocks worth buying at this time.The cyber world is as dangerous as it has ever been. New threats are constantly popping up. There is certainly plenty of business in the cybersecurity world.So how is it that many top cybersecurity stocks are down so much in the past year?Cybersecurity stocks have been a painful reminder that on Wall Street, performance is always relative. According to a new report by  , global cybersecurity spending is expected to exceed $1 trillion from 2017 to 2021.Unfortunately, the market was well aware of the potential market when share prices exploded skyward back in 2014. The growth bar was set so incredibly high for many of these cybersecurity stocks that any subsequent hiccups have been met with intense selling in the market.Even today, the bar is extremely high when it comes to the valuations of some of the top cybersecurity stocks. But this high bar simply means that investors need to be even more careful when choosing the best investments.PANW is one of the most well-known cybersecurity stocks in the market, but it has certainly not escaped the selling pressure in recent months. PANW stock is down 32.6% in the past year and is down 27.3% so far in 2016.Yet despite the market pessimism, Finviz projects 40.9% annual earnings growth for PANW over the next five years as the company takes a large slice of that $1 trillion pie.Growth is the main reason why Goldman Sachs analyst  set a \"buy\" rating on PANW earlier this year. The analyst said that its \"growth-adjusted valuation is compelling given the significant runway ahead in network security and in new markets.\"FTNT stock is also down 19% in the past year. Borges believes traders should be buying on the dip. Borges praised the stock for its improving free cash flow and stable business fundamentals. also reiterated a \"buy\" rating on FTNT earlier this month. The firm said that the company's fiscal 2016 growth goals are well within reach.In addition to analyst blessings, FTNT also has the advantage of business diversification. Some cybersecurity stocks are exclusively network security providers. FTNT can provide virtual and real security solutions in networked, application and mobile environments.SPLK is far from a typical cybersecurity stock, but it may be the single best play on the space.SPLK is mostly known as a big-data company. The company specializes in analyzing, searching, sorting and interpreting machine-generated data.However, SPLK's 2015 acquisition of security company  has allowed SPLK to use its machine data analytics capabilities to detect and eliminate cybersecurity threats.SPLK stock is down more than 19% in the past year, but the company seems poised to be a major player in both big data and cybersecurity for years to come.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["mong the underlying components of the Russell 3000 index, we saw noteworthy  volume today in Harley-Davidson Inc (Symbol: HOG), where a total of 25,689 contracts have traded so far, representing approximately 2.6 million underlying shares.

Simply review the multi-year revenue and income trends of growth stocks you're interested in, or already hold. Not all growth stocks run at losses. Yet many that you'll encounter, at some point in their development, exhibit divergent trends resembling Splunk's.Of course, the goal is for such companies to arrive at a relationship between revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and operational costs, that will turn losses into net income. Once revenue and profits are both moving positively in tandem, it becomes easier to place a common-sense valuation on a stock.In the absence of profits, valuation is more guesswork than science. For now, Splunk investors have to be content with the fact that the company is trading at 4.7 times forward one-year sales, which is nearly triple the 1.8 price-to-sales ratio of the overall market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index.Tantalizing and vexing are two adjectives that describe the paradoxical opportunities available in certain growth stocks, especially in the tech industry.A good illustration is  (NYSE: ANET) , which produces specialized cloud-based networking equipment -- in particular, data-center switches that compete with switches of the much-larger  (NASDAQ: CSCO) . Arista has no problem increasing sales, as well as its profits; both have grown at a rate of approximately 30% during the last trailing 12 months.Yet, with less than $1 billion in annual sales, Arista is essentially a niche company. To invest successfully in Arista Networks, you have to be somewhat knowledgeable about the long-term total addressable market (TAM) for the company's equipment, its prospects vis-a-vis Cisco, and its ability to continue to innovate and sustain an attractive growth rate.For shareholders with both adequate investing chops and a thorough knowledge of the networking sector, this probably isn't a problem. But for those without a comprehensive understanding of the company's basic products, it may be problematic to assess what to do if and when Arista encounters its first significant roadblock to growth. Above, we see perennial growth stock favorite  's(NASDAQ: NFLX) price performance during the last 12 months. Those who have held Netflix for long periods have been richly rewarded: The content company's five-year stock-price return is north of 155%, and over a 10-year period, Netflix has returned a stunning 2,270% to investors.But a hallmark of the most-successful growth stocks is extreme volatility over short periods, as investors and analysts wrestle with just how much of a premium to pay at the moment for the growth attracting the interest in the first place. Bouts of eager buying are succeeded by quick dumping of shares, and these cycles are often driven by an over-fixation on immediate news items that have little bearing on the over-arching, long-term investment thesis.If you bought Netflix 12 months ago, you can certainly understand this, as your capital has fluctuated by more than 50%, only to land at breakeven today.You may agree with me that hate without constructive action is simply self-debilitating, so let's focus on positive ways to make use of the points above.First, we can mitigate some of the valuation ambiguity of growth stocks without current earnings by lining up price-to-sales ratios of stocks within the same industry. When valuation becomes difficult, it never hurts to compare like to like. In the example of Splunk, we can research the price-to-sales ratios of its peers, and gain some context before placing a \"buy\" order.Second, for a growth stock like Arista, which is riding high on a specialized technology, we should take the leap, and become deeply knowledgeable about the company's offerings. In this age of widely disseminated, free information, there's really no excuse not to.We should read trade journals, blogs, and of course, quarterly reports, especially the section required of all corporations by the SEC entitled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis.\" Between these sources, we should be able to understand, in comprehensible English, what exactly a niche company's business proposition is, and how its prospects stand.Finally, after identifying a promising growth stock, we should try our best to stretch out our investment horizon. This helps in weathering volatility, and better, if an investment idea pans out, enables us to maximize the gains the stock is capable of delivering.

The company says the platform can monitor one million events per second and calls Tetration a \"time machine\" for data centers.Tetration pulls information from data center hardware and software sensors and then uses machine learning to analyze the information. One of its key features is that it can look at past events to see what happened, or allow IT professionals to make a policy change and see what would happen if implemented across the entire system.Cisco said in a press release: \"Through continuous monitoring, analysis, and reporting, the Tetration Analytics platform provides IT managers with a deep understanding of the data center that will dramatically simplify operational reliability, zero-trust operations and application migrations to SDN solutions and the cloud.\"Cisco said it will launch the first Tetration platform next month and will offer advanced services, such as guidance on how to optimize policies and application performance within the new platform, soon.This is an important move for Cisco because it furthers the company's ambitions in bringing in more recurring revenue from software and services. says that the analytics and business intelligence space is a $16.9 billion market right now and Cisco is smartly pursuing new ways to grab a larger share of it.This is an important move for Cisco because it furthers the company's ambitions in bringing in more recurring revenue from software and services.  says that the analytics and business intelligence space is a $16.9 billion market right now and Cisco is smartly pursuing new ways to grab a larger share of it.There are certainly other data center analytics offerings on the market, including products from one of Cisco's partners,  (NASDAQ: SPLK) . Splunk's software focuses on analyzing machine-generated data by searching and monitoring data center systems. But Cisco says that Tetration is analyzing information on a much broader scale than other companies can do.Investors should be pleased to see Cisco releasing new products that could potentially broaden the company's recurring revenue. Hardware sales will continue to decline as companies move to cloud computing, and Cisco is trying to expand its services and products to position itself for that change.It's still too early to tell how much of an impact Tetration Analytics may have on Cisco's bottom line, but I think investors should look at the new system as just one small part of a larger services segment Cisco is building.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

(NASDAQ: SPLK) may have technically exceeded revenue expectations for the sixth-consecutive quarter, but don't expect the market to give the operational intelligence specialist a pat on the back for its efforts.More specifically, shares fell around 8% in Thursday's after-hours trading after Splunk revealed quarterly revenue jumped 48% year over year, to $186 million, including a 41% increase in license revenue, to $101 million, and 57.9% growth from maintenance and services, to $85 million. That was also well above the high-end of Splunk's guidance, which called for revenue between $172 million and $174 million.But that also translated to an adjusted operating  of $1.4 million, good for adjusted operating margin of negative 0.7% -- below guidance for adjusted operating margin to be positive at between 1% and 2%. Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Splunk turned in a net loss of $100.9 million, or $0.77 per share. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items like stock-based compensation, Splunk's net loss was a much narrower $2.6 million, or $0.02 per share.To be fair -- and though we don't generally pay much attention to Wall Street's near-term demands -- that adjusted per-share loss was technically in line with analysts' consensus estimates, while revenue came in significantly above expectations of $174.1 million.Splunk CEO Doug Merritt called it a \"solid start to the year,\" elaborating: \"Our product team continued to deliver innovation in Splunk Enterprise 6.4, a new Splunk Cloud release, and new versions of Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk User Behavior Analytics. We will continue to support our customers who are leveraging Splunk as their machine data fabric with increased investments in the Splunk platform, our ecosystem and high value solutions.\"Cash flow from operations rose 24.7% year over year, to $35.7 million, or 19.2% of total revenue, or slightly below the company's long-term target for maintaining operating cash flow margin of at least 20%. After accounting for roughly $3.7 million in property and equipment purchases (down from $6.4 million in last year's first quarter), free cash flow grew 44.1%, to $32 million.Meanwhile, Splunk wisely continued investing to foster growth through sales and marketing (up 42.3%, to $145.2 million), and research and development (up 50.7%, to $67.4 million). Splunk also added over 450 new enterprise customers during the quarter, with notable new and expanded customer relationships including  ,  , the University of Virginia, Clemson University, Chicago Public Schools, U.S. Courts, and World Bank Group.Splunk continued to roll out new and improved versions of its products, as well, including:Splunk also struck a number of strategic deals with channel partners, including an alliance with  to help organizations manage machine data, an alliance with  Enterprise to bring predictive threat detection to enterprise and government agencies, and the formation of a new Adaptive Response Initiative focusing on combating advanced attacks with the best technologies from nine founding industry leaders including Splunk, Carbon Black, CyberArk,  ,  , Phantom, Tanium, ThreatConnect, and Ziften.For the current quarter, Splunk expects revenue between $198 million and $200 million, and adjusted operating margin between 2% and 3%. By comparison, analysts' consensus estimates called for roughly the same second-quarter revenue at $199.4 million, with adjusted net income of $0.03 per share.For the full fiscal-year 2017, Splunk increased its guidance, and now expects revenue to be between $892 million and $896 million, up from its previous outlook for full-year revenue of $880 million. Trending toward the bottom line, Splunk continues to expect full fiscal year adjusted operating margin to be around 5%. Here again, analysts were expecting a more modest raise, with estimates predicting fiscal 2017 revenue of $882.2 million.With that in mind, it seems strange to see shares of Splunk significantly lower in after-hours trading as of this writing. But investors should also keep in mind that Splunk stock had climbed more than 30% in the three months since last quarter's report, including a more than 16% jump over the past two weeks alone. So if anything, considering Splunk didn't absolutely crush expectations per its usual habit, the pullback isn't entirely surprising.However, long-term investors should be content as Splunk continues to consciously forsake bottom-line profitability in favor of successfully driving the top-line higher, and taking market share in these early stages of its growth story.

(NASDAQ: SPLK) is set to release fiscal first-quarter 2017 results after the market close on Thursday, May 26, 2016. And with Splunk stock having rebounded nicely from its February lows following its  three months ago -- but still trading around 8% lower for the year as of this writing -- you can bet the operational intelligence specialist would like to sustain that momentum by making it six straight.But what, exactly, should investors be watching when Splunk's report hits the wires?First, note Splunk's guidance calls for fiscal Q1 revenue between $172 million and $174 million, and adjusted operating margin between 1% and 2%. But given Splunk's history of under promising and over delivering, the market won't be terribly surprised if it outperforms once again.Delving deeper, we should also see Splunk maintain healthy operating cash flow and free cash flow, which is crucial for providing the flexibility for Splunk to continue forsaking bottom-line profitability in favor of investing to drive revenue growth and take market share in these early stages. Last quarter, operating cash flow climbed nearly 50% year over year, to $77 million, representing roughly 35% of revenue. And after accounting for property and equipment purchases during the quarter, notably related to the build-out of Splunk's new office in San Francisco, free cash flow climbed a more modest 2.9%, to $50.2 million, or 23% of sales. For the full-year fiscal 2016, Splunk's operating cash flow rose 49.7%, to $155.6 million, or roughly 23% of revenue. But that was also well above Splunk's stated long-term target for consistently generating operating cash flow margin of at least 20%.Next, look for Splunk to continue investing heavily in both sales and marketing (up 49.9% year over year last quarter, to $161.4 million), and research and development (up 39.7% last quarter, to $66.1 million), both of which are equally important to enabling Splunk to maintain its competitive edge.Splunk will also highlight notable new product launches and announcements from the quarter, including its recently formed Adaptive Response Initiatives unveiled at the RSA Conference 2016 in March. It should also detail new and expanded customer relationships, notably including  's move to  of Splunk Cloud to its Trulia and Retsly brands. As for specific numbers, Splunk added more than 600 new enterprise customers last quarter to end its fiscal year 2016 with over 11,000 customers worldwide, and we should expect to see similar momentum with overall additions this quarter.Finally, depending on the gravity of any top- and bottom-line beat (or miss), investors should keep a close eye on any revisions to Splunk's full-year guidance. Following its beat last quarter, for example, Splunk raised its fiscal 2017 revenue guidance by $30 million, to $880 million, representing growth of roughly 31.7% from fiscal 2016. Splunk also told investors to anticipate fiscal full-year adjusted operating profit of roughly 5%.To be fair, that's only the tip of the iceberg considering some industry analysts peg the current total addressable market for Splunk's products at around $45 billion. And with its competitive win rate hovering around 85% according to CEO Doug Merritt last quarter, this week's report should offer a valuable update in its long-term efforts to secure a healthy share of that market.

Splunk posted a negative surprise of 7.41% in the last quarter. The company has posted an average negative surprise of 7.00% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Splunk has been strengthening its product pipeline to benefit from the growing data and analytics market. Over the past few years, the analytics market has seen strong growth especially in the enterprise domain, which is a positive for the company. In 2015, the company made a couple of acquisitions to enhance its cyber security offerings. It bought Caspida, Inc., a machine learning and analytics services provider, and Metaphor Software, an anomaly and prediction analytics company.However, increasing investments in research and development, coupled with higher operating costs, are anticipated to be a near-term drag on profitability. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins in the near term.Also, growing competition from established players such as International Business Machines  , SAP, Amazon and Microsoft  , all of which are vying to get a bigger share of the market, is a concern.For the first quarter, Splunk expects revenues in the range of $172 million and $174 million and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of negative 1% to 2%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Splunk is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see belowZacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new July 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $46.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $46.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $47.84/share today.Because the $46.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of SPLK stock at the current price level of $47.84/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $48.50.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPLK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

It's always difficult to see success like that ahead of time, but  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are all strong candidates to follow in AMZN's footsteps. AMZN shares several common themes with each of these three stocks. AMZN became such a hit because it was the early market leader in a massive and wide-open field of e-commerce. LC has a similar leadership position in the booming industry of alternative finance.LendingClub is trying to use technology and the internet to disrupt the banking industry the same way that AMZN disrupted the retail business. In recent years, LC's growth has been extremely impressive. According to Finviz, LC's sales have grown at an average annual rate of 119.7% over the past five years. In addition, the company has a projected annual earnings growth of 74.1% over the next five years.LC is also showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Last quarter, LC reported a year-over-year revenue gain above 90%.Despite the massive revenue gains,  reports that online lenders like LC have only captured about 3.3% of the total small business lending market so far and could account for about 20% of the total loan market by 2020. There is plenty of room for growth ahead for LC, and the company's relatively small market share and only $2.9 billion market cap means that the stock's share price could see some major upside if the business stays on track over the next 10 years.Despite concerns over an economic slowdown in China,  (BCG) still projects a $2.3 trillion increase in China's consumer economy by 2020 even if Chinese GDP growth falls well short of current projections. Of course, the closest thing China has to an AMZN analog is  (  ). But with a market cap already nearly $200 billion, a 1,500% gain for BABA might be a bit of a stretch.WUBA, on the other hand, has been described as the \"Craigslist of China\" and is demonstrating the ideal potential long-term upside combination of reasonably small $8 billion market cap, staggering growth and a massive potential market for its services. Last year, WUBA's total revenue climbed 169.8% and its membership revenues surged 153.3% annually in Q4. In the past five years, WUBA has logged annual sales growth of 131.7%, and the company is projected to grow its earnings by 65.4% annually over the next five years.SPLK is yet another company that is a leader in a market with massive long-term growth potential. Splunk specializes in analyzing, searching, sorting and interpreting machine-generated big data. Big data is going to be the key to the future of business. Generating the data is just the first step in the process for companies, and SPLK helps companies efficiently utilize that data to improve their businesses.SPLK's market cap is only $6.3 billion, but its revenue grew 49% last quarter. In the past five years, SPLK has averaged 58.8% sales growth per year, and it is expected to grow earnings by 49.4% annually over the next five years as well.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.86%. Jabil Circuit has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 14.06%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Jabil's top line is expected to be driven by the strong performance of non-traditional sectors, diversity in its revenue channels and a customer base spread across the world. In addition, the company has been seeing strength across most of its end markets like automobile, connected homes, wearables, healthcare, consumer packaging, cloud infrastructure and capital equipment.The company's EMS margins have already started improving owing to the restructuring initiative, which has also resulted in increasing market share.

This apart, intensifying competition, macroeconomic headwinds and increasing investments in diversified manufacturing remain concerns.Jabil expects net revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

But the fact is that NFLX is not worth $42 billion, and chance are  its business to the size of  (  ), which actually supports a relatively similar valuation with its operations.No, NFLX is a growth  , a momentum stock, a company whose lofty valuation is tied to the manner in which it has disrupted the pay-TV industry, and not necessarily its trajectory.Nevertheless, Netflix stock does prove that a company with sustained growth can soar in valuation. And for that reason, investors should always be on the lookout for similar high-growth stocks.If you're looking for a place to start, consider these eight stocks to buy - all of which are growing faster than NFLX. 33% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth:  31% (  ) is one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers in the world, with expected revenue growth of 33% and 31% over the next two years, respectively. While the company operates in many layers of SaaS, its core business is in human resource management (HRM).HRM is a business that has  , and Workday is the fastest growing company in the arena. With just $1.5 billion in revenue expected this year, WDAY is still a fly on the wall in HRM, but over time, its push to bring all human-resource-related operations to the cloud are sure to bring the company higher market share.It is this assumption that explains Workday's $14 billion market capitalization. 28% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 27%Ironically,  (  ) stock recently fell 50% in a single session after it  . That \"light\" guidance still figures revenue growth at a midpoint of 28%, and analysts expect DATA to grow another 27% the year after. (As a note, Wall Street is expecting revenue growth of 29% for Tableau this year.)While the company is not growing at the 50%-plus rate it once was, DATA still is performing just fine. During its last quarter,  , with the number of $100,000 or higher transactions rising 36% year-over-year to 414. Furthermore, Tableau's international business remains a bright spot, growing 63% during its last quarter and accounting for 26% of total revenue.Clearly, Tableau Software is growing much faster than Netflix, and because it is oversold, investors are likely to find much higher long-term upside in DATA than NFLX. 32% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 29%If DATA is the big data stock that Wall Street loves to hate, then  (  ) is the one it loves.SPLK has soared 43% in the past month behind its strong fourth-quarter earnings and outlook for the coming year.The company's guidance implies revenue growth of 32%, and analysts think that SPLK could add another 29% revenue growth the year after. With  and over 11,000 total, SPLK certainly appears to be operating on autopilot.As a result, many research firms like BMO think that SPLK will  billings by 45% this year. Since billings translate to revenue, such growth bodes well for SPLK investors long-term.Frustratingly, Fitbit's financial performance has actually been exceptional, making its downward spiral all the more confusing. Despite three straight quarterly beats on revenue and earnings per share, Wall Street always seems to find something to dislike about Fitbit. 32% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 21% (  ) revenue is expected to grow roughly 32% this year, and more than likely, that figure is well short of how FIT will  perform.Since Fitbit's IPO last year, all the company has done is beaten and raised guidance with each earnings report. Its full-year revenue of $1.86 billion last year was $460 million higher than what analysts and the company expected last July. Further, Fitbit was the  of the holidays,  that 2016 will be yet another breakout year for FIT, and the company  to enter the faster growing smart wearables market.Collectively, there is a lot to like about this fast growing company, and the fact that Wall Street pairs it so closely to the failures of  (  ) makes it all that much more attractive. After all, FIT has given investors no reason to bet against it, yet the stock is down 50% over the past three months.To me, that's a rather good reason to be bullish from here. 33% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 24%Threat prevention leader  (  ) has faced harsh criticism over the past year for its decelerated growth.While FireEye may never again grow 150% or more in a single year, the company maintains an impressive growth rate. For 2016 and 2017, revenue will grow 33% and 25%, respectively.Meanwhile, with FEYE shares down 57% the last year, its stock price is better aligned with the actual performance of its business. That's why low expectations and the company's strategic move toward FireEye-as-a-service (FaaS) could provide an unexpected spark for current owners of the stock.FaaS has only penetrated  , and is already on a $100 million-plus revenue run rate after recently launching.That success gives investors a reason to be excited. 46% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 33% (  ) is the cybersecurity stock that Wall Street favors among the group of next-gen service providers. The company's $1.1 billion in revenue supports a whopping $14 billion market capitalization.The reason is because of its growth. Palo Alto is expected to grow 46% this year and 33% next year. That's impressive, but with PANW's next-generation firewalls being a secondary service among the majority of its customers, there is great upside for Palo Alto to further up-sell its products and services long-term.Yes, PANW might be a little pricey, but then again, cyber crime is a serious threat, and PANW is one of the best at solving the problem.Based on just about every traditional value metric, Facebook stock looks expensive. FB sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 85, a forward P/E of 26 and a price-to-sales ratio in the high teens. 46% Estimated 2017 Revenue Growth: 33%Facebook is the final, and perhaps most impressive, company growing much faster than Netflix.FB is much larger than NFLX, with its revenue expected to top $33.8 billion by the end of next year, which will come via 42% and 33% sales growth over the next couple years, respectively.What's more impressive is that there is no end in sight. Facebook has at least  that can grow the company much, much larger. Furthermore, FB could very well  in the next five years, just off the success and growth of Facebook's core platform and Instagram alone, completely eliminating the potential from WhatsApp and Messenger.With that said, some put FB and NFLX in the same conversation, believing Facebook is too expensive. However,  - once you consider that Facebook is trading at just 26.6 times next year's EPS, yet is projected to grow earnings by more than 30% annually over the next five years.Given its growth, FB is not all that pricey, and could go even higher as it continues to grow larger.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["op Technology StocksMSFT: -0.7%AAPL: +0.4%IBM: -0.1%CSCO: -0.5%GOOG: -0.3%Technology shares were mainly lower in early trade on Friday.In technology stocks news, Nimble Storage (  ) shares were downgraded to neutral from overweight by Piper Jaffray and the firm lowered its price target to $9 from $20 a share on Friday.Shares in the company were 14.2% lower at $7.13 in recent trade.

But the cash flow statement tells a different story. Free cash flow is positive, exactly equal to the cash on the balance sheet.This ridiculous business is indeed generating cash, but it's doing so by \"borrowing\" money from its customers, taking payment for services in advance. This is all well and good, as long as the number of subscribers keeps growing quickly enough. But once growth starts to slow, this business will quickly run out of cash and be unable to fulfill its obligations.There are two things that should be clear from this example. First, the free cash flow being generated is not real, in the sense that I can't pull it out of the business without jeopardizing the company. That cash, and then some, is owed to the subscribers. In this case, the free cash flow is in no sense a measure of profitability.Second, trying to value this company based on free cash flow is absurd. As growth slows, the free cash flow disappears.This is an extreme example, but it demonstrates why valuing fast-growing companies like Splunk, Tableau, and FireEye based on free cash flow doesn't make any sense. Backing out the deferred revenue growth, Splunk is burning cash, Tableau's free cash flow drops by 75%, and FireEye goes from almost break-even to not even close.Free cash flow is not always the best number to represent profitability, and in some cases it can actually be  number to represent profitability.

Image source: Alex Kuruz via  .Investing and emotions can make for a volatile cocktail, but sometimes you find a company with an awesome opportunity to do great things and be a market-crushing investment along the way. When this happens, it's hard not to get excited. The trick is controlling that excitement and staying disciplined when you choose to act on what you've found.These contributors have a top stock they're excited about, so we asked them to tell us what makes these stocks so compelling. Here's a closer look at what they had to say.I've always been a tech guy, and right now we're seeing a monumental convergence between Silicon Valley and Detroit. As all of the major players continue to explore how they can improve, disrupt, or contribute to the future of mobility, one company stands out as the most exciting to watch:  .Tesla Model X. Image source: Tesla Motors.Independent of Tesla's sky-high valuation and the related growth expectations that are being priced in (which is fodder for  ), Tesla's ambitions are incredibly exciting purely on the technological and product fronts. And I'm not just talking about the advent of the affordable electric car. Tesla Energy has immense opportunities to revolutionize energy storage applications, technology, and costs. Batteries can help address one of the fundamental hurdles with renewable energy sources: intermittency.It's also worth pointing out that all of these goals are incredibly long-term. The auto market moves relatively slowly, and the energy sector is so massive that it takes a very long time to make any type of meaningful change. For example, Elon Musk has estimated that it would take a  of 20 years to convert the entire global fleet of cars to electric. And that's if 100% of new car sales were electric, which they're not. Realistically speaking, we could easily be talking about 50 years or more until EVs comprise a majority of the global fleet.Tesla has never been short of naysayers and skeptics, yet the company has always executed on its targets, even if it's late at times. Tesla will remain a battleground stock and company for the foreseeable future, which will only make its maturation that much more fun to watch unfold.Any investor looking to add a little bit of growth to his or her portfolio might want to give  a closer look. This biotech behemoth has been a stellar performer for years, thanks to its blockbuster success of Eylea, its drug that treats age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Sales of Eylea grew an astounding 54% in the U.S. last year, and with 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 each day for the next 13 years, the odds look good that demand for drugs that treat eye diseases should continue to grow.Image source: Regeneron.But there's more to the Regeneron growth story than just Eylea. The company is in the process of launching its next-generation cholesterol-busting drug, Praluent, which is staring down a multibillion-dollar market opportunity. While sales of Praluent have been a bit  out of the gate, they are slated to pick up over the next year as reimbursement is removed as a barrier. In addition, the company will be reporting data from a cardiovascular outcomes study later this year. If the data show that Praluent lowers the risk of a heart attack or stroke, then demand for the drug could increase significantly.Regeneron also has a solid pipeline of late-stage drugs and is slated to hear from the FDA in October about its new rheumatoid arthritis drug, sarilumab. If approved, sarilumab will be a new treatment option in the multibillion-dollar global inflammation market, and it stands a good chance of stealing market share away from existing rheumatoid arthritis therapies.Right behind sarilumab, Regeneron has yet another potential blockbuster drug called dupilumab, which is in phase 3 studies as a treatment for atopic dermatitis and asthma, both of which affect millions worldwide. If the company reports positive data from those studies, then dupilumab could be in regulators' hands before the end of the year.Add it all up, and Regeneron has the potential to have four different blockbuster drugs on the market in the next few years.Of course, the market is aware of all of this potential and has priced Regeneron's stock accordingly. Shares are currently trading hands at more than 32 times trailing non-GAAP earnings, which implies that investors expect big growth over the coming years. Still, for a high-quality company like this, I think the premium is worth paying. Although the price of oil and gas is beholden to cyclical downturns when supply and demand get out of whack, over the next decade both demand and therefore supplies are expected to grow. That's especially true for natural gas, which is expected to see a 27% spike in demand through the end of this decade, necessitating a similar rise is supplies. That's why I'm pretty excited about  . It's well positioned to benefit from this trend thanks to its strong position linking supply basins to demand centers:Image source: Kinder Morgan investor presentation.What's unique about Kinder Morgan is that it produces very little oil and gas. Instead, it makes most of its money by owning and operating natural gas pipelines that charge a fee to move gas from supply basins to end users. Those pipelines earn money irrespective of the value of the natural gas flowing through, which drives strong recurring cash flow for the company.Furthermore, because of its size and scale, Kinder Morgan is well positioned to capture an outsize portion of the growing need for new natural gas pipelines in the years ahead. That will provide it with a steady stream of investment opportunities, from which it can grow its already gargantuan cash flow, providing it with greater ability to return cash to shareholders.The natural gas megatrend is one a lot of investors are overlooking right now because its price has been so weak. However, it's a trend that I'm pretty excited about, which is why I continue to like Kinder Morgan despite the rocky road it has been on over the past few months.I'll double up with Matt on Kinder Morgan, and not only for the reasons he describes. While those are certainly key behind my thinking for the long term, a big part of my excitement for the midstream giant is that it has already largely \"de-risked\" itself. In December, the company was essentially forced to slash its dividend by 75%, only days after management stated that the company would produce more than enough cash to sustain it, when a credit rating agency threatened to lower its credit rating to junk status.While this move caught many off guard and harmed investors -- at least for the short term -- it put the company in a better financial situation, and created significant value for buyers. Add the fact that Kinder Morgan is a safer stock today than it was a few months ago, because of the shift in its capital allocation strategy, to Matt's long-term outlook, and Kinder Morgan is an exciting investment opportunity today.Image source: Splunk.On the heels of its  last week, I'm as excited as ever by the long-term potential of  . This company specializes in operational intelligence software that analyzes unstructured machine data to make its customers -- namely, enterprise clients -- more efficient, secure, and productive.But I will admit one thing that might seem off-putting at first glance: Splunk  forgoes bottom-line profitability in favor of investing to grow revenue and thereby take market share in these early stages of its long-term story. However, Splunk  cash flow-positive in the meantime; as revenue climbed 49% to $220 million last quarter, cash flow from operations rose 49.5% to $77 million, or to 35% of sales and well above its long-term goal for maintaining operating cash flow margin of at least 20%.Also to Splunk's credit, its aggressive investments in both research and development and marketing are paying off in spades. Last quarter alone, Splunk added an impressive 600 enterprise customers to its base, with new and expanded customer relationships including big names such as the Federal Reserve,  ,  , and Nasdaq. That brought its total to more than 11,000 customers, demonstrating that Splunk's novel platforms continue to resonate with its global target audience.Best of all, Splunk stock still hasn't recovered after being dragged down along with the broader market in recent weeks. Despite a healthy post-earnings pop after its most recent report, shares still sit more than 20% lower than they started this year. As such, I think this represents a perfect chance for opportunistic investors to open or add to their positions in Splunk.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Trending toward the bottom line, adjusted operating income was $14.7 million, good for adjusted operating margin of 6.7%. Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) -- and keeping in mind Splunk currently opts to forego bottom-line profitability as it invests for top-line growth and gaining market share -- Splunk turned in a net loss of $79.3 million, or $0.61 per share. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation, Splunk's net income came in at $14.4 million, or $0.11 per share.For perspective, three months ago Splunk told investors to expect significantly lower Q4 revenue between $200 million and $202 million, and adjusted operating margin between 5% and 6%. And though we don't typically lend much credence to Wall Street's short-term demands, analysts' consensus estimates predicted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of just $0.08 per share on revenue of $203 million.This mark's Splunk's fifth consecutive quarterly earnings beat. Cash flow from operations climbed 49.5% year over year to $77 million and, after accounting for roughly $26.8 million in property and equipment purchases (up from just $2.8 million in last year's fourth-quarter), free cash flow rose around 2.9% to $50.2 million. For the full-year 2015, cash flow from operations rose 49.7% year over year to $155.6 million, or around 23% of revenue, well above the company's long-term target for maintaining operating cash flow margin of at least 20%. Full-year free cash flow came in at $104 million, up \"just\" 15.8% from $90 million in 2014, albeit primarily reflecting incremental capital expenditures related to the build out of a new office in San Francisco. Excluding that build out, free cash flow would have climbed around 50% year over year.As far as operating expenses and with Splunk's top-line/market share growth goals in mind, Splunk wisely continued to plow resources into both sales and marketing (up 49.9% to $161.4 million), and research and development (up 39.7% to $66.1 million).These investments continued to yield fruit, as Splunk added more than 600 new enterprise customers in the fourth quarter to end the year with over 11,000 customers worldwide. Among notable new and expanded customers during the quarter are Bloomberg,  ,  ,  , the Federal Reserve, Fox News, GEICO, NASDAQ, and the U.S. Army.Splunk also continued to roll out new and improved versions of its products to keep its growing customer base happy, including:Splunk also enjoyed deeper integration with strategic partners.  for example, released a new version of its AnyConnect Network Visibility App for Splunk to help customers support capacity planning, troubleshooting, advanced threat detection. And Splunk teamed with  to integrate Splunk Enterprise and Splunk ES into the telecommunications giant's Managed Security Services platform. Splunk CEO Doug Merritt added,For the current quarter, Splunk expects revenue between $172 million and $174 million, and adjusted operating margin between 1% and 2%. By comparison, analysts' consensus estimates called for lower revenue of $170.8 million, and an adjusted  of $0.01 per share. Given Splunk's history of outperformance, it seems safe to expect Wall Street will once again raise its expectations in kind.Finally, for the full-fiscal-year 2017, Splunk expects revenue of roughly $880 million, good for 31.7% growth from fiscal year 2016 and an increase to prior guidance provided last quarter for fiscal 2017 revenue of $850 million. Full fiscal-year adjusted operating profit should be around 5%. Here again, Wall Street was hoping for lower fiscal year 2017 revenue of $854.2 million, and adjusted earnings of $0.23 per share.In the end, it's hard to argue with Splunk's relative strength and value proposition as it continues to accelerate customer additions and build market share in these early stages of growth. With that in mind, it's no surprise shares currently sit almost 10% higher Friday as of this writing.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $32.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.61/share today.Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

It's the first click for those shopping online, and AMZN stock is the first name investors turn to when seeking a consumer play with consistent growth. Source: Grab MediaUnfortunately, over the past three months or so, Amazon stock has fallen on hard times. Shares are off almost 20% since the beginning of December, and just a few weeks back AMZN stock investors were  .The resulting declines have caused some to write off this e-commerce giant in 2016 as just another overpriced tech name. However, those who underestimate Amazon have been proven painfully wrong in the past, as they will again in 2016 when this temporarily troubled retail giant returns to favor.In reality, Amazon.com is the best consumer play on earth, as well as a bold bet on the future of cloud computing and the Internet. Here's why investors can still rely on this high-growth play from here on out.Amazon.com, Inc. faded at the start of the year as investors got more \"risk off\" in this troubled market. Then, after it disappointed the market with Q4 numbers at the end of January, its decline accelerated. In fact, AMZN stock lost roughly 8% in a single session.However, the bears are reading too much into the short-term troubles.For starters, the \"disappointment\" over earnings of $1 per share vs. estimates of $1.58 is not exactly an uncommon miss for the e-commerce king. Amazon has been investing heavily in growth over the last few years, leading to volatile bottom-line numbers and infrequent profitability. Also, while revenue missed expectations by a hair at $35.75 billion on forecasts of $35.9 billion, the figure marked yet another new record for AMZN.And digging deeper, there's a lot to like.For example, despite already having massive scale, Amazon grew its top line 22% - and Wall Street expects roughly 20% sales growth in 2016 to boot, putting total revenue at over $150 billion.That is simply stunning.And beyond traditional e-commerce, its  ; those memberships will continue to provide consistent cash flow going forward even as Amazon invests in growth. Also, efforts like the Fire TV streaming device and Prime Music continue to gain traction.Along with these strong points, there is also heavy investment in Amazon Fresh - a same-day grocery delivery service that has enormous promise.Although expectations were just a bit too high and the market has been hostile to momentum plays like Amazon in early 2016, investors should not worry about this downtrend persisting given that AMZN stock has plenty of bright spots.Perhaps most impressive, however, is the fast-growing Amazon Web Services arm of this company. Though investors have only gotten details on this cloud computing unit for about a year, the numbers we do have are too impressive to ignore.Bears latched on to the fact that  - off 9 percentage points from the year before - but the expansion is still stunning. And when you consider the cloud computing arm will probably hit $10 billion in annual sales after being next to nothing a few years ago, that is a staggering feat worth celebrating.It's not just the top line, either.  - a 161% increase - at a margin of 28.5%. This means that for a company that has struggled to turn a profit thanks to its focus on being the low-cost leader in retail, AMZN stock has finally found a profit center.Even more impressive is that the cloud market continues to suffer price deflation as everyone from Amazon to  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) to  (NASDAQ:  ) race to lock up customers in the fast-growing cloud space. AMZN is making money, but forcing its competitors to post losses as they invest heavily to catch up in a race where Amazon Web Services is far ahead.It's difficult to see those numbers and not be amazed.Look, if you want to chase declining retail giants like  (NYSE:  ) on the premise of value, go right ahead. And if you want to chase fashionable, high-growth but deeply unprofitable tech names like big data play  (NASDAQ:  ), be my guest.But for my money, this combination of retail dominance and high-tech growth makes AMZN stock the perfect investment in 2016 even after its declines. While some volatility is to be expected in this market, it seems almost impossible for Amazon.com to not wind up even more dominant in 2017 - and with its stock significantly higher as a result.The post ) Is Still Your Best Bet in 2016 appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 20Array6 results on Feb 25. Splunk posted a negative surprise of Array0.20% in the last quarter. The company has posted an average negative surprise of Array0.4Array% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Splunk has been strengthening its strong product pipeline to benefit from the growing data and analytics market. Over the past few years, the analytics market has seen strong growth especially in the enterprise domain, which is a positive for the company. In 20Array5, the company had also made a couple of acquisitions to enhance its cyber security offerings. It had bought Caspida, Inc., a machine learning and analytics services provider and Metaphor Software, an anomaly and prediction analytics company.However, increasing investments in research and development, coupled with higher operating costs, are anticipated to be a near-term drag on profitability. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins in the near term.Also, the company's shares have been witnessing a downtrend as other players like Tableau Software, , which operates in the same market as Splunk and offers complementing products, reported disappointing results this quarter, raising concerns about market conditions.A prime reason for this slump despite the growing market could be growing competition from established players such as International Business Machines  , SAP, Amazon and Microsoft  , all of which are vying to get a bigger share of the market.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Splunk is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #Array, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 54 cents. Though Splunk's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Here is a stock you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apache Corp.  with an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #3Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

With shares down more than 40% during the past three months despite its  in November, investors in the operational-intelligence specialist could use a positive catalyst to end this questionable pullback.After all, Splunk's recent plunge largely came with no company-specific news, but rather as the  , punishing similar high-multiple, cloud-based enterprise software companies in the process. But that raises the question: What should investors be watching this time when Splunk's quarterly report hits the wires? First, Splunk's latest guidance calls for revenue between $200 million and $202 million, the midpoint of which represents roughly 36.4% growth from the same year-ago period. Splunk also told investors to expect adjusted operating margin between 5% and 6%, up sequentially from 3.8% last quarter.By contrast -- and with the caveat that we don't typically lend much credence to Wall Street's short-term expectations -- analysts' consensus estimates call for higher revenue of $202.9 million, likely a byproduct of Splunk's knack for under promising and over delivering for each of its past three quarters. Next, look for Splunk to continue meeting or exceeding its full-fiscal year target for operating cash flow margin of 20%. Last quarter, Splunk generated operating cash flow of $36.4 million, or 20.9% of revenue, and free cash flow of $21.1 million.Meanwhile, Splunk will almost certainly continue investing for growth in lieu of bottom-line profitability, piling cash into both sales and marketing (which rose 51.8% year over year last quarter), and research and development (up 42.1% YOY in Q3). These investments should yield fruit in the form of new products, collaborative agreements, and ultimately, new and expanded customer relationships. Last quarter, for example,  more than 500 new enterprise customers, struck a strategic alliance centered around predictive security analytics with  , and detailed half a dozen significant product updates, including huge performance increases with the latest versions of Splunk Enterprise, and the Splunk App for  Web Services.And its efforts appear to be enjoying continued success. In mid-December, the company revealed a new report from IDC naming Splunk the worldwide IT Operations Analytics (ITOA) market share leader, with a 28.7% share. At the same time, Splunk senior VP of IT markets, Rick Ritz added, \"Splunk helped pioneer the ITOA market and we look forward to accelerating our ITOA leadership with the introduction of our newest solution -- Splunk IT Service Intelligence.\" Splunk surprised investors last quarter by revealing that CEO Godfrey Sullivan was retiring from his post, effective immediately, to be replaced by then-senior VP of field operations, Doug Merritt. Merritt previously served in several executive roles, including CEO of Baynote, senior VP of product and solutions marketing at  , and executive VP of global on-demand applications at  .That doesn't mean everything will change for Splunk. Sullivan admitted during the subsequent conference call that he had worked with the board \"for some time now\" on a succession plan -- something he noted was \"every CEO's responsibility\" -- noting he had recruited Merritt to Splunk with an \"eye to succession\" two years earlier. Meanwhile, Sullivan remains on Splunk's board as non-executive board chairman, and promised to work with Merritt to ensure a smooth transition.Nonetheless, this will be Merritt's second conference call as Splunk's CEO, and investors will be watching closely to determine whether the company can continue to thrive and advance its customer-centric approach under his leadership. Finally, with almost two months of fiscal 2017 already under Splunk's belt, listen for updates on the company's targets for the full year. Last quarter, management told investors to expect fiscal 2017 revenue of roughly $850 million, or roughly 30.8% year-over-year growth, assuming it meets expectations on revenue in fiscal 2016, with similar adjusted operating margin as compared to last year.Noting that industry analysts had only recently increased the potential total addressable market for Splunk's products to $45 billion, management also insisted Splunk plans to \"remain in investment mode,\" which almost certainly means continuing to forego bottom-line profits as measured by generally accepted accounting principles. While that might mean more volatility over the near term, however, it makes sense for Splunk to continue to invest in securing as much market share as possible in these early stages of growth.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The company has been around for 25 years, is very well run, is regarded as a great place to work, and generally speaking, has been a pretty steady eddy executor in the mid-market North American payroll/HR software space. Usually, it's very tough to get excited about shorting a name like this because it never turns into a valuation outlier. In recent months, it has caught more of our attention as it slowly started to push itself into outlier territory in an arguably compressing SaaS multiple landscape. This led us to do more work on the name as we tried to better understand the market dynamics in the SMB to mid-market payroll/HR space in North America. This has been a fruitful endeavor, and we believe that we have come away with a compelling short thesis based on our research.Normally, that would be the entire focus of our report, but things in tech and more notably SaaS really have drastically changed over the past two weeks. The change has been so drastic as to basically render our stock-specific short thesis almost entirely irrelevant. This is because we were previously focusing on proving why Ultimate's discount multiple to SaaS and tech's high growth and relatively fresh faced stock story darlings should be relatively wider than it already was.  Consequently, we recently decided to aggressively up our short exposure post the company's Q4 results on Wednesday Feb. 2nd as the stock temporarily pushed into SaaS relative nosebleed valuation territory. We got some immediate return benefit out of this in the post LinkedIn/Tableau tech bloodbath on Friday, but we are now extremely confident there is a lot more to come. Here is why...This is what your SaaS darling valuation comp table looked like at close of market on Friday Feb. 4th. Almost every name (Splunk (  ) and Medidata (  ) being current exceptions) on this list has already provided guidance for 2016 top-line growth.\n  \nThe group average ex-Ultimate is 4.38x EV/2016 est. rev. This puts Ultimate at a 41% premium to the average, and a 10% premium to the group leader. ULTI has typically traded at a 25% minimum EV/rev discount to the SaaS hyper growth darlings. This gap has narrowed somewhat as it has shown some slightly increased operating momentum over the past two quarters, which we will get to later, but to be clear, you are not going to find anyone on the sell side or buy side arguing that Ultimate should have the highest multiple in this group. In fact, almost every sell-side report gets at a valuation for the stock by applying some sort of EV/rev forward multiple discount to the likes of Workday (WDAY) or higher growing SMB payroll or broader cloud peers. So, for those who care about broker targets, Ultimate's numbers have to come way, way down and very, very fast.Well, if Ultimate trades\u2026At the peer group, EV/sales forward avg., the stock should be $117. At Workday's current forward EV/sales multiple, it should be $152. At a 20% discount to Workday and ServiceNow's forward EV/sales multiples, it should be $119. And what about if traded at Tableau's forward EV/sales multiple which has essentially the same revenue base and is expected to grow at 30% this year. Well, at that multiple, it's a $67 stock. And if you want to get into cash flow, well, it's even worse. At Tableau's 2015 operating cash flow multiple, Ultimate is worth $59. And if it traded like LinkedIn on an EV/adj EBITDA multiple of 2015 EBITDA, the stock should be $70. Blend these all together and you are looking at on average 40% downside from here or a $100 stock.Now you may say, hey, wait a minute Ultimate has much better operating margins than Workday and ServiceNow, so maybe that matters more in this environment. Ok, yes that could be the case. Then again those two companies are global SaaS players with much bigger TAMs whose current growth rates are also understated because of significant currency headwinds. However, if adjusted EBITDA multiples are the story, the downside looks even worse when you compare them against Tableau and LinkedIn or the vertically-focused SaaS names. Ahh, but the data visualization market is more niche and there is serious competition there, so that's why that trades where it is at.Yeah, ok, and then what do you think the North American payroll/HR SMB and mid-market is like? Is that more niche than the global DV market? Well, we can tell you that it is a heck of a lot more crowded, and it's going to get even more crowded. Where do you think pricing is headed in this market with startups giving away the software for free? How much more desperate are those startups going to be to win new business in this environment? By the way, Ultimate's growth story and the other niche payroll/HR NA market focused players has been about a replacement trade against the service bureaus; do you want to pay a huge premium for that? Ok, fine, maybe this all resonates, but LinkedIn is not a good comp as the market is discounting job market headwinds in the name as we get into the back half of the year. Do you think those same headwinds don't apply to payroll/HR provider whose growth is coming from small- and medium-sized businesses?We can go on with back and forth, and in a stable or expanding growth multiple environment, that is precisely what we all do. That conversation is for a different market. In a normal environment, there will be several outliers on the high and low end. This stock's discount is warranted because the TAM is smaller. No its premium is warranted because the margins are far higher. No, don't focus on margins here as they are in investment mode, and the top-line growth is off the charts and justifies the premium. No, no, no, the names with much lower top-line growth and more narrow market focus deserve a decent discount to the big boys. The valuation battle goes on and on and on...But in this tape, there is no such battle. There are faster-growing and higher-EBITDA-margin software and related tech companies trading at huge discounts to Ultimate, and huge TAM global SaaS giants with the previously loved \"land grab\" top-line revenue stories also trading at discounts. Basically, thanks to a broad rerate of how technology stocks are valued, it is the most identifiable outlier we have ever come across in a deep public market tech sub segment. Normally, when you come across something like this, there is some new paradigm story you need to work hard to disprove like a Mobileye (MBLY), and even then, there may be a few similarly situated names in the same neighborhood that skeptics can point to and say, \"well, what about that one as well?\" That's not the case here. Ultimate's model is well understood, and the universe that exists to value it well established. The problem is that universe just drastically changed, and it is now sitting there all alone simply waiting for the laws of market gravity to quickly bring it in!If you made it this far, you should stop here as this is essentially all we are focused on in this short. It is really that straightforward. When we first started shorting Ultimate late last year, we really didn't have an infallible thesis. We knew the company was exceptionally well run, and that it was growing at a measured pace in the North American payroll/HR market. It was essentially one of the few names to make a smooth on-premise to cloud transition, and there was pretty much nothing we didn't like about the business. We just thought that the market was starting to overpay for the slight uptick in operating momentum that it was experiencing.We were familiar with the company's decision to push into the 300-500 employee firm space over the past 12 months, and believed it was getting a decent boost because of this decision, thanks to heightened payroll/HR provider selection activity around the Affordable Care Act ((ACA)) compliance reporting deadlines. Basically, we developed a view that while ACA filing enhancement capabilities were not going to be a big revenue boost, the Spring 1094/1095 IRS forms filing deadline was spurring firms in the SMB to mid-market space to evaluate new vendors and or upgrade existing suites. So essentially ULTI was catching a nice regulatory-driven spike in overall business activity at the same time it had decided to push more downstream into the market most affected by that spike.As far as we are concerned, regulatory deadline driven spikes in business activity are great because they distort baseline demand and are always followed by predictable hangovers in activity. From a short-selling perspective, all you need is a market that all of a sudden decides to get carried away by this spike to create an opportunity for you to exploit. In our view, that opportunity started to materialize last year. FX headwinds took a lot of the steam out of the SaaS heavyweights, leaving Ultimate as one of the few names with a very jubilant conference call for investors to get excited about it. The melt up seemed like a nice and easy short opportunity as you sat back and waited for its luster to wear off in H2 2016 and going into 2017. The problem with that view though was we were not that confident in it as management had us really believing what was going on here was very unique to ULTI.When asked about ACA driving activity in Q3, here is what Ultimate's CEO had to say on that  :And here is what he had to say on the Q4  last week:While we get Ultimate's management being dismissive of ACA functionality as a differentiator/revenue booster, we really were not sold on it, denying its role in new business generation momentum.This is because on the same conference call, it highlighted metrics like this:So, a 50% y-o-y increase in new potential business interest has nothing to do with ACA? The deadline isn't helping the new strategic sales team close deals in the 300-500 employee firm range? We had a hard time reconciling this after the Q3 call, but, by the Q4 call, the picture cleared up a lot for us. The reason for this was actually a short thesis we were pitched on payroll/HR provider Paycom Software (PYCM) just a few days after Ultimate reported its Q3. We were admittedly ignorant to the name until this thesis found its way to us, but thankfully, it did because it opened our eyes to what was going on in the sector. Despite the appeal of the thesis, we didn't short Paycom, but as its target market was exclusively in the SMB/mid-market space that was delivering a boost to ULTI, it naturally caught our attention. Then, a week later, Paycom reported its results and delivered 51% y-o-y revenue growth which was 400bps above consensus and an acceleration from Q2's 47% . The stock jumped nearly 30% the next morning, which naturally got us thinking maybe we are shorting the wrong name, but that at the same time, our ACA demand boost thesis was more likely accurate.So we started going through Paycom's conference calls as well as the even more SMB-focused Paylocity's (PCTY) (100 employee average payroll/HR customer size) conference calls and results. What we discovered was pretty clear. Paycom started 2015 guiding for 29% revenue growth and it is going to end up delivering close to 50% growth. PCTY guided for similar 30% growth and also raised that closer to 50% when it reported last Thursday (the Paylocity numbers are eye-popping as growth spiked to 60% y-o-y in the most recent quarter). Clearly, both these firms experienced significant accelerations in demand into year-end.Now put this all together and you have a much clearer picture of what is going in the space. The demand pulled forward, thanks to ACA, is as clear as day. All three firms have seen the spikes at the same time, so you can't really argue with that; but that's not even the whole story here.Paycom and Ultimate get 50%+ of their business from the giant service bureaus like ADP (ADP) and Ceridian. ADP reported results last week, and here is a nice little excerpt from its  :Here is ADP telling you that, thanks to ACA, its customers, many of which they are trying to migrate at an accelerated pace from their legacy offerings to their cloud platforms, churn has spiked. So you've had both a combination of accelerated service bureau migrations and ACA deadline compliance as powerful tailwinds in the SMB/mid-market payroll/HR provider space. Set against that backdrop, Ultimate's 200bps bump in top-line growth at the same time it ramped up its strategic sales team doesn't exactly look all that impressive. Management can say what it wants, but broad demand bumps like this can turn into awful hangovers pretty fast.So why not short Paycom and Paylocity instead?We actually don't have a major problem with that idea, but both these names trade at around 20% discounts on EV/forward revenue basis to Ultimate's current multiple. This is despite the fact that Paylocity delivered 60% revenue growth last quarter and Paycom 51% versus 26% for ULTI. Also, these names already have pretty steep growth rate declines baked into forward estimates as well as coming off lower revenue bases. In our view, they also don't have the very likely increased competition headaches and headwinds that are likely looming for Ultimate on the larger enterprise side. Then, there are the questions around introducing more churn into ULTI's model by going down-market as well as exposing itself to core value proposition erosion as it goes up against more of these guys.Going up market is great if you are in the down market, but going down market to get revenue comes with a whole bag of potential future headaches. That being said, we'd obviously rather own the well-established more broadly diversified Ultimate over either of them in the long term, and wouldn't be shocked to see both names cut by more than half. This is because we view these names as 2nd and 3rd tier stocks and not really part of the broader SaaS blue-chip comp universe, and obviously, because they are clearly a lot more levered to a slowdown in overall payroll/HCM selection activity going into next year. But as we pointed out at the start of this section, this is the icing on the cake. Our enthusiasm around this position is based on what is going on in the 1st tier names in software where you don't have liquidity and typically different type of shareholder base elements potentially creating thesis execution headaches.Ultimate is trading at current levels simply because it reported what seemed like relevant good news right before a \"bear market\" stamp got placed on tech. It in fact got more expensive during Friday's LinkedIn/Tableau inspired sell-off despite a 10% decline on the day. This is because the likes of Workday, Splunk, ServiceNow, NetSuite, and Salesforce.com declined even more. Those investors long the stock are probably taking some temporary comfort in this \"relative outperformance\", but in this environment, that is not going to go very far. Sell-side models will be updated, and price targets on the name drastically cut. As for the buy-side picture here; investors who think tech is cheap now have dozens of great stories they can pick up at massive discounts to Ultimate, and will re-balance away from it. Meanwhile bearish inclined tech investors scavenging for what is left to short will be all over the name as it literally jumps off their Bloomberg screen at them.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $22.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.85. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 8.2% return against the $22.50 commitment, or a 8.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to SPLK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $22.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Splunk Inc sees its shares decline 37.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $20.65 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.85 from $22.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 8.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, and highlighting in green where the $22.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $22.50 strike for the 8.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

License revenue came in below expectations, suggesting that competition from larger players is starting to chip away at Tableau's early lead in data visualization. Even worse, Tableau cut guidance for both the current quarter and the full year, and some of the comments on the conference call contributed to the sectorwide bloodbath.This quarter should see revenue in the range of $160 million to $165 million, well below the Street's expectation of $179.5 million. Tableau is reducing its full-year outlook, now expecting sales to come in between $830 million to $850 million, down rom a prior range of $845 million to $865 million, which was already below the $871.5 million that analysts were expecting. Operating margins will be pressured this year as Tableau plans to make 2016 an \"investment year.\"But here's the part that really applies to Tableau's peers. CFO Tom Walker noted that there was noticeable \"softness\" within enterprise spending trends, particularly in North America. Some customers are increasing usage, but at a slower rate than the company has enjoyed historically. Tableau's conservative outlook is based on the buying patterns that it's seeing from enterprise customers.Considering current market volatility and investor skittishness, combined with a wide range of global macroeconomic fears, Tableau's remarks are causing investors to flee the sector, particularly those stocks with high valuation multiples.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Friday, shares of Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 25.0, after changing hands as low as $33.77 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 42.3.

In contrast, my Foolish colleague Tim Brugger says that Microsoft is making great strides in cutting edge fields like  . More importantly to the Tableau sell thesis, Maxim Group is warning that Microsoft now has assembled all the tech it needs \"to render Tableau the next Netscape\" in the big data space.In contrast, the analyst likes what it sees at Splunk -- despite the fact that neither Tableau nor Splunk is currently profitable, and that Tableau actually outgrew Splunk in the revenues race last quarter, putting up 64% growth to Splunk's 50%.Given the companies' relative performance, what are the chances Maxim Group is right to like Splunk, and dislike Tableau? Initial indications do not look great. According to our data on Motley Fool CAPS, where we've been tracking Maxim's performance as an analyst for close to  , Maxim's picks are rather hit-or-miss.On average, only about 38% of this banker's recommendations have succeeded in outperforming the S&P 500 over the past decade. On the other hand, Maxim's record in picking Internet software and services stocks  is quite a bit better. According to our records, 47% of Maxim's picks in this sector have outperformed the market -- and by some pretty astounding margins:But does this mean that Maxim is right about Splunk and Tableau as well?Image source:  . It's hard to say. While neither of these company currently sports \"GAAP\" net profits to base a valuation on, both  generating pretty sizable piles of cash from their respective businesses. According to data from  , Tableau generated about $73 million in positive free cash flow over the past 12 reported months (against net profits of  $22 million).Splunk arguably did even better, generating $103 million in FCF (versus an apparently worse GAAP result -- net losses of more than $256 million).Valuation-wise, both stocks cost about the same. Tableau shares have a $5.8 billion market cap; Splunk, $6 billion. In fact, when you factor cash reserves and debt into the picture, the firms have almost identical  -- $5 billion each.Relatively speaking, the fact that Splunk is generating 41% more cash on its $5 billion enterprise value than Tableau is generating on  $5 billion enterprise value, means that...Maxim is probably right! Splunk actually is the cheaper company. (Albeit, at an EV/FCF ratio of 48.5, it's not exactly cheap, period). The fact that Splunk is also expected to grow faster than Tableau -- 40% versus 36%, respectively, according to analyst estimates on Yahoo! Finance -- further reinforces the case for selling Tableau, and using the money to buy Splunk shares instead. I can't in good conscience recommend paying 48 times free cash flow, or more, for any company in a business like big data, where new companies are emerging to disrupt the market every day -- and where, as Maxim points out, even old companies like Microsoft may join the fray. But on balance, if I had to buy just one big data company today...Splunk would be it -- and Tableau would not.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Actually, it's even worse than that. Over the past 12 months, Splunk shares have actually  nearly 5% of their value, and in a (mildly) positive stock market. And yet, at long last, there's a bit of good news to report for shareholders of this operational intelligence company. Bright and early Wednesday morning, a new report on Splunk dropped on the market -- and according to investment banker  , the time has come for Splunk to \"break out\" of its funk.As related by StreetInsider.com this morning, Drexel attributes much of the weakness in Splunk shares to the recent announcement of its CEO's departure. And yet, Drexel sees investors' worries as unwarranted. Last month, if you recall,  featuring a 50% increase in revenue, 45% growth in high-margin licensing revenue, and \"adjusted earnings\" of $0.05 per share.Although the company's GAAP earnings were somewhat underwhelming (a $0.57 net loss), revenue came in 10% ahead of previous management guidance. And more important than the GAAP loss, or the \"pro forma\" profit, Splunk reported strong free cash flow of $21.1 million for the quarter.Best of all, Splunk has upped its guidance for the rest of this year -- and next year as well. Management is looking for fourth-quarter revenue to grow about 15% sequentially, for full-year revenue ($650 million) to come in about 44% ahead of 2014 numbers, and for next year's revenue to grow a further 31%.In short, Splunk is going boffo -- and Drexel thinks it's a buy (with an $80 price target). But is Drexel Hamilton right about that? Here at  , we've been tracking this analyst's performance for a few years now, and initial indications are good. From what we've seen so far, Drexel is an above-average analyst, getting more picks right than wrong, and ranking in about the second quintile among the investors we track.But the sad truth is that unlike most analysts, for which we've got  on past picks, Drexel is a bit of a \"black box\" to us. (And not just us. Data from StreetInsider.com suggests that Drexel only began releasing its recommendations publicly in 2012 -- the same year we began receiving data on its picks).Be that as it may, while our data on Drexel is not perfect, it is at least positive. Now, let's turn to the stock that Drexel is telling you to buy: Splunk itself. According to Drexel Hamilton, $60 spent on a share of Splunk today should turn into $80 a share over the course of a year -- close to a 33% profit. But how likely is that to happen?Well, let's take a look at the valuation. Currently, Splunk carries a market capitalization of $7.8 billion. GAAP net income is running negative, but according to data from S&P Capital IQ, Splunk generated nearly $103 million in positive free cash flow (\"cash profits\") over the past 12 months. That works out to a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 76 -- a mite pricey even if Splunk succeeds in hitting Yahoo! Finance projections for 40% annualized profit growth over the next five years. But let's give Splunk every possible benefit of the doubt. Mathematically speaking, the P/E on this profitless stock is \"infinity.\" The P/FCF valuation is merely \"expensive.\" So what about EV/FCF?Credit Splunk for its $949 million in cash, and its total lack of debt, and Splunk's  drops to just $6.8 billion. Divide $103 million in free cash flow into that number, though, and the EV/FCF ratio still works out to more than 66.When you get right down to it, even after reading Drexel's report, and even knowing that other Fool services are optimistic about the stock, I -- personally -- just can't get excited about Splunk's potential as an investment. Even taking 40% long-term profit growth as a given (  ), 66 times cash profits is an awful lot to pay for a company like Splunk, situated in the fast-changing tech sector, and at constant risk of disruption by the next new thing. And if the growth should fail to materialize?Look out below.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Stock in  fell 13.2% in January, according to data from  . The company's January weakness followed a year in which the \"CRM\" ticker gained 32%. Some of the selling can be attributed to the market's overall January malaise: the  drooped by 8% in January alone.But more pertinent to salesforce's fortunes is the sudden skepticism focused on cloud-based software companies. Due to double-digit revenue growth rates, companies in this sector of the software industry have enjoyed relatively high valuation multiples versus more traditional providers until very recently. Perhaps due to overall vulnerability in the stock market, these multiples are undergoing close scrutiny.Below is a sampling of prominent cloud software leaders, including  ,  , and  . As you can see, salesforce moved in tandem with these companies during January:Perhaps this chart presaged the current month. Tableau and Qlik, both in the business of providing data analytics, dismayed the markets with their respective earnings releases over the last two weeks.Tableau's management had offered what it termed a \"glimpse\" into its 2016 revenue outlook during the company's Q3 2015  in November of last year. At the time, executives projected full year 2016 revenue in a range of $845 million-$865 million.However, in its Q4 2015 earnings release on February 4th, Tableau reduced this range to $830 million-$850 million. As management pointed out, hitting the high end of this revised band would still equate to 30% year-over-year revenue growth. But conditions have changed in the broader market since the end of 2015, and the stock faced fierce and unrelenting selling after earnings were filed, skidding nearly 51%.Similarly, Qlik offered a rather lukewarm revenue outlook for 2016 in its Q4 2015 earnings report on February 11th, indicating full year revenue growth of 13%-15%. Again, there seems to be little tolerance in the current market environment for steeply valued companies which face even nominal growth challenges: Qlik's shares have plummeted 41% thus far in February.Let's look again at this peer group during February, in the context of Tableau's and Qlik's earnings:Salesforce and Splunk shareholders can fasten their seatbelts, as these companies will release fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings on the 24th and 25th of February, respectively. It's interesting to note that in the sell-off in the cloud sector sparked by the likes of Tableau and Qlik, and exacerbated by cloud-based professional network  roughly 50% stock pummeling last week, Splunk has lost 41.3% of its value, even though it has yet to report earnings. Salesforce, however, has managed to actually climb so far this month.Back in November, salesforce raised full year 2015 guidance, upping its revenue forecast of between $6.60 billion-$6.63 billion, to a range of $6.64-$6.65 billion. Management also communicated improved full year earnings per share guidance, from a loss range of ($0.15) to ($0.17), to a smaller deficit of ($0.11) to ($0.12).With acceptable 2015 results seemingly in hand, what will happen if salesforce also depicts a slower year ahead -- will investors dole out the same magnitude of punishment that Tableau and Qlik received?It's a difficult question to obtain clarity on. Unlike younger companies in this sector, salesforce has built investor confidence over a period of years, as it's gradually scaled into one of the world's larger software companies, with trailing twelve month revenue of $6.3 billion.But the same might have been said about LinkedIn. With $3.0 billion in trailing twelve month revenue, and a multi-year rise to prominence, LinkedIn, like salesforce, has benefited from the patience and conviction of investors. This didn't stop LinkedIn's stock price from getting sliced in half during the first two weeks of February, on a warning of weakening top-line expansion.Adding to uncertainty is salesforce's rich valuation relative to fellow cloud corporations, some of which, admittedly, have been drastically revalued by the market this month. Currently, salesforce trades at a price to sales, or PS, multiple of 4.2 times forward one-year sales. In comparison, Qlik, Tableau, LinkedIn, and Splunk, trade at PS ratios of 1.9, 2.4, 2.6, and 3.8, respectively.In theory, salesforce's earnings report shouldn't produce an earth-shattering movement in the company's stock price. Management has guided revenue toward a very narrow range; this specificity indicates a high confidence level in fourth quarter numbers. And near-term results should be stable. This is because the company continues to garner generous portions of its revenue through advanced bookings, leading to ratable income from quarter to quarter.Salesforce also remains proactive in creating revenue opportunities through tuck-in acquisitions. The latest example is its December 2015 agreement to purchase  , a \"quote to cash\" sales cycle software provider which operates natively on the salesforce.com platform, for $360 million.Even accounting for the factors above, given the middling revenue outlooks provided by its peers so far this earnings season, salesforce is certain to see its shareholders zero in on the full year 2016 revenue guidance when it unveils earnings next week. A positive projection may well support the modest climb the \"CRM\" symbol has produced in February. If the company cautions on its growth prospects, however, we shouldn't be surprised to see the market work up at least some of the wrath it's visited on fellow cloud companies this month.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

But the operational intelligence also threw a bit of a curve ball at investors in the form of a new CEO succession plan -- effective today. Let's take a closer look at what Splunk accomplished this quarter. During Splunk's fiscal third-quarter 2016, revenue climbed 50% year over year, to $174.4 million, including a 45.2% increase in license revenue, to $104.2 million, and 58.7% growth in maintenance and services revenue to just below $70.3 million. As per usual, that's well above Splunk's guidance, which called for revenue between $158 million and $160 million.Based on generally accepted accounting principles, that resulted in an operating loss of $72.3 million, and a net loss of $0.57 per share. On a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis -- which excludes items like stock-based compensation and acquisition expenses -- Splunk achieved operating income of $6.6 million -- good for adjusted operating margin of 3.8% -- and adjusted earnings of $0.05 per share. Here again, Splunk's guidance was significantly less optimistic, calling for adjusted operating margin in the range of 1% to 2%. As I suggested in my  earlier this week, investors should also watch for Splunk to generate healthy cash flow. And it did: Operating cash flow came in at $36.4 million, or roughly 20.9% of revenue, and slightly above Splunk's full-year target for operating cash flow margin of 20%. After accounting for $15.3 million in property and equipment purchases, free cash flow was $21.1 million.Meanwhile, as Splunk continues to forego bottom-line profits in favor of driving top-line growth, it continued piling money into both sales and marketing (up 51.8% year over year, to $130.1 million in Q3), and research and development (up 42.1%, to $56.2 million).Those investments continued to manifest in the form of new customers and products. Regarding the former (and similar to last quarter), Splunk added more than 500 new enterprise customers during the past three months. Notable new and expanded customer relationships include the likes of  ,  ,  , the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, and  .Regarding the latter, Splunk unveiled a slew of new product offerings, including a new version of Splunk Enterprise 6.3, as well as the launches of:Splunk also released the latest version of the Splunk App for AWS, and struck a strategic alliance for predictive security analytics with  . In addition, Splunk announced CEO Godfrey Sullivan has informed the company he will retire from his post effective today. As a result, Splunk's board has appointed Doug Merritt as CEO. Merritt joined Splunk as senior VP of field operations in May, 2014, and previously served in several other executive roles including CEO of Baynote, senior VP of product and solutions marketing at Cisco, and executive VP of global on-demand applications at  .Sullivan will remain on Splunk's board, and serve as non-executive board chair, where he'll continue to work closely with Merritt to ensure a smooth transition. \"We will continue our laser focus on becoming the data fabric for businesses, government agencies, universities, and organizations,\" added Merritt. \"Our innovative products, outstanding people, and over 10,000 enthusiastic customers form a solid foundation upon which to build our future growth and success.\" For the current quarter, Splunk expects revenue between $200 million and $202 million, and adjusted operating margin between 5% and 6%. By contrast, analysts' consensus estimates called for lower revenue of $198.3 million, and adjusted earnings of $0.08 per share. Don't be surprised, though, if Wall Street again ratchets up its expectations given Splunk's past history of lowballing guidance.Consequentially, Splunk again raised its outlook for the full-fiscal-year 2016, calling for revenue of approximately $650 million (up from prior guidance for a range of $628 million to $632 million), and adjusted operating margin of 3% (the top-end of Splunk's previous range of 2% to 3%). Wall Street was modeling lower fiscal 2016 revenue of $632.6 million, and adjusted earnings of $0.13 per share.Finally, Splunk provided investors with their first look at next year, calling for fiscal 2017 revenue to increase 30.8% over fiscal 2016, to $850 million. Analysts, on average, were anticipating lower fiscal 2017 revenue of $832.3 million.In the end -- notwithstanding its sudden, albeit seemingly unalarming CEO departure -- this was another solid report from Splunk as it works to secure as much share of its burgeoning industry as possible in these early stages.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

It has the capabilities to collect and analyze data in healthcare to better diagnose patients, aid in complicated procedures, etc. Also, after buying  assets, IBM is well positioned for analytic services in the media, aviation and energy industries.Splunk would give IBM icing on its already very impressive cake. It would add a new layer where IBM could sell the information and collect data from a broader array of devices and machines.Ultimately, Splunk bodes well for IBM's ambition to capture a  big data technology and services market.What many don't realize is that Big Blue is the market leader in business analytics. This is a segment that combines many of IBM's most successful businesses from the cloud, hardware, software and services. Last year, IBM's business analytics operations grew 7% to $17.9 billion, or 22% of total revenue and responsible for essentially all of the company's growth.With IBM forming a new Internet of Things segment, the performance of business analytics should shine for IBM, and could be enough to create optimism among shareholders and  .Given that Splunk is expected to grow 31% and create $855 million in revenue over the next year, it would certainly have a noticeable impact on IBM's IoT and business analytics segments. Furthermore, it would add just enough annual revenue to push IBM from the brink of growth in 2016 to actual year-over-year growth, which is certain to make IBM stock owners happy.Beyond that, if IBM acquires Splunk, it opens a huge door for cross-selling opportunities. Splunk already has a large list of  and more than 10,000 customers. However, Splunk is still in many instances a secondary service provider, applied to just a fraction of a large company's operations.By becoming a part of IBM, it will open doors to an even larger customer base and for larger, more meaningful deals.Keep in mind, companies like  (  ) are rolling out  to make the likes of Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas \"Smart Cities.\" IBM is, in most instances, a partner for such initiatives by companies like AT&T, and if Splunk is a part of IBM, it increases the likelihood that Splunk's technology will be used to collect and analyze the data from tens of thousands of sensors and machines that are collecting data.The real scope of possibilities created from an IBM and Splunk tie-up are hard to imagine, mainly because of how quickly these IoT rollouts are expected to occur over the next two years.With  (  ), a major competitor of IBM in the cloud, rolling out a new service called Space Needle that challenges many of the services offered by the likes of Splunk, it seems that IBM could gain a quick edge against AMZN by purchasing Splunk.This fact coupled with the cross-selling and growth opportunities that exist make it a likely tie-up, and a great catalyst for IBM stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["xpected Earnings Release: 11/19/2015, After-hoursAvg.

Splunk posted a positive surprise of 3.92% in the last quarter. The company has posted an average negative surprise of 10.71% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.We believe that Splunk's strong product pipeline will continue to boost top-line growth. However, increasing investments in research and development, coupled with higher operating costs, are anticipated to be a near-term drag on profitability. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins in the near term.Earlier in the year, the company acquired a machine learning and analytics services provider - Caspida, Inc. for $190 million and anomaly and prediction analytics company, Metaphor Software. These acquisitions significantly strengthen Splunk's cyber security offerings.However, the company continues to face tough competition from established players such as International Business Machines  and Oracle  , which remains an overhang on the stock.For the third quarter, the company projects revenues within $158 million and $160 million and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 1% to 2%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Splunk is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 49 cents.

In the handful of months since, however, shares have simply collapsed. Including the Q3 2015 post-earnings plunge on Thursday, the \"FEYE\" symbol is now down nearly 30% for the year.To get some kind of perspective on this drubbing, and understand what might be in store for FireEye in the near term, let's compare FireEye's valuation to two well-known names in the security sphere:  and  .Below is a chart showing each company's valuation on a one-year forward price-to-sales (PS) basis. It's clear that Palo Alto and Splunk share an almost identical pricing relative to sales, while FireEye is not nearly as dear to the market: data by  .It's important to note that these three security stalwarts share a remarkably similar financial model. Each company is posting high double-digit revenue growth on a quarterly (and annual) basis, each runs at a loss in order to gain market share, and each doles out stock compensation liberally, which increases GAAP losses but reduces the amount of cold, hard cash needed for payroll expenditures.Of the three, Splunk is the most diversified, with several revenue streams that exist outside the security industry. Palo Alto Networks is the largest by revenue, as we'll see below. Since each organization operates on a negative margin, the market values them in part based on their perceived revenue growth potential(s), as expressed by the PS ratio.What other factors do investors use to differentiate between the three companies when figuring a thumbnail valuation? While many qualitative factors are involved, such as FireEye's unique virtualization platform, or Splunk's many \"use cases\" outside of the security market, I believe investors are eyeing a few prominent guiding measures.Billings growth is one -- what's the ongoing growth potential that is laid bare when revenue and deferred revenue are evaluated together? You can read why billings proved a major catalyst in Splunk's decline after its earnings report  .Operating margin and operating cash flow are two other key indicators relevant to this industry. Many cyber security investment candidates sport negative operating margins. But the more attractive companies remain at least within a stone's throw of positive territory. They also find a way to generate ample operating cash flow.Scanning these few metrics together yields eye-opening inferences. The numbers in the following table are based on the most recently filed quarter (MRQ) as well as trailing-12-month (TTM) data:\n  \nAll dollar figures in millions. Sources: Google Finance, YCharts data, and company SEC filings. Note: Splunk does not report billings. Splunk's billings were calculated by the author from company filings, under the same methodology used by FireEye and Palo Alto Networks.Most notably, FireEye's growth in billings significantly trails its two peers in the most recent quarter reported for each company. And while all operate in the red -- in the interest of scaling up revenue and grabbing market share -- FireEye has the worst operating margin (by far) of the three.Finally, due to that relatively poorer operating performance, FireEye doesn't generate the magnitude of cash its competitors do for each dollar of sales. In fact, FireEye only turned cash flow positive this year. Based on this admittedly birds-eye view of FireEye relative to two well-regarded companies operating in the same market, we can draw the conclusion that the sell-off, which dropped FireEye to a 45% discount to Palo Alto Networks and Splunk on a PS ratio comparison, was probably adequate. Moreover, it's also likely that the stock at this point is neither oversold nor dramatically undervalued.Essentially, investors in FireEye are forking over about half of what they'll pay for the revenue of Palo Alto or Splunk. That's because FireEye's growth prospects seem much weaker, its losses significantly larger, and its conversion of sales to cash flow anemic in comparison with these two similar companies. For FireEye to receive a higher PS multiple from the market, it will need to start improving the core metrics we've reviewed above -- and soon.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Software vendors focused on business intelligence, or BI, such as  ,  , and  would do well to take notice.After swirling rumors, Amazon introduced its own cloud BI software, named QuickSight, earlier this month at the company's yearly \"re: Invent\" conference in Las Vegas. Thus far, the analyst community has been dismissive about the scope of the threat Amazon presents to BI software incumbents and their peers. However, underestimating Amazon's ability to innovate and compete has led to the quick dismissal of too many companies to count over the years. The analysts' skeptical view of Amazon's challenge to many of BI software's more established names are, to be fair, justified, for several important competitive reasons.One of the most significant structural advantages pure-play BI vendors enjoy is that many corporations still maintain their high-value or \"mission-critical\" data warehoused in on-site servers. As William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri recently noted, that means that, in most cases:The sensitive nature of key data (sales data, customer info, and so on) creates a reluctance to host this type of information in public cloud servers such as those Amazon runs for AWS, even though small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, are probably little better at network security than Amazon is. This dynamic could change over time as acceptance of cloud hosting increases among SMEs and the cost and scalability advantages that accompany it. However, customers that have already invested in BI software for their on-premises servers will face an even greater disincentive to switch to Amazon in the short term. This situation bodes well for the likes of Tableau, Splunk, and Qlik. However, it's not the only advantage they enjoy over Amazon.Current BI software specialists will probably enjoy a feature advantage over Amazon as QuickSight enters the market. As at least  , the full functionality of Amazon's new BI software isn't entirely understood at this point, a fact that could indicate QuickSight lacks some of the robust features established BI software leaders offer. As was the case with the on-site advantage, superior product quality, if that turns out to be the case, should help insulate BI-specific software players to mitigate the impact of Amazon's entry.These are both powerful advantages that should help protect the likes of Tableau, Splunk, Qlik Technologies, and the remaining glut of BI upstarts. However, success is never permanent, least of all in a rapidly evolving software vertical such as BI, and that's why I believe underestimating Amazon's long-term competitive presence would be a serious mistake for industry incumbents and their shareholders.In my years covering Amazon, I've come to appreciate its position as a competitive force. Going beyond simply respecting Amazon's disruptive DNA, I see two additional factors that could increase its chances of success in BI software.The first is the inherent benefits of cloud hosting. While not always cheaper, cloud hosting and computing costs continue to steadily decline, and there's no denying the flexibility cloud-based options provide over expensive, fixed investments in hosting hardware. So it's easy to envision how, over time, the on-site advantages BI vendors currently enjoy diminish as cloud adoption continues. And as the company at the forefront of many cloud computing markets, Amazon could package its BI products with other cloud products in a compelling enough way to steal customers from the likes of Splunk, Qlik, Tableau, and others. This is by no means a certainty, but it does seem plausible.Second, should Amazon narrow the product functionality gap, the e-commerce giant could, and probably would, aggressively compete on price. As we've learned over the years, Amazon loves a price war. And should such a scenario emerge, Amazon's massive revenue base and amazingly patient shareholders could enable it to succeed over smaller competitors. The key in avoiding this outcome will lie in smaller vendors' ability or willingness to keep their products one step ahead of Amazon.We haven't reached a winner-take-all point in the emerging market for BI software. With estimates of market saturation at roughly 10% today, there are plenty of growth opportunities left for the likes of Tableau, Splunk, and Qlik to successfully co-exist with Amazon's 800-pound gorilla. And while the conditions that could create more direct conflict between vendors remain years away, it's still important not to underestimate Amazon in this budding software space, either.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

With shares of the operational-intelligence specialist down roughly 14% over the past three months as of this writing, it's time for investors to start thinking about what Splunk's latest quarter will hold. For perspective, analysts' consensus estimates predict that Splunk's Q3 revenue will rise 38.1% year over year to $160.2 million and translate to adjusted earnings of a penny per share. And though Splunk doesn't provide specific per-share earnings guidance, management did tell investors during last quarter's call to anticipate adjusted operating margin between 1% and 2% and revenue between $158 million and $160 million.To be fair, though, Splunk has demonstrated a knack for underpromising and overdelivering, so don't be surprised if the market shrugs off another beat. Shares fell last quarter, for example, after Splunk not only outpaced the market's expectations on both its top and bottom lines but also increased its full fiscal 2016 revenue guidance to a range of $628 million to $632 million. The midpoint of that range represented an $18 million increase from previous guidance, and a $14 million premium to Wall Street's models at the time.Naturally, Wall Street has ratcheted up its expectations going into this week's report and now wants Splunk to achieve fiscal 2016 revenue slightly above the high end of its latest guidance range. So what else should investors be watching when Splunk's report his the wires?For one, look for healthy operating cash flow and free cash flow. In particular, Splunk management has insisted that while it continues to eschew bottom-line profitability in favor of investing for top-line growth, operating cash flow is expected come in at roughly 20% of total revenue this year. Meanwhile, Splunk will almost certainly continue piling money into both sales and marketing (up 39.8% year over year last quarter to $111.8 million) and R&D (up 41.3% in Q2 to $48.3 million).Those investments should bear fruit in the form of new products and hundreds of new and expanded customer relationships. For perspective, Splunk added over 500 new customers last quarter to bring its total to more than 10,000 worldwide. And Splunk announced several notable wins in recent weeks, including implementations of Splunk Enterprise Security at both regional networking solutions company Integra and Canadian securities marketplace CanDeal.Next, listen for updates on Splunk's acquisition activity, which last quarter included spending around $143 million to acquire IT anomaly-detection company Metafor Software and behavioral-analytics company Caspida. Splunk hasn't disclosed any new acquisitions since then, but at the very least it should offer highlights on the integration progress of these two companies and their respective software technologies. Finally, in keeping with their past patterns, Splunk management will almost certainly offer a look at expectations for the current quarter and may also provide initial thoughts on next year's (fiscal 2017) revenue, investment, and margin targets.On the former, hitting the midpoint of its fiscal Q3 revenue outlook (at $159 million) would leave Splunk approximately $197 million in fiscal Q4 revenue to reach the middle of its current full fiscal-year outlook of $630 million. That's 39.7% growth over fiscal 2014. As I suggested earlier, however, few will be surprised if Splunk delivers slightly more when all is said and done.On the latter, consensus expectations call for Splunk's fiscal 2017 revenue to rise 31.6% year over year -- a deceleration, mind you, as Splunk builds from its larger base -- to $832.2 million. If Splunk indeed expects to deliver anywhere near that level of growth, it seems safe to assume the company will also remain in investment mode and continue to put aside bottom-line profits for now. In the end, that should sit well with patient investors as they watch this innovative company make itself all that much more indispensable to its growing list of customers worldwide.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Human resources, facilities, marketing, finance and legal all re-examined the way they do business and started to take notice of how their tech departments used ServiceNow's productsHe added that some businesses are customizing the company's products to track insurance claims, carry out car fleet management or manage clinical trials.\"These are things that we'll never build and areas we'll never go into,\" said Wright. \"But people look at the fundamental workflow that IT has and they say, 'We can repurpose it; we can use this.'\"In the third quarter, ServiceNow said 30% of its customers were large Fortune 2000 firms.

The maker of data analysis and visualization tools reported third-quarter results on Thursday night, falling short of Wall Street's revenue estimates and setting up a weak earnings target for the next quarter.

Qlik hit the earnings consensus on the nose, up from adjusted net income of $0.01 per share in the year-ago quarter.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .In the world of finance, earnings are 'the bottom line,' both literally and figuratively. And for good reason: a company's earnings performance is probably the foremost factor influencing its stock price in today's fast-paced world.Of late, investors have been preoccupied with China, global growth worries and the Fed's interest rate timeline. These macro concerns will take a back seat in the coming days as the third-quarter earnings season takes the spotlight.Wall Street seems on edge - bracing itself for what could prove to be a gloomy earnings season, after the August sell-off wiped off roughly $11 trillion of value from global equities. The usual suspects which are ushering in weakness remain a strong dollar and sustained weak energy prices.Yes, we are still following the negative estimate revision trend that has now been well entrenched for quite some time. Analysts have considerably lowered their expectations, dragged by economic slowdown in China, volatility in global markets, low energy prices and the unrelenting strength of the greenback.However, if we dig a little deeper, the overall trend is somewhat negatively skewed by a huge drop in energy sector results. Also, the magnitude of revisions this quarter has been notably less than what we saw in the comparable periods in other recent quarters. That is reason enough to celebrate.You must have noticed how some stocks skyrocket after the earnings results while others fall off a cliff. Ever wondered if there is a way to identify potential outperformers before they report?Studies indicate that on an average, positive earnings surprises drive strong returns in share prices for several weeks following the report. This is what we call the  .At Zacks, we have developed  . This system leverages the Zacks Rank, along with what we call Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP. When a stock has a good Zacks Rank, as well as a positive Earnings ESP, there is a very high chance of the company beating estimates in its next earnings report.Another tool in our arsenal is estimate revisions.Earnings estimates come from brokerage firm stock analysts. As we get closer to earnings season, analysts have increasingly accurate information at their disposal to incorporate into their estimates.When we fixated on those positive estimate revisions closest to the earnings announcement, that's where the earnings \"whispers\" become a roar.These whispers tip us off that a big surprise is in the cards for the company and investors can get in and ride the ensuing stock appreciation.Thus, we capitalized on these signals coming from the brokerage analyst community that investors are oblivious to. We then integrated our time-tested Zacks Rank and  methodology, all the time ensuring that only those stocks that have consistently beat earnings by a huge margin got through.Moreover, these champions have delivered staggering earnings beats of over 100% in their last reported quarter.

This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has an Earnings ESP of +40.00%.With its impressive combination of a great Zacks Rank and a positive earnings ESP, this company looks set to continue its winning streak in its upcoming earnings report on Nov 2. Also, analysts clearly see good things in the company's future, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 earnings has risen over 4% over the past month. (  )SkyWest, through its subsidiaries, operates a regional airline in the United States. It provides scheduled passenger and air freight services with approximately 3,500 total daily departures to various destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.SkyWest has delivered huge earnings surprises in each of the four trailing quarters, posting an astonishing average surprise of 338%. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has an Earnings ESP of +4.55%.Moreover, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company over the past month, with 2 upward estimate revisions that led to a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015, which now stands at $1.80, up from $1.75 a month ago.With a top Zacks Rank and positive analyst sentiment, the company looks well poised to beat estimates in its upcoming earnings report on Oct 29.

And for good reason: a company's earnings performance is probably the foremost factor influencing its stock price in today's fast-paced world.Of late, investors have been preoccupied with China, global growth worries and the Fed's interest rate timeline. These macro concerns will take a back seat in the coming days as the third-quarter earnings season takes the spotlight.Wall Street seems on edge - bracing itself for what could prove to be a gloomy earnings season, after the August sell-off wiped off roughly $11 trillion of value from global equities. The usual suspects which are ushering in weakness remain a strong dollar and sustained weak energy prices.Yes, we are still following the negative estimate revision trend that has now been well entrenched for quite some time. Analysts have considerably lowered their expectations, dragged by economic slowdown in China, volatility in global markets, low energy prices and the unrelenting strength of the greenback.However, if we dig a little deeper, the overall trend is somewhat negatively skewed by a huge drop in energy sector results. Also, the magnitude of revisions this quarter has been notably less than what we saw in the comparable periods in other recent quarters. That is reason enough to celebrate.You must have noticed how some stocks skyrocket after the earnings results while others fall off a cliff. Ever wondered if there is a way to identify potential outperformers before they report?Studies indicate that on an average, positive earnings surprises drive strong returns in share prices for several weeks following the report. This is what we call the  .At Zacks, we have developed  . This system leverages the Zacks Rank, along with what we call Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP. When a stock has a good Zacks Rank, as well as a positive Earnings ESP, there is a very high chance of the company beating estimates in its next earnings report.Another tool in our arsenal is estimate revisions.Earnings estimates come from brokerage firm stock analysts. As we get closer to earnings season, analysts have increasingly accurate information at their disposal to incorporate into their estimates.When we fixated on those positive estimate revisions closest to the earnings announcement, that's where the earnings \"whispers\" become a roar.These whispers tip us off that a big surprise is in the cards for the company and investors can get in and ride the ensuing stock appreciation.Thus, we capitalized on these signals coming from the brokerage analyst community that investors are oblivious to. We then integrated our time-tested Zacks Rank and  methodology, all the time ensuring that only those stocks that have consistently beat earnings by a huge margin got through.Moreover, these champions have delivered staggering earnings beats of over 100% in their last reported quarter.Qualys provides cloud security and compliance solutions in the U.S. The company has recently formed technology alliances with data analytics firm Splunk, Inc.  and ServiceNow, Inc.  , a maker of software to help manage IT services.The cybersecurity software company has consistently beaten estimates in each of the four trailing quarters, registering an astounding average beat of 233.3%. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has an Earnings ESP of +40.00%.With its impressive combination of a great Zacks Rank and a positive earnings ESP, this company looks set to continue its winning streak in its upcoming earnings report on Nov 2. Also, analysts clearly see good things in the company's future, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 earnings has risen over 4% over the past month.SkyWest, through its subsidiaries, operates a regional airline in the United States. It provides scheduled passenger and air freight services with approximately 3,500 total daily departures to various destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.SkyWest has delivered huge earnings surprises in each of the four trailing quarters, posting an astonishing average surprise of 338%. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has an Earnings ESP of +4.55%.Moreover, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company over the past month, with 2 upward estimate revisions that led to a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015, which now stands at $1.80, up from $1.75 a month ago.With a top Zacks Rank and positive analyst sentiment, the company looks well poised to beat estimates in its upcoming earnings report on Oct 29.USA Compression Partners is a Master Limited Partnership that provides natural gas compression services to domestic customers.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 830 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new January 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $45.20 (before broker commissions).

Shares of  fell 10.7% in September,  . The maker of software tools used to analyze massive data collections generally followed a muted sector trend last month, but stumbled and missed out on one of the Big Data industry's few bright moments. At the very end of August, Splunk reported strong second-quarter results and rosy forward guidance. But the stock fell anyway, as analysts and investors were reminded just how lofty Splunk's valuation multiples are. So the report was followed by analysts adjusting their price targets to more closely match the P/E multiples of sector peers. Even some of Splunk's bulls started slashing their target multiples, while sticking to their buy ratings.And then the Chinese economy shook up the entire market. Splunk went along for that negative ride, too, only faster than most stocks because it's matched to nosebleed valuations.And with financial debt of just 1.5 times trailing EBITDA profits, Eros compares well with stateside rivals at 3.4 times EBITDA, or , whose ratio stands at 2.8. Lions Gate and CBS are also increasing their effective debt load, while Eros is reducing its own. But the company does generate positive free cash flows -- and healthy ones at that. Thirty-three percent of Splunk's trailing sales trickled all the way down the cash flow statement, turning into free cash at the end. Still not impressed? Consider this:  only keeps 23% of its revenues in the form of free cash flows at the end of the day.Yet, Apple's market cap sits at 12.2 times trailing free cash flows. Splunk? Well, have a look: data by  .So, yeah, Splunk shares have come a long way down in recent months but the stock remains very richly valued.

Splunk posted a negative surprise of 14.29% in the last quarter. The company has posted an average negative surprise of 24.57% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.In the last quarter, Splunk posted greater-than-expected losses despite significant improvement in revenues. The higher-than-expected loss was primarily due to a sharp rise in operating expenses.We believe that Splunk's strong product pipeline will continue to boost top-line growth. However, increasing investments in research and development, coupled with higher operating costs, are anticipated to be a near-term drag on profitability. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins in the near term.In July, the company acquired a machine learning and analytics services provider - Caspida, Inc. for $190 million.This deal significantly strengthens Splunk's cyber security offerings. Caspida has made a name for itself in using machine learning to automatically detect threats, which when coupled with its extensive data management portfolio can significantly improve security offerings.However, the company continues to face tough competition from established players such as International Business Machines  and Oracle  , which remains an overhang on the stock.For the second quarter, the company projects revenues within $138 million and $140 million and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 1% to 2%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Splunk is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. Thisis because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 51 cents.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $45 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.90. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.4% return against the $45 commitment, or a 4.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to SPLK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $45 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Splunk Inc sees its shares fall 35% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $42.10 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.90 from $45), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.5% annualized rate of return. Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45 strike is located relative to that history:  The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $45 strike for the 4.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

The company will be bearing the expense organically. As of Apr 2015, Splunk had cash and cash equivalents of $413.5 million.

Caspida has made a name for itself in using machine learning to automatically detect threats, which when coupled with Splunk's extensive data management portfolio can significantly improve security offerings.Cyber security has become a major problem for all institutions both in the private and government space. Lately, a large number of attacks have gone undetected because they were made using trusted credentials. Moreover, the increasing adoption of \"Internet of Things\" has exposed networks and devices to such attacks.According to research firm, MarketsandMarkets, the cyber security market is expected to touch $170.21 billion by 2020 from $106.32 billion in 2015, growing at an annual growth rate of 9.8%.We believe that the addition of Caspida's capabilities will place Splunk in a favorable position in the cyber security market with an advanced and comprehensive product portfolio.Also, the move comes at an opportune time when other bigger players in the market including International Business Machines  and Oracle  are also vying for an increasing share of the booming cyber security market.Currently, Splunk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Five9, Inc.  is a better-ranked stock in the space, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

We\u2019ve invested in several of these types of companies in my GameChangers service over the years, one of which we\u2019ll talk more about in just a moment.First, let\u2019s start with two of the biggest and best big data names out there. They\u2019re among the best pure plays, and while I\u2019m not sure the time is quite right to invest in either right now, they are both garnering some buzz in the tech world.The first is Splunk (SPLK). Splunk\u2019s flagship product is Splunk Enterprise, which at its core is a proprietary machine data engine that enables dynamic creation on the fly. Users can then run queries on data without having to understand the structure of the information prior to collection and indexing.Faster, streamlined processes mean more efficient (and more profitable) businesses.While Splunk is very small in terms of revenues, with January 2015 fiscal year sales of just $451 million, it is growing rapidly, and I\u2019m keeping an eye on the name as it may present a strong opportunity down the road.However, I do not want to overpay for it. Splunk brings effective technology to the table that is gaining market acceptance, and has strong security software partners with its recent entry into security analytics. At the right price, the stock could also be a takeover candidate for a larger IT company looking to enhance its Big Data presence.Another name on my radar is Tableau Software (DATA), which performs similar functions as Splunk\u2019s. Its primary product, VizQL, translates drag-and-drop actions into data queries. In this way, the company puts data directly in the hands of decision makers, without first having to go through technical specialists.In fact, the company believes all employees, no matter what their rank in the company, can use their product, leading to the democratization of data.DATA is also growing rapidly, even faster than Splunk. Revenues were up 78% in 2014, and 75% in the first quarter of 2015, including license revenue growth of more than 70%. That rate is expected to slow somewhat, with revenues for all of 2015 estimated to increase to a still strong 50%.Tableau stock is also very expensive, trading at 12X expected 2015 revenues of $618 million and close to 300X projected EPS of 40 cents for the year. DATA is a little risky to buy at current levels, but it is a name to keep an eye on in any pullback.The company we made money on earlier this year in my GameChangers service is Red Hat (RHT). We booked a 15% profit in just a few months after it popped 11% on fourth-quarter earnings.Red Hat is the world\u2019s largest leading provider of open-source solutions, providing software to 90% of Fortune 500 companies. Some of RHT\u2019s customers include well-known names like Sprint (), Adobe Systems () and Cigna Corporation ().Management\u2019s goal is to become the undisputed leader of enterprise cloud computing, and it sees its popular Linux operating system as a way to the top. If RHT is successful \u2014 as I expect it will be \u2014 Red Hat should have a lengthy period of expanded growth as corporations increasingly move into the cloud.Red Hat\u2019s operating results had always clearly demonstrated that its solutions are gaining greater acceptance in IT departments, as revenues had more doubled in the five years between 2009 and 2014 from $748 million to $1.53 billion. I had expected to see the strong sales growth continue throughout 2015, and it did. As I mentioned, impressive fiscal fourth-quarter results sent the shares 11% higher.I recommended my subscribers sell their stake in the company at the end of March because I believed any further near-term upside was limited. Since then, shares have traded mostly between $75 and $80. It is now at the very top of that range and may be on the verge of breaking above it after the company reported fiscal first-quarter results last night.Although orders were a little slow, RHT beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines in the first quarter. Earnings of 44 cents per share were up 29% quarter-over-quarter, besting estimates on the Street for earnings of 41 cents. Revenue climbed 14% to $481 million, while analysts had been expecting $472.6 million.At this point, RHT is now back in uncharted territory, climbing to a new 52-week high earlier today. This is a company with plenty of growth opportunities ahead, and while growth may slow a bit in the near term following the stock\u2019s impressive climb so far this year, RHT stands to gain as corporation continue to adopt additional cloud technologies.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["etwork security solutions provider  in partnership with Splunk, Inc.  , a provider of a platform for machine data analytics software, has launched a cyber security app for enterprises and service providers.Fortinet's FortiGate App for Splunk Enterprise uses the latter's platform to analyze log data produced by FortiGate appliances and thereby boosts threat-detection and response times. It offers real time multivariate threat uncertainty, visualization and strange behavior detection within the framework of the organization's entire security data. Therefore, it enables enterprises and service providers to protect their networks from cyberattacks.Leveraging Splunk solutions and the interoperability with its collaborative security model, the app enables enterprises to quickly and effectively identify the most serious threats to their businesses and then quickly automate their defense against those threats.The FortiGate Application for Splunk 1.1 is available to customers for download from Splunkbase.Cyber security is an area of concern and investment today, given the increasing number of cyber-attacks. Cloud technology is being increasingly adopted by businesses to innovate and drive growth. However, this makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which can cost them millions of dollars.With the increasing threats, Siloed (or isolate) security solutions are not sufficient. A joint security model that expands aggregate awareness and ability of the siloed solutions is therefore needed to strengthen the enterprises' defense position.Research firm MarketsandMarkets predicts that the cyber security market will touch $170.21 billion by 2020 from $106.32 billion in 2015, growing at an annual growth rate of 9.8%.Therefore, both the firms stand to gain from this collaborative effort. They will be able to boost their internal security offerings, deliver even greater value and protection to customers, lower their internal integration costs and capture greater market share.Both Fortinet and Splunk carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the technology space include Manhattan Associates, Inc.  and Amazon.com Inc.  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

After climbing 2.5% in Thursday's regular session, however, shares of the operational intelligence software company have largely given back those gains in after-hours trading as of this writing. But that doesn't mean the results weren't great.For Splunk's fiscal first-quarter 2016, revenue climbed 46% year over year, to $125.7 million -- above estimates for revenue of $118.2 million -- including 40% growth in license sales, to $71.9 million, and a 55% increase from maintenance and services, to $53.8 million. Based on generally accepted accounting principles, that translated to an operating loss of $71 million, and a GAAP net loss of $0.57 per share. On an adjusted basis, however, Splunk achieved a net loss of $0.01 per share, again beating analysts' estimates for a wider adjusted net loss of $0.03 per share.Meanwhile, Splunk's quarterly adjusted operating margin was negative 0.6%, and it generated operating cash flow of $28.6 million, or 22.8% of total revenue. After accounting for property and equipment purchases, Splunk's free cash flow was $22.2 million. That cash flow helps Splunk continue investing in sales, marketing, and research and development. In turn, those investments aid Splunk in its decision to forsake bottom-line profits to chase top-line growth in these early stages of its fast-growing, high-tech market.In the first quarter alone, Splunk's R&D spending soared more than 50% year over year, to $44.7 million, while sales and marketing expenses jumped a slightly more modest 43.5%, to $102 million. As growth in the industry wanes over time, Splunk should emerge an even stronger leader with greater market share as a result.Splunk's efforts are already bearing fruit. The company signed more than 450 new enterprise customers last quarter to end the period with more than 9,500 worldwide. That esteemed client list now includes 80 members of the Fortune 100, and new and expanded relationships in Q1 include the likes of  , Bloomberg, the City of Los Angeles,  Playstation Network, and Thomson Reuters.\"Our customers are moving toward enterprisewide adoption of our products and solutions for a growing set of use cases,\" explained Splunk CEO Godfrey Sullivan. \"We welcomed a record number of new customers to Splunk Cloud driven by the compelling value delivered by our solutions across on-premises, cloud and hybrid environments.\"This growth shows no signs of letting up, either. Last month, for example, Splunk announced the international availability of Splunk Cloud in EMEA and APAC through nine  Web Services global regions. And in March, Splunk introduced Splunk Light as a more affordable option to target individual consumers and smaller IT environments. Splunk also recently released a new version of Splunk MINT to focus on mobile app performance, problems, and usage.As a result, for the current quarter, Splunk anticipates revenue between $138 million and $140 million, and adjusted operating margin between 1% and 2%. By contrast, analysts were modeling a breakeven quarter, and lower revenue of $136.4 million.Finally, for the full fiscal year 2016, Splunk expects revenue between $610 million and $614 million, or an increase over the  it provided in February for revenue of $600 million. Wall Street, for its part, was modeling fiscal 2016 revenue of $603.5 million.In the end, perhaps investors are simply taking profits after hours given Splunk's recent gains. Going into today's close, Splunk stock was up more than 20% so far in 2015, and 54% during the past year. But in my opinion, this was yet another solid report from an industry-leading company, and I think patient investors who don't mind sitting tight stand to reap continued rewards going forward.Bad news for your credit card company. The plastic in your wallet may soon be gone forever. And once it is, it could cost Capital One, American Express, Chase, and all the rest as much as $18 million a day! Good news for you. Because when you're finally able to say \"goodbye\" to the cards stuck in your wallet, a little-known tech company responsible for finally putting an end to plastic could hand its investors life-changing profits.

Last quarter, the company posted a loss of a penny, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of breakeven results. It is also worth noting that Salesforce has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of four preceding quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 223.33%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Although Salesforce reported adjusted loss in the fourth quarter, it fared better than the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company's robust top-line performance was an encouraging factor in the last reported quarter. Revenues surpassed the consensus mark and increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily backed by growth across all its business segments and Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform.The higher number of deal wins were encouraging as were the geographical contributions. We consider the rapid adoption of Salesforce1 Customer Platform to be a positive. Overall, the company's diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain catalysts. Moreover, strategic acquisitions and the resultant synergies are expected to benefit over the long run.Considering the increased customer adoption and satisfactory performances, market research firm Gartner acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider. We believe that the rapid adoption of Salesforce' platforms indicate solid growth opportunities in the ever-growing cloud computing segment.Although the company is growing reasonably in the cloud market, growth prospects have been rationalized to a considerable extent due to intensifying competition from International Business Machines  , Oracle Corp. and SAP AG. Moreover, currency fluctuations and increased investments in international expansion and data centers could impact near-term results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Salesforce will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $40 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.85. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 7.1% return against the $40 commitment, or a 4.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to SPLK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $40 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Splunk Inc sees its shares fall 40.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $37.15 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.85 from $40), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.2% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $40 strike for the 4.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

Splunk posted a negative surprise of 11.43% in the last quarter. The company has posted an average negative surprise of 237.17% over the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.In the last reported quarter, Splunk suffered more-than-expected losses despite significant improvement in revenues. The increasing loss was primarily due to a sharp rise in operating expenses.In this quarter, Splunk formed a partnership with Box for the development of an information security model, in collaboration with other partners from the Box Trust ecosystem. Splunk enterprise was also selected by Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich for providing a platform with improved operational intelligence.Recently, major companies like Yahoo have also chosen solutions from Splunk like Hunk: Splunk Analytics for Hadoop, NoSQL Data Stores and Splunk Enterprise to obtain in-depth insights from their big data resources. Additionally, Splunk's solutions have been selected by the likes of Shazam and Vantrix to enhance their businesses.We believe that Splunk's strong product pipeline will continue to boost top-line growth. However, increasing investments in research and development, coupled with higher operating costs, are anticipated to be a near-term drag on profitability. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales and marketing expenditures are also predicted to rise significantly, thereby hurting margins in the near term.Moreover, the company continues to face tough competition from established players such as International Business Machines (  ) and Oracle (  ), which remains an overhang on the stock.Nevertheless, at the end of last quarter, Splunk provided encouraging guidance for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. For fourth quarter, the company projected revenues within $135 million and $137 million and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 4% to 5%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Splunk is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 38 cents. Though Splunk's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Here is a stock you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Veeva Systems Inc.

Even after rising 3% into Thursday's close, shares of the operational intelligence software specialist jumped another 7% in after-hours trading.Fiscal fourth-quarter 2015 revenue climbed 48% year over year, to $147.4 million, including a 43% increase in license revenue, to $98.1 million. That translated to adjusted income of $0.09 per share. Analysts, on average, were only expecting earnings of $0.04 per share on sales of $137.1 million.Quarterly adjusted operating margin rose to 7.8%, and Splunk generated operating cash flow of $51.5 million, or roughly 34.9% of total revenue. After accounting for property and equipment purchases, free cash flow came in at roughly $48.8 million.For the full fiscal year 2015, Splunk's revenue climbed 49%, to $450.9 million, including 42% growth in license revenue, to $283.2 million. Adjusted earnings for the year came in at $11 million, or $0.09 per share. Analysts were modeling fiscal 2015 earnings and revenue of $0.04 per share and $440.7 million, respectively.Next, fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin was 2.7%, while operating cash flow came in at $104 million, or 23% of total revenue. For reference, that's just above the targeted 21% to 22% range for operating cash flow margin provided by Splunk management during last quarter's call. Meanwhile, fiscal 2015 free cash flow was $90 million. Investors should also keep in mind that, based on generally accepted accounting principles, Splunk technically achieved an operating loss of $57.1 million in its most recent quarter, and GAAP net loss of $0.47 per share. But while that might sound bad, I'll reiterate it's not indicative of a failing business.To the contrary, this early in its long-term story, Splunk's primary focus is both growing its top line and securing market share in this burgeoning, high-tech industry. To do so in its most recent quarter, Splunk dedicated a whopping $47.3 million to research and development, and a staggering $107.7 million to sales and marketing. Despite the fact this means putting aside bottom-line profits in the near term, this should be  to see for patient, long-term investors as Splunk continues to extend its market leadership position.Splunk added more than 600 new customers during the quarter, bringing its base to more than 9,000 customers worldwide. Among the most notable names to either initiate or expand their relationships with Splunk in Q4 were Kaspersky Lab,  , Sephora,  ,  , the U.S. Department of State, The Washington Post, and  .\"We finished FY15 with strong performance across the board,\" added Splunk CEO Godfrey Sullivan, \"and posted our best quarter yet for both Splunk Cloud and the Splunk App for Enterprise Security. Our investments in cloud and solutions are helping to drive global customer adoption.\" Splunk also offered a revised look at guidance. Now, it expects fiscal 2016 revenue of roughly $600 million, representing a $25 million increase over Splunk's  provided three months ago. Adjusted operating margin should also be between 2% and 3%.  Wall Street, for its part, was looking for full-year revenue and earnings of $580 million and $0.11 per share, respectively.For the current quarter, Splunk sees revenue between $116 million and $118 million, with adjusted operating margin between negative 2% and 4%. Analysts were expecting a first-quarter loss of $0.04 per share on lower sales of $115.4 million.In the end, Splunk stock certainly doesn't look \"cheap\" based on traditional metrics. But that's also not entirely unexpected for a fast-growing business that has yet to achieve sustained profitability. For now, given its better-than-expected performance on all fronts, it's no surprise the market is bidding up the stock today.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 195.65%. It is worth noting that Synopsys has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 74.73%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys kicked off 2015 on a strong note with both the top and bottom lines witnessing a significant year-over-year improvement. The improvement came mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and effective cost management. The company's bottom line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though total revenue marginally fell short of the same.We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp. coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

Following Friday's rally, Splunk's stock has now traded higher by more than 60% in the past three months. Sentiment for the machine analytics company is definitely on the rise, but after its third-quarter earnings, I certainly have some concerns. Splunk's business falls under the umbrella of big data, which is the process of using information combined with software to help businesses make informed decisions. Big data companies such as  sell software to companies that provides insight into their respective industries. An example is helping a grocery retailer know where to place certain goods in a store based on buyer tendencies, or helping a pharmaceutical company know which drug compounds might treat a disease.Splunk differs from the traditional sense of big data in that it's analyzing machines rather than businesses and industries. Splunk's software gathers and analyzes data found on websites, servers, networks, mobile devices, and so on. It then sells that data to enterprise customers for the purpose of mitigating security risk, preventing fraud, improving service performance, and reducing operating costs.During Splunk's last quarter, it added more than 500 new customers, including the likes of  and  . As a result, Splunk now has more than 8,400 total customers. The operating outcome was revenue of $116 million, a 47.5% year-over-year increase -- not to mention that Splunk is profitable, finishing the quarter with a 2.2% operating margin.The quarter itself looks flawless. Therefore, it's no surprise that investors are buying the stock. However, the problem is valuation, leaving little long-term upside and the possibility for downside risk. Splunk's quarterly revenue has grown at a brisk and consistent quarterly pace since the 2012 IPO. The third quarter served as a continuation of this trend. data by Over the past four quarters, Splunk has created approximately $403 million in revenue. Its market capitalization stands at $8 billion. That means Splunk trades at nearly 20 times trailing-12-month sales.That said, Splunk's valuation is not a reflection of its current business performance. Instead, Splunk's market capitalization is a reflection of what investors hope the company will ultimately become -- a very large technology company that grows with the big data industry.The problem with this logic is that Splunk's industry is growing more crowded every year. The company faces competition from similar companies such as New Relic, which recently filed its prospectus to become publicly traded, with revenue growth of 84% during the first six months of 2014. With just $48 million in revenue through July, New Relic is much smaller than Splunk, but it's competition nonetheless.Splunk also competes against larger companies such as  , which recently launched a version of its vCenter service to compete against Splunk in the machine analytics space. Splunk is still expecting to grow revenue quite significantly next year, by 30% year over year to $575 million. If Splunk's market capitalization were to remain unchanged over the next year, it would still trade at nearly 14 times next year's expected sales. That's quite pricey, and it leaves little to be desired in the stock. Meanwhile, big data peer Tableau trades at less than 15 times trailing-12-month sales, and roughly 10 times next year's expected sales of $551 million. In addition to being a cheaper stock relative to sales, Tableau is growing faster. During Tableau's last quarter, it grew revenue 71% year over year and is expected to grow revenue by 41% in 2015, both of which are greater than Splunk's year-over-year performance.Given Splunk's market capitalization, the stock looks very risky. In essence, it's tough to see Splunk growing to become a multibillion-dollar-a-year business to support its market capitalization anytime soon, as year-over-year revenue growth naturally slows as a company grows larger. This means the investment upside is limited in the long term regardless of how well the company performed in the third quarter. In other words, Splunk's stock appears fully appreciated many years in advance.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. It could make early investors wildly rich.

We had previously analyzed the business when the company filed their first S-1. Yesterday, the company filed an  In the past two quarters, some of the key financial characteristics trajectory have improved materially.In the next seven or so charts, we'll explore how the Box business has evolved. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I've used New Relic's (  ) colors as a consistent legend. Box company data is powder blue, median values are black, and other company values are gray.While the company took a little longer to hit its stride than most, Box is growing revenues incredibly quickly. In the last months, the company will have grown more than 111%, and astounding figure for company generating more than $120M in revenue. The median publicly traded SaaS company achieves those growth rates at $13M in revenue and is unable to sustain them past $35M in trailing twelve months revenue.This extraordinary growth is readily apparent in this chart. In year six, Box was relatively close to the median for total revenue. In the last 12 to 18 months, the company has clearly pulled away and demonstrated exceptional revenue growth.File sharing products are viral. When one user adopts Box to share files, eventually many other users within a company will want to share files similarly to collaborate. This behavior engenders best-in-class account revenue expansion. Box reported greater than 30% annual account growth for each of the previous three years. To compare, I've plotted New Relic's account growth by year. Box been able to sustain greater than  , while New Relic's has been declining each year at about 9%. In short, this behavior is a massive and incredibly valuable engine of revenue growth for the business.Box took six years to reach $50M in revenue and is among great company including Hubspot (  ), Demandware (  ), Splunk (  ) and ServiceNow (NOW). But, as we saw in the previous charts, Box's initial ramp was slower, followed by meteoric revenue growth.To achieve this growth, Box has invested a huge amount of capital. In fact, the business has outspent almost every other company to achieve its revenue. However, in the last year, the business has reduced its investment and decreased its burn rate. When the company filed its first S-1, it reported net income as a percent of revenue at -191%. This figure has dropped by 30% to -136% in the last year, to about $168M.To achieve this cost reduction, Box reduced its investment in sales and marketing by 19%, from 169% of revenue to about 138% of revenue. At this pace, the company is still far above the norm. The tradeoff is that the company is also growing at 10x the rate of the median.As a result of a decrease in sales and marketing investment,  , a measure of how much revenue a dollar in sales and marketing yields, has doubled from 0.27 to 0.54, which is about 36% less than the median. This is a good sign for the business, especially when considering the average account expansion pattern noted above.In addition to relative sales and marketing expense reductions, the business reduced its investment in engineering, as a percentage of revenue from 50%+ to 37% in the last twelve months. While this figure is substantially above companies of a similar age, it's consistent with companies in their fifth year, who on average are growing as quickly as Box.Box's gross margins are 10 percentage points better than the median, at 79% and continue to rise as the company grows. Higher gross margins enable the company to invest more in customer acquisition and  .The average customer pays Box about $5,000 per year. Given the number of free accounts, this measure is likely a bit misleading. The largest customer has more than 95,000 seats and is likely worth more than $1M, but unfortunately, we don't have a distribution of customer account size or other proxy to get a better sense.Overall, Box has dramatically changed its investment strategy in sales & marketing and engineering investment, likely through a decrease in hiring, to reveal a very special business underneath. The company has best-in-class negative net churn, improving sales efficiency and exceptional revenue growth. Some may still point to much higher than median losses, but this objection will likely disappear with time. The company is proving it can cut costs by 30%, improve efficiency by 50% and still grow revenue 111% annually.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["plunk Inc. (  ) reported fiscal third-quarter 2015 loss of 38 cents per share, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents and the year-ago quarter loss of 13 cents per share. The wider loss was primarily due to a surge in operating expenses in the third quarter.Revenues surged 47.6% year over year to $116 million, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $107 million. Strong license sales and maintenance & services revenues primarily drove the upside.License sales (61.8% of revenues) jumped 41% year over year to $71.8 million. Maintenance & services revenues (38.2% of revenues) increased 59.5% from the year-ago quarter to $44.3 million.Adoption and implementation of its products within the enterprises is helping Splunk to generate more revenues. The company also added 500 new customers, which resulted in more than 8,400 customers worldwide. The clientele includes the likes of Automatic Data Processing (  ), AT & T (  ), Boeing Employees Credit Union, Cisco Systems, Comcast, SAP AG (  ) and others.During the quarter, the company announced the industry's first 100% uptime service level agreement for Splunk Cloud and a free Splunk Online Sandbox to provide customers an experience of Splunk Cloud instantly.Gross margin contracted 180 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 84.8%, primarily due to an unfavorable product mix. License gross margin declined 50 bps on a year-over-year basis, while maintenance & services contracted 90 bps in the quarter.Splunk continues to invest in research & development (R&D), which jumped 108.5% year over year to $39.5 million in the quarter. Sales & marketing (S&M) expense surged 61.6% from the prior-year quarter to $85.7 million. General & administrative expense increased 66% year over year to $21.4 million.The sharp jump in operating expenses (up 72.7% year over year) hurt profitability in the quarter. Operating loss (including stock-based compensation) was $45.5 million compared with a loss of $13.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Net loss (including stock-based compensation) was $45.8 million or 38 cents per share compared with a loss of $13.9 million or 13 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Splunk exited the third quarter with $796.4 million in cash & cash equivalents. Cash flow from operations was $24.2 million, while free cash flow was $20.2 million.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2015, Splunk expects revenues in the range of $135 to $137 million while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $133 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 4% to 5%.For fiscal 2015, revenues are likely to be in the range of $438 to $440 million (up from $423-$428 million expected earlier), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $429 million. The company expects to report non-GAAP operating margin of 1% to 2% for the fiscal year.For fiscal 2016, Splunk expects its total revenue to be approximately $575 million while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $571 million.We believe that Splunk's strong product pipeline will continue to boost the top line. However, increasing investments for R&D and higher operating costs are expected to remain a drag on profitability in the near term. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, S&M expenditure is expected to increase significantly, thereby hurting margins in the near term.Moreover, the company continues to face tough competition from established players such as International Business Machines, which will remain an overhang on the stock.Currently, Splunk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

That translated to adjusted earnings of $0.02 per share. Analysts, on average, were only expecting adjusted earnings of $0.01 per share on sales of $107.3 million.Meanwhile, adjusted operating margin came in at 2.3%, while Splunk generated operating cash flow of $24.3 million, or just higher than its stated goal for 2014 operating cash flow margin of 20%. After accounting for property and equipment purchases of roughly $4 million, free cash flow came in at roughly $20.2 million. It's also worth noting that, based on generally accepted accounting principles, Splunk technically achieved an operating loss of $48.3 million, and a GAAP net loss of $0.40 per share. For that, investors can thank the $39.5 million and $85.7 million that Splunk plowed into research and development, and sales and marketing, respectively, during the quarter.However, that's also not entirely out of character, as Splunk regularly  in its business, eschewing bottom-line profits in the name of adding customers and growing its top line. Believe it or not, this a great thing for investors to see so early in the game, as Splunk works to extend its market leadership position in this burgeoning, high-tech niche.Speaking to the progress of those investments, Splunk chairman and CEO Godfrey Sullivan elaborated, \"This quarter we released new versions of all of our core products, offered new solutions for mobile, wire, mainframe and sensor data, and strengthened our market teams.\"Consequently, Splunk saw growth in all of its core markets, and added another 500 new enterprise customers this quarter to bring its global customer base to more than 8,400. The more significant customers that are either new, or expanded their respective agreements in Q3, include  ,  ,  , and the U.S. Department of Energy. In addition,  its use of Splunk software shortly after the third quarter closed.Splunk also expects current-quarter revenue in the range of $135 million to $137 million, with adjusted operating margin between 4% and 5%. In addition, Splunk raised its full fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance to a range of $438 million to $440 million -- compared to the old range of $423 million to $428 million -- with adjusted operating margin between 1% and 2% -- compared to 1% previously. By contrast, Wall Street's models were much less optimistic, calling for fourth-quarter earnings of $0.04 per share on sales of $133.26 million, and full fiscal year 2015 earnings of $0.03 per share on sales of $428 million.Finally, Splunk offered its first peak at the coming year with initial guidance for fiscal year 2016 revenue of $575 million. Once again, that's higher than analysts' expectations for sales of $570.3 million, and represents year-over-year growth of roughly 31% from the midpoint of Splunk's new fiscal 2015 range.All things considered, it appears Splunk has no intention of slowing down its quest to help customers understand the massive quantities of useful operational data that it's generating. This was an undoubtedly solid quarter, and I can't blame the market for bidding up shares of Splunk.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

But earlier this week, Splunk provided an encouraging update through a press release highlighting its particularly promising relationship with tech giant  . Specifically, Splunk says, Adobe has chosen to not only expand its use of Splunk Enterprise deployed on  Web Services, but will also now use Splunk Cloud -- which runs on AWS -- and the Splunk App for Enterprise Security to support global IT operations, application delivery, and security. Splunk's  goes on to state, \"Adobe believes that Splunk solutions are vital to both its cloud transformation and continuously evolving security portfolio to help ensure customers receive a great experience with the highest levels of service and security.\" But with so many customers added each quarter, why does this merit a press release all of its own?Consider the fact Adobe itself is right in the middle of implementing a massive, accelerating transition away from traditional license-based software, and toward its new cloud-based subscription offerings. In fact, Adobe  Creative Cloud subscriptions last quarter alone, good for a nearly 22% sequential increase, and bringing its total to 2.81 million. All told, 63% of Adobe's third-quarter revenue came from those recurring subscriptions, up from 52% during the previous quarter.In short, Adobe's decision to essentially double down on Splunk's software at this point in the transition represents an  vote of confidence in the smaller company.Of course, the timing of the announcement is also convenient. Splunk's fiscal third-quarter 2015 results are slated for release on Nov. 20, after the market's close, and the market has high expectations. Analysts, on average, will be looking for revenue to climb 36.4% year over year, to $107.2 million, which should translate to adjusted earnings of roughly $0.01 per share. Keeping in mind that its top line exceeded expectations by more than $7 million last quarter, Splunk's own guidance calls for quarterly sales between $105 million and $107 million, with adjusted operating margin of roughly 1%.The latter might not sound particularly impressive, but we should also note Splunk last quarter reiterated guidance for full-year operating cash flow margin to be roughly 20% of total revenue. And Splunk  each quarter into research and development and sales and marketing, all at the expense of its bottom line. This, according to management, is to ensure it maintains its leadership position as it fights for share in the continuously growing market opportunity for operational intelligence software.For now, it makes perfect sense for Splunk to continue its outsized focus on both expanding existing relationships and bringing new customers into the fold. Regardless of where its bottom line clocks in next week, then, investors should keep a close eye on how effectively it has been doing so.In any case, check back here on  after the report for my take on how Splunk fared. But if this week's Adobe agreement is an indication of a broader trend, I like Splunk's chances of success. A major technological shift is happening in the automotive industry.

Licensing revenues were up 41% to $71.8 million. The company released new versions of all of its major products during the quarter, while launching new mobile products. Adjusted operating income was $2.7 million, or a non-GAAP operating margin of 2.3%.

The Street was calling for just $107.2 million in revenue and $0.01 per share in adjusted net income. In August, Splunk guided third quarter revenue to a range of $105 million-$107 million, and expected its non-GAAP operating margin to be around 1%. It gets better.

To be fair, Splunk is still unprofitable on a GAAP basis because it's spending so heavily on investing in future growth, but those investments will prove to be well worth it in the long run. Right now, growing the top line is the No. 1 priority, much like other growth companies. The public sector is also performing very well, with Splunk enjoying a record quarter in this market segment.

And perhaps most telling, Amazon's cash used in investing activities over the previous three months alone totaled nearly $1 billion.The gravity of that loss is notable, but it was really nothing new. Since founding the company in 1994, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has  shunned GAAP profits in favor of offering low-priced products, taking retail market share, and opting to maximize cash flow. Amazon then invests its cash back into growing its various businesses. If this sounds strange, note Bezos was recently named the  by Harvard Business Review in a study objectively based on shareholder returns from the start of his tenure.Then there's Twitter, which has a much smaller operating scope, but more than makes up for it with its nearly $1 billion loss over the past year. That includes a net loss of $175 million last quarter alone, as Twitter more than doubled its revenue stream to $361 million. Even so, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo called it \"another very strong financial quarter,\" and insisted he is \"confident in our ability to build the largest daily audience in the world, over time, by strengthening the core, reducing barriers to consumption and  .\"[emphasis mine] Over the long-term, as Twitter continues to invest in building new apps, growing its users, and improving monetization, it'll come out a significantly larger, stronger company once its GAAP losses finally subside.Next up is Splunk, which may not be a familiar name, but is growing revenue extraordinarily fast as it carves out a new niche in operational intelligence software for other businesses. Last quarter, Splunk added an impressive 500 names to its now 7,900-customer base, including the likes of  ,  , and even the U.S. Department of Defense. At the same time, Splunk expects operating cash flow margin to be 20% total 2014 revenue, and consistently pours large amounts into research & development (over $34 million last quarter) and sales & marketing (almost $80 million) to seize what management describes as a continually expanding market opportunity.Meanwhile, cyber-security specialist FireEye -- which incidentally  a new app for Splunk Enterprise just last month -- is growing revenue even more quickly. And similar to Splunk, for 2014 FireEye has told investors to expect R&D expenses in the range of 41% to 44% of total revenue, and sales and marketing to range from 76% to 79% of total revenue. It doesn't take a math genius to realize no company can turn a profit given the sum of those expenses alone. But that's exactly what investors should love to hear as FireEye shuffles for as much market share as possible in its own burgeoning, high-tech industry.Finally, there's Salesforce.com, which has consistently focused on achieving top-line growth to secure its position as the world's leading CRM platform provider. Again, it might seem counter-intuitive that to do so required incurring losses of almost $400 million over the past year. But astute investors realize Salesforce has also grown cash flow from operations for each year since 2010, and generated over $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations over the past 12 months alone, according to S&P Capital IQ. Better yet, last quarter Salesforce management gave investors a light at the end of the tunnel by promising  remains a priority.Of course, at a certain point that should be the case for each of these businesses. But in the end, the pattern and takeaway remains the same: Sometimes a company's conscious decision to lose money is a great way to ensure long-term oriented investors ultimately end up with more of it.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed. It could make early investors wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"... But you'll probably just call it \"how I made my millions.\" Don't be too late to the party-  when the web goes dark.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2014 The Motley Fool, LLC.

Those includedFireEye (  ),ServiceNow (  ),Splunk (  ) andTableau Software (  ).In mid-February, before the wave of selling started, four software groups ranked in the top 20 among 197 industries tracked by IBD -- a solid showing. On the IBD 50 list, Tableau,NQ Mobile (NQ),Manhattan Associates (MANH) andNetEase (NTES) were all riding high.As of Friday, the security software group was 18% off its early March high. The database software group was 17% off its peak. Enterprise software had tumbled 20% and medical software developers, as a group, were 24% off their high.In the past week, none of IBD's 10 software groups ranked in the top 50 industries. Six of the 10 groups ranked weaker than 150. On an individual basis, NQ Mobile is 71% off its February high. FireEye, a market favorite early in the year, on Friday traded 68% below its high from early March. The tumbles stand in sharp contrast to the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which corrected nearly 10% in March and April, but has since recovered to new highs.Part of the reason for the software sell-off was valuation, according to Frederick Ziegel, an analyst for Topeka Capital Markets.Though not considered a high growth company, Vasco's consistent profits and smaller but growing year-over-year quarterly revenue provides some insight into how investors are evaluating software companies, he says.In addition, Ziegel says, attitudes toward investing in the sector also changed.\"Earlier this year investors took the attitude that you spend money as fast as you can to build the business and then all of a sudden they reversed course,\" Ziegel said. Suddenly, \"spending money like you were going to be dead tomorrow\" fell out of fashion, he said.Another, more simple factor in the year's massive software sell-off: skittish investors, says Tom Vandeventer, manager of the Tocqueville Opportunity Fund.\"The way the market works these days is if there is something going on and people don't understand it, it feels like everybody just jumps to the sidelines,\" he told IBD. \"The control of volume is really in the hands of the traders and not the investors.\"Beyond Vasco, other software developers that have remained in investors' favor includePalo Alto Networks (PANW),OpenText (OTEX) andSynchronoss Technologies (SNCR).Palo Alto is a leading provider of security firewall systems. OpenText makes content management software to help companies manage unstructured data from Web pages, websites andMicrosoft (MSFT) Word documents.Synchronoss has emerged as a leading provider of the activation process for smartphones, tablets and cellphones for service providers. It also dragged investors through a harrowing double-dip correction, diving 36% between October and February and scooping out another 27% divot from March to May. The stock has since recovered sharply, and was trading up 41% year-to-date on Friday.All four companies, including Vasco, are growing and posted recent quarters with earnings and revenue ahead of expectations. The common denominator: All are chasing segments of growing markets. By 2016, global sales of security software and hardware systems are expected to reach $84.5 billion, up 37% from 2012, says market tracker Gartner.Sales of enterprise content management software are expected to reach $9.32 billion in 2017, up 82.3% from last year, says The Radicati Group. By 2015, sales of global public cloud services will reach $184.5 billion, up 64.5% from 2012, Gartner says.Just in the past couple of weeks, cyberattacks onJPMorgan (JPM),Home Depot (HD) and celebrity users ofApple (AAPL) iPhones have dominated headlines. The increasing number of such threats continues to drive demand for some but not all security software developers.Vasco's primary customers are financial institutions, Ziegel says.\"The overwhelmingly largest percentage of their business is with banks that use the Vasco authentication products for their consumer online banking customers,\" he said.Palo Alto is building out its role in firewall systems through recent acquisitions. Those included Cyvera, a security software company focused on deciphering hacking techniques, for $200 million earlier this year.Investors also applauded Palo Alto's agreement to pay $175 million toJuniper Networks (JNPR) to end a patent infringement tussle with the network gear maker, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets & Co.The Juniper lawsuit was a huge overhang that has been removed, Ives said, and Palo Alto has \"expanded their market opportunity all around this next gen firewall market, which is really the golden jewel in cyber security.\"OpenText's reaccelerating revenue growth is the result of a change in strategy about two years ago involving several recent acquisitions.The integration plan helped boost organic revenue growth by offering customers more than one product in one easy-to-use system, says Mark Schappel, an analyst for The Benchmark Co.Formerly, OpenText salespeople that sold software for managing Word documents would have to go back and try to sell software for managing Web pages and websites separately.\"By integrating everything, there is some leverage they bring to the table, giving them new features and giving customers a reason to buy their stuff,\" Schappel told IBD.Synchronoss derives more than half of its revenue from its mobile activation business for carriers. But its cloud business, which allows mobile users to store and access data over the Internet, is growing fast.Cloud revenue jumped 74% to $46.7 million in the company's second quarter vs. the year-earlier period, setting the stage for the recent stock surge, Ives says.\"That has been the pizzazz part of the story,\" Ives said. \"Investors are starting to see Synchronoss in a different light after what they have done in the mobile cloud piece.\"VC software investments topped $10 billion in the first half of this year -- the most since 2000, when software companies raised $13.6 billion in the same six-month window, say PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association.The pace of investment stands in stark contrast to investors dumping shares of many publicly traded software companies.But private investors differ from their public counterparts, says Mark McCaffrey, global software leader for PwC.The private markets don't look at it from the standpoint that, in some of these disruptive markets, you may have a winner and you may have a loser, he says.\"They are betting on the fact that their (company) is going to be the winner, so they are giving it a healthy evaluation,\" he told IBD.Palo Alto, OpenText and Synchronoss continue to invest in R&D and sales and marketing at varying rates.Vasco's Q2 sales and marketing costs rose 8%, but its R&D costs declined 2.6%.Vasco is acquiring technology rather than developing it internally. In late May it agreed to acquire Risk IDS, a provider of authentication software to global banks for an undisclosed sum. A year ago, it paid $21.9 million to acquire Cronto, another maker of authentication software for online banking transactions.In its third quarter, Palo Alto's sales and marketing costs rose 62.3% vs. the year-earlier period, while its R&D expenses jumped 79.6%.But there is some difference between Palo Alto and other high-growth names, Ziegel says.\"They are being aggressive in expanding their R&D and sales and marketing, but they are profitable on a non-GAAP basis whereas some companies like FireEye are not,\" he said.More spending could be coming. In late June, Palo Alto said it plans to raise $500 million from the sale of senior notes that could be used for working capital and acquisitions.In its Q4 ending June 30, OpenText's sales and marketing costs increased 27.6%. R&D spending only climbed 12%.OpenText has never been a big spender, which is a reason why their operating margin is around 30%, says Schappel.\"The company never poured an inordinate amount of money into those areas,\" he said. \"They are not one of those 'grow at any price' companies.\"Neither is Synchronoss. In Q2, the company's R&D spending grew by 5.7%, while sales and marketing expenses rose 14.7%.In early August, it signed a deal withTime Warner Cable (TWC) to activate subscribers on that company's remote access home automation service. The company is also working withAT&T (T) to provide activation services for smart cars hooked to the Internet.Synchronoss has also used acquisitions to build its cloud business. On Aug. 12 the company raised $230 million from the sale of senior notes, which it plans to use for internal investment or acquisitions.The growing number of disruption cases -- situations in which new technologies or innovative companies change how companies either conduct or view business -- has piqued the interest of private investors, says McCaffrey.You have Big Data, security and storage, he said, \"that is why the funding is so hot because all of these areas are impacting so many different markets and are becoming a megatrend around the world.\"Synchronoss might be in the best position to capture a majority market share because they have no significant rivals in their fast-growing cloud business, says Tavis McCourt, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates.\"There is nobody that has scaled up a carrier-grade platform . .. with the kind of scale that Synchronoss has,\" he told IBD.For Vasco, hackers continue to drive demand among banks, said Vasco President Jan Valcke during a Q2 conference call with analysts on July 24.\"The pipeline remains strong in banking, and I can say it's basically in all regions,\" he said.The company's near-term outlook is largely determined by external factors, Ziegel says.The biggest risk: Their business is very heavily international.\"So they are exposed to Europe's economic conditions and they are exposed to the banks, which can be kind of sporadic in the way they order product,\" he said.Ziegel says Palo Alto is facing internal and external issues.\"You have competition but the bigger challenge is: Can they manage their growth and get to the profitability level they are targeting by the end of fiscal 2016?\" he said.OpenText's biggest challenge might be more near-term than a long-term issue. At issue is the company's $1.17 billion January acquisition of GXS, a cloud-based business-to-business integration services vendor.Integration and growth are key issues, Schappel says.\"When they bought them (GXS) was a company that was not growing. When it came their way, they probably couldn't resist the price,\" he said. \"They need to get it growing or GXS is going to weigh on their top line.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the December 20th expiration.

Qlik exceeded analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, and shares traded 6% higher in after-hours action.Qlik's sales rose 26% year over year, stopping at $131 million. Analysts would have settled for $124 million. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share fell from $0.05 to $0.01, just above Wall Street's break-even target.On a constant currency basis, revenues increased by 27% in the Americas and 21% in Europe. The catch-all \"rest of the world\" segment, which covers all other geographies, saw sales surging 50% higher. This fast-growing division now accounts for 12% of Qlik's total sales, up from 10% in the year-ago period.From a product category point of view, Qlik's professional services are growing much faster than license sales and maintenance agreements. Once again, the fastest-growing portion of Qlik's overall sales is also the smallest, as professional services still only account for 9.2% of the company's total revenues.In a prepared statement, Qlik CEO Lars Bjork explained the forces behind these strong results. He said:The two-product strategy Bjork mentioned refers to the rapid data visualization tool Qlik Sense, next to the more powerful QlikView analysis suite. These tools attack the business data analysis market from different angles: QlikView offers a more complete feature set, but a steeper learning curve, while Sense delivers results in a simpler, but less powerful, package.Sense is a brand-new product, released in September. This product chases a larger-volume market than QlikView ever addressed. Of course, the license fees are smaller for the simpler tool, but Qlik is explicitly looking for a larger market share in the business intelligence field right now.Looking ahead, Qlik expects revenues of roughly $178 million, and adjusted earnings near $0.28 per diluted share. Both of these figures are below Wall Street's fourth-quarter targets at $184 million and $0.34 per share, respectively.Investors did not see this report as a harbinger of larger industry trends.

Yet both Splunk and Tableau have market capitalizations that are far higher than Tibco's, reflecting a premium that Wall Street has placed on growth. Tibco Software's stock also continues to trade near a multiyear low, while its peers thrive, suggesting it has something to learn from Splunk and Tableau. Tibco, Tableau, and Splunk all operate within the realm of big data, an industry that IDC estimates will be worth $16.1 billion this year. This business is widespread across all industries, analyzing data and then helping customers to use the information to make better decisions.Big data can be used to assess the data usage of telecom customers, thus giving companies a breakdown by geography, network, age, etc., ofwhich customers use the most data. Big data can be used in medicine to predict which chemical compounds might cure certain diseases. Or it can tell grocery stores which items are most popular among certain age groups, or most sought by thieves. Essentially, the possibilities are endless.Tibco, Tableau, and Splunk are all similar companies, but they have certain distinguishing differences. Tibco uses fast data, based on real-time information, which is popular with enterprise customers. Tableau uses slow data, information collected over a period of months. Splunk offers machine data, which is collected in data centers, such as information based on network devices, security devices, websites, mobile devices, cash registers, and ATMs. Given each company's niche, and the ever-growing presence of big data, investors might think all three companies are on a level playing field. However, while Tableau and Splunk saw year over year revenue growth of 81.8% and 51.8%, respectively, during their last quarters, Tibco revenue grew just 3.3%.Tibco also experienced a 7% decline in licensing revenue, which accounts for 30% of total revenue.Meanwhile, Splunk saw license revenue growth of 44%, while Tableau's grew 80%. With license revenue being a good indication of future service revenue, investors can assume that Tibco's problem lies in weak license performance. And w hile poor licensing revenue might be Tibco's outcome, the reason for its underperformance is rather simple. In an  said his company's software is superior because of its real-time function, and that customers say \"it is just as, if not easier, to use.\" However, Ranadive acknowledged that \" what's not easier is to pay for it,\" in regards to software from Tibco versus Tableau.Specifically, Ranadive noted that Tableau allows users to purchase softwarewith a credit card, and that Tableau's service is very cheap to consume. Tableau has placed an emphasis on simplicity with its applications, while also focusing on low cost, using this approach to steal market share from Tibco .Apparently, Splunk took notice of Tableau's approach; after a 40% stock value loss during the first five months of 2014, the company cut pricing of its popular Splunk Cloud analytics platform by 33% during its last quarter. The result was accelerated growth, along with a stock that has surged nearly 30% since its most recent quarterly results.Big data may be fast-growing, but it is also a service that both enterprise and small businesses don't want to pay excessively to own. Ranadive understands that Tibco must lower prices and make it easier to purchase software.\"We have customers that have millions of dollars invested into data, becoming the backbone of what they are doing,\" the CEO said. \"So, we have to make sure that all pieces fit together so when we offer a low-end product to purchase off your credit card, we're not creating unhappy customers on the high-end of the process.\" Ranadive made this statement in May, and while Tibco's growth has worsened since then, Tableau and Splunk have never appeared stronger. In other words, if Tableau's pricing and accessibility strategy does not make clear that it's time for Tibco to lower prices, then Splunk's success following its cut most certainly serves as proof. Ranadive and other Tibco executives should take this knowledge in stride, quit procrastinating, and make the necessary changes to reduce prices.

In addition to providing software products, Splunk is helping communities harness the power of big data and create projects that have a lasting social impact. The company's commitment to making a difference through data has made it a favorite among top mutual funds such as Calvert Investments, which specializes in Socially Responsible Investing or SRI.Investing in socially responsible stocks is a popular strategy today that aims to find companies with a balance between both solid financial returns and social good. In fact, socially responsible investing has grown tremendously in recent years with roughly $3.74 trillion in total managed assets today, according to  . One of the ways to invest in socially responsible companies is to find businesses that align with your values. With that in mind, let's see how Splunk stacks up as a possible SRI for long-term investors. Unlike many other companies in the Software Industry, Splunk continues to strengthen its core values through corporate social responsibility programs such as  . Through this initiative, Splunk is showing the world how data can have a positive social impact in a variety of outlets. Splunk's newly launched  , for example, is a Splunk4Good project that collects and organizes public data related to regulations and legislative proposals submitted through regulations.gov.\"Many of these metrics have never before been easily available to the public or regulators,\" according to Splunk. This project is important because it aims to help improve government transparency and promote public participation in Federal rulemaking. Moreover, this isn't the only Splunk4Good project that is making the world a better place today. Splunk makes the bulk of its revenue through licensing fees from new and existing customers. However, the company lives up to its reputation for being a socially responsible business by offering free non-profit licenses for organizations worldwide that have budgets below $1 million annually. Some of the nonprofit organizations now benefiting from Splunk's free licensing initiative include the JQuery Project, MusicBrainz, and Hospice of Medina.In addition to this, Splunk has worked with individuals and communities to help track fundraising efforts for a variety of charities and causes. Last month, Splunk4Good sponsored the Open Humanitarian Initiative Code Sprint with the goal of revolutionizing how data and information is shared between organizations during disaster relief and humanitarian efforts. These are just a few of the many ways that Splunk is using its expertise of data to improve society. Indirectly, these initiatives also help build public awareness of Splunk's software and product offerings. This has translated into steady revenue growth for the company in recent quarters.In fact, Splunk's revenue climbed 52% to $101.5 million in the second quarter, which beat analysts' estimates. Quarterly profit of a penny per share also topped expectations for the period. Licensing revenues were another bright spot in the quarter, up 44% over last year at $62.1 million. On top of this, Splunk added 500 new customers in the quarter bringing its total customer base to 7,900 clients worldwide.These results demonstrate that Splunk knows how to create shareholder value, while also dedicating resources to social responsibility -- especially in respect to promoting open access to data for public good. For these reasons, Splunk is undoubtedly one of the most socially responsible investments available to investors today.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed.

The wider loss was primarily on account of a significant increase in operating expenses.Shares however surged 9.2% ($4.16) in after-hours trading following the results. This jump in share prices was primarily attributable to robust revenue growth exhibited by the company in the quarter as well as an increase in revenue guidance for fiscal 2015.Revenues surged 51.9% year over year to $101.5 million, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $94.0 million. Strong license sales and maintenance & services revenues primarily drove the better-than-expected year-over-year result.License sales (61.1% of revenues) jumped 43.8% year over year to $62.1 million. Maintenance & services revenues (38.9% of revenues) increased 66.6% from the year-ago quarter to $39.5 million.Adoption and implementation of its products within enterprises is helping the company to generate more revenues. The company also added 500 new customers, which resulted in more than 7,900 customers worldwide.The clientele includes the likes of Dell, Dropbox, Nordstrom, NASDAQ, Overstock.com (  ) University of Washington, Chinese University of Hong Kong and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.During the quarter, the company announced the availability of the Splunk app for Stream. This uses the Cloudometer technology that makes it easier for customers to get wireless data into all sorts of Splunk products.Moreover, the quarter also witnessed the launch of the Splunk app for enterprise security as well as the Splunk mobile app.During the quarter, Splunk entered into a partnership with Syncsort to deliver machine data insights from mainframe systems.Further, the company announced the industry's first 100% uptime service level agreement for Splunk cloud and a free Splunk Online Sandbox to give customers a trial experience of Splunk cloud almost instantly.Gross margin contracted 370 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 82.5%, primarily due to an unfavorable product mix. License gross margin contracted 340 bps on a year-over-year basis, while maintenance & services contracted 30 bps in the quarter.Splunk continues to spend on research & development (R&D), which jumped 110.9% year over year to $34.2 million in the quarter. Sales & marketing (S&M) expense surged 79.2% from the prior-year quarter to $80.0 million. General & administrative expense increased 174.3% year over year to $32.7 million.The sharp jump in operating expenses (up 101.8% year over year) hurt profitability in the quarter. Operating loss (including stock-based compensation) was $59.2 million compared with a loss of $13.3 million in the year-ago quarter.Net loss (including stock-based compensation) was $59.6 million compared with a loss of $13.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Splunk exited the first quarter with $645.4 million in cash & cash equivalents compared with $667.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $9.3 million, while free cash flow was $6.4 million.For the third quarter of 2015, Splunk expects revenues in the range of $105 million to $107 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 1%.For fiscal 2015, revenues are likely to be in the range of $423 to $428 million (up from the prior outlook of $402 million to $410 million). Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 1% (up from the prior outlook of breakeven).We believe that Splunk's strong product pipeline will continue to boost top-line growth. However, increasing investments for R&D and higher operating costs are expected to be a drag on profitability in the near term. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, S&M expenditure is expected to increase significantly, thereby hurting margins in the near term.Moreover, the company continues to face tough competition from established players such as International Business Machines (  ) and Oracle (  ), which remains an overhang on the stock.Splunk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Coming off last quarter's disappointing earnings beat, a bit of a non sequitur itself, Splunk shed concerns about potential headwinds from recent price cuts and delivered another standout quarter. The positive news sent Splunk's shares sharply higher in after-hours trading. Let's take a look at what you need to know.Splunk surpassed analysts' expectations on both the top and bottom lines this quarter. On the revenue side, Splunk's outstanding growth potential was once again reiterated by its all-around strong performance from its two reporting segments.\n  \nSource: Splunk Investor Relations; all figures reported in US$millions.The average analyst estimate called for Splunk to generate sales of $93.8 million, so we're looking at a solid beat here.Looking toward the bottom line, Splunk's GAAP quarterly loss appears jarring at first glance, coming in at -$0.51 per share, and widening substantially from Splunk's -$0.13 of GAAP EPS in the same quarter last year. However, after backing out certain expenses, Splunk's non-GAAP EPS was $0.01, well ahead of the -$0.02 of non-GAAP EPS analysts expected.The strong momentum continued in other areas of Splunk's business, as well. Although still minuscule in an absolute sense, Splunk's operating cash flow increased 48%, from $6.3 million in Q2 last year to $9.3 million this quarter. Likewise, free cash flow for Splunk soared 48%, as well, from $4.3 million last year to $6.4 million this year.On the customer front, Splunk added another 500 customers in the second quarter. These additions push Splunk's total customer base north of 7,500. For context, Splunk reported 6,000 customers in the same quarter last year. This strong customer momentum certainly vindicates Splunk's previous move to lower its initial pricing model for first-time customers, and certainly bodes well for Splunk's customer growth going forward.On the product side of its business, Splunk continued to invest heavily in product development and R&D as part of its broader business transition toward a multi-product business model, which certainly shouldn't surprise anyone. During the quarter, Splunk announced the general rollout of its Splunk App for Stream, as well as a new version of its Splunk App for Enterprise Security. Splunk also introduced its Splunk Mobile App during the quarter, which should enable current customers to leverage the power of Splunk's analytics platform and receive notifications in real time on the go.Such moves, as well as ongoing product development initiatives, helped Splunk's R&D expense to balloon 111% during the quarter. However, as these kinds of initiatives should help diversify and expand Splunk's overall product and revenue base, Splunk's heavy product development spending seems eminently appropriate, especially considering the relative infancy of Splunk's overall market.All in all, this was a very strong quarter for Splunk.Looking out to its current quarter, Splunk guided for revenue to come in somewhere between $105 million and $107 million, which would represent between 34% and 36% top-line growth versus the third quarter of last year.Splunk management raised its full-year revenue guidance, as well, during the report. Splunk's executive team now sees FY 2015 annual sales coming in somewhere between $423 million and $428 million, up from its previous estimates between $402 million and $410 million.Nearly any way you slice it, this report was a win for Splunk, and the market appears to be rewarding the strong performance in kind. It's been a wild ride for Splunk shares during the past 12 months. However, with two consecutive earnings beats under its belt, it appears Splunk is, once again, well on its way toward realizing its truly monumental potential.Apple recently recruited a secret-development \"dream team\" to guarantee its newest smart device was kept hidden from the public for as long as possible.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPLK options chain for the new September 12th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $48.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $48.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $45.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPLK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $48.68/share today.Because the $48.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SPLK stock at the current price level of $48.68/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $49.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.03% if the stock gets called away at the September 12th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPLK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Splunk Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

But is there any way that investors could have seen this \"fall from the clouds\" coming?For investors in  (SPLK) shares, there was one clear warning sign on March 5 when the stock was trading $92. That's when SPLK became a Zacks #5 Rank Strong Sell. And since then, the stock has consistently been a #5 or #4 Rank Sell. This week is no exception as shares have been cut in half since March.Splunk provides a software platform, which collects and indexes data and enables users to search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data, all in real time. Sounds like a red hot, growing area of Technology.But the Zacks Rank doesn't care how exciting the industry is or how great the company's story is. It's a quantitative model that only focuses on one thing: Earnings Estimate Revisions (EER) from Wall Street analysts. When the analysts are raising estimates sufficiently, a stock can earn a Zacks #1 or #2 Rank or Strong Buy or Buy, respectively.When EER are headed up, a stock's price usually follows. And when EER are headed down, they lead stock prices lower. Here's a look at what's happened in SPLK shares since estimates took a dive and make it a #4 or #5 Rank...The February earnings report (4QFY14) that shifted the Zacks Rank to a #5 Strong Sell was accompanied by a big miss in expectations when the company reported a GAAP loss of $0.27 for the quarter vs. the consensus of -$0.07.Then the May report (1QFY15) delivered a whopping 600% EPS miss with a GAAP loss of $0.42 vs. expectations of only -$0.06. Clearly, even Wall Street analyst expectations for the company were fooled again, as you can see in the chart above when they had to drastically reduced estimates again last month.The turnaround in Splunk shares may be around the corner.

(Symbol: FLIR), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK), the market cap is now $4.96B, versus FLIR Systems, Inc. (Symbol: FLIR) at $4.93B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SPLK vs. FLIR:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, SPLK is up about 0.3%, while FLIR is down about 0.3% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to report earnings after hours on 05/29/2014.

Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  (  ), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in SPLK.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 8 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, widening from a loss of 40 cents a share a month ago to its current loss at 92 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Splunk has seen 6 downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 26 cents a share from a loss of 14 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 20.5% in the past month.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Internet Software industry, you may instead consider some better-ranked stocks including  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). While j2 Global and Model N carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Constant Contact holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Companies \"try Splunk and then they want more of it,\" Koenig said.He notes that the company has made a name for itself helping clients' information technology and security departments, two areas ripe for ongoing investment, predict service degradation problems before they happen. This saves time and money, and prevents disruptions to productivity.Splunk went public in April 2012 at $17 per share and its stock has zoomed nearly 330% since. Splunk joined the IBD Leaderboard of stocks this month.Brian White, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, says Splunk is transforming from a single-product company into a multiproduct one, offering more clients data gathering and mining services to meet ever more needs. He notes that in recent months Splunk has expanded working relationships withIDT (  ) andBlackRock (  ), among others.He says at the same time Splunk is venturing outside its IT and security sweet spot, helping to create new avenues of profitability for clients, from energy-efficient buildings to what White calls smart farms.\"Customers are getting more serious about how they use this,\" White said.Speaking at an investor conference in December, Splunk CEO Godfrey Sullivan explained that because tractors used by corporate farming operations now have GPS systems and wireless transmission capability, they produce data that can be broadcast from the fields back to a company headquarters. The information can be analyzed to assess everything from soil quality to temperature conditions, and the results can, for instance, be used to better understand when or how much seed to plant.Similar work is developing with railroad operators and auto manufacturers, including electric car makerTesla Motors (  ) andFord (  ).McKenney's, a designer and builder of large facilities in the Southeast, has partnered with Splunk to collect data from about 100 buildings on Elgin Air Force Base, Sullivan said. From some 20,000 sensors placed throughout the buildings -- in card key access systems and lights, for example -- data are relayed back to Splunk's index and analyzed to assess patterns that help determine where and when energy is needed.\"They are harvesting the information off those sensors, putting it into Splunk, doing time series analysis about it, and saving millions of dollars worth of power,\" Sullivan said.It is all about making the most of machine-generated -- or device-generated -- data in abundance in an emerging era, Sullivan said. This new era began when cell phones and various other devices went from analog to digital, he says, \"and they learned how to communicate with each other through machine events and typically through a wire transmission capability.\"This new generation of information, often structured in an unwieldy form that hardly resembles the data warehouses to which many are accustomed, has become known as Big Data.\"So how do you get value out of this new generation of data? You can use it to do things like identify fraud by looking at patterns on websites of trading activity, of logins vs. transactions vs. attempted wire transfers. If you look at and do pattern matches off this activity, you can do a lot of things,\" Sullivan said.White says Splunk is a forerunner on this front along withTableau Software (DATA), which he called his top emerging tech pick for 2014. White chose Splunk as his overall top IT software pick for 2014.\"There's definitely a lot of hype\" around Big Data, White said, calling it at a point similar to where cloud computing was in 2008 and 2009.Cloud computing has since become a household term and its use is pervasive, he adds.\"We are in the very, very, very early stages\" with Big Data, White said. \"But that's what makes this exciting: If you are positioned well now, you can really be an early mover\" in the next big thing.White estimated that Splunk's 2013 calendar year revenue growth was 47%. That figure will pull back some into the 30s this year, he said, as \"you simply can't surge forever.\"But he thinks Splunk will continue to bring in more customers and do more business with its existing clients as the uses for Big Data become more widely known and appreciated. \"I think they can put up very good numbers for the next five years,\" he said.Koenig, the Wedbush analyst, agrees. He notes that the moderately slower revenue growth could concern some, and the company's already lofty valuation could cause volatility in the stock this year. A relatively thin crowd of competitors could of course thicken, and if a better player emerges, that would pressure Splunk.But Koenig says still-strong top-line generation, coupled with the expectation for ongoing growth in Big Data usage, makes Splunk an appealing stock. He also notes that, as a young firm of less than a decade, its sales force is still maturing. He estimates that it takes six to nine months for employees to become productive, so as the sales force gains greater tenure it should add to productivity in coming quarters.\"There is a lot of promise with Splunk,\" he said.Splunk in November reported break-even fiscal third-quarter results, but revenue swelled 51% to $78.6 million, beating Wall Street's average estimate of $71.1 million.Splunk reports fiscal fourth-quarter results in February. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average expect a nickel profit on $90.2 million in revenue.The company last week announced pricing of $81 a share for a follow-on stock offering of 6 million shares. And on Monday FBR & Co. analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note that he's raised his price target by 20 to 100, amid signs of an upbeat product cycle and market-share strength. Splunk shares set a high of 83.97 on Wednesday Jan. 22 and closed near 73 on Wednesday, where they were about two weeks earlier.

The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK), the market cap is now $10.46B, versus NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA) at $10.45B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SPLK vs. NVDA:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SPLK and NVDA collectively make up 4.27% of the First Trust Technology AlphaDEX Fund ETF (  ) which is lower by about 0.3% on the day Friday.At the closing bell, SPLK is down about 2.9%, while NVDA is off about 0.7% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise by nearly 23% on the day.

The reason is simply because investor perception and can be incorrect, and that can create a huge opportunity for value investors.One company that is ripe for profits is  . The company is transitioning to become a leader in \"big data.\" Thanks to this transformation and the company's small market capitalization of just $185 million, investors haven't yet recognized the big opportunity with the stock.So what's happening at DataWatch? The company has a new management team from IBM at the helm and an acquisition that will revamp its product portfolio.Revenue growth will be ramping up next quarter. And the valuations of competitors indicate that this stock could double in price.Two of the most successful recent IPOs were  and  . Both are software companies competing in the space of enterprise analytics, providing easy access to big data in real-time. Because of a major paradigm shift towards the use of visual tools for analyzing data, these stocks have received exceptionally high valuations from Wall Street.Splunk had its IPO in early 2012. It trades at 27 times trailing sales and is valued at $6.5 billion. Meanwhile, Tableau went public in 2013, trades at 23 times trailing sales and is worth $3.9 billion. Neither company is profitable.Why is the Street giving these companies given such lofty valuations? There are three main reasons:Demand for the products and solutions from big data companies like Splunk and Tableau is rapidly growing, and has resulted in incredible growth over the past year. Splunk is on pace to grow revenue 41% in 2013, Tableau almost 100%. These are great companies with bright futures, but unfortunately it appears as if Wall Street has already priced the bulk of their success.Enter  . This is a little company that went public in 1992 and is valued at just about $250 million. Here's the catch: since 2011 DataWatch has been undergoing a major transformation to compete directly with offerings from Splunk and Tableau.This transition has been led by an all-star management team, with a track record of numerous buyouts in the big data analytics space. In 2011, DataWatch hired Michael Morrison as its new CEO. Morrison came with years of executive experience at Applix, Cognos and IBM.Morrison was first the COO of Applix, which was bought out by Cognos in 2007 for $339 million. Just a couple months after the acquisition, IBM bought out Cognos for $4.9 billion. These were all enterprise software companies specializing in business analytics, exactly where DataWatch now competes. Not a bad track record, especially given DataWatch was worth well under $100 million when Morrison took his position as CEO.It may seem hard to imagine why five industry leading executives would all leave their current positions to work for a tiny company like DataWatch. I'm impressed by what they've accomplished. In just two years DataWatch has transformed from an outdated niche software vendor and become a dynamic real-time analytics player.A large part of that shift is due to the recent acquisition of Panopticon Software, a Swedish company specializing in the visualization of real-time big data analytics. DataWatch announced the acquisition in June, and it was completed in late August. The all-stock deal was done and on the conference call, Panopticon's management specifically pointed to DataWatch's low valuation as the rationale for selling the company in an all-stock deal.Industry experts were quick to rave about the acquisition. Philip Howard of Bloor Research sums it up nicely in a  : \"DataWatch \u2026 isn't very sexy \u2026 Panopticon, on the other hand, is sexy.\"Panopticon doesn't just sound like a trendy software company. But its numbers are impressive. Although concrete financial data will be tough to find on the company until DataWatch announces its third-quarter results, we do have a couple of hints to work from. On the original conference call it was noted that Panopticon produced $5 million in revenue in 2012, an increase of 112%.Although it's very small, Panopticon grew faster than both Splunk and Tableau in 2012. Ironically, DataWatch got this higher growth, for just a fraction of the cost. When it was announced, the deal was worth $33 million, meaning DataWatch paid just 6.6 times sales. That translates into about 25% of the valuation multiple of these better-known competitors.But what really makes me excited is the potential of combined product offerings from DataWatch and Panopticon. DataWatch has over 40,000 customers, including 99 of the Fortune 100 companies. Meanwhile, Panopticon has just 75 customers. It's safe to assume that Panopticon's customers are signing much bigger contracts, similar in structure to what Tableau and Splunk typically receive.If DataWatch can successfully integrate its new offerings and sell Panopticon's software to its 40,000 customers, there is huge potential for growth. Even if DataWatch can only sell 1% of its customers the Panopticon services, the business could grow by a factor of four.Learn more about DataWatch, and why I think the stock could rise by 50%.

But the surprising thing is that analysts and investors continue to be bullish on these stocks despite growing losses.These companies operate in a sector known as \"enterprise software.\" Enterprise software stocks including  , and  are some of the most loved  , and enjoy remarkably rich valuations.The bullish case on these stocks seems to be completely reliant on rapid revenue growth, which investors assume will translate into future profits.But skeptics point to one big issue: these profits aren't materializing.While each of these companies continues to see their stock soar to new highs, losses continue to grow at an astonishingly similar rate.Let's examine the three biggest stocks in the sector: Salesforce, Splunk, and Workday. These players undoubtedly get the bulk of the attention from the media and investors.Theoretically a lot of this attention is deserved. The disruptive potential of these cloud-based enterprise software players is huge, and the revenue growth is real. Demand for these services is there. But thus far, these companies aren't turning a profit.A lot of stockholders will point to the unique nature of the Subscription as a Service (SaaS) business model, as a reason for the discrepancy in valuation. With enterprise software contracts typically spanning one to three years, revenue is recognized linearly on a quarterly basis. This gives the appearance of steady sustained growth over the long term.As these businesses have matured, it's surprises me to see growing losses. And what's surprised me even more is that no on seems to care at all.Let's take a quick look at each companies revenue and losses.\n  \nThe following table shows just how expensive these stocks are on a price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-earnings (P/E) basis.\n  \nDespite rapidly growing top-lines, every company managed to increase its losses by a significant amount year over year. This seems particularly worrisome given that all these companies are enjoying ludicrous P/S valuations.Many tech companies - including these three - like to report earnings on a non-GAAP basis. This allows them to selectively remove pesky expenses including stock options, write-offs, and taxes. On a non-GAAP basis, the income statements look far more favorable. Yet these numbers doesn't provide a true view of the profitability.As we saw this week, yet another quarter of growing losses was reported from each of these three companies. And you guessed it right! All three stocks are trading within 5% of their all-time highs.Sooner or later investors are going to have to start demanding profits, or some sort of tangible value. Very rarely has there been a growth company that was unprofitable during its  years and subsequently enjoyed long-term success.Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle are all great examples of tech companies that were profitable during the period where they experienced the most rapid growth. No - it doesn't seem as though these enterprise software stocks are \"the next Microsoft.\"So why are investors giving a free pass to the most expensive stocks like Salesforce, Splunk and Workday?The simple answer is due to their \"software as a Service\" or SaaS business model. But this is nothing more than an argument of \"this time it's different because\u2026.\" And anybody  in shares of these companies now better hope that's right. With stratospheric valuations and no assets to fall back on, these stocks will have a long way to tumble when the growth finally slows down.If you own shares of these high flying enterprise software stocks, now may be a good time to be locking in your gains. If profits never materialize, there is no question these stocks will be trading at significantly lower prices sometime soon.We just found out that some of the savviest investors in the tech world are bankrolling a new, alternative, web-based banking platform. Most investors have never heard of it, but we believe it could revolutionize banking the same way the internet revolutionized music, communication and business. The best part?

Maintenance and services revenues (35.4% of revenues) increased 65.9% from the year-ago quarter to $23.7 million.Splunk's results were mainly driven by continuous adoption and implementation of its products within the enterprises.

Marketo, a marketing software company, jumped 78% on Friday in the best first-day performance since Splunk's (  ) 108% gain in April 2012. With Tableau's 64% pop, it was just the second time since 2000 (and the first time since 2010) that two companies produced first-day gains of more than 50% on the same day. The seven  for the week pushed May's total to 22, which is the highest monthly total since November 2007. Upcoming  remained strong as well, with four companies setting terms and six making initial filings.\n  \nUntil Friday, last week looked to be yet another stretch of robust pricing activity paired with weak returns. On Thursday, the week had already become the fifth out of the last six to have at least five IPO pricings, but three of the five IPOs had posted negative first-day returns. Of the 20 IPOs that had priced so far in May, only one had gained more than 10% on its first day. By contrast, through April, more than half of the year's 44 IPOs had done so.But on Friday, Marketo and Tableau became 2013's top two first-day performers as well as two of the  by total return. Both were lifted by enthusiasm for new enterprise software offerings and both came public with top-line growth near 100%.

Tableau has 10,900 customers and, unusually for recent software IPOs, has been profitable for three years. Tableau priced at $31, well above its initially proposed range of $23 to $26; if it had priced at the midpoint, it would have generated a first-day return of 107%.The next best return of the week, a comparatively paltry 5%, came from William Lyon Homes (WLH), the third homebuilder IPO of 2013 (after TRI Pointe Homes (TRI) and Taylor Morrison (TMHC)). William Lyon, which was previously listed but filed for bankruptcy in 2011, closed 268 homes in the first quarter for $76 million in sales, a 140% increase year-over-year.\n  \nThree of last week's newly launched deals, Constellium (CSTM), Global Brass and Copper (BRSS) and Ply Gem (PGEM), have generated more than $1 billion of sales in the past year. Constellium, which is based in the Netherlands, made its first public filing and simultaneously launched its roadshow on Monday. Both it and Global Brass and Copper are private-equity backed metals companies that have low margins relative to peers, and both experienced declines in volumes shipped during the first quarter. Ply Gem, a manufacturer of residential exterior building products, is also backed by a private equity firm, CI Capital Partners, and is looking to ride a recovery in the US housing market.\n  \nAcquired by Compuware (CPWR) in 2004, Covisint (COVS) provides secure, cloud communication and collaboration platforms primarily to the auto and healthcare industries.

Countless tech companies have come of age during this long summer, and we know them generally by their buzzwords: cloud, mobile, social media, big data. They've grown quickly, as things usually do in favorable weather. One day, though, a recession will come, and these businesses will have to prove that they can survive the winter.Two issues haunt them, and the first is a low return on investment. Most of the technology firms that went public during this business cycle remain unprofitable. Streaming audio has been a money-loser for  (  ), and streaming software has been unprofitable for  (  ). Big data upstarts like  (  ) and  (  ) are in the red, and social/mobile gaming giant  (  ) has struggled to find profits. Of the current crop of tech companies, the only ones that seem to enjoy healthy margins are those that own infrastructure, and rent it out, like  (FB) does with advertisers, or  (RAX) does with cloud developers.The industry has defended itself to investors, often successfully, by arguing that losses feed growth. This may be true -- charity usually finds a willing market -- but it doesn't tell us whether these products can actually be sold for a profit. It's a bad sign when new technologies require  (WDAY) to earn operating margins of -30%, while traditional competitors like  (ORCL) are pulling in +40%. If cloud software is a great improvement, then growth shouldn't require such a steep discount. Perhaps the problem is scale -- Workday is much smaller than Oracle -- but then losses have risen in step with growth, and there's no reason to expect large efficiencies of scale in a software company.For investors, the problem is made worse by misleading earnings reports. More than a decade after the dot-com bust, the tech industry still prefers non-GAAP earnings. Cash flow statements don't always show the actual damage; Pandora reported operating cash flow of negative $2.3 million in the last quarter, when in reality, it burned through $14 million. Income statements tend to be overwhelmed by capital coming in and capital going out. By watching net current and cash assets on the balance sheet, and correcting for new stock and debt, capital expenditures and acquisitions, we can arrive at a better idea of how the core business is doing.The picture isn't always pretty. Of the new kids on the block, most sit in a core cash flow range of -12.6% to 2.5%. By reference, Rackspace earns 25%, and Facebook earns 20%. Older firms like  (CSCO), Oracle, and  (VMW) also sit around 20-30%. There's a marked gap between the haves and the have-nots, and it's not always explained by growth; Facebook has expanded as fast as many of the enterprise cloud companies, but still experienced healthy and rising margins. I have no doubt that Marc Benioff, CEO of  (CRM), could offer compelling reasons for why his company is different, and since he knows his business much better than I do, I would have to take his word for it.That makes me uncomfortable -- first of all, because trust is a poor risk-management strategy. Additionally, his reasons may not matter in a recession when margins are pushed down even further - nor do we know how today's Web-based products will fare in the event of a recession. They may be hypercyclical; their flexibility might place them first on the chopping block, with clients believing that they can quickly redeploy once the economy has turned around. On the other hand, Salesforce's expenses are mostly salaries, and these are not so easily or painlessly cut.The second problem facing younger tech companies is a heavy dependence on outside capital. Long after their IPOs, these firms are still leaning on debt and stock markets. The three largest cloud enterprise firms -- Salesforce, Workday, and NetSuite -- have all issued debt in 2013 to the tune of $2 billion, or an amount equal to revenue in the period.  (NFLX) and Pandora have also issued new debt, although in smaller proportion. For companies in the enterprise space, stock dilution is an even more serious issue. Many of them routinely issue shares worth 20% of revenue. Stock compensation, employee investment plans, and new issues all represent an infusion of cash into the balance sheet, either directly or by lowering cash salaries.Investors haven't objected, and since stock valuations are currently so high, the dilution is modest. However, capital markets are cyclical, and a time will probably come when employees don't want to be paid in a declining stock, investors don't want to tolerate further dilution, and bond markets don't want to buttress an already bloated balance sheet. For some of these companies, a freeze would basically eliminate their ability to finance new investments. For others, it could potentially threaten the core business. Many have generous cash positions, but a few ill-timed acquisitions could leave any one of them naked in the cold.Of course, winter might not come. Margins might spontaneously improve, consumers might reprioritize their lives, the Fed might have killed the business cycle, and everything might work out. Hope is gratifying -- but it's not a strategy. Unfortunately, the pursuit of growth at all costs has left today's tech companies with little choice but to cross their fingers and pray for a mild December.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported fourth-quarter 2013 loss of 6 cents per share, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents loss. Loss per share remained flat on both year-over-year and sequential basis.Revenues surged 51.0% year over year and 25.3% sequentially to $65.2 million and were ahead of management's guided range of $58.0 million to $60.0 million. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $60.0 million. The better-than-expected result was primarily driven by strong license sales and maintenance & services revenues.License sales (71.7% of revenues) jumped 42.5% year over year and 35.4% quarter over quarter to $46.8 million. Maintenance and services revenues (28.3% of revenues) increased 77.7% from the year-ago quarter and 5.5% from the previous quarter to $18.4 million.Splunk continues to generate majority of its revenues from core markets, which include App management, infrastructure and operations, and security compliance. Splunk introduced a number of new products during the quarter that include  ,  ,  and many more.These new products are expected to boost Splunk's market share in the emerging fields of web intelligence, business analytics and industrial data. The company's cloud and Storm platform had more than 160 customers and 200 paid projects, which include enterprise customers such as  . Splunk's total customer base was approximately 5,200 at the end of the fourth quarter.During the quarter, Splunk signed deals with more than 400 new customers, which include the likes of  . Splunk also expanded its existing customer base, as more than 18 customers, such as  extended their agreements with the company. Splunk continues to experience strong growth in its existing customer base as over 70.0% of the quarter's license booking came from them.In the fourth quarter, Splunk signed 171 orders, worth more than $100,000, compared with 94 in the prior-year quarter and 125 in the previous quarter. Deferred revenues increased to $115.0 million from $74.0 million reported in the previous quarter. This included a $20.0 million order and 117 figure transactions.Maintenance renewal rate was 92% in the reported quarter. Term-base and perpetual license sales mix was 13.0% in the quarter compared with 8.0% in the year-ago quarter and within the historical range of 10.0% to 20.0%.International operations represented 26.0% of revenues as Asia-Pacific (\"APAC\") and Europe Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") jumped over 60% from the year-ago quarter.Gross margin contracted 220 basis points (\"bps\") from the year-ago quarter but expanded a modest 10 bps sequentially. Both license and maintenance & services gross profit contracted on a year-over-year basis. The sequential expansion was primarily due to better product mix.Splunk continues to invest in research & development (\"R&D\"), which jumped 81.1% year over year and 20.0% sequentially to $13.3 million in the quarter. Sales & marketing (\"S&M\") expense surged 52.6% from the prior-year quarter and 22.8% from the previous quarter to $40.3 million. General & administrative expense (\"G&A\") increased 65.2% year over year and 42.7% quarter over quarter to $10.9 million.The sharp jump in operating expenses (up 59.8% year over year and 25.2% sequentially) negatively hurt profitability in the quarter. Operating loss was $5.9 million compared with a loss of $0.6 million in the prior-year quarter and a loss of $5.4 million in the previous quarter.Net loss was $6.2 million compared with a loss of $1.3 million in the prior-year quarter and a loss of $5.5 million in the previous quarter.Splunk exited the fourth quarter with $305.9 million in cash & cash equivalents compared with $273.3 million in the previous quarter and $31.6 million in the year-ago quarter.Cash flow from operations was $24.8 million compared with $6.5 million in the previous quarter and $10.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow improved significantly to $21.4 million compared with $4.2 million in the previous quarter and $7.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Splunk expect revenues in the range of $260.0 million to $270.0 million and break-even operational result for fiscal 2014. For first quarter of 2014, revenues are likely to be in the range of $52.0 to $54.0 million. Operating margin is expected to be negative 10.0% to 12.0% in the first quarter.Operating margin is expected to improve gradually in the second and third quarter and management expects to report positive figures in the fourth quarter. Headcount is expected to increase by 250 in fiscal 2014.Splunk's revenue growth is expected to benefit from strong growth in user base, higher renewal rates and expansions into new markets. We believe that Splunk's strong product pipeline will also boost top-line growth going forward.However, increasing investments for product development are expected to drag profitability in the near term. As Splunk continues to explore and expand into new markets, sales & marketing expenditure is expected to increase significantly, thereby hurting margins in the near term.Currently, Splunk has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ortrait of A Successful InvestorMusings on Investing StylesSome Thoughts on Apple (  )---The world is full of successful investors. Some are famous; most are not. Today's story is about one of the latter, a guy named Joe.Joe and my father became friends roughly 55 years ago while they were working at General Electric in the aircraft engine division. My father was a mechanical engineer, while Joe's talent was operations research; it was a hot new field back then, a bit like Cloud computing today.Joe's main hobby was golf, while my father's main hobbies were music and investing.Well, Joe never could get my father to take up golf; tennis was more his speed. But my father succeeded in getting Joe hooked on investing, and over the years they spent many hours sharing tips and discussing investing strategies.After a few years, both moved on from GE. But they stayed in touch.My parents had five kids while Joe and his wife had three. Our families vacationed together in the summer. Some of us skied together in the winter; I remember piling into the back of Joe's big station wagon for the ride to New Hampshire many times.Today Joe is 87 years old. He turns 88 in June. He still plays a lot of golf, in part because it provides increasingly important social connections.But above all he invests-seriously. He's successful at it.And here's why.When Joe retired at age 77, he found himself with a lot of time on his hands. Plus, he found that he wanted a mental stimulant, to ward off any type of mental decline.So he decided to focus his attention on small-cap investing!Now, small-cap investing is risky for anyone, and a lot of people who try it don't last long; they lose their shirt and they go back to mutual funds, or dividend-paying blue chips.But Joe wasn't foolish. As a long-time reader of numerous Cabot advisories, he knew enough to avoid the usual beginners' mistakes.So he kept the bulk of his investable funds in sensible long-term securities, the way any competent money manager would: dividend-paying blue chip stocks, municipal bonds, etc. It doesn't take a lot of work, and the resulting average annual return is enough to live on.But with his \"discretionary\" money, the money he spends much more time thinking about, Joe began to invest in underfollowed small-cap stocks. More important, he began to research them, in depth.Just a few decades ago, researching these stocks was difficult. If you wanted to learn anything, you had to subscribe to investment newsletters or go to the library. Barron's was useful, but it was limited.Today, by contrast, the Internet has made information abundant. And anyone who takes the time, and has a decent system-and follows that system-can learn enough to do pretty well.Joe has the time. He spends about four hours a day on his discretionary portfolio, more than most of my readers.And he has more than the Internet; he's a long-time reader of numerous Cabot advisories, and particularly fond of Cabot Market Letter, Cabot Top Ten Trader, Cabot Stock of the Month, Dick Davis Investment Digest and Dick Davis Dividend Digest.But he's not loyal to any particular system or editor. He loves them for the ideas they provide, but he has his own investing system, which he usually follows.Joe's system is unusual in a couple of ways that are worth mentioning.First, he diversifies heavily; his discretionary portfolio has roughly 60 stocks! To me, that's an unnecessarily large number. As a growth investor, I like to focus much more narrowly; I like every stock in my portfolio to be working for me today.But Joe argues that his broad diversification provides safety. He says any stock that crashes-and small-caps do sometimes crash-won't have too heavy an impact on the whole. This is a true, but it's an argument usually used by value investors.And Joe is, in a way, a value investor!He has a method of determining the fair value for a stock that prevents him from buying stocks that are \"too high\" and gives him confidence to hold onto a stock that's temporarily underperforming.This valuation model, like many, is based on a stock's P/E ratio. But Joe adds a twist. Using data found online, he takes the earnings estimate that's farthest in the future for that company, and then applies a multiplier, based on the company's expected earnings growth rate; a higher growth rate justifies a greater multiple, which justifies paying a higher price.Joe's system doesn't always work; no system does. And Joe can't use it on companies that are not yet profitable, including many biotech companies. But he thinks it's saved him a lot of grief.Furthermore, as Joe has put more and more weight on this valuation system, he's evolved away from small-cap stocks. Today, nearly 10% of his stocks are trading for more than $100 a share, while roughly 25% are trading for less than $10 a share.And not all those low-priced stocks have great prospects!You see, like many investors, Joe has trouble selling stocks that go down. In fact, of his 60-odd stocks, roughly 10 show losses of greater than 50%, and some are over 90%. I would sell all of those big losers today and work to put the money in stocks going the right direction. But Joe says, somewhat wistfully, \"They're not worth selling anymore.\" And as is common among all investors who hold their big losers, he has some lingering hope that they might come back!Nevertheless, his numbers are very good.Through last Friday, Joe's discretionary portfolio was up 20.1% year-to-date. By comparison, the Dow was up 12.3%, the S&P 500 was up 10.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 8.6%.And Joe isn't even trying to maximize his return! If he did, he'd work more hours, and do more trading. But he doesn't want to work harder. He just wants to make his account grow, and to keep his mind engaged enough to keep from turning into a couch potato.I think Joe has done a marvelous job of developing an investing system that works for him, in more ways than one, and I recommend that you do the same and find a system that works for you, if you have time.---I like to say that one of Cabot's missions is to help you find the investment system that's right for you. So here's a quick, subjective appraisal of some growth investing styles.Joe's investing style might be called \"Growth at a Reasonable Price,\" or GARP. It works for him, as similar GARP systems work for many investors. He doesn't rely much on charts, and as mentioned, he could do better at selling.My father, who founded Cabot, didn't give a hoot about valuation. He liked strong charts. If a stock was going up, and the story was good, he'd happily jump on board, knowing the potential was there for it to climb even higher. In fact, Joe remembers my father saying many times, \"Always buy more of your best performers.\" For my father, that sometimes meant 40% of his portfolio ended up in one stock-and he was fine with that! My father was also big on the idea that it was changes in perception that moved a stock, so the best time to buy a stock was just ahead of a big wave of improvement in investor perception. He seldom sold too soon, while he sometimes sold too late.Mike Cintolo, by contrast, is a great fan of high-potential chart set-ups. He won't buy a stock that's over-extended; he doesn't want the risk. But with a long watch list of well-researched great growth stories, when a set-up does materialize, Mike is often ready. Mike spends a little more time than my father thinking about valuation, but not a lot; he likes to say that for growth stocks, \"Valuation is the result of good performance, rather than vice versa.\" Finally, Mike has proven himself better than both my father and Joe at selling; he'll often take partial profits near a stock's peak and he'll sell quickly when a stock breaks down.Finally, there's me. I don't care much about valuation; I think future numbers are too difficult to predict for great growth stocks. I do respect charts a lot, so I prefer stocks that are under accumulation. And I like great, often revolutionary growth stories. But I've come to realize that what makes me different is my focus on investor psychology. I like recommending stocks where investor perception is very likely to improve, like  which I recommended more than a year ago, or  , which I recommended just three months ago. And I'm leery of stocks that are too popular, like  last year, where a shift toward lower perceptions has the potential to set off a selling stampede.---Lastly, some thoughts on  .Most-perhaps all-investing systems that measured value called Apple a decent value last year. Joe's system did, and so did our own But that value didn't stop the stock from falling 31% in little over six months!In recent weeks, more and more advisors have been popping up calling Apple a buy \"at these depressed levels.\"Well, I respectfully disagree, and here's why.First, I wasn't surprised when Apple topped last year. As I wrote both before and after the top, when a stock is owned by everyone who has the potential to own it, the only way it can go when perceptions begin to worsen-even infinitesimally-is down, regardless of valuation.Today, Apple is combating its stock's slide by doing the only thing it can; shoveling cash to investors through stock buy-backs and dividends. In the next year, these efforts will cost it $60 billion, and probably stem the stock's slide.AAPL's chart may help, too. The stock is nearing its 200-week moving average-it's now at 370-and there's also support in the 350 region dating back to 2011, so the odds are good for AAPL to build a base in that area.But I don't think the stock will reward buyers who are jumping on board here, because investing is not that easy!This is not about valuation. It's not about charts. And it's not even about the loss of Steve Jobs; I'm pretty sure this would have happened even if Steve were still around.The way I see it, too many people today still hold the memory of AAPL being a great investment. Too many people still remember missing the opportunity to buy AAPL low enough the first time around, and thus too many people are attuned to the \"opportunity\" to now buy APPL some 30% off its high.But the market doesn't give you what you wish for. Instead, the market offers opportunities that you're not looking for, and that are hard to recognize.Note: Also arguing for a more difficult future is the fact that Apple's business is deteriorating fast. Thanks to growing competition and falling prices, Apple's margins appeared doomed to shrink dramatically in the years ahead. But I won't get into that here.My rule of thumb about investing in past big winners like Apple is that the stock needs to fall out of the public's consciousness first. People have to stop expecting the stock to be bargain; they have to give up on it! That takes time, and experience tells me that five years will usually do it.For example, exactly three months ago today, I recommended buying  at 28. Today the stock is selling at 46, up a very satisfying 64%.That's more than I'd expected so quickly, but I'm not totally surprised, because the potential was there.Here's what I wrote back in January.\"First Solar came public in December 2006 at 26, and soared all the way to a high of 317 in May of 2008, for a gain of 1,119%! (  subscribers bought in March of 2007 at 57, took partial profits on the way up at 115, 167 and 220, and sold the last bit in September 2008 at 228 as the stock started to crash.) Interestingly, the base that was built following that crash-and which centered on 140-didn't hold, and the stock crashed again in 2011 and 2012. It's been less than a year since the second crash, so it's possible the stock needs more time. On the other hand, it's been five years since the first crash, and that's the one that took the stock out of the limelight.\"Lesson: If you're buying what's popular, you might be buying near a top. If you're buying what was popular five years ago, and what's now out of favor, you might be buying near a bottom. For AAPL, I'd wait until 2017.---I'll finish this long letter with a stock most investors don't know about. Those investors represent potential buying power, as they learn about it.Its name is  , which in my mind puts it in the same category as other fun names like Yahoo! and Zappo's-and they haven't done badly!Here's what editor Mike Cintolo wrote in  a month ago.\"Splunk is a software company whose products give businesses control over the mountains of data that they collect and store in the Cloud, often in Hadoop clusters, which are cheap commodity servers connected with open-source software. Splunk's software eliminates bottlenecks and security breaches in software applications and networks, and analysts say that it's such a superior product that the company is competing on an equal footing with HP and IBM. With 60 of the Fortune 100 companies on the customer list and a string of 25 seven-figure contracts signed in the fiscal year ending in January, Splunk is clearly getting major traction .\u2026 The demand for software to handle Big Data is so strong that Splunk has been able to grow revenue at an impressive rate; the 51% revenue growth in the latest quarter would have many companies doing cartwheels, but it's the lowest growth rate in over two years for Splunk. The 200% jump in earnings in its latest quarter is also important, as it pushes the company closer to consistent profitability.\"When that was published, SPLK was trading at 40. Since then it's been up to 42 and back down to test 40 and now it's advancing again. I think buying in expectation of a breakout above 42 will probably work.Yours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth,Timothy LuttsEditor of Cabot Stock of the MonthThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["his week in American insider trades saw an increased buying in company stakes by individuals.

The company's newest version of Windows was aimed at taking back lostmarket share from the likes of  and  . Yet as I  , the launch for Windows 8 has been underwhelming. Nearly three months later, this view still holds.Still, Microsoft has many other core strengths outside of operating software. Management should shift focus and ensure that each of these divisions has the right growth drivers to take market share. With more than $60 billion in netcash just sitting in the bank, it's foolhardy to stand back and do nothing.Here's a look at three Microsoft niches and how the company can strengthen them through acquisitions of young, fast-growing firms that are gaining relevant traction. History has shown that the fast-changing technology landscape often produces tomorrow's top-performinginvestments . And these are the kind of opportunities no investor should ignore.    It's easy to overlook this division as it has little exposure to the consumer end of the technology world. Yet it's a billion (in annual sales) division that is a key player in the management of many corporate networks. Microsoft has an especially strong presence in business intelligence and structured databases (with its SQL server platform).But in recent years, the hottest growth areas have been in a field known as \"Big Data,\" which is the ability to log, classify and analyze massive reams of data in real-time. And the most dominant entrant in the field of independent vendors is  , which closed on its first day of trading in April 2012 at .50 a share and is now a few dollars cheaper. Microsoft would likely have to pay north of .5 billion to acquire Splunk, which seems pretty rich for a company on track for just 0 million in sales in fiscal (January) 2014.But using Splunk as a beach head for a move into the Big Data niche would likelyyield major benefits for Microsoft down the road as it goes head to head with  and others. Microsoft could also look to make a smaller purchase in the field: Privately-held firms include Sumo Logic and Loggly.   If Microsoft wants to be seen as a serious challenger to Apple and Google in the consumer space, then itwill have to beef up this division, which is home to the Bing search engine, the MSN portal, the Hotmail email service and the company's SkyDrive data-storage service.It's this last service could serve to be a Trojan Horse for the company's other consumer initiatives. Hosting personal data and media content in the cloud is a key goal for Apple, and it should be for Microsoft as well. After all, consumers tend to remain clients once they have all of their important files on a particular platform.To boost market share in the data-storage segment, Microsoft may look to acquire  , which is growing at a 20% annual clip and is on pace to exceed 0 million in sales this year. The company is valued at about 5 million, and even assuming a 30%buyout premium, this would still barely make a ripple in Microsoft'sbalance sheet . Privately-held Dropbox, which may look to pull off anIPO this year, is also a potential target for Microsoft.   In the entertainment space, Microsoft's biggest challenge is a simple one: Attract new customers to its platform (which includes Skype, MSN, Bing, Hotmail and its various gaming efforts), and figure out ways to keep these customers' eyeballs glued to the company's properties. Outside of video games, the company is lacking compelling forms of entertainment and popular online services (such as dating sites).That's where  comes in. The company operates a range of online dating sites (such as Match.com), media and humor sties (such as Vimeo.com and CollegeHumor.com) and has also invested heavily in mobile apps, which is a big part of Microsoft's revamped smartphone efforts.IAC/Interactive brings more than just a billionrevenue base: It also brings an army of tech-savvy developers who have shown a willingness to make bold moves, a personality trait Microsoft sorely lacks. Back out IAC/Interactive's net 0 million in cash, and the company is currently valued at less than billion. Chairman Barry Diller is now in his 70s and may be willing to take anoffer from Microsoft -- for the right price.Risks to Consider:  One year ago, investors were looking ahead to Microsoft's looming Windows upgrade, andshares were moving above the $30 mark. A year later, shares have lost momentum and are back in the $20s, exactly where they stood five years ago. Apple and Google's share prices are up 200%, and 50%, respectively, in the same period.It's increasingly apparent that Microsoft will have to keep stepping on the gas to get its share price moving again. Its cash-rich balance sheet means that deal-making will most likely be part of the strategy. The buyout targets I mentioned here are a good starting point for further research as you refresh your understanding of the technology landscape. While some of these young companies will be buyout targets, others some will prove to be winning investments on their own merit.

Solar panel installer SolarCity (  ) set terms on Tuesday for a $141 million IPO, while biotech Audeo Oncology (  ) plans to raise $49 million. However, Archstone's acquisition and slow filing activity have limited the chances of an active US IPO market in December. That said, strong earnings results from several 2012 IPOs have helped raise IPO performance YTD and could help add a few deals to the calendar early next week.Pending IPO Archstone (  ), a Lehman-backed apartment REIT, was acquired by Equity Residential and Avalon Bay for $16 billion on Monday. The acquisition removed one of the largest companies from the IPO pipeline, which was expected to raise $3.5 billion and would have been the largest real estate deal since Blackstone purchased Hilton Hotels for $26 billion in 2007. Had Archstone chosen to float its shares, it would have been the largest commercial REIT offering in history.Five companies withdrew their  last week, including oil and gas E&P Ute Energy (UTE), Texas-based bank PlainsCapital (PCB) hydraulic fracturing company FTS International (FTSI), Chinese light bulb maker TCP International (TCPI.RC) and biofuel producer Fulcrum Energy (FLCM). Ute Energy was acquired in early November for approximately $860 million while PlainsCapital was acquired in May for more than $500 million.  for the month of November reached 10, tying April's total as the highest month for withdrawals in 2012. There were no initial filings this week, extending a streak that has now reached 15 days.Archstone's acquisition along with last week's five withdrawals have shrunk the US IPO pipeline, which currently stands at 116 companies looking to raise $34.4 billion (compared to 123 companies looking to raise $39.6 billion at the end of the prior week). While eight companies were able to update their filings this past week, data suggest that half of the US pipeline consists of stale or postponed deals. In the last 90 days, only 44 of the 116 companies in the US pipeline have updated their filings. Additionally, 18 of the 116 deals on file represent postponed deals.A recent string of strong earnings reports has helped elevate  . Notable 2012 IPOs that had strong earnings results last week include Five Below (  ), Splunk (  ) and Infoblox (BLOX). Also pushing IPO returns higher was the strong performance of Facebook (FB), which closed the month up 32.8%, its best one-month performance since its May offering. The average aftermarket return for IPOs from the past 90 days has risen to 4.7% and the average total return is up to 17.0%. These figures compare with a 0.2% average aftermarket return and a 13.0% average total return as of early November. Year-to-date, 124 US IPOs have produced an average aftermarket return of 3.3% and an average total return of 16.9%.While the US IPO calendar is light, IPO activity overseas has picked up as 2012 winds down. Seven deals were able to price last week, raising $5.9 billion, including large deals like Russian telecom provider MegaFon and Chinese insurer PICC. Excluding A-share listings, the late surge for non-US IPOs made November the busiest month since June 2011.With the fast-approaching fiscal cliff, many companies appear to be waiting until next year to pursue its IPO. With only two deals on the  and the absence of new companies setting terms last week, December is on track to have its slowest month since 2008. This December, which has historically been an active month, could be the third December in the last 10 years to see fewer than eight IPOs price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["tock Market VideoCabot, Salem and WitchesThe Hand Dealt is Determinism; The Hand Played is Free WillIn Case You Missed It---In this week's Stock Market Video, I sound a cautionary note. It's not that the market is in a downtrend, far from it. But the number of technical warning signals and former market leaders taken off at the knees is too high to ignore. You should be weeding out the losers and laggards in your portfolio and tightening up your stops. Nobody knows what the market will do, but fortune favors the prepared. Stocks discussed include:  and  , among others. ---Cabot Heritage was founded in Salem, Massachusetts in 1970, which makes us 43 years old this year. That makes us a fairly venerable company as these things go, but having Salem for a home can give you a slightly different perspective on time.That's because Salem itself was first settled in 1623 and incorporated in 1626, so the town was already well over three-hundred years old (344) when Cabot put out its first investment newsletter. So we temper our pride in our longevity accordingly.This August, we're staging the first-ever Cabot Investment Conference, a three-day chance for our subscribers (and others who are interested in investing) to meet all of our editors-all eight of them-and each other. There will be a cocktail reception on Wednesday (August 14), which will be both a meet-and-greet and a chance to get to know the editors as people and to start asking questions.Thursday will be a full day of presentations, in which each of our editors will lay out the investment rationale that guides the construction of their advisories, give strategies for the selection and handling of investments and answer questions from the audience.After a half a day of presentations and questions on Friday, attendees will find themselves in Salem with a full weekend ahead of them.What to do? What to do?I thought it might be useful to give you some idea of what there is to do in Salem when you're not getting your head stuffed with useful and interesting investing information. So here's a guide to Salem in August in three parts: history, culture and just general messing around.Yes, there was a spot of unpleasantness in Salem in 1692. The locals got a little carried away with the idea that witches were among them. After a series of Witch Trials that generated a fair amount of hysteria and left nearly two dozen dead, things returned to normal.But while the Witch Trials are now regarded as a black eye for Salem, the town has made every effort to embrace them as part of its identity. Salem is officially The Witch City, has the outline of a witch on the side of its police cars and employs an official Town Witch. The downtown features a Salem Witch Museum, a bronze statue of Bewitched star Elizabeth Montgomery (on a broom) and more fortune tellers and shops full of witchy merchandise than you can shake a stick at.Personally, I give about as much credence to fortune tellers as I do to those who predict the stock market, but if you want your palm read, your tarot cards cast or your aura buffed to a high sheen, Salem has you covered. Beyond its assorted witchiness, Salem also has many reminders of its central position in the China and spice trades, including a replica of the Friendship, a merchantman that was launched in Salem in 1797. National Park Rangers would love to show you around.I have a lasting memory of touring one of Salem's pre-Revolutionary Era houses years ago. I was stooping to get through a very low doorway into a very authentic kitchen, its hearth displaying all the tools necessary to get meals ready over an open fire, when I had a realization of how small these people actually were, and how dark and constricted their world was. It made me glad for my convection oven and my microwave, but it also made me sympathize with their trials, in every sense of the word. There's also a cornucopia of restaurants, gift shops, bars, art galleries and other spots to dawdle in. The average high temperature in Salem is 79 in August, and the average low is 62. Visitors know it's summer, but they're not reduced to a puddle by it.---Salem is lucky to have a world-class museum, the Peabody Essex Museum right smack in the middle of town. The Peabody Essex has great memorabilia and art connected to Salem's sailing past, but it also features fine art collections and traveling exhibits that make it a fabulous way to spend a day.I saw a traveling exhibition of teapots at the PEM that knocked my socks off. And the complete 18th century Chinese house that they have completely reassembled there is absolutely fascinating.For the literary minded, the House of the Seven Gables, made famous by Nathaniel Hawthorne, is open to give visitors insight into colonial living. And Hawthorne's own home is nearby and open to view. I always thought Hawthorne was a little creepy, and the insight provided by his house, and the one that inspired The House of the Seven Gables, didn't cure me of that.Salem has lots to offer, including boat rides, tours (both witchy and historical) and all the usual amusements of a summer in a New England tourist town. There's a 45-minute self-guided tour of the McIntire District, an area with more than 300 historic structures. Taking this tour will show you what Salem's rich merchants built instead of McMansions. My personal favorites for a way to spend a few hours is just to take to the streets and look in shop windows, find a table overlooking the harbor and enjoy a refreshing beverage or renew my life-long search for the best fudge in the world.I will also let you in on one gem that few tourists get to, even though it's know to everybody in Salem who loves breakfast. It's Red's Sandwich Shop, a fixture in downtown Salem for more than 50 years. Red's is located in the building that used to house the Old London Coffee House, which extends its pedigree back into the 17th century. The Hash & Cheese Omelet at Red's will put a spring in your step that will last through endless sightseeing. You won't run out of things to do in Salem. And if you take into account the compactness of New England-it's easy to drive through five states in one day-and the closeness of Boston, Cape Cod and the coast of Maine, you have unlimited opportunities.Combine all that with the wealth of investment lore and practical tips you'll get at the Cabot Investors Conference, and I think you'll want to take us up on our offer to make your August both instructional and enjoyable.---Here's this week's Contrary Opinion Button. Remember, you can always view all of the buttons  Originally by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who wrote, \"Life is like a game of cards. The hand you are dealt is determinism; the way you play it is free will.\" It makes sense to me. What's great about the investment world is that we are all dealt the same cards (ignoring the professionals with their super-fast computerized trading systems), so we all have equal opportunity to make brilliant, highly profitable investments. In investing, especially growth investing, which is what I know about, knowledge and confidence lead to gains, while ignorance and feeling like a victim leads to losses. The investment playing field is actually pretty level, and you can buy exactly the same issues as a mutual fund manager or a hedge fund guru. And beating them is a real thrill.---In case you didn't get a chance to read all the issues of Cabot Wealth Advisory this week and want to catch up on any investing and stock tips you might have missed, there are links below to each issue.Tim Lutts, editor of  , writes about what attendees as the Cabot Investors Conference can look forward to.

Last week,  the solid quarterly results offered up by \"Big Data\" player  , and you can add Guidewire Software to the list of stellar 2012 IPOs. The provider of insurance agency software turned an expected quarterly loss into a solid quarterlyprofit -- for the third straight quarter -- when results were released Tuesday evening. A $0.10-a-share profit was well ahead of the consensus forecasts of a $0.02 loss.Guidewire has been around for more than a decade, but has only recently gained major traction against incumbent vendors such as  and  . That traction is translating into 20% to 30% top-line growth, and sales are likely to approach $300 million in fiscal (July) 2013. The total market opportunity is far larger than that, and for Guidewire to boostmarket share to the levels seen by those bigger rivals, it will need to crack some major accounts. Recent contract wins with Columbus, Ohio-based Nationwide and Aviva, the largest insurer in the U.K., are surely good signs. Indeed, international expansion appears to be a solid long-term growth driver for the company.To be sure, this is now a story stock: The current run rate of around $40 million in annualizedEBITDA is just a fraction of the company's current $2 billionmarket value . Even if EBITDA hits $200 million by 2015, then this is still a richly-valued stock. So the key is to wait for the inevitable market pullback, as expensive stocks like this can sometimes take a pounding, which could then create a great entry point.Investors continue to closely track any companies that are working on a weight-loss pill, simply because the potential market opportunity is so huge. So investors are bidding upshares of Orexigen by nearly 5% in today's trading, solely due to a widely-expected announcement that a current clinical trial will be fully enrolled by the end of this year. Investors likely take note of the fact that rival  saw its share price double in late February when its obesity drug received Food and Drug Administration approval.  has soared to a recent $9.30, from $2 in late April, on the back of an FDA thumbs-up as well. (In case you are wondering, Vivus' drug is said to be more effective but has more side effects).Will Orexigen be next? Merrill Lynch's Steve Byrne anticipates that the company's Contrave weight loss drug will get the FDA nod and be on the market by 2014, which underpins his $10price target . That implies 100% upside. However, the FDA in recent years has increasingly sought to approve drugs that are clearly superior to existing approved drugs, so it's unclear whether Orexigen's Contrave will need to clear a higher hurdle than Vivus' Belviq and Arena's Qsymia drugs.As with many biotechs, Orexigen's share price outlook is binary: Approval would be a solid boost for this stock, but there's also ample downside if the FDA gives the thumbs down. Guidewire Software has delivered three very impressive quarters in a row since its January 2012 IPO. The key for investors is to wait for a less-than-stellar quarter, if it comes, as that could be the point to tap into the bright long-term opportunity that will still likely remain on track.Orexigen's clinical progress is notable as the company edges closer to the finish line. Yet even if you choose to commit some funds to this stock, then its speculative nature calls for a fairly small-sized position in your portfolio.-- David StermanDavid Sterman does not personally hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

The unwieldy nature of such massive enterprises makes it hard to peg a value for the entire firm, leading to a \"conglomerate discount.\"So whenever investors see a company take steps to break itself into pieces -- or \"deconglomerate\" -- they cheer loudly. In just the past 18 months firms such as  ,  and  have all racked up quick gains when they announced plans to break into two parts.The latest example: Information technology and defense contractor SAIC Inc., which is rallying nearly 8% this morning after announcing plans Thursday to spilt itself in two.SAIC's decision is for an unusual reason: The company found that certain divisions were being hampered from pursuing government bids because of a conflict of interest. In effect, the government was displeased that SAIC's technology consultants were recommending the use of the firm's technical services division.Yet caution is warranted, especially after today's gain. That's because SAIC has been a huge beneficiary of the government's decision to outsource many security and intelligence functions over the past decade. Sales shot up from $5 billion in fiscal (January) 2004 to more than $10 billion by fiscal 2009. The fact that sales rose to just $10.6 billion by fiscal 2012 highlights the limits of government's outsourcing efforts. And there's a good chance that outsourced contracts will be brought back in house to save money, which means that companies like SAIC may actually see revenue declines in the belt-tightening years ahead.When a company goes public, the stage is often set for a solid initialquarterly report . The company is well aware that many investors are paying close attention, so all efforts are made to pump up the quarter. Yet many of these companies often stumble in the subsequent quarter as all the tricks to juice a quarter have been exhausted.So it's quite impressive that analytics software firm Splunk delivered an impressive sophomore quarterly report on Thursday evening, giving the stock a double-digit gain in today's trading. Fiscal second-quarter sales of $44.5 million were more than 10% ahead of consensus expectations as more clients sign up for the company's \"Big Data\" software. That phrase has created a lot of buzz in tech circles this year as companies seek to more effectively harness and analyze all of the reams of data their servers are producing. Splunk was widely touted as one of the leading Big Data players when it was private, and still has that reputation now that it is public.Trouble is, with buzz comes nosebleed valuations. Splunk is on track to generate around $185 million in sales this year, yet its $3.5 billion valuation should give you pause. That kind of price/salesmultiple is hard to maintain as a company grows ever larger.Shares now trade for twice as high as the April 2012offering price, and if you missed this meteoric rise, you may as well wait to see if Splunk stumbles in the next quarter or two, which would allow you to own this intriguing company at perhaps a far lower price.Unless your name is Samsung, it can be so nice to get a phonecall from  . Once the company decides to use your company's technology, you can count on solid demand for your products -- and strongappreciation from investors. Omnivision, which provides the chips used in Apple's phone-based cameras, is just such an example. The company's sales have risen from $507 million in fiscal April (2009) to around $900 million by fiscal 2012, thanks to big orders from Apple.Omnivision's just-announced fiscal first-quarter sales of $258 million were nicely ahead of the $243 million consensus forecast. More impressively, projections of sales in excess of $350 million in the current quarter are far above the consensus $270 million forecast. That's an early glimpse that Apple expects to sell a lot of new iPhones in coming weeks and months. Look for analysts to sharply boost their forecasts as fresh reports roll in, and look for shares to extend today's gains as investors take note of a still-reasonable valuation in the context of surging sales and profits. Although Omnivision will never garner a high multiple, shares have ample room to run further. As a point of reference, audio chip maker  is also a provider to Apple and trades at around 13.5 timesforward earnings . If analysts adjust their fiscal 2013 earnings-per-share forecasts for Omnivision up to around $1.50, then shares could move up into the lower $20s.-- David StermanDavid Sterman does not personally hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

Customer base were approximately 1,600 at the end of the quarter.In the reported quarter, Splunk signed deals with more than 400 new customers.

Operating margin is expected to be in the range of negative 2.0% to 3.0% (was previously negative 4% to 5.0%).Splunk's revenue growth is expected to benefit from a strong growth in user base, higher renewal rates and expansions into new markets.

Instead, check out five other recent IPOs that are now selling far below their peaks. With newly-lowered share prices, these fresh IPOs have already seen the wind taken out of their sails -- a key consideration of the  slumps to fresh lows. Here are five names worthy of further research:Peak price: $37.57Current Price: $28.40This had been a hotly-anticipated IPO -- and for good reason. Splunk is a play on \"big data,\" an emerging trend that has companies focusing on the best ways to analyze the massive amounts of information that flow out of networks every day. Splunk has emerged as the largest standalone player in the space, boosting sales from $18 million in 2008 to a projected $175 million in 2012.It's not a cheap stock, trading for more than 10 times sales, and meaningful profits are likely a few years out. Yet, with the tough market erasing more than $600 million in  since the end of May, this recent IPO is worth a fresh look for investors seeking companies with potentially very robust growth.Peak price: $32Current price: $21This merchant rating service now tracks more than 600,000 locations with a reported 25 million cumulative reviews.  ,  and others have tried to make a big dent in this market, but Yelp has emerged as the leader. Just as the case with  many years ago, growth has been viral as a greater number of consumers attracts the presence of more merchants, which in turn makes it an even broader platform for consumers.In the quarters ahead, Yelp aims to deepen its presence among smart phone users and plans to roll out its service internationally. That's expected to keep sales growing at a 40% to 50% annual pace, perhaps reaching $250 million by 2014. But investors shouldn't expect to see meaningful profits until at least 2014, which may keep  from moving past that $32 peak for the next few years.Peak price: $25.50Current price: $14.25This company, which helps build and operate video delivery websites, recently made a splash by announcing it was giving away free tools to help companies make video-serving apps for smart phones. One key beneficiary:  , which would love to see an eco-system develop around its anticipated Apple TV launch.There's no question the worlds of TV and Internet video are rapidly colliding. Brightcove aims to enable its 4,300 clients to deliver video in a range of formats. Right now, the company generates roughly $20 million revenue per quarter with roughly 65% gross margins. Still, as is the case with many new IPOs, it might be a few years before Brightcove generates net profits. As such, investors should temper their expectations for near-term gains.Peak price: $29Current price: $16This luxury goods retailer was a hot IPO, in part because  bankers and brokers are often big fans of the brand's luggage and other travel items. Tumi operates about 100 stores, with plans to open 10 annually, especially in overseas markets with robust luxury goods demand. Tumi is expected to earn close to 70 cents a share this year, and  per share could exceed $1 once the global  starts to rebound.Peak price: $38Current price: $25The insurance industry is quite mature, but this software provider is uniquely positioned to outgrow the market. Guidewire offers software that helps insurers manage the billing and claims process -- an especially handy service for smaller insurance agencies that lack the funds to develop cutting-edge software that firms such as  and State Farm use.Sales shot up from $87 million in fiscal (July) 2009 to a projected $205 million in the  that ends in July. Analysts at Citigroup forsee strong growth ahead, with sales hitting $285 million by fiscal 2014.Risks to Consider:  While many investors like to focus on brand new stocks, it's the IPOs that are three to six months old that often  better value as there is less hype around them.-- David StermanDavid Sterman does not personally hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

China's A-share market drove IPO returns, generating average returns of 29% helped by the expectations of loosening foreign ownership restrictions.Following the second busiest April in a decade for pricings, Facebook's May debut was suppose to prove that US IPOs were back on course. Instead, a mismanaged offering and heightened market volatility led to an abrupt, month-long shutdown. US IPO activity fell 41% year-over-year, the second lowest level since the 1Q10. Some of the top performers were small cap technology growth stories, including big data companies Splunk (  ): +66% from offer price, Infoblox (  ): +30% and Proofpoint (  ): +20%. Overall, US IPOs outperformed the market (+4% average return vs. -7% for the S&P 500), helped by above average IPO discounting (nearly half the deals priced below the range). Excluding the first day pop, aftermarket returns were weak (-6%) as cyclical companies, including Edgen (  ): -31% and PetroLogistics (  ): -38%, weighed on results.The FTSE Renaissance Global IPO Index underperformed global equity benchmarks in the second quarter, generating a -13% return (MSCI ACWI; -10%). Second quarter performance was equally weak in the US, as the FTSE Renaissance US IPO Index underperformed the Russell 3000, generating a -16% return in 2Q12 (Russell 3000; -7%). Key detractors from index performance this quarter were major index constituents Facebook (FB): -16% in 2Q12, General Motors (GM): -22%, NXP Semiconductors (NXPI): -22%, and Zynga (ZNGA): -54%.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ccording to  , the largest CFO sells during the past week were: Lincare Holdings Inc, eBay Inc, Ultratech Inc, Amphenol Corporation, Splunk Inc, and Kimberley Clark Corp.Lincare Holdings Inc. is one of the nation's largest providers of oxygen and other respiratory therapy services to patients in the home.

The company's newest version of Windows was aimed at taking back lostmarket share from the likes of  and  . Yet as I  , the launch for Windows 8 has been underwhelming. Nearly three months later, this view still holds.Still, Microsoft has many other core strengths outside of operating software. Management should shift focus and ensure that each of these divisions has the right growth drivers to take market share. With more than $60 billion in netcash just sitting in the bank, it's foolhardy to stand back and do nothing.Here's a look at three Microsoft niches and how the company can strengthen them through acquisitions of young, fast-growing firms that are gaining relevant traction. History has shown that the fast-changing technology landscape often produces tomorrow's top-performinginvestments . And these are the kind of opportunities no investor should ignore.    It's easy to overlook this division as it has little exposure to the consumer end of the technology world. Yet it's a billion (in annual sales) division that is a key player in the management of many corporate networks. Microsoft has an especially strong presence in business intelligence and structured databases (with its SQL server platform).But in recent years, the hottest growth areas have been in a field known as \"Big Data,\" which is the ability to log, classify and analyze massive reams of data in real-time. And the most dominant entrant in the field of independent vendors is  , which closed on its first day of trading in April 2012 at .50 a share and is now a few dollars cheaper. Microsoft would likely have to pay north of .5 billion to acquire Splunk, which seems pretty rich for a company on track for just 0 million in sales in fiscal (January) 2014.But using Splunk as a beach head for a move into the Big Data niche would likelyyield major benefits for Microsoft down the road as it goes head to head with  and others. Microsoft could also look to make a smaller purchase in the field: Privately-held firms include Sumo Logic and Loggly.   If Microsoft wants to be seen as a serious challenger to Apple and Google in the consumer space, then itwill have to beef up this division, which is home to the Bing search engine, the MSN portal, the Hotmail email service and the company's SkyDrive data-storage service.It's this last service could serve to be a Trojan Horse for the company's other consumer initiatives. Hosting personal data and media content in the cloud is a key goal for Apple, and it should be for Microsoft as well. After all, consumers tend to remain clients once they have all of their important files on a particular platform.To boost market share in the data-storage segment, Microsoft may look to acquire  , which is growing at a 20% annual clip and is on pace to exceed 0 million in sales this year. The company is valued at about 5 million, and even assuming a 30%buyout premium, this would still barely make a ripple in Microsoft'sbalance sheet . Privately-held Dropbox, which may look to pull off anIPO this year, is also a potential target for Microsoft.   In the entertainment space, Microsoft's biggest challenge is a simple one: Attract new customers to its platform (which includes Skype, MSN, Bing, Hotmail and its various gaming efforts), and figure out ways to keep these customers' eyeballs glued to the company's properties. Outside of video games, the company is lacking compelling forms of entertainment and popular online services (such as dating sites).That's where  comes in. The company operates a range of online dating sites (such as Match.com), media and humor sties (such as Vimeo.com and CollegeHumor.com) and has also invested heavily in mobile apps, which is a big part of Microsoft's revamped smartphone efforts.IAC/Interactive brings more than just a billionrevenue base: It also brings an army of tech-savvy developers who have shown a willingness to make bold moves, a personality trait Microsoft sorely lacks. Back out IAC/Interactive's net 0 million in cash, and the company is currently valued at less than billion. Chairman Barry Diller is now in his 70s and may be willing to take anoffer from Microsoft -- for the right price.Risks to Consider:  One year ago, investors were looking ahead to Microsoft's looming Windows upgrade, andshares were moving above the $30 mark. A year later, shares have lost momentum and are back in the $20s, exactly where they stood five years ago. Apple and Google's share prices are up 200%, and 50%, respectively, in the same period.It's increasingly apparent that Microsoft will have to keep stepping on the gas to get its share price moving again. Its cash-rich balance sheet means that deal-making will most likely be part of the strategy. The buyout targets I mentioned here are a good starting point for further research as you refresh your understanding of the technology landscape. While some of these young companies will be buyout targets, others some will prove to be winning investments on their own merit. The 2013 IPO calendar is chock-a-block full of these high-growth tech companies,  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["On a day with no market-moving economic reports to speak of, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) found a triple-digit tailwind in the form of well-received earnings from a few major players. \"The European indexes moved higher today on bullish German sentiment data,\" noted Equities Analyst Bryan Sapp, \"and strong earnings from Microsoft (  ) helped U.S. stocks follow suit.
