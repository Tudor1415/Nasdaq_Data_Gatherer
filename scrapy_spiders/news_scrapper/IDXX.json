A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the\u00a0 for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street, we will dig into the future of television, and as always, we've got a few stocks on our radar. But we begin with the future of the workplace.This week, \u00a0and \u00a0became the latest companies to announce extended working from home policies for their employees.  CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said many employees at Facebook will work from home permanently. And with all this new flexibility comes increased safety for the health of those employees and increased risks for the businesses that have depended on big companies having their employees in a single office building. So, Ron, we haven't really heard yet from the big banks on Wall Street; you have to imagine they're thinking about this as well. What does this mean for commercial real estate as well as the restaurants and shops in those urban areas? Nothing good, Chris. [laughs] This is going to be a big deal. Commercial real estate has got to be, I think, the biggest thing that gets impacted as a result of the work-from-home trend. Companies are inevitably going to reduce their need for office space, vacancies will increase, prices will drop, I think retail bankruptcies that we've been seeing are going to exacerbate this commercial real estate problem and it's going to continue for some time.Interestingly, I think we're also going to see an exodus from cities into suburban locations from people. And as folks move out to the suburban areas, we actually could end up seeing a residential real estate boom out in the suburbs. Again, leaving the cities in some type of pain as a result of increased vacancies that we've already started to see. As you mentioned, I think restaurants as well, especially those that rely on office parks, right around Fool HQ, for example, we were talking about earlier, some of those restaurants are going to be in real trouble as the amount of people that come to work each day permanently declines. And as a result, I think, we are bound to see permanently less restaurants in the U.S.I think there will be some positives from the work-from-home trend, cars are going to last longer. We're not putting as much mileage on them. There will be a reduced demand for gas. I think the environment is likely to benefit. So, there are some pros to this.Apparel is going to change as well. Less need for work apparel, less need for pants, more need for sweatpants and pajamas, but there will, I think, be a change to the apparel industry as well. Emily, what do you think? I think what Ron said is true, but there is also another silver lining here that I feel like not enough people are talking about, it's pets. I mean, there's no way that a permanent work-from-home trend doesn't result in more pet ownership across the United States. All these people who are spending hours commuting, living in cities where they didn't have space for pets, now are living at home, right, living in the suburbs, living in spaces that allow them to have cats and dogs. So, that could be a wonderful long-term trend that also comes out from this movement. I hadn't thought of that until you just mentioned it, and now I'm thinking I need to look at businesses like  and sort of the pet care industry. Or . Or pet food. Yeah, Chewy. Let's move on to the home improvement industry. \u00a0and \u00a0 both out with first quarter reports this week. Emily, we typically see a similar story with these two, this quarter was no exception, higher revenue for Home Depot and Lowe's, but higher costs as well. Yes. Home Depot and Lowe's typically move in line with each other. So, it was really interesting to see them have such substantially different quarters despite both existing in the same macroenvironment this quarter. So, Lowe's had amazing comparable same-store sales. I mean, that was up over 11%, and that's nearly 5% over Home Depot was, at 6%. So, both were great quarters, but it's weird that we see such outperformance by Lowe's, especially when typically, it goes in Home Depot's favor.When I think about the tailwinds that both of these companies are experiencing, I come back to what their core customer is. And Home Depot and Lowe's spent a lot of money this quarter supporting their employees, but ultimately the DIY home improvement person, you or I, is more likely to shop at Lowe's versus contractors which will typically go to Home Depot. And they do have some overlap, there's some competition there, but I think that's what we saw really influencing on Home Depot this quarter; it was the fact that a lot of contractors who were working on big projects didn't come through with those projects during this pandemic, whereas the average person who is sitting at home, looking at that hole in the wall [laughs] maybe they haven't fixed in a while thought they should probably get out to their local Lowe's and improve that. Yeah, I think it was interesting the comments that Home Depot made about comp sales which, in a vacuum, 6% comp sales is nothing to sneeze at, at all. But obviously, Lowe's, as Emily pointed out, faired a bit better.Home Depot said they were accelerating, and that'll be interesting to see what this next current quarter they were in, how that shapes up. Do these even out and become a little bit more the way we've seen in the past, similar types of increases or is something changing at Lowe's that will continue the outperformance? You know, we've said in the past, these companies are similar. Obviously, we think Home Depot is probably a little bit better-run than Lowe's, as a result it trades at a premium consistently, the stock trades at a premium. So, for example, now you can buy Lowe's at about 19X earnings where you have to pay about 23X earnings for Home Depot, but you're getting a little bit of a better company.I actually always say, I don't see the need to necessarily choose one or the other, they're both fine companies to own and you could split the difference, but I do want to see what kind of acceleration to comp sales Home Depot comes up with in the current quarter. Well, and one of the things that we've seen from other companies in other industries that we are not really seeing with Home Depot and Lowe's is the marketing spend. Home Depot and Lowe's are traditionally big spenders on advertising. They haven't really ratcheted that back the way that some companies have. So, that's probably also having a little bit of impact on the margin picture.But, Emily, to Ron's point about Home Depot, typically being a better-run company; Marvin Ellison at Lowe's, I think, he's been CEO for nearly two years now. It really seems like his work is starting to pay off in terms of the way Lowe's is operating. Yeah. Ellison has made a lot of improvements to Lowe's that are similar to the improvements that Home Depot has been making over the past five years or so; digitizing the experience, making it easier for people to sign up for loyalty programs, really improving on the omnichannel experience for shopping at Lowe's. Ultimately, if you go to Home Depot, there's probably a Lowe's within a stone's throw distance and vice versa is true for Lowe's. So, there is a lot more price competition and customer competition there than there is in other industries.But these two companies, to Ron's point, are the two dogs in the home development space. I mean, there really is no other competition. So, I think there's value in owning a basket. I do think that Ellison has more to prove with Lowe's than Home Depot needs to prove though. Shares of \u00a0and \u00a0 flat this week as the two major retailers issued their first quarter reports. Ron, there are a bunch of different ways we can go here, but I'll just start by saying, Walmart and Target putting up same-store sales growth of 10% to 11% is pretty impressive. Very impressive. And these are similar stories here, right up until you get to the bottom-line, but let's talk about the similarities first. Both saw revenue increases, Walmart 9%, Target 11%. As you said, both had comp sale increases in the 10% range, Walmart doing just a little bit worse than Target; Target at 10.8% and Walmart at 10%. Big numbers there. Obviously, the beneficiary of being open, being a necessary business while other businesses got shut down and them really taking advantage along with folks like .Very strong online sales, as you would expect, Walmart up 74%, Target up 141%; different bases obviously. But Target, I think, their investments that they've made over the last few years in same-day delivery and pick-up, really paying off, seeing the same-day business up 278%; a huge number, obviously, aided by the crisis that we're all being impacted by.Both had to spend a ton of dough as a result of COVID-related costs and wages to keep employees. Walmart put the cost at about $900 million, Target at about $500 million. Margins were lower for both companies as a result of those lower margin items like food being sold and some of the higher margin items like apparel being weak.But then when you get to the bottom-line, you see that Walmart was, kind of, able to absorb these extra costs quite a bit better with earnings per share up 5% versus Target getting, kind of, whacked there, down about 60% on an earnings per share basis. No guidance from either company, but they're both really strong companies, I expect them to continue to execute well even when the country reopens and they're not necessarily the only game in town. But they will be one of the winners of this retail shakeout that we've been talking about. And I wouldn't want to downplay the importance of the permanent changes in habits that will come from people who have adjusted their grocery or food delivery to different platforms as a result of this pandemic. If I can bring everybody back to the beginning of 2020 when Walmart spent millions of dollars on their Super Bowl ad, reminding people that they had grocery pickup in most of their locations. I mean, I was one of the people who laughed and said maybe that was a waste of money, right, I mean the people who are ultimately shopping at Walmart are aware of the fact that they do grocery pickup, but that money, as it's been proven out over the past few months, was well-spent.I think people who have made a shift to grocery pickup are probably more likely to retain those habits once this pandemic is over then we may have given them credit for a few months ago. Ron, just real quick on the apparel question. Obviously, apparel, a higher margin item. Target has made investments in apparel. It really seems like, you know, I'm not looking to add pressure to CEO, Brian Cornell, but it really seems like they are set up to succeed in a future where we're wearing fewer suits and more casual clothing. They are very well positioned here. They've brought designer brands in-house, they've private labeled some of the designers they brought in, they've created a new price point for those designers who have been willing to, kind of, dilute their brand and sell more to the masses at a value proposition, a value point that lots of folks can afford. They make absolutely fine clothes at a reasonable price. I think that continues, I think they continue to steal business from some of those retail apparel companies. Wednesday was the day that shares of \u00a0 resumed trading. Luckin had been halted in the wake of an accounting scandal, and shares down more than 40% this week.Emily, we're getting a lot of questions about this issue. I mean, obviously, the House of Representatives would still need to take this up and then it would need to go to the President, but this seemed like a pretty strong signal. Yes, this is Senate bill 945 and it actually had bipartisan support in the Senate. This bill would essentially say that any foreign-listed company in the U.S., and this is really targeting Chinese companies since they are the main offenders, would need to certify that they are not controlled or owned by foreign governments, and then also get the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to audit their financial statements or have an auditing firm that is approved by the PCAOB.So, this would be a big change in response to how Chinese companies are listed in the U.S. exchanges today. They do escape some of the oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission, because the Chinese government is one of those governments that says the financial information of our companies is relatively proprietary. Now, as you mentioned, Chris, this would need to be taken up in the House of Representatives and approved, then voted on by President Trump. It's also worth noting that this, as you mentioned, is in connection with Luckin, it's not a coincidence that this bill is proposed around the same time that Luckin Coffee is being delisted from the Nasdaq here in the U.S. because of fraud allegations.So, Chinese companies are definitely being targeted right now. This is not something to be overly panicked about. There would be a three-year period, as proposed in the Senate bill, for these companies to essentially come into compliance with this new law. It would also need to be passed by the House of Representatives, but if these Chinese companies weren't able to come into compliance, then they would potentially list themselves on other exchanges, Hong Kong, London, potentially, which would prevent American investors from being able to get exposure. Is it possible they could list on the Toronto exchange? It is possible, it only applies to U.S. exchanges, and this includes the over-the-counter exchange, the OTC or pink sheets market here in the U.S. So, the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the over-the-counter exchanges. Neiman Marcus and \u00a0 are just two of the retailers that have filed for bankruptcy so far this year. And \u00a0 CEO, Jeff Gennette, sees an opportunity. Gennette said this week, there's $10 billion worth of sales up for grabs in the retail landscape. He's not wrong, Ron, but can Macy's be one of the retailers to capitalize on this? They could potentially be able to capture a small portion. I think the lion's share will go to stronger retailers. Right off the bat, the few that we always talk about as being the survivors here: Walmart, Target Costco,  will get the lion's share, and then the rest can, kind of, divvy it up. I don't think it's going to be, kind of, the savior for companies like Macy's that are struggling.And these department stores, you know, we just saw JCPenney, obviously, recently file bankruptcy finally. As you mentioned, lots of other folks, , J.Crew, Neiman Marcus, , and lots of smaller ones that we don't talk about or really don't hear that much about, and that's going to continue.So, sure, there's going to be a demand from the consumer for these items still, but I think it's going to continue to be the big guys that benefit. Emily, I mean, I think we all think we're going to see more retailers going out of business. Do you see retailers essentially spinning off part of their brands just so that the remaining business can survive? We see some retailers doing that right now. So, JCPenney has potentially talked about spinning off their retail brand versus the real estate aspects of the company, but it's worth noting that the underlying economics or demand trends that exist don't change just because you spin something off. Ultimately, all of these retailers have really struggled with merchandising. Trying to predict what people are going to want to buy and in what quantities and in what colors next season has been the struggle that companies like JCPenney and Macy's have been put up against, which has really supported discount retailers, which happen just to take excess inventory, they're not trying to make any predictions about where the market will be a season or two from now. That produces a much lower-cost model, and there's really not much that a lot of these traditional retailers can do to completely change their business model at this point. Shares of \u00a0hit an all-time high this week as the video game company wrapped up its fiscal year; fourth quarter revenue of more than 40%. Emily, this is a great quarter and really a great 12 months for Take-Two. And most people can assume why it was such a great 12 months for the company, because this pandemic has caused a lot of people to play games that weren't necessarily playing games before. Take-Two has an amazing collection of really great brand names, including , these are stalwarts in the gaming industry that are not going away anytime soon. Is TiVo still around? That's the question Dave Shull asked before he became CEO. He'd already been an executive at  and The Weather Channel. Recently, Dave Shull talked about TiVo's business and future with Motley Fool analyst, Tim Beyers; and contributor, Dan Kline, who kicked off the conversation.[...] Dave, to set the stage here, and I cleared this question first, because I didn't want to come off as glib, but there was a point where TiVo was a pop culture company. There were jokes on late night TV, because you watched , you would like to watch  . And TiVo has 10 trademark noises and some of those noises were actually like, you know, the beep-boops that everybody knew. And the company does not have that profile right now. Can you set the table for, sort of, what TiVo is compared to what it used to be? And I'm excited about where it's going, and share a little bit about where it's going. So, it's interesting, when I walked into the company my first question was, are they still around? Right, this amazing heritage of innovation goes back more than 20 years; that's like, damn, that's pretty cool. But the company has changed a lot. We've done 15 acquisitions in the last 15 years. We've had four CEOs, when I first came in, we had four CEOs in a quarter. So, things have changed a lot. And there was a lot of, sort of, turmoil.What people don't understand is, there's maybe a million people out there that don't have TiVo service. And I love those fans because they're so tied to the technology and they can tell me, sort of, the 20 years of history our tech, but if you look at sort of the broader business, we have 22 million households around the world that are using TiVo technology, but they're doing it through their cable company. They may not realize that it's actually TiVo technology that's powering that. But 22 million around the world is pretty broad. And so that's really the bread-and-butter of the company, where we're going.Well, when I said, listen, we've got to get on the streaming wars. And so today we announced this product TiVo Stream 4K which puts us, kind of, squarely into the streaming wars and is really the future of the company. Now, I looked at the 4K and I'm very excited to order one. But I would like to hear, is this you taking on , like is that sort of -- you know, are you throwing down the gauntlet going after, you know, Amazon, Roku, the other players in this space, or is it a little bit of a differentiated product? And just to add to that, Dave, before you answer that, you have a partnership with Roku, if I understand right. So, if you can sort of paint the whole picture here, because it's a little strange and it would be really great to get like the whole picture there.So, there's going to be a little bit of Roku envy. I think those guys have done, Anthony there has just done an absolutely amazing job. You look at his market gap, I don't know what it is today, about $14 billion, $15 billion, our market cap is a little bit less than $1 billion. They've done a phenomenal job, so kudos to them.But I do think, there's really a missed opportunity, which is, when you look at the Roku device, it's easy to install, it plugs into your TV, but what it does is it gives you a bunch of different apps. And you have to remember, is that on  or is that on Hulu or is that on Prime or Sling TV? When we look at our research, on average, people have seven different apps that they're trying to manage. And it could be an advertising-based on-demand service, it could be a Netflix or Prime or a Hulu, it's like, where's that show, where do I find it? And so, we think that's a missed opportunity in the streaming space.And so, because we have decades of experience dealing with complex content recommendations, we can say you know what, it's not about the apps, it's really about the shows. And so, what I want to know is, what show do I want to watch now. And we have all the metadata, we have all the content recommendations and the algorithms, so we can say, \"Hey, we're going to bring all your entertainment together and we're going to make it really easy for you to find the show that you want to watch and you don't have to remember what app is out there.\" And so, that's kind of the magic of TiVo Stream. You know, when I look at the financials of the company, the biggest part of your business is intellectual property and licensing. And so, you're primarily a software company here. And it sounds like what you're doing here is building out an operating system of sorts, sort of, a layer on top of all these services that is consumer-friendly, intended to be consumer-friendly, that organizes the mess that otherwise exists. Yes, so that's fair. Let me, kind of, back up and at a higher level, I want to talk about TiVo as a company, if that makes sense. So, $650 million in revenue roughly, $227 million in EBITDA. And I'm in the middle of closing a merger, so we've given very specific projections in the proxy. So, I would direct the investors to that proxy S-4. But it's roughly half-and-half intellectual property, and half product.And so, on the intellectual property side, there's a base of about 5,000 patents. And we license those patents out and those patents go back decades. Any place where you see people playing video in some sort of linear stream fashion or targeting ads around video, we have some pretty good intellectual property claims. And so, the vast majority of paid TV operators, certainly in North America, but also in Europe and in Asia license our patent portfolio for that.On the products side, we're the TiVo consumer base, these million loyal customers that we have tied to the DVR. And many of these people have very high-end, complex, sort of, TV systems and so, that's where the value of the technology is.We then have built out a software stack, to your point, that's in 22 million households around the world, where we've deployed, sort of, the best of all the TiVo know-how and put that in place for the consumers to experience that but in a traditional cable setting. We're now taking the best of all that and we're synthesizing all that down to a $49 dongle that you can just plug into the back of your TV and any content that's available on the Android TV platform is immediately, sort of, integrated and gives you recommendations across live TV. So, we have a very unique partnership with Sling TV on-demand content, Netflix, Prime, Hulu, and then also all the AVOD [Advertiser-Supported Video On Demand] content: Tubi, Xumo and now Pluto.And so, basically, it's kind of the culmination of, OK, intellectual property, invented stuff that got deployed in millions of set-top boxes around the world, and now we're saying, how do we distill the best of that software platform down to this dongle that we call TiVo Stream?Let me ask the business question. So, Roku makes money from, if I don't have Netflix and the first time I subscribe to Netflix, I do it through my Roku box or dongle or whatever device I have, I have all of them, they make a cut of money. Do you have the same relationship with some of your brand? So, if I've never been a Sling customer and I sign up through them, I am a Sling customer, but when I sign up, do you get a cut of the money? Yes. And the simple answer is, again, I think Roku has done a brilliant job of trailblazing here. So, we make very little money on the hardware, which is why it's $49.99 for a product that's 4K and Dolby and a bunch of other stuff. So, it's an amazing little piece of hardware for that price, which means that we have to make money in the future. So, the way we make money in the future is a cut of your additional subscriptions, but also most of these AVOD services, like Tubi and Xumo and Pluto are ad-based and so there is some revenue-sharing there, because what they want is, they want an engaged consumer. And our view is, consumers can't process 50,000 titles, and so that recommendation engine on top of the metadata makes it much more likely that someone is actually going to watch that show. So, it's a valuable relationship for both us and for the provider.And, Tim, I'll let you jump in with the real business questions, but I have one more question. I live in a house with a 16-year-old and my wife who is also my age. And we all have very different television choices. Do we need one device per person are there multiple accounts on the same device, how does that work? So, right now the devices are intelligent by room and by time of day. So, what we haven't done is we haven't layered another set of, sort of, profiles on top of that, right? So, the box in my office knows that I'm sitting here at this time and it knows that it's kind of my box, right? So, if I'm going to put another one up in the playroom where the kids are, and so it will have very different content recommendations for them based on the time of day because it knows it's a different box.We're looking at profiles in the future, but we're trying hard to make it a really, really simple interface. And so, we think, lots of people provide recommendations, very few companies actually provide recommendations based on time of day. And so, that's sort of a proxy for profiles, because the viewing habits tend to be very different at 5 o'clock at night versus 10 o'clock at night.Can you just for context here, and maybe to oversimplify things a little bit. I think most of us who followed TiVo in the past know that you have some patents that are related to the four-letter words you were relating to, the DVRs and so forth. But there are probably a lot that we don't really know about that our TiVo innovations that I'd like to invite you to maybe give us two or three that are patented technology that TiVo introduced, that people just, you know, we gloss over and we don't realize that's TiVo technology. Can you give us a couple of examples of that? Well, I would say a lot of the voice technology that you use today when you talk to your set-top box actually originated with TiVo. And we would argue that some of the companies that maybe haven't licensed our technology that, [laughs] you know, I'm not going to name names at this point, but you can, kind of, [...] some we just talked about, actually derived their voice capabilities from our voice patents. And so, we provide voice technology around the world, actually much more than the 22 million households that I talked about, because we actually have a know-how and a dedicated team that's focused on that.So, what's interesting about the TiVo voice product, we call it Conversation, is you can say, \"Hey, what's on tonight?\" So, it has to understand what's on TV tonight and that I'm talking about entertainment content. \"No, I actually want a comedy,\" \"Comedy from the 80s,\" \"Something with Tom Hanks.\" \"Wasn't the one where he was on an island?\" And it starts to bury down to that, and you can have that contextual conversation that's really unique.Now, we're not magicians, the way we're able to do that is we understand we're talking about entertainment, and we have a very, very deep understanding of the metadata and, sort of, the linkages between all of these different assets based on our knowledge base. And so, there's a lot of IP tied to that. And we think there's some strong claims around that as well. So, Dave, is your vision on the TiVo side to eventually just organize everything? The mass of content, whether it be podcasts or video or YouTube videos or all the other things, to just provide, sort of, a blueprint in order for people, is that, sort of, the bigger, grander plan? Yeah, I think so. So, our tag line, which there was a little bit of trying, right, you got to blame the marketing folks, but I actually kind of like it. Our tag line is, \"bringing all your entertainment together,\" making it easy to find, watch and enjoy. And so, there's two parts to that statement, really. One is, we do want to bring all of your entertainment together in one place and then we want to make that finding process easy.And so, we think there's a lot of challenges in the streaming world right now and so we want to solve that for you. Where do you think the bulk of your business -- like, let's talk about the future here. We're five years ahead, and TiVo and Xperi have merged, where is the business coming from? You know, five years from now, are the winds at your back because of cord-cutting, where is your growth coming from five years from now? If you had to cast a vision for what we as investors want to be looking for if we're investing in your company? So, I think the future is still to -- the plan is to split the IP business away from the product business, and I think what that does is that gives you a team that's very, very focused on building up intellectual property as an engine, and making it recurring. And then the product team is not having to deal with litigation, they're very focused on new innovative products.So, when you look at the product side, I think the future is very much, hopefully, TiVo or some version of the TiVo experience is embedded across hundreds of millions of devices, whether it's a TV or whether it's an automobile. And I think that very quickly becomes a very light, software-only solution, and doesn't require any hardware changes. I think that's really the win, because I think there's a proliferation of streaming content that is going to continue over the next couple of years and I think consumers love having that choice and they love having a free choice, which is AVOD.So, if you look at, you know, your investors may or may not track it, but Pluto was sold to , Tubi TV was sold to Fox. Zumo was sold to NBC. And these are all three big consumer advertising-based on-demand services. So, consumers love that model. And then they're still willing to pay a premium for unique content, like Netflix and Prime and Hulu.In that five-year future then, in this area where TiVo as a technology is pervasive, does that mean TiVo also is bringing you exclusive content as well, like, program shows? I think that's something we want to avoid, and the reason why I say that is because I think our value in this new world is not shows, right? NBC and Fox and CBS are always going to be able to outproduce us. And our value is, if we have the best user interface, the best content recommendations, the easiest way to find new shows, then we provide value to the consumer, of course, but we actually provide value to the show producers, as well. Our email address is . We got a question from Nick in Canada, who writes, \"I can't begin to thank you, and the rest of the analysts at The Motley Fool, for everything you've taught me. My financial life has been completely changed by you. I'm a very dedicated listener to many of The Motley Fool podcasts.\" Thank you, Nick, we appreciate that. He goes on, \"I had a question about spend allocation between ETFs and individual stocks. I've heard a few different analysts at The Motley Fool mention they think it's a good idea to be buying, both, shares of an ETF and individual stocks, so my question is, what would be the appropriate split between these two?\"Ron, for those unfamiliar with ETFs. Exchange Traded Funds, traded just like stocks, but they are baskets of stocks so you can buy the , the  technology ETFs, commodity ETFs, any strategy you want to pursue, there is a basket of stocks waiting for you to buy, and it's just like buying or selling a stock, unlike a mutual fund, which only trades once-a-day at the close of the market at 4:00 PM.I think it's a great question. I'm a big fan of ETFs. And when I tell people that about 50% of my personal portfolio is in ETFs, they're often surprised. Now, that's a little bit skewed because my 401(k) is primarily in an ETFs, so if you strip that out, I'm about 25% ETF; 75% individual stocks. I don't think there necessarily is the right number, I think a person could have 100% of their portfolio in ETFs if they wanted to, if they were not the type of person that liked to pick stocks and follow stocks, so. I also don't think it depends, necessarily, on age either, I think, either way is fine to go, depending on how much attention you want to give to your portfolio. Emily? I would generally agree. I've also been open about the fact that a lot of my assets, virtually all of my retirement funds are in index funds, not necessarily ETFs, but funds that track the market. It's because I don't like the volatility in a lot of the funds that I know I'm going to need to retire with, for instance, but everything else that I invest in is in Individual stocks. And that's a totally personal preference, mostly because I know that if I have my individual assets that are, you know, volatile on a daily basis, invested in Chinese companies, cannabis companies, whatever you put into it, I know that if that money goes away, I still have my retirement fund.So, without digressing too much into my personal finances, I don't think there is a right answer, I think it depends on you and your personal risk tolerance. Alright. Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Ron Gross, you're up first, what are you looking at this week? Speaking of discount retailers earlier in the show, I'm going to go with , ticker symbol TJX. Retailer best known for TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, focused on a wide assortment at very competitive prices for its customers. Obviously, this last Q1 was a mess, sales down 52%, stores were closed. As of May 2, stores have started to reopen, 1,600 opened so far out of about 4,500. Importantly, the company is seeing sales above last year's for those reopened stores. So, all things being equal, we may be back to a growth mode.Balance sheet is strong, thanks to a $4 billion float of notes. They did suspend their first quarter dividend and probably their second quarter, but before that, they had 23 years of consecutive dividend increases with a compound growth rate of 22%. Dan, question about TJX? Certainly. Ron, so when I was a kid, my mom would take me and my brother on shopping trips to the TJ Maxx in Springfield, Virginia. And I remember it as being a very boring time. What can be done to make shopping at TJ Maxx more exciting for children? Well, it's commonly thought of as, kind of, this treasure hunt experience. You walk in, it's almost like looking at a tornado of clothes, they're everywhere. And you got to find exactly what's right for you at the right price. So, think of it as a little bit of a treasure hunt. Emily Flippen, what are you looking at? I'm looking at a Chinese company called , the ticker is PDD. They reported this week and had really impressive sales, especially as compared to , which didn't quite meet expectations. They had a 42% year-over-year increase in active buyers on their e-commerce platform. And impressively, they had nearly as many active buyers as Alibaba. So, they've scaled up really quickly in China. Dan? Yeah, Emily, the Senate bill doesn't give you any pause with a company like this? It may in the future, but right now, no. Two very different businesses, Dan, you got one you want to add to your watchlist? You know what, as much as I remember those times in TJ Maxx and I didn't really enjoy myself, I got to go with the discount retailers on this one. So, Ron, you're the winner. Nice. Finally. Alright. Ron Gross, Emily Flippen, thanks for being here.Thanks, Chris. Thanks for having. That's going to do it for this week's edition of . Our engineer is Dan Boyd, our producer is Mac Greer.

That's what's great about tracking hedge funds. You can see where the smart money is being put, and you can see if managers put their money where their mouth is. If you have $1,000 to invest, now could be a great opportunity to start a new position, and billion-dollar hedge fund managers have been scooping up shares of  ,   and  .You may not recognize IDEXX Laboratories, but if you're a pet owner there's a chance you've crossed paths with its products or services already. IDEXX is a leader in pet healthcare innovation, with a list of diagnostic products and services that enhance the ability of veterinarians. Here are some reasons why Bridgewater Associates, a fund with over $5 billion in portfolio value, might have scooped up shares during the first quarter. IDEXX is one of a few stocks to outperform the S&P 500 over the past three months as COVID-19 swept the globe, but the company expects to feel some pain during the second quarter, as some people deferred animal care. That said, there is an intriguing trend taking place that could actually be a boost for IDEXX post-COVID-19. Animal adoption and fostering of shelter pets has increased during the pandemic, and these newer pet owners will almost certainly need to use pet healthcare. Already, Americans' spending on pets just hit a record high $95.7 billion in 2019, and at  has there been a year-over-year decline in U.S. pet industry expenditures. Image source: Getty Images.In addition to rising adoption and additional pet owners, IDEXX's intangible assets could improve as veterinarians across the U.S. turn to the company for helpful products and services to keep veterinarians and consumers safe during COVID-19. IDEXX boasts a cost advantage thanks to its network of reference labs, and has a competitive advantage from switching costs -- both advantages that will help weather the COVID-19 storm. Here's what we know to be true:  and they are spending more on them than ever. That means IDEXX has a long-term growth story that COVID-19 can only temporarily slow.While IDEXX Laboratories outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three months, Goodyear Tire, a manufacturer of tires for automobiles, trucks, and aircraft, has spiraled lower with its Americas and Europe manufacturing temporarily suspended. Analysts are predicting double-digit  and sales for the full-year. As if that wasn't bad enough, more Americans stuck at home for social distancing means fewer tires on the road and fewer miles traveled -- bad news if you're a company selling tires. Perhaps buying when others are fearful is why Appaloosa Management's manager David Tepper started a position in Goodyear Tire during the first quarter. With COVID-19 keeping cars off the road, and a plateauing North American auto manufacturing market, it's easy to be pessimistic about Goodyear Tire. However, the company could be oversold because many investors don't realize the majority of Goodyear's sales are from replacement tires, rather than from major automotive manufacturers. Furthermore, the company has also turned its focus to larger than 17-inch tires, which offer much larger profits than smaller tires. In fact, the industry estimates that the profit margin per tire for a consumer replacement larger than 17 inches is almost four times larger than consumer replacement tires smaller than 17 inches.Goodyear Tire certainly hit a speed bump with COVID-19, and its second-quarter financial results will be rough. However, the company could be oversold  Its global manufacturing facilities will be coming online soon if they haven't already, it has a\u00a0 growing larger-than-17-inch tire business, it has $3.6 billion of cash and available liquidity to weather COVID-19, and it's seeing favorable trends in prices versus raw material costs.Starbucks is certainly a household name in the U.S., and it's absolutely the leading specialty coffee retailer, but that doesn't mean the company is all out of growth stories -- far from it. Not only does it still have a growth story, the company will be far better positioned to survive COVID-19 than smaller competitors, and those two reasons could be why Ken Fisher and his Fisher Asset Management fund scooped up a chunk of shares during the first quarter. Let's get back to the growth stories. Long-term, the king of coffee still has plenty of international growth potential in emerging markets and can even grow into new channels with new platforms and products. Heck, it still has a U.S. growth story, as it could build new store formats such as premium location, drive-thru only, and kiosks, among other ideas. There's also menu evolution with new cold beverages, health and wellness options, and even new delivery partnerships.Image source: Getty Images.What's also great about buying Starbucks at a time of uncertainty is simply the company's massive scale and liquidity to , but to apply even more pressure to smaller competitors with more competitive prices. The stock markets will rebound, but not all companies will survive the near-term effects from COVID-19. However, you can invest in Starbucks and still sleep well at night.COVID-19 has been a tragic development for the entire planet, and its financial effects will be heavily felt during the second quarter. With stock market volatility and an ample amount of uncertainty facing investors, if you have $1,000 to invest right now, IDEXX, Goodyear Tire, and Starbucks are being scooped up by billionaire hedge fund managers. It's not difficult to see why.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Starbucks wasn't one of them!

[Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the call over to Jay Mazelsky. -- Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. Today, we're pleased to report strong Q1 results despite late quarter impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. As we'll discuss the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our care customers in unusual ways given broad-based social-distancing efforts, which are changing the ways veterinarians are prioritizing and providing care. We're working through these near-term dynamics, ensuring that we're fully supporting these essential health services in a way that prioritizes our customers' needs. We're doing this while we continue to advance our business strategy.Today, Brian will review our Q1 results and provide an update on current trends that we're seeing in our markets and our business. He will also describe the steps we're taking to mitigate near-term impacts and position ourselves for a strong and sustained recovery in the highly attractive pet healthcare market. I will then talk more about how we're seeing trends evolve in the market and how we're managing our business for the near term and the long term in this context.Now I'll turn the call over to Brian. -- Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We'll be using a somewhat different format for today's financial review. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial results, which resulted in solid revenue and profit gains despite late quarter impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We'll then spend time discussing the near-term dynamics that we're seeing in the Companion Animal healthcare market, including evolving impacts from COVID-19 containment approaches on clinical visits and diagnostic testing levels. We'll review how we plan to manage in this environment and highlight the steps we've taken to mitigate near-term P&L impacts and strengthen our balance sheet and flexibility to position our business for a strong recovery. While we're optimistic about the ability of the pet healthcare market and IDEXX' business, in particular, to rebound strongly from near-term COVID effects, we're withdrawing our full year financial guidance as we work through these dynamics. As such, we won't be providing an update on that front today.Let's start with an overview of our Q1 results. IDEXX delivered 9% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, supported by 10% growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting double-digit gains across both U.S. and international markets as well as solid gains in our Water and LPD businesses. Overall, organic revenue growth benefited by less than 1% from accelerated stocking orders in our Water and LPD businesses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through early March, Global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were trending very strongly, above the high end of our full year goals for 11% to 12% organic growth. We were also tracking toward an excellent instrument placement quarter, driven by continued momentum in new and competitive catalyst placements globally. These gains were against a backdrop of improved market trends, reflected in 4% same-store growth and U.S. clinical visits through this period. As social-distancing policies advanced more broadly in Europe and the U.S. through March and as vet clinics adapted to prioritize healthcare procedures to align with industry and government guidelines, we saw significant declines in clinical visit activity and restriction on access to vet clinics, which moderated our Q1 revenue gains.Despite these impacts, our business momentum enabled strong overall Q1 organic revenue growth across our modalities. Global Reference lab revenues increased 9%, reflecting 8% organic gains and approximately 2% growth benefit from acquisitions, offset by a 1% FX headwind. Through early March, Global Lab organic growth rates were excellent, driven by continued mid-teen organic revenue growth in the U.S. and high single-digit gains in international markets. For Q1 overall, late quarter social-distancing impacts constrained U.S. lab organic growth to high single-digit rates and international lab organic growth to the low to mid-single-digit range. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% on an organic basis despite late quarter COVID-19 impacts, reflecting low double-digit gains in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in international markets. Our consumable revenue growth results through early March were also very strong, benefiting from an expanded premium instrument installed base, sustained high levels of customer retention and continued gains in testing utilization. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high in Q1, reflected in 238 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 698 new and competitive placements in international markets.We also benefited from 273 second catalyst placements driven by momentum with North American customers. These gains and sustained high customer retention levels supported a 17% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base. We also achieved 760 premium hematology placements in 408 SediVue placements, bringing our global SediVue installed base to over 9,300 instruments, up 32% year-on-year. Restriction on access to vet clinics in late March led to deferrals of quarter end placements, however, which contributed to year-on-year instrument organic revenue declines of 16% overall in the first quarter. Rapid Assay revenues increased 6% organically in Q1 despite late quarter COVID-19 impacts, supported by solid volume growth in SNAP 4Dx Plus first-generation and specialty products and moderate net price gains. First quarter results reflected normal promotional and customer stocking activity which supported volume gains ahead of the peak testing season. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues achieved 11% organic growth, supported by continued strong gains in recurring service revenues as well as sustained solid sales of new cornerstone and digital imaging systems and strong growth in our Neo and SmartFlow cloud-based software offerings. Overall gains were also constrained by COVID-19-related impacts on vet clinics late in Q1, which led to deferral of new software and digital system installations.Turning to our other business segments. We saw a strong performance in our Water and LPD businesses in Q1. Water revenues increased 15% organically, including an estimated $2 million or 8% growth rate benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Overall, our Water business demand has remained solid globally as drinking water testing remains an essential service and priority for local governments and utilities. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 12% organically in Q1, including approximately $3 million or 9% of growth rate benefit from accelerated stocking orders. LPD results benefited from demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and improvement in core swine testing volumes in China. We're also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing. Overall, LPD gains were constrained in Q1 by lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results, impacted by the rebuilding of herd populations in key Asia Pacific markets, which is reducing export supply. Livestock diagnostics are also considered essential services, supporting continued demand for LPD products. Turning to the P&L. Profit results were strong in Q1, benefiting from solid revenue gains and controlled operating expense growth. Operating profit in Q1 increased to 8%, as reported, and 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid operating profit growth across our CAG, Water and LPD segments.Operating margins increased approximately 30 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting operating expense leverage and strong revenue gains. Gross profit increased to 8% as reported or 10% on a constant currency basis in Q1. Gross margins were relatively flat year-on-year on a constant currency basis as benefits from strong consumable and water growth and continued moderate net price gains were offset by relatively lower margins in our Reference Lab business. Reflecting late quarter pressure on lab revenues related to COVID-19 impacts, lab capacity investments advanced in 2019 and effects from the integration of the Marshfield acquisition. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 9%, as reported, and on a constant currency basis. Operating expense increases were driven by costs related to the expansion of our global CAG commercial capability advanced in 2019 and growth in corporate, general and administrative costs, including the onboarding of our Westford, Maine headquarters expansion. During the quarter, we benefited from early efforts to prioritize investments and control discretionary spending to mitigate emerging COVID-19 impacts. EPS in Q1 was $1.29 per share, including tax benefits of $6.6 million or $0.08 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 13%.Overall, we're pleased to have delivered strong financial results in Q1 despite late quarter headwinds related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Let's now spend some time discussing how social-distancing policies and associated restrictions on business activity are impacting veterinary clinic visits and our CAG business in the near term. Clinical visits have been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic through the implementation of social-distancing protocols as well as industry guidelines for the prioritization of sick patient and emergency procedures at vet clinics. These dynamics can be seen in U.S. vet clinic tracking data, which is shown in the earnings snapshot on our IR website. We've added weekly tracking data for 2020 clinical visits extended through the week ended April 24 in the snapshot as well as detail for wellness and non-wellness visits. As shown in this data for the first quarter through early March on a same-store basis, clinical visits were up approximately 4% in the U.S., a solid improvement from 2019 trends. As social-distancing procedures expanded in March, we saw a sharp correction in these trends with same-store U.S. clinical visits declining approximately 25% for the weeks ended March 27 through April 10, with 15% to 20% year-on-year declines in sick patient visits and 35% to 40% declines in wellness visits during this period.We saw similar dynamics in European markets with more significant declines in severely impacted regions like Italy and Spain as well as markets which implemented more restrictive stay-at-home policies like the U.K. In addition to this clinical visit data, we've been monitoring rolling weekly averages for chemistry slide-run volumes and Rapid Assay runs through our global SmartService connectivity as well as rolling weekly trends for accession volumes in our Reference Labs. In the late March through the early to mid-April period, we saw meaningful pressure in diagnostic testing levels associated with restrictions on veterinary clinical activity. These initial impacts were relatively more significant in our Reference Lab and Rapid Assay businesses with average weekly volume declines of approximately 30% in the U.S. and approximately 35% in Europe during this period, with more moderate impacts in Asia Pacific markets. Testing volume in these modalities were impacted in part by the deemphasis of wellness testing at clinics as part of the pandemic response consistent with industry guidelines. VetLab in-clinic chemistry-run volumes were relatively less effective during this initial period, reflected an approximately 20% run declines in the U.S. and 25% declines in Europe. These metrics reflected lower test utilization levels as well as moderate reduction in the number of clinics actively operating during this initial high-impact period.Over the last two weeks, we've seen significant improvement in clinical visit and diagnostic testing trends. These changes reinforce the high resilience of demand for Companion Animal healthcare and may indicate that we work through the bottom of near-term COVID-19 effects on veterinary care. For the most recent week ended April 24, overall U.S. clinical visits declines have moderated to 15% year-over-year, with only 9% year-on-year declines for sick patient visits and 24% year-on-year declines for wellness visits. With steady improvement across U.S. regions week by week. We're seeing similar indications of improvement in European markets and in Asia regions where which were impacted at an earlier stage by the pandemic. In terms of our business, we continue to see pressure on diagnostic testing levels. However, these impacts have improved meaningfully. In the U.S. and Europe, on a rolling 7-day basis, IDEXX VetLab chemistry-run declines have now moderated to approximately 5% year-on-year, and Reference Lab accession volume declines have moderated to 10% to 15% overall, with continued steady weekly improvement across regions. Chemistry slide runs in leading-edge markets like China have actually returned to double-digit growth over the last eight weeks, following significant initial impacts on clinical activity. These changes vary by region and may change depending on region-specific dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but overall, recent trends have been very encouraging. As we track data on COVID-19-related impacts over time, some insights are emerging.One insight is that most veterinary practices have sustained operations as an essential service through this initial high social-distancing period positioning the market for a strong recovery. In the U.S., our tracking of the number of customers doing chemistry runs only declined to about 90% to 95% of prior year levels during the peak pressure period in early April, and has now returned to prior year levels over the last two weeks. Active customer tracking metrics have also rebounded strongly in Europe, where we saw more meaningful reduction in active clinic levels earlier in the COVID-19 expansion in lockdown regions like Italy and Spain. We're seeing the same structural market strength in Asia Pacific regions as well. The second insight is that the effects on diagnostic testing levels appear to be heavily influenced by the stage of development of COVID-19 case management and the associated stage of stay-at-home and social-distancing procedures. There's a significant variation in the level of decline in diagnostic testing volumes by region. Regions with higher relative COVID-19 cases and expanded lockdown policies have experienced much more significant clinical visit and diagnostic testing volume declines. As an example, clinical visits in the Northeast U.S. declined approximately 35% in late March to mid-April, while Southern U.S. regions declined approximately 20% during this period, with more recent data from Southern U.S. regions showing year-on-year declines of less than 10% overall.Internationally, near-term pressure on lab accession volumes in regions like Germany have been much more moderate compared to markets with extended lockdown conditions like the U.K. and Canada. In Asia Pacific markets, we're also seeing moderated impact in regions that are farther along in terms of managing pandemic effects, including recent solid growth in IDEXX Lab chemistry runs in markets like Australia, which has less restrictive social-distancing controls. This is the dynamic we'll continue to monitor and which is challenging to project. Overall, it does appear that as regions move past peak levels for COVID-19 cases and adjust stay-at-home and social-distancing procedures, near-term pressures on clinical visit activity and related diagnostic testing lessened significantly. While we remain very optimistic about the healthcare market and IDEXX' ongoing growth opportunity, reinforced by recent encouraging trends, COVID-19 pandemic effects will pressure our near-term revenue results. Given the high gross margin of our IDEXX VetLab and Rapid Assay products and our intent to sustain our Reference Lab operating and service capability to position ourselves for recovery and demand as market restrictions are lifted, we anticipated we anticipate a high level of gross margin flow-through impact from near-term CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue pressures. To mitigate these impacts, we've advanced prudent steps to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $25 million on a quarterly basis compared to the original planned levels.This includes temporary reductions in salaries of 30% for the CEO, 20% for officers and senior executives and 10% for the majority of other salaried employees, which we plan to cease over time as business conditions improve as well as temporary freezing of 401(k) matching contributions and suspension of cash compensation for IDEXX' Board of Directors. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position, and we've taken additional steps to strengthen our liquidity and flexibility to advance our business strategy and market position during this period. We ended Q1 with leverage ratios of 1.70 times gross and 1.59 times net of cash, with $81 million in cash and $362 million in capacity available on our then $850 million revolving credit facility. In April, we increased committed financing availability by $350 million by expanding our credit facility to $1 billion under a new three greement and by issuing $200 million of 10-year 2.5% fixed rate notes. In the current environment, we prioritize funding of our business operations and have suspended our stock repurchase program. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong momentum demonstrated in our business in Q1. We've got a great business model, and we're confident we can manage effectively through near-term impacts from COVID-19 in our CAG business, while positioning ourselves for a strong recovery in the highly attractive and resilient Companion Animal healthcare market. That concludes our financial review.I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. -- Thank you, Brian, for your comments on Q1's financial performance. We're pleased with our solid Q1 results despite late quarter impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. We went into the year with strong momentum. And through early March, Global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were trending above the high end of our full year goals for 11% to 12% organic growth. We were still able to deliver 10 % points CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth in Q1, supported by double-digit growth in the U.S. and international. In spite of impacts from China in the early part of the quarter, from Italy in early March, and then from much of Europe and North America shortly thereafter. Instrument placements were excellent in Q1, resulting in sustained year-over-year levels of catalyst EVI. Our catalyst installed base grew 10% in North America and 25% internationally, with the overall premium instrument installed base increasing 15%. We developed a new remote inflation process for instruments which also supported placements in the impacted regions. The IDEXX Preventive Care program enrollments also achieved record levels with approximately 400 new enrollees and more than 4,200 cumulative enrollments since program inception.This was accomplished despite late quarter impacts from COVID-19. Customers continue to embrace the IDEXX Preventive Care turnkey solution at record numbers and increasingly view it as a foundational element of their care offering. Though we expect in some cases, for implementation to take a bit longer due to COVID-19 impacts, the IDEXX Preventive Care program will be a key element of hat we and our customers see as our Recover Together plan for North America. Our product innovations announced at VMX were launched on schedule and were enthusiastically greeted by customers. Our digital cytology placements starting in early March were primarily sold to larger IDEXX customers via our IDEXX 360 program. Customers are enthusiastic about our test promise of results and expert interpretation in under two hours, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Catalyst bio acids with Reference Lab quality performance was also launched in the quarter. We're pleased with adoption to date with over 340 customers. SediVue Neural Network 5.0 updates began rolling out in March, and advanced bacteria detection kits started to ship in April. Our innovation highlights also included the announcement in Q1 that we would begin monitoring clinically symptomatic pets for COVID-19 infection.We then announced in April that we would offer this test commercially throughout the world based on a small number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in cats, experiments that demonstrated the susceptibility of cats and ferrets and veterinarian demands for a testing option. We expect this veterinary test to not have an impact on human COVID-19 testing or test availability. Additionally, the company's human health business, OPTI Medical Systems, is advancing support of human COVID-19 testing with a validated PCR test kit, enabled by IDEXX' expertise in livestock PCR test development and manufacturing. It is intended for limited initial distribution to existing customers, including labs serving animal production needs that have been repurposed for human COVID-19 testing. Moving to software. We saw excellent ongoing momentum in our software business, which I'll speak to later, with over 10% growth in PIMS placements in North America, record orders for SmartFlow and with now over 4,800 customers on Web PACS subscriptions. Moving to a quick update on our European core lab located in Kornwestheim, Germany. We've begun testing, and it remains on track to transition by the end of Q2. We're excited by the world-class capabilities of this facility, which is 50% larger than our next biggest lab, we'll bring to our European Reference Lab customers. Our team has done an amazing job to stay on track despite the pandemic.Finally, our Water and Livestock, Poultry and Dairy businesses, both performed solidly in Q1. Demand for livestock diagnostics testing is also considered essential, and we're seeing sustained solid demand in our LPD business. Brian highlighted some of the dynamics we're seeing in the market and our testing volumes from COVID-19. Next, I'll discuss how we're managing in this environment, helping our customers and positioning ourselves for the future. Let's start with how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the IDEXX workplace and employee safety. Approximately 60% of our employees are now working from home. We've invested heavily in telephony and IT infrastructure over many years, so that we were able to transition a majority of our employees home without missing a beat. Still other jobs require employees to be on site, like those of manufacturing, distribution and the Reference Labs. We've instituted practices at these locations that minimize risk like staggered shifts or frequent and deeper cleaning and local social-distancing procedures. Our teams continue to stay highly engaged and productive. Not only have we launched products on schedule, like the previously mentioned digital cytology service, catalyst bio acids and advanced bacteria detection for SediVue, but we continue to advance our product pipeline as our teams are adapting to the new circumstances in highly creative ways.Moving to how veterinary practices are being impacted. They're experiencing similar challenges as other businesses based on client visits. The good news is that veterinary practice has been designated as essential businesses throughout the U.S. and in almost all countries. The vast majority are open and operating, and we're still performing essential services for their clients, caring for sick and injured pets in need of attention. Demand for other services, including wellness visits and elective activities, have slowed due to government policies and guidance from veterinary organizations designed to control COVID-19 spread. Though our veterinary customers are consequently seeing fewer patient visits at this point, volumes impacted are in line with the aggressiveness of social-distancing procedures. Many services are only deferred, and we believe we'll return relatively quickly as in past downturns once the recovery begins. We believe the bond between people and their companion animal family members is as strong as ever. As Brian noted, we have seen dampened demand relatively more in our Reference Lab business versus testing in the clinic. This is related in part to fewer preventive care visits versus those involving a sick patient. Further, practices like all businesses are also concerned with workplace and employee safety.They've instituted practices like curbside dropoff and pickup, robo check-in and bill pay, along with the creation of modified shifts for veterinary staff to ensure care team wellbeing and continuity for clients. Our field service organization has played an important role helping customers make these required adjustments to their practice workflow in this new COVID-19 environment. IDEXX sales professionals have also adjusted well to this dynamic, continuing to generate demand for our products and services. Virtual visits, that are now standard, could be highly sophisticated. Our sales professionals are using tools like Webex for demos and DocuSign to bring pipeline deals across the line. We also continue to visit practices when requested by a customer and with an appointment, abiding by necessary safety procedures. Our in-person availability has been welcomed by customers and in April constituted about 25% of total U.S. visits. Veterinarians look to business partners in all times, but even more so now to have sufficient product supply on hand, and be able to supply services like Reference Lab testing in an uninterrupted manner. They want to focus on their businesses and now that their partners can handle theirs. IDEXX has performed exceptionally well in this regard. And we have high confidence that we can continue to do so in the future.Our manufacturing operations are largely based in the U.S., and we have excellent visibility to secondary suppliers for key components and products that we do not directly manufacture. Our reference that performance has been especially noteworthy, in light of the disrupted flight schedules, challenging logistics and more complex workplace procedures to keep lab employees safe. With over 80 labs worldwide, not unexpectedly, there have been a handful of instances where we've needed to temporarily shut a facility for a short time due to an employee being or suspected of being infectious. Because of our network lab capability across regions and geographies, we were able to seamlessly toggle to an alternative lab without service disruption or deterioration. These capabilities are unique in the industry and only possible because we have made significant investments over a very long period of time in lab density, common labs information management systems and courier route and logistics capability. We also deployed a global lab digital cytology service in the middle of all this. Another example of global agility and advantage. Our commercial execution also continues to be noteworthy. Our expansion in the U.S. was completed going into Q1, and the team seamlessly settled into their new territories and account assignments.Our account managers continue to call on customers with similar frequency, but now the majority of visits are virtual. Our European commercial team continues to mature in the BDC model and is also performing at a high level. We entered into the year with record customer loyalty across modalities. And all actions taken to date have been taken with a long-term view to continue to earn this loyalty for years to come. IDEXX veterinary software and services are also playing an important customer-enabling role in this pandemic. Right now, customers are being forced to rethink how they deliver patient care and IDEXX' software solutions, both new and existing, to help them adapt. The IDEXX Telehealth offering includes multiple third-party Telehealth integrations into our global PIMS offering, 90-day free secure remote access for our cornerstone customers, the ability to use SmartFlow through an iPad from their parking lot for curbside checking and contactless payment processing integrated with their IDEXX PIMS. These capabilities enable customers to deliver remote care as well as continue to see patients in their practices, while abiding by social-distancing guidelines.We also believe that in a medium term, Telehealth can expand demand for diagnostics through deeper pet owner client connections, enabled by real-time convenient communications that millennial pet owners expect and pet owners of all ages appreciate. Further, Telehealth has a potential to expand patient access, especially for cats who comprise only approximately 20% of practice visits today. Next, I'll share a snapshot view of the health of the business. There are broad macroeconomic uncertainties as to the depth and length of the impacts from COVID-19. Consequently, our focus has been on what we can control and our plans for recovery. We took quick and deliberate action to prudently control costs while leaving us well positioned for future growth. These included temporary salary reductions, reductions in our essential business and capital expenses and the cessation of stock buybacks. Our intent is to cease those reductions that are temporary, like salary reductions as conditions improve. Critically, these actions were taken in ways that allow us to preserve the considerable strategic advantages, talent and organizational engagement we have as a company. Our financial strength has allowed us to support veterinarians at a time when they need us most, and I believe they will reward. Our approach with their business long into the future.We have taken practical actions, which extend payment terms for customers who need it as well as to provide near-term flexibility for minimum commitments while maintaining these long-term diagnostic partnership agreements with customers. Customers have given us and will continue to give us as much testing volume as possible. Our focus is, therefore, to support the health of their practices and allow them to focus on delivering excellent medical care in a challenging environment. And when the time comes, support them as they quickly rebuild client traffic. We participate in great markets. Nothing has changed in this regard due to COVID-19 social-distancing practices, that have temporarily limited veterinary visits. If anything, pet owners have become even more attached to their companions as they spend even more time with them at home. Pet adoptions and fostering are at an all-time high and breeders, in many instances, report waiting list of 12 or more months. And most importantly, pets still need to go to the veterinarian, and most pet owners do not consider these visits to be discretionary. Diagnostics will continue to play a central and growing role in the care of the patient as well as practice health. Many practices have seen accelerated impacts from e-tailers gains in online sales of food and medicine.This is business that is not likely to come back at the same levels. Veterinarians will continue to look for practice categories like diagnostics that are medically necessary, drive the care envelope and almost always best done in the practice. Our belief is that as a result of pent-up demand from COVID-19, which is constrained care that is desired and needed, though perhaps not time-critical, veterinary practices might experience a stronger V-shaped recovery than the vast majority of other market segments. We see some early evidence of this in select markets like China and Australia and regions within the U.S., where these markets have begun to relax strict sheltered home policies. Practices will be in good shape to meaningfully take up where they left off, though they have reduced hours and furloughed employees, in some instances, we believe that there isn't structural damage to the industry or the balance sheet of practice hours. As practices we build client traffic with a focus on wellness care, we'll be there with our strategic advantages, fully intact. We're using this time wisely, continuing to advance our product pipeline, strengthen relationships and provide exceptional day-to-day service. The unique capabilities that we bring are now even more widely appreciated. And keep in mind that this is a highly resilient business with history of outperforming in economic recovery periods. While these are difficult times, they're an important reminder of our company purpose and that what we do makes a big difference in the lives of pets, people and livestock. I'd like to express my deep appreciation and thanks to the team for their extraordinary support during this period.Now we'll take questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for taking the questions guys. I want to talk about some of the steps you just touched on, Jay, the cost cuts and the salary reductions you implemented earlier in the quarter. Can you talk us through the rationale of that move? It seem like it happen a little bit sooner and was more significant than initially expected. You talked about the V-shaped recovery and the sharp rebound. And yet, those are somewhat meaningful cuts, is there any concern that you could see increased employee turnover, potentially to some of your competitors as a result of this? And what criteria are you using to determine when you lift some of these measures given the improvements you've noted in some of the end markets? -- Sure. I'll cover some of the high-level thinking and philosophy behind us, and then Brian may want to talk through some of the specifics in terms of how we were thinking about them. We have a great business. We have a great organization. We really approach this with the idea that we want to that we're going to come out of this, that we're going to come out of this strong, that the market, that pet owners love their pets, that they believe that taking their pets to veterinarians and getting testing is the right thing to do. We know that veterinarians believe that testing is good medicine and it uncovers disease. And so we wanted to approach us in a way that allows us to maintain all of our strategic advantages. These are advantages that we build up, not just a year or two but over decades. If you take a look at the Reference Lab, for example, 80-plus Reference Labs, common labs, information management systems, courier routes, service levels that are exceptional, including weekends.We don't want to lose any of that capability. We don't want to we want to be able to continue to execute our product road map, maintain high engagement in the organization, continue to deliver exceptional service levels make sure that we have supply when customers need it. And most importantly, if you take a look at our customer-facing organizations, maintaining full staff levels and being able to continue to serve customers is even more importantly. So we did this in a way that we think it was prudent, that maintains engagement that the organization understands and responded to positively. And so that as we come out of this, all these strategic advantages, organizational capability and engagement remains intact. So Brian, did you want to address anything? -- Yes. Mike, I think we as I mentioned in some of the commentary we provided early on, on this, I think the stay-at-home policies and that were being implemented late March, very early April were we were seeing significant impacts. And we didn't have clarity on how that might evolve and thought it was prudent to get out in front of that. And as Jay highlighted, we had a goal of protecting employment and trying to find ways to mitigate what we were expecting in terms of some near-term impacts without damaging our underlying ability to advance our business strategy or serve customers. And I think the intent was to cease those cuts when it made sense. I think we're very encouraged by the recent trends. It's improving significantly day by day. And so I think we'll keep an eye on this, but I think that was the intent. The changes were implemented at a time where I think the depth of the impact from the social-distancing policies was more significant.Our next question will be from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks. Are you seeing any sort of changes in the competitive landscape at this point? Can you take advantage of any competitor disruption on either the point-of-care side of the business or Reference Labs, given that you can withstand the sort of volatility be a little bit more nimble in this environment? -- Yes. Thanks for the question, Erin. We've always said that our markets have historically been very competitive. It's no different now. Even if it's within the COVID-19 environment, they continue to be very competitive. We're very pleased with the way with the inroads that we continue to make in terms of if you take a look at the competitive catalyst placements globally, we were up 17% to premium installed base year-over-year, 15%, we continue to expand Reference Lab testing. The point-of-care solutions, like VetLab, have held up relatively well in the COVID-19 environment. Now part of that is due to the fact that they support more sick patient testing with real-time results. If you take a look at the Reference Lab, for example, before the COVID-19 impact, we were at the solid middle teens in the U.S. from a growth standpoint, high single digits internationally. So we did see some drop off in volume, in line with the visits and prioritizing case management, as Brian described it. But we've also seen even now with the drop-off in the beginnings of a recovery, the customers have a new appreciation, a far deeper appreciation for what we're bringing in terms of service levels, lab network, density, courier, logistics, all of those things. And I think what they're seeing from some other participants in the marketplace is they don't have that capability and that footprint to be able to provide that level of service. -- Okay. Great. And then can you remind us of the sustainability of pricing across your business in prior economic downturns? And can you also speak to how minimum purchase agreements associated with consumables are impacted from the COVID disruption as well? -- Yes. So from in Q1, we continued to realize modest price realization of between 2% and 3%. Relative to future pricing dynamics, we're clearly not going to forecast that today. The thing that I would point out is that customers don't just think about price, per se, they look at price within the context of overall value from what they get. We're always pressure testing the economics within that value construct. In terms of actually the programs themselves, we do have volume-based commercial programs. And in some cases, we're making allowances for rebalancing obligations, where programs just, I think, reflect the reality that there's some reduced client traffic in testing volumes and want to be able to support our customers through that.And our next question will be from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. -- Thanks guys, good morning. Maybe for Jay or Brian, is there a way to think about, call it, like sort of loss versus deferred revenue? In other words, your growth has been so consistent and durable every year, around 10% to 12% organic. If the growth just, to throw out a number, is up low single digits this year, when we think about 2021, do we sort of go back to that 10% to 12% off of that low single digit number? Or is there a chance for, call it, being a big acceleration mid-teens growth as we think about the deferred coming back? And I think that's just an important area that everyone is trying to get their arms around. I'm defaulting to loss revenue because an emergency would have occurred, and I don't think you do two wellnesses in 1H 2021, but maybe if you can go ahead and talk to that, that would be helpful. -- Yes. I think as you point out, Jon, it's a little difficult to estimate at the moment. I think our feeling is that there will be level of pent-up demand here for care that will come back as people are able to access vet clinics. It is likely that there's a level of kind of sick patient care that is just going to be lost in terms of the impacts at this time. And it's just until we kind of work through this and kind of get back to what we think is going to be rebound to a good place in terms of the industry's health. It's a little tough to project that out, which is why we're moving away from guidance at the moment. But I think the under we feel the underlying fundamentals of the industry are very sound. We think that working through the dynamics with our customers will only reinforce the advantages that we have as a business. And I think we'll be very well positioned to grow as we come out of this. -- Yes. I'll share with you, Jon, a couple of things we're hearing from veterinarians. Let me focus on wellness, because to your point, if the patient is sick and/or needs a surgery, they have obviously still have the opportunity to do that. If you take a look at Q1, we had a record number of preventive care enrollments in the first quarter, 400. So that puts the overall program at 4,200 to date, as I indicated earlier. But the important thing about preventive care, just as a category, is pet owners see that as something that's not discretionary, something that they truly prioritize for their pet. And more and more, what practice owners and veterinarians are telling us is not only do they consider this good medicine because it uncovers more and drives the care above. It's important to their practice economics important to client engagement. They see it from both the medical necessity and practice health standpoint. So they're chopping at the bit. That speaks to what Brian had indicated where we are relatively optimistic around sort of this pent-up demand at more of a V-shaped recovery. It's part of our it's going to be part of our recovery strategy, Recover Together strategy to emphasize that. There's still tons of work to do on sick patient testing in addition to preventive care. So we're relatively optimistic. -- Okay. And Jay, maybe just to follow-up on that last point. One thing that we're hearing about COVID-19 is just the change of workflow within the practice, curbside pick up, sort of spacing out the visits more. At the end of the day, it's reducing the overall number of visits just from a workflow perspective. And I think it's unclear how long this hangs around, right? How it plays out over time? So you talk about this V-shape recovery, but do you have any concerns that this altered workflow has a lasting impact, sort of which results in a more protractive return to normal for the industry? -- Yes. I mean, just a couple of observations. The first couple of weeks of veterinary practices, they struggled to adapt that workflow. I mean, partly it was a drop-off in visits, but partly, as you described it, they extended they had to expand appointment blocks, and it was more challenging for them. Now we've worked with customers through our field service organization to be able to help them design new workflows in terms of curve side drop off and pickup and remote check-in and contactless payment processes. They've gotten much better at it, just like you'd expect that over time, you begin to optimize your processes. So different states, different regions are in different the stages of recovery. And so initially, it was only from the parking lot. I think over time, we will see that relaxation. The other point that I would make just tying together your two questions is that, when you take a look at what's happened within the practices with the e-tailers and a lot of product sales, both food and medicines going online, the a lot of that business is not going to return at least at the same levels that they experienced before. That's going to put even more focus on getting the patient into the practice, having checkups using diagnostics. So again, we'll see how this develops over time, but I think all the trends are positive. -- Okay, thanks for the color, guys.We have a question in queue from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Jay, can you talk a little bit more about Recover Together? It sounds like you've developed a specific blueprint for kind of the bounce back. So I'm curious what that involves and how you're marketing that? -- Yes. I mean, it's it really comes down to the fact that even within this COVID-19 environment, we're still highly engaged with our customers. Our customer-facing folks are visiting customers, 75%. Just take the U.S., for example, is virtual, but 25%, when requested, we're present and fully decked out in safety gear. So there's a high level of engagement. We're building pipeline. We're working with our customers in terms of developing strategies that as we recover, they rebuild client traffic. We saw coming out of the Great Recession in 2009, that a lot of really good clients or pet owners returned almost immediately. Where the veterinarians, I think, needed some help and assistance is for those relatively newer clients to help build the muscle memory of semiannual or annual visits. So we're looking at programs that we have. For example, our Preventive Care program is perfect for that.And even those sick patient visits are allowed or advised, there's still some things that people are likely pet owners are likely deferring. So we're looking at all of our programs to be able to support that. Just one word on IDEXX 360 because it's really tailor-made for this type of environment. If you think about IDEXX 360, you're able to get capital purchases with 0 money down. So if you're in veterinary practice, if you're in this constrained environment from an economic standpoint, you can still purchase instruments and you pay on a monthly basis that you're able to match invoicing to the customer with testing volumes. So in some ways, it's really tailor-made to task for this type of environment. So we're looking at all of those things in terms of how to support customers. -- Okay. That's very helpful. And then a little bit more color on OPTI Medical. I know that doesn't get a lot of airtime, an acquisition you did to benefit the Companion Animal business. But what's the potential for that if you get FDA approval? And kind of how will that process go? I assume you'll have a distribution partner for that within the human market. So any color there. -- Yes. So we've developed and validated a human real-time PCR test for COVID-19. And really, to your question, we leveraged the capability we have in OPTI, which is our human health business, from a regulatory standpoint and channels, but also our experience in developing and manufacturing livestock infectious disease kits in our current business. So this is a test, it's a PCR test. It is highly effective in terms of sensitivity and specificity from a performance standpoint. Results, you typically get results in well under four hours, so it's fairly quick. And we've used OPTI has used or is in a process of using the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization process.We're waiting for approval as well as we've applied for a CE mark in the European Union. And so we're advancing our ability to manufacture these in our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business and really targeting for initial distribution existing IDEXX customers, so not necessarily using external channels. So these include things like livestock, laboratories, public health laboratories, state CDC labs, stuff entities like that.Our next question, we will go to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning, thanks for the questions, I guess to start, I think, Jay, you mentioned vet services have tended to be pretty resilient during past downturns. Obviously, consumers are going to be facing kind of uncertain economic conditions coming out of this. I guess I'd be curious, just when you look at wellness visits in recent weeks, I mean, has there been any change in metrics like the percentage of those visits that include blood work or the number of test orders that might provide an indication of the consumers' ability to spend on diagnostics for their pets? -- Yes. So let me I'll answer that question at a couple of levels because you had mentioned recessionary environment and the resilience of the business, which is absolutely true. When you take a look at the Great Recession in 2009, we performed extremely well, growing 5% and coming out of the trough of that. And if you now race ahead 10 years later, we're even, I think, better positioned to be able to perform strongly in a V-shaped recovery. So you think about the business as a whole. We're extremely well diversified geography across businesses like CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy across different modalities. And plus lots of shapes. So just a couple of things that I would emphasis that I would emphasize, which includes our commercial organization with if you take a look at it a decade ago, we were represented primarily through distributors.And now we have more direct representation. And so we're not reliant on others. I think the fact that our portfolio is far broader, it includes sick and some of the wellness pieces that you emphasize. And I think the role of diagnostics is far more appreciated and how important it is and really how it feeds into not only good medical care, but practice health. In terms of the component of diagnostics over the recent couple of weeks and what that looks like, not sure we have visibility to that data yet. That's something that we'll continue to look at on a weekly basis in terms of both lab accessions as well as through SmartService, what the testing piece is, but still too early to comment specifically on that question. -- Yes. I would highlight, I think the as we're looking at this data day-by-day, literally, it's very encouraging to see how quickly it's coming back. So I think it's we think that's reinforcing the willingness that we've seen for a long time with the pet owners and on critical care and for their what is now a member of the family, I think this is even more powerful than it was over 10 years ago with the last Great Recession. So early indications, we're very encouraged by, and those are areas we'll continue to monitor. -- Great. And just a quick follow-up. As you've seen restrictions start to ease in some areas, have you also seen kind of rep visits pick back up? I'm just curious to know if there could maybe be a more prolonged impact there, if that's kind of want to limit the number of sales reps that they see in the clinic, just due to their concerns around COVID? -- I'm sorry, I didn't I missed that part where you said the number of what visits pick back up? -- I'm sorry. Yes. Have your sales reps, I guess, been able to start to go call on customers in areas where restrictions have eased? And could that have a more prolonged impact on just their ability to kind of get back in and see customers? -- Yes. Okay. I get it. Absolutely. The way we conduct visits today is when customers ask us to be present, we're present. That differs than a lot of other companies out there that have essentially 100% virtual visit policy. So if you take a look at April, for example, 25% of the visits of the field organization was actually physically visiting the practice. Now if you break that down by states and regions, it did differ. Based on the how strict the social-distancing procedures were in the practice. And what we saw in places like Texas and the South, relatively more visits, relatively higher visit levels in terms of clients and more testing, impacted higher impacted regions like the Northeast and the Great Lakes, for example, a bit lower. So very much in line and proportional to what the local guidelines are per state per region. -- Thank you.We have a question in queue from the line of David Westenberg. Please go ahead. -- Thank you for taking the question. So I'm just going to layer on some of the questions that have already been asked. Can you talk about your balance sheet right now, some of the rationale between taking on the additional debt? Is that out of offense? Can we expect at the practice level, maybe there's some liquidity needs and right now, it's your opportunity to help those practices that need to preserve cash. And then just related to that, do you think that they're going to be more likely to avoid the cash flow and sign the contract? Or do you think there might actually be some hesitancy on that contract? And then as a follow-up on the near term, can you quantify the pent-up demand? I know VCA used to say, in their practice, they have an 80% recovery rate in a snowstorm kind of environment of those appointments. Is that a good way to think about it in terms of when social distancing ends? And I'll take these questions offline. -- Thanks, David. Just on your balance sheet question, I think we had some of the work that we highlighted was in-flight before the pandemic really started impacting the business. We were in the process of securing some of the term note financing at low rates, and we're able to execute that effectively. And our revolver was up for renegotiation this year regardless. So I think we just advance that, and we're able to extend it and actually upsize it. And I think we were in an excellent position. We're in an even better position.And I think you raise a very good point, it enables us to continue to be highly supportive of our customers. We are helping independent practices in the U.S. and Europe with some payment term dynamics in the near term and trying to be as helpful as we can. As Jay mentioned, I think our programs are very well suited to helping people through if they have near-term concerns about cash flow management to continue to advance their businesses. And we'll continue to be leaning in on that front and helping practices in ways that makes sense for us all to move back to normal over time together. -- Sorry, I would just also, again, reemphasize the IDEXX 360 program is ideal in many respects for new customer acquisition in this environment. No cash outlays, matching customer invoices with the use of consumables. And the other thing, David, is we're able to calibrate future commitment expectations for customers in terms of how we use this. So I think we all recognize that this is a unique environment. And we can highly configure these type of volume commitment programs for that environment. -- And then if I could just get on the recovery rate, if there's any way to quantify like a if VCA's 80% recovery on weather-related thing that they used to give five years ago when they were public, but if that's still a good way to think about... -- But we don't have benchmarks like that. I'm not sure snowstorm is the best analogy at the moment. This is it's very dynamic region by region. But I think as a theme, we're very encouraged by how quickly we see demand coming back as policies are less restrictive, and we're optimistic about how this will play out over time. -- Thank you.We'll go next to the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Please go ahead. -- Hi, everybody. Thanks for the questions. Lots covered. A lot's been covered, so I'll maybe just ask one kind of attacking something a little bit differently. But as we think about the transition to virtual visits, and obviously, you're still doing a number of in-person. But when we think about installs, you've done a lot of second instruments and things like that as a portion of your growth. When we think about demand for that, obviously, it's a little bit different than sort of a net new competitive placement. But how do we think about exiting when clinics aren't necessarily seeing the same volumes that they were? Does that delay that need or potentially are clinics that are well capitalized sitting there saying, \"Hey, we can get an install-in without really disrupting as busy of a day where we're kind of working at full capacity as it is.\" Any comment there, just kind of on the pace of instrument installations would be great as you come out of this? -- Yes. So let me there's a couple of questions in there. Let me just address the question around or the point you made around second catalyst placements and practices. These tend to go to higher-volume customers. So it's not like we're placing a second catalyst, and it's just it's sitting there. I mean the reason they may want a second catalyst is they're growing their practice, they're growing client visits. It's a highly modular system. So this represents a real volume-driven decision on the part of customers. We think from a recovery standpoint as well as longer-term trends, diagnostics utilization will continue to be robust, both sick patient, preventive care, menu offering our product road map and the different assays we're launching, continue to drive usage, continue to drive utilization, though it's somewhat lower now because of this environment. We think that all the dynamics and all the sort of the value drivers are still intact. So we don't expect the recovery for that to change. -- We have time for one more question. -- Thank you.And that will come from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, thanks. I think I dropped out after the initial one. Just real quick, I want to go back to so my concern, sort of longer-term about the vet dynamic. As we think through this impact, sort of what's forefront of my mind is that vets are going to be economically challenged here and potentially for an extended period of time, both from economic recession and potentially some tail risk here in terms of volumes. So how do you think about vets being a little bit more price-sensitive around their offerings? I mean we know that IDEXX is definitely the premium brand in this space in terms of pricing compared to Heska and Abaxis and the cheaper alternatives. Are you concerned that that's going to be, while diagnostics utilization overall and visits may hold in pretty well due to that economic challenges and some of the pressures on them, they may trade down to some of the cheaper offerings? -- So here's how I would here's how at least we think about it, Mike. Customers have always been concerned with the economics of the solution. I mean that hasn't changed. Price is a component of it, the value that we deliver is the other component of it. And as I indicated, you know we're always testing to make sure that the value and economics line up at from a customer standpoint, what we work to do through our programs is to make sure that based on the environment and based on the circumstances, we provide the appropriate program that allow them to purchase what they think are the best tools and allow them to deliver the best medicine. From that standpoint, nothing's changed in terms of our solutions and what they perceive to be the best solutions for their needs.And as I indicated, we have programs that allow them to get the products, get the service offerings they want and do it in a way that works for them, works from an economic standpoint and matches and aligns the invoices that they collect or charge to the client and what they have to, in turn, pay us. So we're confident that we can continue to meet their needs and do it in a way that's economically sensitive to the environment. And with that, I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call, and I'd like to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance there in these unsettling times. We run the company in a way that both delivers today and takes a long-term view to design to maintain and grow the strategic advantages of our business. I couldn't be more proud of the IDEXX team and the purpose which animates our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. -- Thank you.[Operator Closing Remarks]. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But there were plenty of questions for the animal health company in the first quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those questions have now been answered.Idexx Labs announced its first-quarter results before the market opened on Thursday. The company's business is still booming. Here are the highlights from Idexx's Q1 update.Image source: Getty Images.Idexx reported first-quarter revenue of $626 million, a 9% year-over-year jump. This result also handily beat the average analysts' revenue estimate of $617.4 million.The company announced Q1 net income of $111.9 million, or $1.29 per share, based on generally accepted accounting principles (). Idexx's bottom line improved from the prior-year period, when the company recorded GAAP earnings of $102.7 million, or $1.17 per share. The animal health company's Q1 earnings also topped the consensus analysts' earnings estimate of $1.20 per share.Idexx ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $81.4 million, down from a cash stockpile of $90.3 million as of March 31, 2019.COVID-19 both helped and hurt Idexx Labs in the first quarter. On the positive side, the company's livestock, poultry, and dairy (LPD) business benefited from accelerated customer stock orders due to the pandemic. LPD revenue jumped 12% higher than the total in the prior-year period.It was a similar story for Idexx's water microbiology testing business. Revenue for the unit rose 13% year over year thanks in large part to customers stocking up because of the COVID-19 outbreak.But Idexx's companion animal group, which generates 88% of the company's total revenue, was negatively impacted by the coronavirus. The business reported 8% year-over-year revenue growth, led by diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 10%.However, companion animal group revenue began to slide in the latter part of the first quarter. Even though most states recognized veterinary care as an essential business, veterinary visits fell as customers stayed home and delayed elective procedures and wellness visits for their pets.The next few months hold a lot of uncertainty for many . Idexx Labs is no exception. The company withdrew its previous full-year 2020 guidance due to a lack of visibility on how the COVID-19 pandemic could impact its business. However, there are reasons to be optimistic.Idexx remains strong financially. The company increased its financial flexibility in Q1 by increasing its credit facility to $1 billion and issuing $200 million in notes. It also reduced spending by around $25 million compared to its planned levels through temporary pay cuts for executives and most salaried employees and suspending cash compensation for board members.New COVID-19 diagnostic products could also boost sales. Idexx launched a new COVID-19 test for pets in April in response to both customer demand and increased evidence that pets can be infected by the novel virus that causes COVID-19. The company also awaits FDA emergency use authorization for a human COVID-19 test developed by its human health business, OPTI Medical Systems.Perhaps most importantly, Idexx stated that it has seen \"meaningful improvements\" in its tracking of clinical visit and diagnostic testing trends in mid- to late April. The company said that areas that have begun to allow businesses to reopen and moderate social distancing requirements appear to be driving these improvements.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. This is , I'm Alison Southwick, and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, Personal Finance Expert here at The Motley Fool. I said Brobert before, oh, well. That's alright, people won't remember. Okay, so it's the March mailbag. And with the help of Motley Fool analyst, Jason Moser, we're going to answer all your questions about the current market, what's in JMos bucket, all that kind of good stuff, all that and more on this week's episode of .Well, before we get to the mailbag, why don't we chat a little bit about the week and then I can get your thoughts, does that sound good, Jason and Bro? Sounds like a plan. Alright. Well, the big news this morning, and by the way this morning is Friday, is that the U.S. has surpassed China in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases. I think we are at about 85,000; does that sound about right. We're into 90,000s now. Oh, wow! Okay, so that's my research from this morning, so things are ticking up pretty fast.  estimates that at least a 160 million people nationwide have been ordered to stay home. And when it comes to the stock market, well, it kept ticking up this last week, pinned on the hopes of the stimulus bill. Then news came on Thursday that 3.3 million people had filed for jobless claims, which is roughly about a bajillion percent more than the previous worst week ever of about 695,000 claims. That was back in 1982.So, again, now it's Friday. And I believe the stimulus bill is still plugging along, is that right, Bro? Yes, the House has passed it and the President will sign it. So, by the time you are listening to this episode, it will be law. Alright. And at this exact moment on a Friday, a random Friday afternoon, the market is down about 2%. Is that right, JMo? Yeah, I think 2.3% last we looked. In other news. I'm on day four of my sourdough starter, and it seems to be bubbling along nicely, so there's that. The bad news is that everyone is baking now and you can't buy flour to save your life. So, how are you guys doing, how are you feeling? There's going to be a shortage of eggs too soon. Eggs, why eggs? The same thing, people are baking so much. Oh, and then we're all going to get so chubby. See, I guess I'm lucky, I just don't have that itch to bake. I just don't know, it's not my thing, and so therefore I'm not stuck in the kitchen, eating a bunch of baked goods. So, that's the hot market take from JMo. Stay out of the kitchen. You want to stay fit, just stop baking. Yeah, there you go. So, yeah, Jason, how are you feeling after this week; as an investor, not as a consumer of baked goods? [laughs] I mean as an investor, you know, I'm feeling pretty good about things. I posted a note to our members and the services that I run, the  service and the , and the note was based on this stimulus package that Congress has been debating and now has passed. And I think, I mean, there's always going to be political bickering when it comes to things like this, it's too much money, it's not enough money, to put things in context this $2 trillion package; you know 2019 GDP domestically here was $21.5 trillion, just to give you an idea of how those numbers match up.So, frankly I think that number, that $2 trillion number, is going to go up in time, because I think this is probably a little more of a protracted battle then maybe some think it might be. There's not really a clear finish line. I think we got to get used to the fact that we're going to be dealing with COVID-19 in some way, shape or form in our lives for a while here. So, the health and the economic impacts will be significant and I think they'll last for a while.With that said, it is encouraging to see our government come forward in a bipartisan fashion to get aid to the folks that need it most, to the businesses that need it most. And hopefully, I mean the devil's in the details, hopefully this all does get into the right hands, and I'm sure some of it won't, and we can learn from that and hopefully do better next time. But as an investor, I'm very encouraged that we've seen our representatives in DC finally get together and make something happen. Yeah. Bro, I don't know about you, but when I saw those jobless claims numbers, I was literally speechless. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised, but wow, that was insane. What do you think? Yeah, no, it's incredible, and it's most definitely going to get worse. James Bullard, who's the President of the St. Louis Fed, told  and he said, unemployment could hit 30% over the next couple of months, which reached 10% during the Great Recession and 25% during the Great Depression. So, it'd give you an idea, that's the highest unemployment rate we would have seen perhaps in our nation's history, certainly over the last century. So, it's significant. So, when I see those numbers, I just have huge sympathy and empathy for all of those people, all those businesses that who knows if they'll be able to reopen once we solve this virus problem. So, that's the way I feel.I would certainly encourage everyone to dig into the details of this aid package, because there is a lot of aid for people, there's increased unemployment benefits, a lot of ways to defer payments. People don't have to pay their student loans now, at least, their Federal student loans for a few months. So, there are a lot of ways that the government, as well as bigger corporations are trying to help people. So, if you are in a financial pinch, definitely look at what resources are available to you. Alright. Well, should we head on to the mailbag now? Why not?! Let's do it. Alright. So, let's head to the first question, it comes from Jerry. \"To the Gardner brothers and The Motley Fool analysts ... \" that's you guys \" ... you have convinced me that investing in index funds, either domestically or internationally, is guaranteeing mediocre returns. Two examples from your own newsletter support my case. One, had I invested in just ,  and  over the last 20 years, I would have soundly beaten the S&P 500. Two, going forward, I believe that investing in just one stock, , will significantly outperform any Latin American ETF or Global ex U.S. index fund. If you agree, why does  still stick to promoting index funds? So, anti-.\" Oh, Bro, this one is coming at you. [laughs] Well, so, I would first of all say, that I think, we, at The Motley Fool, just about everyone involved thinks that index funds are a great start for most people. In fact, if you go to our  service, there's a  guide to Fool's success, step No. 4, even includes the line, \"We think index funds should be the foundation of your portfolio.\" So, to the extent that we do recommend index funds, it's generally for people who are newer to investing, and then you can start branching out to individual stocks.I will point out that he also said, you know, \"Had I invested in Amazon, Microsoft and Apple the last 20 years, I would have soundly beaten the S&P 500.\" Yes, if you can pick the stocks beforehand that are going to outperform the S&P 500, that is a great investment strategy. If only. I will point out, by the way, he's right about those three stocks, but for Microsoft, and if you look back 20 years, starting in March of 2000 and invested in Microsoft, for the next 18 years, you were underperforming the S&P 500, it wasn't until April of 2018 that it started to outpace the S&P 500. So, for most of the time, it actually wasn't beating the S&P 500.But the point being, it's very difficult to know beforehand which those stocks are going to be. If you look into our services, and we've looked at this as a company, there's sort of a pareto principle with our return. So, 80% of the returns are provided by 20% of the stocks. I wrote up an article for  a month ago, so this is before the biggest drops that we've seen recently, but even when I looked at it then, almost 30% of 's recommendations have lost money, and almost 12% had been down 50%.So, while I do agree that once you become a more experienced, sophisticated investor, you can move away from index funds, but thinking that you can put your portfolio in a handful of stocks and beat the S&P 500 is pretty risky. Yeah. Alright, let's move on to the next question from anonymous. \"Heard you discuss refinancing with Chris on .\" Jason is this coming directly at you here, it must be? I think so. Yeah, I think so. \"But what typically happens with home prices? Good idea to wait to buy, do you think? Also, you said we should all have 20 to 30 or so stocks in our accounts. What if you have more than one account? I have a personal brokerage account and a separate IRA account, should I shoot for 20 to 30, overall, across both accounts or 20 to 30 in each account. Keep calm and Fool on!\" Yes, very good question. And so, let's tackle the home question first, because there is some interesting data here. Now, certainly with the interest rate environment that we have today, it's absolutely time to at least inquire about refinancing, if you own your home. I'm in the middle of enquiring about that as well, trying to see if I can get to a point where it actually makes sense. And I'm encouraged with what I'm hearing from our lenders. So, definitely look at that, that's an easy way to cut that payment and put a little bit more cash in your pocket at a time when a lot of people could really use it.If you look at the actual behavior out there today, total mortgage application volume fell almost 30% here just last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And purchase applications fell even more dramatically in states hit the hardest by COVID-19 today, so you're looking at New York where it's down 35%; California, where it's down 23%, 17%, in Washington state. So, there is clearly a decline there in that mortgage volume. And we saw companies like  here just recently put on hold their home-buying program, which is a new part of the business they recently introduced where they're actually buying homes and then reselling them. They've put that program on hold right now given the situation. And you know most companies are trying to conserve capital and make sure that they can weather the storm, because we don't know, really, how long it's going to last or how much of an impact, economically speaking, it's going to be.Now, Zillow also recently performed a study here, and I got this from an article that came out recently on our  website, Maury Backman published this. Zillow recently did a study on the impact of previous pandemics on housing markets, interestingly enough, and one thing they found in this study is that home prices largely held steady or declines were very modest, in most cases. And that simply was because during those times there were fewer transactions. So, if people aren't desperate to sell, then they're not going to get out there and sell at a loss, they can weather the storm and just wait until times are a little bit better. And so, they don't feel like they have to sell at a loss. And so, I just thought that was an interesting point to note there as well.I mean, housing, as they always say, it's location, location, location. And so, it does change depending on where you are. And I think that where you are at this point in time, you certainly want to look to see how your area is dealing with this crisis. Clearly, California and New York are two states that are getting hit harder than a lot. But it does seem like in times like these, pandemics in particular, there is data out there that says that housing market can stay fairly resilient because people just, kind of, pull back and wait to weather the storm. Alright. Then the second part of that question was, \"Should I shoot for 20 to 30 overall stocks across all accounts or 20 to 30 in each account?\" So, when you have different brokerage accounts. Yeah, absolutely. I'm in that same boat, I mean I've got a self-directed brokerage account and then I have just a discretionary account. I think you're aiming really, you're looking in the context of your overall portfolio, so all accounts combined. Being well-diversified, 20 to 30 is a great place to start. For some folks, that number is going to be higher. For some folks, that number might be lower; if they're a little bit more confident or if they feel like their risk tolerance is high. But, yeah, I would look at in the context of all of your accounts. Alright. Next question comes from J. \"I am in my lower 20s, and I've always been interested in personal finance investing and saving for the future. Growing up, however, my dad has always lived an extremely high consumption lifestyle. He lives in a home worth well in the excess of $1 million has owned dozens of cars including s, s and Maseratis and wouldn't be surprised if he spends close to $4,000 a month eating out at expensive restaurants. He makes between $500,000 and a $1 million a year, so it seems he is able to maintain this lifestyle. However, with his level of spending, it makes me wonder whether he has built any wealth at all. I've tried starting conversations about finance with him and he never seems interested and doesn't add much to the conversation. I know he'd been previously burned by bad investments and I don't think he really invests anything. Am I right to be concerned about his spending and financial habits and if so, how would you recommend bringing this up with him to make sure he's preparing himself for retirement?\"Alright, Bro, that one's going to you. It is. And it can be tricky because there are just some people who do not want to talk about their finances, especially with their kids. That said, I do think the current crisis actually could be a way to bring up the conversation, and I think it's always good to lead with what you're doing. Talk about, \"Hey, you know, look, things are tough right now. This is happening to my retirement savings, this is what's happened to my portfolio, what's going on with you?\" And you might even frame it as a way for advice. That might cause your dad to be more inclined to open up, if you're saying, like, \"Hey, dad, what do you think I should do? What's going on with you?\"It's also I think important to frame it as concern for him, because many parents, especially wealthier parents will interpret this as, really, \"Why are you spending my inheritance?\" So, you definitely want to frame it that way. That said, there's only so much you can do, so if he's not willing to talk about it, you may just have to let it go. From what you've told me, my guess, he's going to be OK, I mean, he does have a $1 million house that he can do a reverse mortgage on or he can downsize. Given how much he's made, he probably is going to receive the maximum social security benefit, which is about $36,000 a year, maybe $40,000 a year, if he waits till late-70, not a lot compared to what he's making, but it'll prevent him from being penniless. But I think just open up the conversation talking about current events, might be the way to get that conversation going. Alright. Next question comes from Morty. \"I would appreciate Jason explaining what his stock buckets are and which stocks are in each bucket? What is his methodology for picking the stocks, market capitalization, growth, momentum, dividends? Is he going to create a coronavirus bucket?\" [laughs] I'm probably not going to create a coronavirus bucket, that might that would be a tough on the message, I think, we're trying to find that happy medium between recognizing the human toll here and also doing our job and making sure we're looking out for our members and our listeners and helping people secure their financial freedom. But the buckets or baskets, as I like to call them, two baskets that I have I have been maintaining here now for a little while. The first one, and this all started initially with just some discussions that Chris Hill and I were having every quarter it seems, when we would do  and we would look at the returns that some of these payments companies were lobbing out there. And we thought, \"Well, why don't we own shares of these companies?\" And so, it struck me that maybe there would be a payments related basket I could form. So, the war on cash basket was born on July 24, 2017 and that basket consists of , ,  and  all in equal amounts. So, 25% weighting on each position. And the idea is, take the total amount of money that you would want to invest in this sector, split it four ways and invest in these four companies.And to-date, since that date of inception in July 24, 2017, the war on cash basket has returned 81% versus the market's 9.6%. So, clearly that baskets worked out very well even throughout this bear market and COVID-19 crisis. And as you can see, with those four companies there, MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, Square, there wasn't one particular angle as far as philosophy, because you've got two dividend payers and you've got two that don't pay dividends. Two were a bit more stable or bigger, lower-risk in MasterCard and Visa. PayPal kind of that mid-risk. And Square being a little bit more of a risky play. But that was the idea behind the basket was to give yourself a nice risk exposure there; cover all ends of the risk spectrum.And so, after the war on cash basket, it struck me that another very attractive market opportunity is healthcare. And healthcare is another space where we have a lot of different ways we can invest. I had identified some companies that I do like in the space and so I came up with the healthcare and wealth-care basket, that date of inception was February 9, 2018. And to-date the returns of that basket, the basket is up 144.4% versus the market's 2.4%.Now, I will say, one caveat here on that on that number.  is one of the components of this basket and that stock has performed extremely well since February 2018, it's up +400% versus the others, but you've got , , Teladoc Health and . And, yes, IDEXX Laboratories is animal health; we cannot neglect our furry friends particularly in these trying times, they're serving as a point-of-support for a lot of us, as the owner of three dogs it just struck me that every time I went to the vet, IDEXX was getting some of my money, so then why not own some shares of IDEXX and get some of that money back. And thus far, it has all worked out very well.And the basket approach is simply meant to identify big, attractive market opportunities and then invest in those market opportunities, instead of trying to just pick one winner from a space, because oftentimes when you find attractive market opportunities, there are a number of companies that will win and in the case of the war on cash basket and the healthcare basket, thus far all eight components of the combined effort there are performing well, outperforming the market, positive returners. So, that's the general idea, is to give you good risk exposure while being able to invest in exciting market opportunities. Jason, do you think that given Alison's new baking hobby that you need to have a bread basket. [laughs] Hey, oh. I'm not sure which one would be easier to message, Rick, a coronavirus basket or a bread basket. I just got done telling a reporter, I'm like, all people are talking about is getting puppies and baking bread, like, that's what the coronavirus is doing to us here in Northern Virginia. We're drinking, a lot of drinking.Well, beer is just liquid bread, anyway, right. Liquid bread. Exactly. Were long on yeast, apparently. Alright, next question comes from Tom. \"I have 27 years left on a $250,000 mortgage with a current rate of 4%. Should I be paying extra principal or investing the money instead with the goal to pay off the mortgage, won't I have better odds paying it off sooner by investing that money for the long-term?\" Well, as Jason mentioned earlier, folks should be considering refinancing. So, mortgage rates had touched 3.25% a few weeks ago, all-time lows, they're slightly up to 3.5% now. But one rule of thumb about refinancing is that if you can cut your interest rate by 0.5% and you're going to be in the house for several years, it makes sense. You should definitely run your numbers. But the first thing I would look at is refinancing.I certainly think that the farther you are from retirement, generally, it's better to maintain the mortgage and invest the extra money; with the goal of paying off the mortgage before you retire. I've mentioned before that that's what I had been doing, I'm paying extra payments so that my mortgage is paid off before I retire. The reason I like that idea is, imagine you were retired right now and your portfolio has dropped by 33% and you're concerned about how that's going to eat into your retirement income. Your probably No. 1 concern is going to be, can I pay for my healthcare? And then, No. 2, can I pay for my mortgage? Because that's everyone's biggest expense and that's what everyone's biggest fear, losing their house. But if your mortgage is paid off, you don't have to worry about it. That said, my wife and I are actually going to stop those additional payments to the mortgage, because I think stocks are a better value right now. So, I'm actually going to be doing more investing than I had been in the past.So, Tom, in your general situation, unless it's extremely important for you to pay off the mortgage soon, I would rather invest the money. Alright. Next question comes from Caroline. \"I've heard that it is highly unlikely for this virus or any virus to be transmitted on cash, regardless, if enough people believe it can be carried that way, I would imagine it might cause even more people to abandon cash for credit cards and/or digital payments, no? I'm thinking that while the dollar amount value of transactions may decrease in an economic downturn or even for a few months because of the coronavirus, the number of transactions may increase and therefore our war on cash baskets of stocks may at least stay flat in the coming months or year. This question was prompted by my seeing someone in my local Upper West Side neighborhood bodega this morning insisting on being allowed to pay for a purchase of less than $10 using their digital wallet, credit card is not accepted for purchases less than $10, because there is at least one reported case of corona here and using cash is not safe he argued.\" Okay. Well, I will begin this answer by telling you that I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist, although, I do like science a lot and my dad is a doctor, so that doesn't matter either way. [laughs] I have done some research on this, though. And I will say that based on everything I have found that cash, paper money, absolutely can carry the virus and is a higher risk for transmitting that virus versus non-cash transactions. The World Health Organization certainly, they have warned that the virus can be transmitted to customers via bank notes and coins. So, don't think it's just paper money, certainly coins can carry it as well.China, I think, just went through a process of deep cleaning a lot of potentially infected cash to try to limit the spread of the virus. And ultimately, while pathogens and viruses can live on most surfaces for around 48 hours, there is research out there that shows that paper money can reportedly transport a live flu virus for, get this, up to 17 days, so. What? Yeah, I'm just telling you what the data says. Now, I'm not saying that you're going to get sick by using cash; don't get me wrong. I'm not really a big user of cash anymore, anyway. Like, I just find it more convenient not to use it. As with most things in life today, you just have to sort of -- there is some judgment involved and you just have to just be safe, you know. If you don't need to use cash then why use it? And I'm sure that a lot of merchants, a lot of stores out there are trying to navigate what is a tricky environment as well as the example that Caroline just offered. And considering your war-on basket, you're like, you know what, why not use that MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, Square -- MasterCard, and Visa, and PayPal, and Square, yeah, and I mean, you know, it's -- Definitely reach for that Visa says, Jason Moser, Visa shareholder. I think, coronavirus notwithstanding, I mean, the trend is clear, we are moving away from cash transactions and more toward electronic transactions worldwide. Alright. Next question comes from John. \"I know the government allows us to put away money in a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA tax free up to an income level. I believe in 2020, the household AGI has to be less than $206,000. What I'm not sure of is, if your household income is more than $206,000, are you still able to put money into an IRA, just not tax-free, and if so, is it a smart strategy, or is that a bad idea? Since when I take money out, I will end up paying taxes on my $6,000 contribution again?\" Well, I like to think of IRAs as really three types, there's the Roth IRA, whereas, when you put the money in, you don't get a tax break, but it grows tax-free, you take the money out, tax-free as long as you follow all the rules. There's the deductible traditional IRA, whereas, when you put the money in, you get a deduction, it grows tax deferred, but when you take the money out, you then pay taxes. If you make too much money, though, you may not be eligible for either of those, but you can always still contribute to the traditional IRA nondeductible, no deduction, but it still grows tax-deferred and when you take the money out, it's taxed then.So, just to give you some numbers on which ones people are eligible for. So, the Roth, your eligibility starts to fade when you make a $124,000, if you're single. It's completely eliminated when you're at $139,000; if you're married, a $196,000. It starts to be reduced to $206,000; again, if you're married then it's eliminated completely.If you are not covered by a retirement plan at work, any contribution to a traditional IRA is always deductible. So, if you don't have a 401(k) or a 403(b) and you're in a high tax bracket, the traditional IRA might make sense. If you are covered by a plan at work and you make a contribution to a traditional IRA, it may or may not be deductible and that is also subject to income limit. So, if you're single, your ability to deduct starts to go down at income level of $65,000; if you're married it's $104,000 it starts to go down.So, really, the point is, you're always eligible for some type of IRA, it just depends on your income and whether you're covered by a plan at work.One thing that John said was, he's basically asking, \"Should I bother contributing to a nondeductible IRA, if I put in that $6,000, I didn't get a tax break, and then when I take it out, I'm going to have to pay taxes on it again.\"That's actually not true. So, any nondeductible contribution you make to a traditional IRA, you're not going to be taxed on it again, that money will come out tax-free, it's the growth that you'll be taxed on. If you do not have significant amount of assets in traditional IRAs and you're not eligible for the Roth, you can make a contribution to the nondeductible traditional IRA and do what's called a backdoor Roth IRA. You basically do an instant conversion. I don't want to go into too many of the details, google it, you'll find plenty of articles, or even just call your discount broker, they'll know how to handle it.But the bottom-line is, anyone who's working can contribute to an IRA, it just depends on what you're eligible for based on various things. And I think if you're eligible for one and you have the excess money, it's always a good idea to contribute. Alright. Next question comes from Gary. \"What are the best defensive stocks in a volatile market? Best aggressive stocks with risk to buy now?\" So, that's a tough question, just because, there's so many stocks out there and, you know, these are unique times where it doesn't seem like there's necessarily always a correlation. But I do think, in a volatile market if you're looking for stability, something that is not going to go to crazy one way or the other frame your mindset around needs, think about things that people need as potentially ways to invest.And so, I'm thinking of things like utilities and telecom, things like that, they can be a little less susceptible to these heavy market moves, given that their revenue streams are largely uninterrupted, right. I mean, most people aren't cutting off their power, right? You kind of need power. Most people aren't cutting off their cellphone service, so whether that's  or . I mean, if you look at this stretch, Verizon, year-to-date down 12.5%; AT&T down 21.5%, compare that to the greater market, that doesn't really seem like it's so bad. And they also pay really healthy dividend yields that they can afford, again, because they're businesses that are providing services that people really do need.So, I think, if you're looking for stability, think about needs.If you're thinking about more aggressive stocks, I can give you a couple of ideas. One of the things I love to focus on in times like these, when everybody's kind of in the same boat. Look for the market leaders in their respective spaces, because they're the ones that typically emerge from periods of time like this stronger. They're typically the companies that pick up a little bit more market share, even if they just maintain essentially a flat market share, the fact that competitors are typically smaller -- I mean, we're talking about smaller competitors here, but typically you see either bankruptcies or businesses that lose business and revenue declines and whatnot. You look at the market leaders in their respective spaces, they tend to walk away from stretches like this even stronger.A couple of companies that come to mind, examples there, think about something like . Travel right now, I mean, obviously getting hammered for obvious reasons, I mean people aren't traveling, but when things get better, when the dust does settle, Booking.com is still going to have this tremendous network of hotels, the biggest network out there. It's going to still be a great business that does a lot of business in the travel industry. So, that's a good example.And then another one, I think, is . Starbucks is a company that is going to be able to weather the storm financially. You know, they're going to come out on the other end even stronger I think given their history, given what they sell. Chris Hill, I think, put it very eloquently today. He said it's a legally addictive product. And you know, anytime you can sell a legally addictive product, you got to look at that as a potential investment opportunity.And then, I'll just give you a last thing here. Some ideas as far as stocks that I've personally bought myself throughout this stretch here over the past month. Companies that I bought include , which is in the AutoCAD software business. I did open my very own position in Starbucks finally, so that I can be invested in Starbucks alongside my daughter's. And , which is, I think everybody familiar with Adobe the PDF company, but it's so much more. And then also , which is a programmatic advertising.And I really do believe that when the dust settles, those are for companies that will emerge even stronger. Alright. Next question comes from Jeff. \"I was wondering if it makes sense to discontinue my student loan automatic payment plan that provides an interest rate deduction, to begin sending my monthly payments through the Virginia529 plan? I'm thinking, yes, assuming the interest rate deduction provided by the lender for automatic online payment is small compared to the, I believe, 5.75% savings on Virginia taxes using the 529 plan would provide.\" So, Jeff, let's remind the audience what a 529 plan is. When it was originally conceived, you would put the money in, you didn't get a deduction when you put it in, generally, at least on the Federal level, but then the money grew tax-free as long as you used it for qualified higher education expenses. Then a couple years ago they changed the rules so that you could use some of your 529 money for elementary and secondary school expenses. And then just at the end of last year, thanks to The SECURE Act, they now allow people to take out $10,000, lifetime limit, to pay off student loans.So, Jeff is thinking, if I put money in my Virginia529 plan, something that I also participate in, I get a tax deduction. And that's true of about 30 of the 529 plan, every state has one, 30 of the states offer a deduction on the state return, not Federal, the state return if I put the money in. He basically wants to put the money in and then take the money out quickly to pay off his loans.As opposed to what he's currently doing, he's on some sort of automatic payment plan, and most of these lenders as well as all kinds of other banks and lenders, will basically reduce your interest rate a little bit if you sign up for some sort of automatic payment plan.So, my first thing to say is, I think you can do both, you can still stick with the plan, you can put money in the 529 and then take it out, because the money you take out of the 529, doesn't have to go directly to the loan, you can take it out and take it yourself and then write the check, just have it sit in your bank account. And at the end of the year, you'll get a 1099-Q indicating that you took a deduction.I think we discussed in a previous episode, it's actually rather surprising at how little anyone follows up on whether you actually use the money for qualified higher education expenses or not.I did call the Virginia529 plan today just to say, like, \"Is there any limit on how long I have to leave the money in there?\" And the person I spoke with said, \"No,\" so. But you might want to check, everyone has their own plans, every plan has their own rules, so you might want to pay attention to that.Also, for states that do offer this deduction, they often have what they call, recapture rules. And Virginia has one and many states have this. So, for example, if you donate to the Virginia529, get the tax deduction but then transfer that 529 to another state, it might basically want you to pay back the money you got for taking the deduction.Some states do this if you use the money for K-12 expenses. The interesting thing here is, using money for student loans, it's so new that states don't have any rules about this yet. I even looked through the 60-page document for Virginia's 529 to see how they treat distributions for school loans, and there's a big disclaimer on the frontpage saying, \"We know that there's no rules, but we haven't codified them yet, so stay tuned.\" So, I would just follow-up on that to make sure that there's not going to be any sort of tax deduction recapture if you use the money to pay off your school loan. Alright. Next question comes from Jerry. \"Would you help me understand what investment managers mean when they recommend investing internationally? There are several reasons the term \"international\" seems confusing. First, if a company incorporates in a nation outside the U.S., is that sufficient grounds to call it an international stock? Does that make an American depositary receipts on the NYSE an international investment? Do managers believe opening a special brokerage account that permits trading on a non-U.S. exchanges is a must?\"\"Second, if a stock is only traded on an exchange outside the U.S., not ADRs, is that sufficient to call it an international stock? What if the company makes the majority of its sales from clients in the U.S.? Finally, what if the top ten large cap American multinationals incorporated in the U.S. and traded on U.S. exchanges received the majority of their revenues from clients outside the USA, does that make them international stocks? For example, Microsoft makes more than 50% of its sales outside the U.S.\"\"Bottom-line it seems that the  provides plenty of global diversification without the word \"international\" entering into the calculation.\" Excellent question, and I will begin with Jerry's takeaway there, the bottom-line. I agree with you that, yes, I think that the Vanguard Total Market Index provides plenty of global diversification without the word \"international\" entering in the calculation, primarily because so much money is made outside of the United States and other international locations.So, defining international investing has certainly changed throughout the years and as the world gets smaller, thanks to technology, we're all more and more connected. And so, I think international investing is very much just wanting to make sure that you get exposure to the global economy, however you do that, it is a bit of a squishy definition. I think that I personally look at it today as most big companies out there are international in nature, because they make their money all over the world. It didn't always used to be that way, but it certainly is more the norm now, and that's how I view international investing.I think the Microsoft example is a really good one. I think Microsoft can certainly be viewed as an international investment based on the revenue it generates and the locations it generates it. Starbucks, Apple, , I mean the examples just go on and on. I think international investing today is much easier than ever before, because we've got companies that are making their money in so many different places. Alright. Next question comes from Sam. \"If I sell a stock in my Roth IRA for a profit, are there any issues with rebuying the same stock immediately in my taxable brokerage account? I'd like to lock-in gains in the Roth to free up cash and move a non-dividend paying stock to my other account.\" The quick answer is, no, there are no tax consequences to selling anything in your Roth. You don't have to pay capital gains and you can't take a capital loss. So, you go ahead and sell that stock and then you can rebuy it on the outside. And it sounds like what you're doing is asset location, and that is, putting the right investments in the right accounts for maximum tax efficiency and it sounds smart. If you have a dividend-paying stock and you're not yet retired, it's better to keep it in the IRA, use your taxable brokerage account for stocks that don't pay dividends. Alright. Next question comes from Vasu. \"Following your advice, in an effort to be able to buy stocks on a discount in the situation like we are experiencing right now because of the coronavirus, each month I put aside a portion of my savings, about 5% to 7%, in a high-yield account to invest in a downturn. My question is, do you have any rules of thumb or strategies for when and how to invest in such a situation? Right now, I have about $7,000 saved up compared to my monthly contribution to my retirement account of $4,500. I primarily invest in a mix of U.S. and international index funds for my retirement savings. Retirement for me is 37 years away. So, when and how do you think I should invest the $7,000?\" So, my primary rule-of-thumb, and I've learned this from the Great Recession ten years ago, take it slow. No matter what, first-and-foremost, just take it slow. You're not in a race to try to get all of this money invested at once, because as we've seen, the market has moved a lot one way or the other for the last month here, so the opportunities are certainly there.From there, I think you take the money that you have, a good idea -- and Ron Gross turned me on this idea a while back, is take that money, split it up into four or five tranches, you know, divide that out and say, \"Okay, I've got four or five tranches of a $1,000 each and I'm going to put those to work on my given opportunistic timeframes, whether that's every week or when the market falls a certain percentage, whether it's 2%, 3% or 4%, you can determine that line for yourself.But I think taking it slow and dividing that money out into tranches that you can get to work in there will help you do that. Alright. Next question comes from Matt. \"I have very little debt and a six-month emergency fund in place. My wife and I are 30 and make good income, but should still get the full $1,200 per adult and $500 per child in the new stimulus plan. Can I take the $3,400 my family will get and invest it in my traditional IRA or my children's 529 plans and claim that as a deduction?\" The answer is, yes. So, from what I have read, the money that's coming from the stimulus plan will be automatically deposited into your bank account that was listed on your 2019 or 2018 tax returns. So, that money will just magically appear in your bank account and there's no rules against then using that money to put in a 529 or an IRA, the only limits for an IRA is it's $6,000 per year, another $1,000, if you're 50 or older, as long as you make that much money. So, as long as you're working, you can do that 529 there's really virtually no limit. So, go ahead and do that and you can still take the deduction for the 529 if your state offers that or for the traditional, if you meet the limits that I mentioned earlier in the show. Alright. Next question comes from Mary. \"Why in the world is the stock market tanking on Monday and then up on Tuesday and then tanking again on Wednesday? There really has been no news, the virus has continued to spread globally and we won't have a vaccine for another 12 to 18 months. I know that a lot of this trading is done algorithmically, but there are still humans providing price inputs. I'm so confused.\" Well, there are humans providing price inputs, but the word that was mentioned their \"algorithms,\" that really is a big part of what's going on here right now. We are seeing a resurgence in high frequency trading and , which is a publicly traded company out there, one of the largest high-speed trading firms out there actually said, that it expects to post trading income of around $515 million here in the first quarter, which is more than double the amount from the same period last year. And then Thomas Peterffy, who is the Founder [sic] of , noted that they have seen, I think, double the trading volume in this time compared with last year as well.So, certainly high-speed trading is a big part of it. I think it's also worth noting that there are folks that short stocks, obviously, as they go down. When we see shorting at some point, they start covering and that can sometimes cause a little bit of a squeeze which sends the markets back up. So, it's not one particular answer, it certainly is a combination of a lot of things, but we're definitely seeing a resurgence in high-frequency trading these days. Next question comes from Charlie. \"I'm a 20-year-old college student who has had the privilege of investing since I was 14.\" Oh, that's awesome. \"When it comes time to finance a house or car, would it be wise not to touch my investments and to let them run. I have a Roth IRA and two taxable investment accounts, one taxable account holds a small mix of ETFs and some index funds, while the other has 40 individual stock picks. Upon graduating, my plan is to gradually build up my emergency savings while still contributing to my investments. Is it unheard of, given my age, to be practically all-in with equities and use these investment vehicles to save for a down payment and other life goals?\" I personally don't think it's unheard of to use those types of investments to achieve life goals. I mean, I certainly have invested in individual stocks and sold those positions in order to make, actually, a down payment on a house as well. And so, I think that that is definitely one way to look at it. And I like, particularly when you're talking about a house, to me, that is essentially taking money from one investment and you're allocating that money to another investment where the opportunity for you is a little bit better. And in this case, if you're putting a down payment on a house, I mean, yeah, you know, you're investing that money into something that's going to put a roof over your head for the next however many years you plan to stay in that house. So, it's another investment. It's just always worth remembering the tax implications that are involved whenever you do something like that. So, just keep that in mind whenever you do plan to liquidate and allocate that money to another form of investment. Alright. The last question is for Jason. \"What is he most excited for on his future visit to Clemson University.\" Derek wants to know. \"Jason, are you going to Clemson.\" Yeah, I was so bummed, man. Derek is a guy on Twitter that he and I have talked back-and-forth about investing and stuff. And I was going to go down to speak with some folks at Clemson, some investors, some students and just talk a little bit about what we do, what I do, and you know, just talk stocks and stuff. But it's a postponement, it's not a cancellation, so I am looking forward to getting back down there. I went to college just an hour or so away from Clemson a while for college. So, for me, it's always nice to get back to South Carolina just because that's where I grew up.I've got a cousin down there, Austin, she's still down at South Carolina and I don't get to see her very often and I was really excited to get back down there and catch up with her. But again, a postponement, not a cancellation. So, Austin, I'll be down there eventually and we'll go grab some dinner. Alright. My sister went to Clemson. And back in the day it had a strong agriculture program and they had all their own homemade ice cream and it was crazy cheap and it was outstanding. [laughs] I mean, they still have very strong agricultural program there. Clemson is a big school, a good school. I got a lot of friends that have graduated there through the years and so I'm just excited to get back down there and see it.[...] Alright. Well, that covers it for our mailbag, but we can also head to the other mailbag. Okay, I don't know what's going on with the postcards, because again, we're taping this remotely from each of our houses and so there may be a stack of postcards from our listeners waiting at the office, but what I was able to do though is go to iTunes and see all the people who've left reviews for us lately.So, other than MFFan saying that the host voice is painful, I want to thank Claire in Knoxville, Rebel, Smith, Drew, Jake, What2What, Finn, Dave, Matt, King Hoser, Bunch of Liars, and then a P with a couple of asterisks and an L -- I don't know, people pick hard to pronounce names on iTunes, but that's OK, I want to thank all of you for the reviews, it helps bump us up in the rankings which helps us attract new listeners and that's a good thing, especially now.So, before we go though, as we've been doing during these troubling times, we've been closing by sharing our one recommendation for the week for our listeners to do or read or whatever to kind of take their mind off of the sadness that surrounds us. [laughs] That makes it sound so dark and sad at our house, I promise you, I'm OK. So, who wants to go first this week with their recommendation? I'll go, just because I don't have a particular good recommendation, because I was so busy all week, so I'm more eager to hear other people's recommendations. However, I did stumble upon the  account of Patrick Stewart @SirPatStew. And every day he's reading a sonnet with his outstanding English accent. So, highly recommend that. Good stuff, Bro, good stuff. Yes, so I just got done watching on HBO that limited series The Outsider, it was based on a Stephen King book. And so actually read the book a year, year-and-a-half or whatever. Really liked the book. I got to say, the series did the book justice. So, read the book or watch the series. Either way, I think it is super-entertaining, if you have any Stephen King inclinations whatsoever. Alright, Rick, how about you? You pointed out that I keep picking music things and that's my brand here, but I'm also a photographer. And so, I'm going to recommends some fun with your iPhone or whatever camera you have around the house. And that is to do some, either backyard or indoor photography. So, I'm going to rifle through a couple of tips, things you might not think to do because you're just pointing at your kids or whatever. One is perspective angle, try shooting from on your knees or from lying on the floor, try different angles, see what you can find.Light, instead of looking at the subject of what you're looking at, look at the way the light is spread across the floor or across the wall or whatever; cool things come out of that. Look for lines and shapes. Look instead of just a tree, look at the bark on the tree or look at the books on your shelf, you know, what kind of patterns are they making; look for that.Macro, get up close. Take close-up pictures, as close as your camera will focus. Bad weather. Bad weather makes good photos. It's the perfect time to do portraits of your pets and family. Try different locations around the house, either inside or outside. All of these things can feed your Instagram account and all of your socials. Have some fun with your camera, try some different things, do some things you wouldn't normally do, have fun. And you can send those pictures to us by email instead of postcards in the interim, so. Oh, there you go. Well, we have so much luck when we ask people to send us anything that's not a postcard. Bro, how many emails did we get with people giving us their moneysaving piece of advice? Not many. [laughs] As many as we got sending us our holiday traditions. That's OK. [laughs] I think we got a few holiday traditions, actually, but -- Did we?Yeah. Okay. Alright. Well, my recommendation is an artist and a writer named Charlie Mackesy. Do you guys know this guy? Nope. Okay. So, you can follow him on Instagram. He also has a recent book out called . And the book is just a lovely series of illustrations and conversations between a boy, a mole, a fox and a horse. And they're all about acceptance and love and every drawing is just like a great big hug, as we all socially distance here.So, again, you can follow him on Instagram @charliemackesy, and the book is, . Highly recommended if you need a hug.Alright. Well, that's the show, but I should probably say a disclaimer, huh, because we did talk stocks, so.As always, The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against the stocks we talked about today, don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you heard here.Jason, thank you so much for joining us this week. We really appreciate it. Thank you for having me; it's always a pleasure. Yeah, well, we made it work. We're trying to make it work doing it all remotely. So, I hope our listeners aren't suffering too much as we kind of blunder through this.Alright, the show is edited socially by Rick Engdahl, I don't know, usually Rick helps me come up with what my adverb is. Socially distantly. [laughs] [laughs] Socially distantly by Rick Engdahl, our email is Answers@Fool.com. Again, send us those pictures and Christmas traditions and moneysaving tips.

As one of the top providers of animal healthcare diagnostics and veterinary equipment, the company has witnessed a strong 2019. Shares of IDEXX rose by about 40% in 2019, and many expect that this trend will continue going forward.Will 2020 also be a good year for IDEXX Laboratories? Here are a few reasons why it might.Image source: Getty Images.While some investors might overlook animal healthcare in favor of a more exciting niche, there's a strong case to be made for this sector. In America, pet ownership continues to grow, with about 67% of all American households -- or roughly 85 million families -- owning pets. That's a pretty big rise from the mere 56% reported back in 1988.Not only is pet ownership increasing, but people are becoming all the more attached to their furry companions. About 95% of all pet owners consider their animal friends to be close members of their family, a figure that's also grown from the 88% who said the same back in 2007.When we further break down the data into age groups, it's clear that younger generations are leading the way in pet ownership. According to IDEXX, 45% of all dog owners in the U.S. are millennials (people born between 1981-1996) or \"Gen Z\" (people born after 1997). This percentage is expected to increase to 58% by 2025.All these things put together paint a picture of a very healthy, growing market. For the companies operating in this space, the future looks increasingly bright.IDEXX Laboratories technically has three main business segments. First is its companion animal group, second is water, and third is its livestock, poultry, and dairy segment. However, companion animal group sales represent the lion's share of IDEXX's revenue, and they're what the company's best known for.Products in this segment in-house analyzers (which include blood and urine tests) and laboratory reference services (which include pancreatic, cardiac, kidney, and parasite tests and screening). IDEXX also sells point-of-care testing devices (SNAP devices), which are designed to immediately test for a variety of conditions, including various viruses and parasites.The company's in-house analyzers, as well as SNAP testing devices, are one-time purchases for their customers, which are primarily veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. In contrast, IDEXX's laboratory services provide a source of ongoing revenue. At the same time, IDEXX also offers consumables needed for in-house analyzers, so there's a recurring revenue component to the company's sales as well.IDEXX has been doing well for itself financially, reporting respectable revenue growth over the past several years. Between 2015 and 2019, the company managed to report a strong 12% compounded annual growth rate, a figure that's been fairly consistent over the past 18 years.In IDEXX's fiscal Q4 2019 results (which were released Jan. 31), the company reported decent results for the most part. Fourth-quarter revenue had grown to $605.4 million, up 10% in comparison with last year, driven almost entirely by the companion animal segment. Net income for the quarter was $90.5 million, a 5.6% increase in comparison to last year's $85.7 million.The company's cash position still sits at a reasonable $90.3 million, though this is a decrease from the $123.8 million in cash and cash equivalents reported in Q4 2018. However, it's not a big reason to worry, because IDEXX is a profitable company -- unlike other biotech stocks, which need to rely on their cash to shore up their short-term losses.Data Source: YCharts, IDEXX LaboratoriesWhen looking at IDEXX, it's hard not to compare it with another rival giant in the animal .  is about three times as large as IDEXX, with a market cap of $58 billion in comparison with IDEXX's $21 billion. Despite this, both companies seem to be priced relatively similarly, although Zoetis is a bit cheaper. The price-to-equity (P/E) ratios for Zoetis and IDEXX are about 45.3 and 50.3, respectively.\u00a0Zoetis also differs from IDEXX in that its revenue sources are more balanced. Unlike IDEXX, where approximately 88% of its revenue comes from its companion animal business,  is almost perfectly split between its livestock and its companion animal businesses. Total revenue growth, however, is a bit slower than IDEXX's, coming in at just a 7% increase from Q4 2018.It's hard to say whether IDEXX is a superior investment to Zoetis. While the former is more heavily focused on the companion animal market with a faster growth rate, the latter trades at a slightly cheaper valuation with more diversified revenue, although growth is slower.If you're looking for a business with strong, consistently growing revenue in a defensive market that's resilient to economic downturns, IDEXX is a stock worth looking at. The animal healthcare market by itself is very appealing, and when coupled with IDEXX's strong financial track record, there's a compelling argument to be made in favor of this company.While it's debatable whether or not IDEXX is the top stock pick in the animal healthcare market, what is clear is that this is a very healthy company with an excellent long-term outlook.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Edge by Ascential, a market research firm, says that North American spending on pets hit $225 billion in 2018, and is expected to hit $281 billion by 2023 - roughly 5% compound annual growth. Millennials and Gen-Zers are embracing pet ownership in far greater numbers than previous generations; roughly two-thirds of U.S. households own a pet, up from 56% just 30 years ago.Rising demand is fueling a diverse set of pet stocks - companies that provide everything from premium kibble to medications to even pet DNA testing and health insurance.You can get some pet-related exposure among blue chips such as General Mills (), which acquired all-natural pet-food leader Blue Buffalo for $8 billion in 2018. Aon () boasts a top-rated pet insurance business in the form of subsidiary Healthy Paws; Synchrony Financial () bought a principal rival, Pet's Best, in 2019. However, pet care remains a small portion of their overall business.Here, we look at nine of the best pure-play pet stocks to buy right now. This is a mix of high-growth newcomers and a few more established plays. We'll start with a couple of well-known blue chips before making our way to some under-the-radar names.Market value: $65.7 billionDividend yield: 0.6%Zoetis (, $137.89) - by far the largest of the pure-play pet stocks - develops, manufactures and commercializes a wide range of veterinary medicines, vaccines and diagnostic tools sold in more than 100 countries. It has been a leader in animal health for more than 65 years, mostly as part of Pfizer (); however, the drugmaker spun the company off in 2013.While pet spending is spread across hundreds of companies, Zoetis makes up a big chunk of that. It generated $5.8 billion in revenues in 2018, and it has racked up $6.2 billion in sales over the past 12 months.Zoetis is focused on expanding its diagnostic products footprint in the U.S. Veterinary diagnostics is a $4 billion  estimated to be growing 10% annually; ZTS expects demand to grow faster than the overall animal health market, targeting annual mid- to high-single-digit growth.To that end, the company acquired veterinary lab services supplier ZNLabs, and its nationwide network of labs, in November 2019. Zoetis also made a significant deal in 2018, buying Abaxis - a leader in veterinary point-of-sale diagnostic instruments and consumables. CEO Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix cited the latter, as well as parasiticide and dermatology products, for the company's strong operational results in the quarter ended September.ZTS shares have a Buy rating from 14 of the 21 analysts following the stock; none of the remainder have it below Hold. Credit Suisse's Erin Wilson Wright (Outperform, equivalent of Buy) calls Zoetis a top pick, and wrote in October that \"We are raising our TP to $138 (from $130) on greater conviction in its (long-term) growth prospects with emerging trends from our latest survey.\"Speaking of long term: Zoetis is among the few  on this list, and it has been a serial dividend raiser since its 2013 IPO. The payout has exploded by 141% over the past half-decade, including a 22% upgrade for its 2020 dividend.Market value: $23.5 billionDividend yield: N/AIdexx Laboratories (, $274.40) is the global leader in pet diagnostics and veterinary practice software. The company offers in-clinic diagnostic test kits used by veterinarians to measure blood and enzyme levels, as well as medical instruments and related consumables. Idexx generated $2.4 billion in revenues in 2019 by serving customers in 175 countries; roughly 40% of its sales are made outside of the U.S.Idexx hasn't missed a quarterly earnings estimate in years, and its annual income growth has clocked in at nearly 20% over the past half-decade. The company's most recent report, for Q4 and full-year 2019, included 10% year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter, fueled by recurring revenues from its Companion Animal Group, as well as improvements in Water and Livestock, and Poultry and Dairy. While the company maintained its 2020 revenue outlook, it upgraded its earnings-per-share guidance to $5.42 to $5.58 per share - an improvement of about 2% at the midpoint.Idexx is under new management, which sometimes can be a concern. President and CEO Jay Mazelsky replaced longtime chief Jonathan Ayers, who was paralyzed in a bicycle accident, on an interim basis in June, then was fully appointed in October. However, William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels (Outperform) writes that he's confident in Mazelsky and urges shareholders to buy on any dips, given a healthy end-market and strong recurring sales.Indeed, in addition to putting IDXX among the best pet stocks to buy right now, it also ranks among the .Market value: $12.6 billionDividend yield: N/AElanco Animal Health (, $31.63), like Zoetis, is the result of a major pharmaceutical company spinning off its pet-care operations. In Elanco's case, the company was broken off Eli Lilly () in late 2018.Since then, the company has pursued growth via . Elanco paid $234 million for pet medicine developer Aratana Therapeutics in July 2019, acquiring veterinary drugs for appetite stimulation, osteoarthritis pain and long-lasting post-surgical pain relief. Then in August, Elanco announced a $7.6 billion cash-and-stock deal to purchase Bayer's () animal health business. The pairing, which will make Elanco the world's second largest animal-health company by revenues (behind Zoetis), is expected to close in mid-2020.The acquisition will double the size of Elanco's companion animal business and provide a foothold in new segments of the parasiticides market, with topical treatments and collars. It also strengthens Elanco's access to pet e-commerce channels. Other benefits include margin gains, accretion to profits as early as year one, and the potential to realize $275 million to $300 million in operating synergies.Elanco hasn't done much since coming public, with shares off 12% since the company's first day of trading in 2018. Bank of America's Michael Ryskin acknowledges that the \"2020 itself is likely to be a challenging year for Elanco,\" he upgraded the stock to Buy in December, writing \"we think this year will mark 'the bottom,' and we see significant upside as revenue growth and EBITDA growth reaccelerates, bolstered by the contribution from Bayer Animal Health.\"Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger upgraded the company from Equal Weight (equivalent of Hold) to Overweight (equivalent of Buy) in November and raised his price target from $32 per share to $34, citing positives related to the Bayer transaction, prospects for margin enhancement and long-term pipeline potential. Then in late January, he nudged his target even higher, to $35.Market value: $10.7 billionDividend yield: N/AFull disclosure: Like Elanco, Chewy (, $26.90) - one of the youngest publicly traded pet stocks - could have a difficult 2020 ahead of it. In fact, we've detailed Chewy's headwinds in a recent look at .However, some analysts see a longer-term bull case for investors willing to ride it out.Chewy and Amazon.com () combine to dominate the online market for pet supplies, accounting for $9 of every $10 spent. Each holds a roughly 45% share of the e-commerce pet food market. CHWY is differentiated by its singular focus on pet supplies, in-house brands and growing pet pharmacy business.That dominance likely fueled the hype behind Chewy's early move; CHWY shares jumped nearly 60% in their first day of trading after the company's June 2019 IPO. Since then, however, shares have surrendered roughly a quarter of their value - with many concerned about the company's lack of profitability, not to mention the threat of Amazon tipping the scales.Analysts have nonetheless started tilting their opinions in Chewy's favor, albeit some with a longer time horizon than others. Wedbush's Seth Basham upgraded the stock to Outperform in late January, citing potential growth of online sales penetration to 25% by 2023. Morgan Stanley's Lauren Cassel (Overweight) also likes the secular growth story and writes that Chewy's revenues could double by 2024.Market value: $2.4 billionDividend yield: N/APet food purveyor Freshpet (, $65.93) helped pioneer the concept of fresh refrigerated pet foods, which it claims are healthier than dry or canned foods. Customers seem to agree, as evidenced by the company's steadily increasing household penetration rate and repeat sales, which make up a whopping 70% of revenues.Freshpet has created a competitive moat via its proprietary manufacturing processes and formulas; retail partnerships with Walmart (), Kroger (), Whole Foods and Petco; and by controlling the only refrigerated pet food supply chain in North America. The company even enhances brand loyalty with its branded refrigerated cases, installed in partner stores.Freshpet has grown its revenues by a red-hot 25% annually over the past five years. They're still pacing that way, with sales up 27% year-over-year during the first nine months of 2019; adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) jumped 44%. The company still has failed to generate an annual net profit, but  if they're headed in that direction, which Freshpet appears to be.Q3 marked the company's eighth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus sales growth; Freshpet also reported positive earnings per share that exceed analyst estimates. FRPT's growth strategy focuses on expanding its consumer franchise and retail presence; building more efficient capacity; and strengthening margins via new products and better pricing.D.A. Davidson analyst Brian Holland initiated coverage of FRPT shares back in June with a Buy rating, calling it a \"disruptor\" in the $30 billion pet food industry and a great pick among . Interestingly, while showing faith in the company's long-term potential, saying it has \"considerable runway\" and could hit $500 million in annual revenues by 2023, he also thinks shareholder value could be found in a buyout, writing that he thinks FRPT will \"ultimately get acquired.\"Holland reiterated his optimism in December, calling Freshpet \"the most compelling growth story in Staples today.\"Market value: $1.2 billionDividend yield: N/ATrupanion (, $33.81) is America's second largest provider of pet insurance and the only pure play in this space.Demand for pet health insurance is rising due to steadily increasing costs for routine veterinary care. The average pet owner spends $257 annually on vet care for dogs; it's $182 for cats. Pet insurance premiums rose 23% last year, and the number of insured pets rose about 16% to 1.83 million, according to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association.Despite this robust expansion, only about 1% of American pets are insured currently. Insurers expect that number to rise to levels comparable to the U.K., where 25% of pets are insured. At a 25% penetration rate, Trupanion estimates its addressable market opportunity at $32.7 billion. For comparison's sake, the company brought in $361 million in revenues over the past four quarters.The company's growth is fueled by its 120-member direct sales force, which calls on 20,000 to 28,000 veterinary hospitals each year. Veterinary hospitals represent 75% of Trupanion's referral sources.Trupanion benefits from a nearly 99% customer retention rate and a monthly subscription model that provides high recurring revenues. It's also among the best pet stocks as far as sales growth goes, at more than 29% annually over the past five years. TRUP still is losing money, though analysts think the company will report positive adjusted net income in 2020.The stock clearly faces some issues. Stifel's Jonathan Block downgraded Trupanion's shares to Hold in early January, citing a quick fourth-quarter run-up in valuation and potential for more competition.  In all, six analysts have Buy-equivalent ratings on the stock, according to the Wall Street Journal, versus just one Hold.Market value: $880.1 millionDividend yield: N/APetIQ (, $31.13) supplies veterinary-grade pet products and veterinary services to consumers. Its branded medications are offered via 60,000 retail and e-commerce sites and manufactured at its own facility.In addition, through its VIP Petcare business, PetIQ provides veterinary services at 3,400 retail partner locations. Retail partners include Walmart, Target (), Tractor Supply (), Pet Supplies Plus and others. The company also is opening clinics within some of these locations; it was on track to open 114 in 2019, and PetIQ plans on growing this network to 1,000 wellness centers nationwide by 2023.The July 2019 acquisition of Perrigo Animal Health gave PetIQ a portfolio of leading over-the-counter pet-care products under the PetArmor, Sentry and Sergeant's brands. The combined business generated $605 million of pro-forma 2018 sales.PetIQ's revenues have more than tripled since 2014, though its profitability has been much more unpredictable. Nonetheless, analysts are looking for a 55% jump in adjusted profits for full-year 2019, and a 13% improvement in 2020.PETQ shares boast Buy ratings from all five of the covering analysts tracked by WSJ. Raymond James' Joseph Altobello (Outperform) cited a pet-owner survey in which 60% of respondents said they either already take their pets to a wellness center or are open to the idea. \"The above pet owner survey results appear to support our bullish thesis on PETQ,\" he writes, adding, \"Overall, we remain confident in PETQ's healthy growth and improving margin profile, bolstered by both the expansion into services as well as the recent acquisition of Perrigo's Animal Health business, with should lead to meaningful multiple expansion over time.\"Market value: $787.4 millionDividend yield: N/AHeska (, $100.58) sells veterinary diagnostic and specialty health-care products. Its larger business, the Core Companion Animal Health (CCA) segment, accounts for 85% of company sales. CCA sells lab testing tools and consumables, primarily under a unique multiyear \"Reset Subscription\" model; allergy and immunotherapy testing; and single-use products such as in-clinic diagnostics and heartworm prevention treatments.Heska's growth hasn't been as explosive as some of the previously mentioned pet stocks, at about 10% annually over the past half-decade, and things have been slower more recently. Through the first nine months of 2019, HSKA recorded a 5% year-over-year improvement in sales. However, the company has been soundly, if variably, profitable for years. It did report a net loss during the quarter ended Sept. 30, but that was impacted by a one-time charge related to cyber theft and still was considerably better than the prior-year's loss.New test product launches, geographic expansion into France and Australia, and renewal of a long-term contract with a major corporate client (PetVet Care Centers) are all potential sparks for future growth. Indeed, the company raised $86.3 million last year through a convertible note offering that will be used to fund future growth initiatives. Heska also is trying to grow via acquisition, buying CVM Companies - the leading provider of pet imaging and blood testing products in Spain - in January.Analysts have calmed on the stock after a nearly 40% run over the past six months. That includes Raymond James' John Ransom, who downgraded the stock to Market Perform (equivalent of Hold) citing valuation concerns because of the run-up. He's still positive on the overall business, however, and says the mid-2020 launch of Element UF, the company's highly anticipated urine and fecal analyzer, could be a catalyst for the HSKA shares.Meanwhile, Canaccord's Mark Massaro (Buy) raised his price target from $75 per share to $105 in November after its third-quarter earnings report, but did note the company might be too optimistic about its margins, given the heavy investments it's making in its business.Market value: $523.7 millionDividend yield: 4.2%PetMed Express (, $25.97) markets pet medications and other health supplies direct to consumers via the Internet, which represents more than 80% of the company's sales. Unlike other pet supply companies, however, PetMed Express is no recent startup; the company was founded in 1996 and also is known by 1-800-PetMeds. Moreover, it has been generating positive cash flow and paying dividends for roughly a decade.PETS has been among the most lively pet stocks on the market over the past few years. Shares surged from below $20 in 2017 to around the $53 level in early 2018, then dropped into the mid-teens as recently as August 2019. Shares have whipped back since then, up 67% over the past three months.That volatility has come amid fairly stable growth. Revenues are up 5% annually on a compound basis over the past five years, while profits have climbed by 16% annually. Moreover, sales and net income have increased every year since 2016. PetMed Express's most recent earnings report, released in January, showed a small slip in quarterly sales and a 12% drop in net income. Price competition from newer players and rising customer acquisition costs have cut into results in recent quarters.PetMed Express plans to improve its fortunes with a new customer loyalty program that will strengthen sales and reorder rates, as well as minimum advertised price commitments from major manufacturers, which should bolster margins. The company's $92 million in net cash provides plenty of operating flexibility.PETS stock is thinly covered, but it has two Buys, two Holds and one Sell among the five analysts on the job. Most recently, Anthony Lebiedzinski, from boutique analyst firm Sidoti, reiterated a Buy rating and $29 price target, calling Wall Street expectations \"too low.\" He believes the company's profits will recover during the current quarter for the fiscal year ended February 2020, and that EPS will grow 30% in fiscal 2021.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The iShares Global Healthcare ETF is seeing unusually high volume in afternoon trading Wednesday, with over 359,000 shares traded versus three month average volume of about 98,000.

To get started investing, check out our\u00a0. A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the\u00a0 for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. It's Thursday, and we're going to be diving into some dividend stocks to consider buying during the coronavirus market disruption. Joining me to break it all down is Motley Fool contributor Matt DiLallo. Matt, how's it going? It's going as well as can be expected in these times. Yeah, it's been a wild couple of months in the stock market, crazy volatility, when a lot of the stats you can compare to are 1929-1930, you can tell a craziness is going on, how have you been personally investing during this time? You know, I really got back some cash, it's just kind of how I invest and so I've been dabbling putting some of that to work, focusing mostly on companies that I know can survive, like, your big, big cap stocks, things that pay good dividends, have strong balance sheets and that are just, you know, 20%, 30% cheaper than before. Absolutely. And we're going to talk about some of those dividend stocks later on the show. We do have a couple of news items that we have to dive into. The first one came, really, right before we started recording, so it's about 10:45 eastern time this morning, 15 minutes ago maybe, President Trump tweeted about what could potentially be some significant cuts coming out of Saudi Arabia and Russia.The tweet said, \"Just spoke to my friend MBS, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, and I expect and hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 million barrels and maybe substantially more, which if it happens will be GREAT for the oil and gas industry.\" When you see this cut, obviously, we'll have to see what the Saudis and Russians actually do? But 10 million barrels a day is a significant cut, Matt.Yeah, that's significant. So, the oil industry pumps about a 100 million barrels a day, so you're taking out that much; however, they think demand is going to drop 20%, so this is really just a drop in the bucket, because demand has been falling for weeks now, so there's got to be more cuts coming, there's just nowhere to put all this oil, so they have to do this because there's nowhere for the oil to go. But it's still not enough, so America is going to have to do something.And it'll be interesting to see what our response will be, because they're not doing this for free, you know, they did this initially to hurt our oil industry, but it's really backfired because the coronavirus outbreak has turned out to be much worse than people expected. Yes, we keep saying that double one-two punch of coronavirus, plus this massive surge-up in supply. What could possibly be on the table here, because we have talked about, part of this move has been to potentially break U.S. shale and force up the price of oil across the board, when they can boost production back up. What do you think could possibly be concessions from the U.S. to get these cuts to happen? Well, I think, initially what Russia was saying is that, the United States producers were still growing their production, so here's Russia holding back and U.S. is continuing to grow, and they just got sick and tired of that and they're, like, \"Okay, we're going to take advantage of the situation and really put the pressure on the U.S. producers to stop growing.\" And I think they might actually have learned their lesson this time, at least for the near-term.There's been like a big pushback from investors to stop growing production as fast as possible, that's why we see dividends and stock buybacks. But I think now U.S. producers actually have to cut back. They've stopped drilling in some places and they've laid down drilling rigs, but that's just not enough, they have to actually turn off the physical pumps. And I've seen numbers, like, Texas might cut 20%, and I think things like that have to happen, which is things that just are unheard of in the industry. Right. And even with Texas cutting 20%, you're still going to be, you know, say 7 million barrels a day oversupplied. So, either way, we're going to be in a significant oversupply in the market, which creates difficult conditions for shale oil companies.We've talked about in the past that there are probably some bankruptcies coming down the line for shale E&Ps, whether or not the coronavirus disruption took place. Well, we saw the first of those come to fruition this week with  being the first shale company to declare bankruptcy so far this year. Not only did they declare bankruptcy, though, Whiting Petroleum's Board approved $14.6 million in cash bonuses for top executives days before they declared bankruptcy.When you see this happen, Matt, does this surprise you at all coming from the shale industry? Unfortunately, it doesn't surprise me, but it's still shameful, you know. They have drilled their company into the ground, taking up too much debt. And you know, they had several years to prepare for this. And they did little things here and there. But then, what are they getting a bonus for? For destroying the company? And for it to be paid in cash when there's people that they're laying off, it's just shameful, but it's practiced in the industry, and this is something that really needs to stop. Right. This is legal. So, this is the thing, I mean, there's not really a legal repercussion here. The thing is, you know, you need to, kind of, not invest in these sorts of folks, don't support them, and really call it out when you see it. And it's not just the management here that you need to shame some, this is the Board, I mean, the Board approved this compensation package, a lot of these folks are long standing Board members. You look at the Chairman of the Board, who has been there since 2003, has received about $1.5 million in compensation over the past five years. Clearly, isn't putting a lot of resistance to management when they ask for these sorts of things. So, this is certainly concerning. I think we can expect more of that this year as there's disruption in the oil market.And to be honest, some of these bankruptcies were coming down the line whether or not the coronavirus disruption took place. So, when folks say, \"We would have got through this, but for the coronavirus,\" don't necessarily believe that for all these shale folks.Moving into our main topic for today, we're going to talk about some dividend-paying stocks. We got a listener question from Mike. Mike asked \"What are the prospects for energy pipeline companies? Is , , MLPs like , etc., in the current environment? What are the best current investments? Love the show. Keep up the good work.\"Matt, any thoughts on those midstream pipelines? Well, first, before we get into those specific companies, just more broadly, we talked about the trouble that the E&Ps have had, these bankruptcies taking place. How are these going to affect midstream companies, if at all? Yeah, I think that's the big unknown right now. One of the things that Whiting did before they declared bankruptcy is, they drew everything on their credit facility. And so, basically, it's like a credit card that companies have with banks and what that will do is that will give them cash to operate as they work through things. And the idea is, this will give them the money to pay these midstream companies, their employees, their partners that sort of thing.So, it all really depends on is how the bankruptcy things shake out. Like, in Whiting's case, it's pre-packaged, which means they basically agreed what they're going to do. So, if everybody agrees to it, that means they'll keep these midstream contracts in place. However, we don't know what the next one will be and there's companies out there that have significant exposure to these financially weaker E&Ps and so if they go bankrupt and then they can't work out a pre-packaged deal, they might have to go all the way back and cut midstream contracts oil service contracts. So, we just don't know how it's all going to play out.And so thus, investors really need to be careful and just keep an eye on basically everything that is risk-related with these companies. Right. Those counterparties are really important, that's why if you can have folks who, their customers are more credit-worthy, particularly, help -- I mean, it's always a good thing to look for, but particularly in this environment, even more important.Going to these companies that Mike mentioned, Kinder Morgan, Enbridge, Magellan Midstream, any of those pop out to you as particularly attractive or particularly unattractive? So, Enbridge actually put out an interesting investor slideshow where they went through their counterparty risk, which is, you know they have these long-term contracts, which is great, but if the companies that underpin that goes bankrupt then they're worthless, but it was like 90% of those contracts were with an investment grade counterparties. Now, investment grade is flexible, and if these companies come into trouble, those ratings could go bye-bye, but it does give them kind of a leg-up on some of the other ones.And then the other thing is volumes are going to fluctuate a lot. And a lot of these contracts are called take-or-pay, which means if the volumes don't go, it doesn't matter and the other thing is the commodity price. So, a lot of these bigger pipeline companies are better insulated from these things. So, like, your Kinder Morgan, your Enbridge, they are a lot safer. Magellan, in particular, they put out kind of like a warning that they see 20% demand decline and so that's going to impact them. But they still believe that they're going to be able to fund their dividend, they're just going to take on more debt, which they can because they have a great balance sheet.So, you know you're looking at the balance sheet. This is where the balance sheet really matters. And in those cases, all three of those companies really stepped it up before things got bad and so they're better positioned now that things are bad. Yeah, I think, all three of those are on the shortlist of ones that I would be looking at. I think, Enbridge is one, I think, it's particularly attractive given the assets that they have. They are kind of systemically important to the Canadian market when it comes to the pipeline supply there.Want to talk about too, just more broadly, outside of the ones that Mike mentioned. So, some dividend stocks that you like. I asked you to kind of bring a couple that you're interested in. The first one of these is . Matt, what can you tell us about that company? Yes, so I really took a deep look at each one of these pipeline companies to see which one looks like the strongest. And I think TC Energy, which is formerly TransCanada, they are natural gas focused, and natural gas is going to be a little bit less impacted by all this, even though the industries are shutting down, so you're not going to have as much natural gas demand. However, 92% of the cash flow is backed by these take-or-pay type contracts which just means there's no volume or commodity price for us, so that's very stable cash flow.Most of them are investment grade shippers. And the big thing, I think, with them is a 40% dividend payout ratio. So, very conservative, lots of cushion there. They have one of the highest credit ratings in the sector. And so, they're really well-positioned for this.Now, they are projecting 8% to 10% dividend growth next year and 5% to 7% in the future. I'm concerned with that, but I do like their dividend right now. And I think that as far as, you know, if I'm looking at a pipeline stock to buy, that would be the safest one, in my opinion, right now. So, when you say, \"A concern about the dividend; don't expect it to rise this year,\" can you expound on that a little bit? Well, they've already increased it this year, but they're saying 8% to 10% next year. And the industry might hold back for the near-term, just given all the uncertainty, they might keep that cash they would have used to raise the dividend, they might go and make an acquisition or just really fortify that balance sheet. I think in this environment they don't need to grow the dividend, at least that fast, maybe you do a 1% just to get to that 21 year, because they've grown it for 20 straight years, so.Right. We're on the way to dividend aristocrat status, you don't want to give that up, right, even if you got to raise it by $0.01, you're going to do what you need to stick on that list.There's another one, you mentioned Canada, you know there's been a lot of political issues around the pipelines being going on there. Has that affected them at all? Actually, they just approved the Keystone XL pipeline, which kind of flew under the radar, that was a big deal in the past couple of years, but Trump had pushed it as soon as he got elected. And they just decided that they're going to move forward with that. And they did it because the government of Alberta, which is where all the oil sands companies are located, they're going to help finance this thing, they're pumping, like, a $1 billion in equity plus they're backing a credit facility.And that's because Canada needs pipelines. The oil price in Canada was like $5 a barrel the other day, because they just don't have any place to store, they don't have any place to get it to market. And so, this will help them in the future, obviously, it won't be ready for -- you know, 2023 is optimistic because you know there's going to be some pushback from environmentalists and landowners and people like that. But it's a project that would really move the needle for them if it does move forward. Yeah, it's been difficult, particularly these further inland producers, it's really hard to get your product to market. I mean, you know there's no way to store it terrestrially and then there's no way to get it out. So, that's a particularly important thing. And then Canada, I think, has been starved for pipelines for a while.Moving on to your second stock, which one do you bring for us, Matt? , which is a utility in Florida, we talked about it before. I think they're one of the best-run energy companies in the country. They've been spot-on with renewable energy, which, you know, is just this huge megatrend. They invest very well as far as looking for returns and, you know, just their business. Now, even utilities, I think, could feel some near-term impact from just the demand that, you know, we're not using much electricity, we're not using much of natural gas, but they've got the balance sheet to get through that. One of the best balance sheets in the industry. They have a little payout ratio, about 60%. So, I like them very much.Again, the question is, are they going to grow the dividend as much as they say? They say 10% per year through 2022, which is very optimistic right now given we just don't know how the economy is going to respond to all this shutting down for a couple of months, so. But I think they can at least maintain their dividend, then once things get better, they're going to be shining on the other side. Yeah, as a utility, one thing you think about is they have regulated rates. And there could be some restrictions from governments on how much they'll let folks hike up rates given the state of the economy. I mean, obviously, NextEra energy is known mostly for its renewable portfolio, that sort of thing. They do have a small portfolio of pipelines, do you think, is that going to be affected at all by what's going on? I don't think so, because most of the pipelines are these take-or-pay ones. So, they're not into the gathering and processing, which is further upstream, right by the wells, these are mostly interstate pipelines. And the gas, typically, will flow to utilities that will use it. Now, I think if a utility is going to shut down anything, because of lack of power demand, it will be coal, because coal is the most expensive power source. So, I think coal will go before natural gas. And because natural gas prices have plummeted. And then, I don't think that anybody is going to shut-off a renewable power plant right now. So, I think they're very well protected as far as being able to continue making money on those contracts. Yeah, but, Matt, this raises an issue that I've thought about, maybe I can get your thoughts here. As we've seen this trend over the past several years of coal being replaced by natural gas or renewables, that sort of thing, do you think that this disruption caused by the coronavirus could accelerate that trend at all? I think so, because coal, in my opinion, it's done. There's no reason to be burning coal when we have clean burning natural gas, which is, I saw a price $1.50 for NCF; that's half of what it was not too long ago. And so that's so cheap and the renewables are getting cheaper and cheaper, especially with, like, all commodity prices are falling, so your steel prices are going to be cheaper, so that's going to make wind cheaper. So, I really think that this will basically help accelerate this trend toward renewables. Yeah, absolutely, we see President Trump, you know go back to another tweet talking about, \"Now is the time to invest in infrastructure.\" If we're going to do that, I really would love to see some more investment in natural gas, renewables, that sort of thing. And I think that's the type of investment that both parties can get onboard with. And these days, it's very difficult to get that done in any sort of way.Moving away from energy companies, talking more broadly in the dividend space, any companies that you're interested in right now or you've been buying that you think are particularly attractive for dividend purposes? Yeah. I had a watchlist of the kinds of things that I was looking for to buy if we ever got a big sell-off. And is one that was on my watchlist, because I'm renovating my house right now and I've been to Home Depot seventy times. And one day I saw the dividend yield was like 4% in Home Depot. And that's a company that, yeah, it's going to suffer in the near-term, but it's something that, like,  is going to disrupt and we're always going to need to maintain our houses. So, that was one that I bought.And then was another one. Sure, garbage is, you know, that's kind of recession resistant, but this is a different kind of recession. So, I think there's a near-term impact, but long-term, you know, that's a really great, well-run company.So, those are some of the ones that I bought recently that I'm excited to be able to get at such a cheaper price. I've personally bought Home Depot as well. It ticks off a lot of the boxes I look for in a company. So, it's in this duopoly, it's them and . It's really the barriers to entry are going to be very difficult for them. I can't imagine there's a city in the country of any size that doesn't have one of those major hardware stores there. You talk about the type of things that they ship. You mentioned Amazon. Amazon is not going to start shipping 2x4s or any of that sort of thing anytime soon. Just the logistical aspect of it is tough.And again, whether you like to or not, things break around your house. We have a little sliding door that goes in front of our, kind of, washer dryer at the stack washer dryer thing. And that thing has been slowly, but surely, breaking down day-after-day week-after-week since we've been living at home. And I know I'm going to have to make a trip to Home Depot to fix that. And, you know, they're just going to have that business going forward.Another thing that I think about too is, a lot of folks my age, younger folks, are getting to that age where they're going to be moving into homes. And a lot of these starter homes, there's an undersupply of starter homes. So, if you can't buy new starter homes, well, maybe you're going to have to buy an older house, which leads to you having to fix more stuff.So, I think just structurally, Home Depot checks off a lot of boxes. This is a type of business that maybe it's going to be disturbed for a while, but it's a really, really strong franchise.And I also like the management too. Arthur Blank is a person who -- the Founder of the business -- who I can really respect and get behind. So, I think across the board I like that business.Another one, I bought . I think that's a business that is going to do really great during this period, dividend payer, it's not a massive, massive yielder. And card volumes are probably going to go down slightly. But again, there's some arguments people have made -- I don't know if I'm really onboard with them, though -- that maybe this is going to accelerate the trend away from cash, folks are worried about handling cash, buying more things online. I think, generally this is a company that's going to come out of the backend, that's going to be well-positioned. Yeah, I definitely agree with you on MasterCard, I bought that too. And then, to your point about renovating houses, my wife and I just bought a house last July, it was a 25-year-old house. And, man, the longer we've been in here, the more projects we added to our list. You know, things that initially didn't bother us, it's like, \"Uh, that needs to be painted,\" or \"Uh, that needs to be replaced.\"And the other thing is, people that are living in apartments now, they've realized that those apartments get small really quickly. And the space is going to be at a premium and I think you're going to see a big wave of people moving a little bit out to the suburbs and getting some space in a backyard that they can go out in. Yeah, tell me about it. We've been here with the lockdown, I have a large dog, a lab, and they closed all the dog parks in the city and it has been a chore trying to get him exercised without having a backyard and like a place to go run him. And I think lots of other people are noticing that.While we're talking about it, one other theme that I do think is going to benefit coming out of the backend of this is pets. I don't know, if you've seen, a bunch of my friends have gotten pets in the past week or so. There was an article out of  maybe a week or two ago that said New York City had literally run out of foster pets, they didn't have any, because so many people had come and got and picked up pets to help them out, I guess. And I think that's a trend that's probably going to benefit in the near-term from this disruption. And I think that that's a trend that already had a lot of tailwinds behind it.So, I've been looking at some of the pet companies with  or Zoetis or even, like,  pet insurance. Those are all, kind of, themes that I'm looking at right now to invest in. Yeah. Well, as pet owners, we don't have the kids, but we have two cats. And  is something that we've used for years, and it's such a great company as far as just being ease-of-use. We get our Kitty litter and food delivered to us on a consistent basis, so my wife doesn't have to pick that up at the store. So, they're a good company for us as users. So, there's a list for everybody to look at. Matt, do you have -- I keep asking this for all our guests that come on, because a lot of you all have been working at home for a long period of time even before this coronavirus disruption. And I know I'm kind of adjusting to this process as well. Do you have any tips for those of us who are now working at home on how to navigate that new dynamic? I love working from home. I'm a bit of an introvert, so it kind of suits me well. But try to keep some sort of set schedule, it's kind of what has been easy for me. But I like to break up my day and go for a walk or go get some exercise. And you just have so much freedom to do that and so I take advantage of that freedom. I spend a lot of time in front of the computer writing, but just getting that fresh air is very helpful. So, definitely do that.Good tips for everybody at home. Matt, thanks, as always, for coming on the show. You know, we had President Trump tweeting right before the show, but likely by the end of the day there could be another tweet that totally reverses everything we discussed today, hopefully not, hopefully we gave some value for the listeners anyway. But always happy to have you on chatting about investing. Hey, thanks for having me. As always, people on the program may own companies discussed on the show, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against the stocks discussed, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.Thanks to Austin Morgan for his work behind the glass.

We'll take another , and we'll do some  today.We're going to dig into a new IPO; a company called . We're also going to check in on my Healthcare and Wealthcare basket to see how things are going now that we've gotten through the gist of earnings season. And joining me today, to make sense of it all, it's my friend and colleague, Brian Feroldi. Brian, you know, you just made the point before we started taping, this is the first  that we've ever done together, which is bizarre to me, but it's nevertheless true. Jason, so great to finally be chatting with you in a recorded manner, this is wonderful.Well, I was looking forward to it and I'm glad we get to do this. Before we get started, yesterday was a bit of a, let's just call it a volatile day in the markets. How are you handling yesterday's big plummet? Yeah, the funny thing for me is that, I was actually away yesterday on a field trip for my son's fourth grade school. We actually went out to a local wilderness place that we have that's owned by our local university here. And we were out there until eight o'clock at night. And after the sun went down, we were recreating what it was like to travel on the Underground Railroad in the pitch black, and we were walking around, and these kids were terrified because we ran into some seedy characters along the way, but history came alive for me. So, it was very fun to come back. And I say, \"Well, how about the markets on the day that I took off?\" \"Oh, another fun day.\" So, I had a great time and didn't give one lick or care about what was happening with the markets.Nice. It sounds like you were just getting them prepped for that Halloween hayride, a little bit early this year. [laughs] Yeah. Oh, we had some kids that were absolutely terrified. It's so funny how you just -- when it's dark out, if you're walking around outside, kids get scared fast. Yeah, they certainly do. Well, probably best that you just ignore yesterday anyway. These days it seems like we're just waiting for the headline to sort of dictate how the market's going to behave any given day. And today it's certainly the better day. We wanted to dig into what's a pretty new company here to the public markets. And, you know, it's an interesting business model, particularly, as healthcare is under the microscope here during this election season.The company 1Life Healthcare, the ticker is ONEM. Talk to us a little bit, Brian, about 1Life Healthcare. You've been able to dig in now. What is this business 1Life Healthcare? What do they do? Yeah, I'm glad that, I believe, one of our listeners brought this company to our attention, and I had never heard of it before, but this is a company that just came public in January of this year. And their mission is to transform healthcare for all through a human-centered technology-powered model. And this company was founded in 2007 by a healthcare entrepreneur named Tom Lee. And what they've pioneered is a membership-based primary care platform.And just some quick stats on the stock. So, this company, again, came public in January. They raised $245 million. They priced their IPO at $14. And even though the markets have been crazy volatile, this stock is about at $20 today. So, they popped on their first day and they've actually held up pretty well even through these volatile couple of weeks.So, the big problem this company is trying to solve is to fix everything that's wrong with the primary care system in the U.S. So, in the United States we only spend about 5% to 7% of our healthcare dollars on primary care. And if you compare that to, you know, the average developed nation, they spend about 14% of their budget on primary care. And the reason that that matters is every dollar that you spend on primary care and preventive care can lead to about $13 in cost savings down the road on specialty care. I mean, with healthcare, you know, intervention and upfront investments can really payoff.So, 1Life Healthcare is on a mission to, kind of, fix all the pain points that exist in the primary care model today. So, as I'm sure our listeners know, that see a family medicine, there could be enormous wait times to get in to see a doctor, you show up and there's often a long wait to just get into to see them. Your touchpoints with your physician are very infrequent. And these stresses also lead to huge dissatisfaction on the provider side as well.So, about 50% of primary care providers report burnout. And a big reason why is that our entire system is incentivized around fee-for-service, so they have huge pressure on them to just see patient after patient after patient throughout the day, and they also have this enormous number of administrative tasks that they have to handle on a daily basis too. About half of primary care report burnout. So, 1Life is, kind of, pioneering a solution that addresses all of these problems and is trying to fix the primary care system to just make it better for everyone. Yeah. And that primary care system, that's really where it all starts, right? I mean, if you have something that you need to go to the doctor for, as you mentioned earlier, something specific, you have to go see a specialist. Typically, that requires a referral or a consult with the primary care physician anyway to get that ball rolling. So, I can certainly understand where that burnout comes into play.And when you consider the fact that we are in fact running into a shortage of doctors, along with, really, a global population at this point that is demanding more and more healthcare services, you can see how the supply and demand continuum works there. I mean, we're going to start running into some problems. And certainly, it's not just the bandwidth of the number of physicians to actually service patients but then also the economics behind it all.And speaking of economics, how does 1Life make their money? I mean, how does the money flow through their system? What do they do to generate revenue? Yeah. So, these guys primarily open up primary care offices. And right now, they're in nine markets throughout the U.S. So, all of the big cities, like, San Francisco, L.A., Seattle, New York, Boston, etc., they're in nine major markets. And their model is to charge each of their members an annual fee of $199 per year. And what that fee buys them is the ability to use any of 1Life (sic) Healthcare clinics and they also get access to their technology platform. And this platform makes it very easy for patients to get in touch with a provider quickly, so they can actually, once you're in their system, you can book an appointment with your physician that same day or the next day. You compare that to the average family practice, it's an average wait time of 29 days, so we're talking about very fast care.And they also state that their providers only service about half the number of patients that the average provider sees. So, that allows them to really spend quality time with each patient and also help to make sure that their appointments actually start on time. And I'm sure that is something that appeals to every single person that is listening to this show. I mean, how much would you be willing to pay if your provider started your appointment actually on time.And the way that this model works for the physicians is that, on the physician side, physicians are just paid on a salary, there's limited bonuses and there's no extra compensation. They're not compensated on a fee-for-service basis; which is just rampant in the industry. So, that reduces a huge amount of financial pressure, so that providers can actually spend that quality time with their patients.And the platform, the health records platform that 1Life has created in the background, supposedly reduces the administrative tasks that is placed on the physicians by almost half, so it's a really attractive model for primary care providers because they're seeing less patients on a daily basis, get to spend more time with them and has a lower administrative burden. So, this model is really designed, again, to appeal to both consumers and healthcare providers. Yeah. It makes me think a little bit of a country club. It's almost like, you're paying your annual or your monthly membership fee to be a member at a club and you get to go play golf and you can play ten times a month or five times a month or one time a month and it's just going to cost you what it cost you in the form of a membership fee. And in this case, we're talking about healthcare.And it seems to be something aimed at solving, ultimately what is becoming a big problem going back to that whole supply and-demand problem, in figuring out a way to scale healthcare. I mean, to bring healthcare to more people and to make it more efficient, more -- I don't want to say enjoyable, but at least tolerable.And it's a company that has the backing, obviously, of some very important partners, not to mention a strong insider presence as well. So, let's talk a little bit about the Founder here, Tom Lee; the CEO, Amir Rubin, they hold stakes in the company that are fairly respectable. Not to mention, some other big partners that we may have heard of as well, right? Yeah, so these guys have been funded by , some other major venture capitalist firms, and they also have financial backing from the . So, these guys have attracted a deep bench of committed long-term, well-capitalized investors, and that has really allowed them to invest a lot of money upfront to build the platform from the ground up the way they want it to be.And more recently, after they came public, this company currently has a cash balance of about $410 million that it now has access to continue to fund to build out this network across the country. And that's important, because when you're building out this model, it's very expensive. I mean, they're hiring doctors. They're building out the clinics. They're hiring like crazy, and they're simultaneously making this big investment into this custom platform to manage all of the patients' health records and the technology that, kind of, goes behind that, so a lot of investment upfront. But when you see that these guys have the backing of these huge deep-pocketed investors, that certainly has given this company a big edge. Yeah, you know, what this reminds me of this, makes me think of, in a couple of our flagship services here, our and services -- which are the stock recommendation services, as I'm sure most, if not all listeners know -- you know, we have features in those services. Every year we talk about our core stocks, you know, the core holdings that we feel like, if anybody is going to follow these services and you're looking to get invested, these are the core bedrock holdings that we think you ought to own.And those core stocks change year-to-year and they change by virtue of the team going in there deliberating and figuring out what they believe the core stocks should be. But it's about starting from the ground and working your way up, it's not about replacing one core stock with the other, it's about essentially starting over again and building something today with the knowledge that we have today.It does seem like, in 1Life's case, they're not trying to unwind or unravel all of this red tape that has ultimately plagued our healthcare system. It's like they're trying to start fresh with a new concept, a new idea, to see, \"Hey, what if we just decided, what if we chose to take healthcare in this direction, how could that work?\" I mean, this could be the start of something really important in the landscape of our healthcare system, don't you think? Yeah, I think so too. And I do like your point there. And it is worth pointing out that 1Life does work with your existing insurance provider. So, this is not, like, totally out of left field and it's just purely a $199 fee for the year, these guys do bill your current insurance company for their range of services. They've just pioneered a different model, really, behind the scenes, especially on the provider side with the compensation, to make sure that the model, kind of, works better for everybody.And it's also worth pointing out that these guys do have active partnerships with big healthcare systems that want access to 1Life's growing network of primary care physicians. So, they've already struck deals with some UCSF Health systems in San Francisco, UC San Diego, Dignity Health, Providence St. Joseph. So, these big health platforms are now plugged into 1Life's EHR system to provide the primary care and get their members access to those additional services through their health network. So, these guys are really solving pain points across the board.And from a financial perspective, this is proven to be very attractive for employers, because it's a very high-touch model on the primary care side. One of the stats that 1Life touts is that there's a 41% reduction in emergency room visits for its members once they join the platform. So, that leads to huge potential cost savings. The overall cost savings that they're reporting, when employers switch to them, is about an 8% drop in total cost savings, but that does not include the potential for employees that are sick to get back to work faster, so there could also be some other knock-on effects down the road.So, again, their model is supposed to appeal to consumers, employers, health systems and providers, and the growth that we've seen thus far, does show that there is something to this. Okay. So, let's talk about that growth for a second, because while I think we've painted a pretty neat picture of this company and I'm certainly interested in learning more, I mean, there are no investments that come without risks, right? I mean, there are going to be risks involved with this business, particularly, given that it is so new to the public markets. What are some of the key risks for a business like this today? Yeah. So, before we talk about the risks, I'd like to talk about just how fast this company is growing to give our listeners some perspective. So, for the first nine months of 2019 -- that's the data that we have when they filed their regulatory filings to go public -- this company reported 29% top-line growth. So, total revenue was about $199 million. And they report a fun metric called their \"care margin,\" which is basically their gross margin, and that number came in at 40% and that figure was up 500 basis points over the year ago period. So, we're seeing decent top-line growth, especially for a primary care focused facility, as well as a good margin, a margin that I was actually pretty impressed with.However, we did talk about this company is funding a number of growth initiatives, and that is very expensive. They're also hiring like crazy. So, the net loss that this company produced, in just the first nine months of 2019, was $46 million. You annualize that, you're probably talking about a $60 million to $65 million loss. So, it is obvious why they went public, they do need access to capital. And they do have $410 million in cash after the IPO, so that buys them a decent amount of runway. But there's no doubt that this company is probably going to be operating at a loss for the next couple of years as they continue to invest and build out the network. So, given what we know today and given the risks involved, particularly on the growth side there, what's your bottom-line takeaway with a company like this? Yeah, I think this company is definitely interesting. I mean, once we started to dig into it, I think that I do like their model, I do think that it's, kind of, solving a number of pain points. And the one that I'm the most impressed with is actually the healthcare provider pain point, because that's something that is almost never talked about, but I know that burnout is definitely real. So, if I was a provider, I would definitely find this system to be far more attractive -- if I was a primary care provider -- than the alternative.And then there's also -- we haven't touched upon the valuation yet, but this company became public at a pretty rich valuation. They are currently trading about 9X sales. Their estimated growth for next year is about 22%. So, that's not the fastest growth rate that we've talked about in the show before. And 9X sales certainly is a rich valuation. So, my takeaway after, kind of, digging in is, I think there's a lot to like here. I'm personally not interested, given the valuation and the sales numbers, but I do think that this company is in a great position to consolidate a very fragmented industry and could grow at a double-digit rate for many, many years. How about you? Yeah. I mean, to me, it's a fascinating business, I love the idea of trying to make the healthcare system better, and for that, I just gave them the tip of the cap. As with most IPOs, I'm going to adopt my rule of, I'm going to at least give them a couple of quarters to report earnings and understand better how management communicates the vision, communicates the strategy, communicates the results. So, I would say, it's safe to say, we just keep this one on the radar, definitely follow it, want to learn more about it. And, hey, who knows, a year from now, this may seem like a little bit more of an obvious idea. Yeah, I think that's a great point, with when it comes to IPOs, there's so many factors that can affect the share price in the short-term, then you're talking about, you know, insiders get locked, they can't sell, but after a certain number of days, they can sell. So, kind of, crazy things can happen to the stock price after the IPO. We also don't know what this company is going to be like once they have the pressure of the public eye and Wall Street estimates are over their head and all that, kind of, stuff. So, it is always a trying time, but that's one of the reasons that we do preach, wait a couple of quarters, see how they're doing, see how they handle being public, and then, if you're still happy, dive in. Well, it's always nice to get another stock idea on the radar. And as a reminder for all of those out there looking for more stock ideas, because let's face it, if you're listening to the show then you're probably always looking for more stock ideas.

For those out there who are familiar, then you know what I'm talking about, for those who are not, this is a basket of stocks that I put together a little while back in order to try to capitalize on the healthcare market opportunity that exists out there today. And this was a basket, we put it together back in February of 2018. The date of inception is actually February 9, 2018. That's where we're tracking returns.And the basket itself, it's much like that War on Cash basket I always talk about, this is just a  focused basket and it consists of , ,  and . And that last one, Idexx, if you're not familiar with it. Yeah, I mean, listen, pets matter too, right. This is a pet healthcare company and pets matter too. One of my favorite market opportunities out there.But we figured, with earnings season wrapping up here and with the four components of this basket having reported, we go ahead and just take a look at the status, see how the returns are doing, talk a little bit about the companies in the basket, things that are doing well, maybe areas where we'd like to see them do better. But to give a quick look at the returns picture. Since inception, February 9, 2018, the basket itself has returned in total 116.5%, and that compares to the market's 21.2%. So, we can see that the Healthcare and Wealthcare basket is outperforming nicely, it's done very well for investors in the short time that it's been in existence.And thankfully, I can say, Brian, that it is contributions from all four components, all four components of the basket are in positive return territory. They're all four outperforming the market. And so, I figured we could jump in here and talk a little bit about some of these companies today, just to give a review for listeners, what they do and why we like them.And let's go ahead and just start with the one that I've just been fascinated with ever since they went public about five years ago, Teladoc Health. I think that when we talk about changing the healthcare system, telemedicine is certainly a topic of discussion that is taking up more and more time these days and rightly so, because it is really helping bring more efficiency into the healthcare system and scale healthcare, which is, as we're seeing, is a big concern. Yeah. And anybody that's listening to you for a long time knows that you've been beating the drum on Teladoc Health basically for the last couple of years, so you've really nailed this one so far. So, Teladoc is the leading provider of telemedicine. So, just video conferencing with a doctor to get symptoms done. And obviously, the interest in this company has just skyrocketed in the last couple of weeks given the huge epidemic of coronavirus, the idea that you can interact with a healthcare provider without leaving your home, without risking anything, that has really caught Wall Street's attention.But this company has just been on fire. They just reported really great quarterly results. We saw U.S. paid members grow 61%. So, now almost 37 million Americans have access to this platform. Total visits, so the number of people that are actually using the platform, grew 57% to 4.1 million during the quarter. That's great to see. Revenue grew 27%, and the bulk of that was organic in nature, which means, that it was just natural to the platform, it wasn't acquired growth, because Teladoc has been quite acquisitive in its history to drive that top-line higher.And for 2020, we basically saw that they're calling for more of the same big top-line growth, big growth in member visits, and Wall Street just ate it up. This stock has been red hot. Yeah, it does seem like this is a point in time in history where we're getting, I think, some pretty reasonable buy-in from all parties involved regarding the merits of telemedicine. Again, it's not meant to replace our current healthcare system, it's simply meant to make it better.What they always talk about is this concept of the front door. They feel like they are better positioned to be the natural first step in pursuing your healthcare transaction, whatever may be wrong. And clearly telemedicine isn't meant for every ailment, but there are certainly plenty of them where it works out very well, as being that first step you take in going to the doctor. And so, yeah, you're seeing more and more healthcare systems, more HMOs, more insurance companies adopting these services.And Teladoc is certainly not the only company out there doing it, but you mentioned the point about being rather acquisitive, and there's no question they have been acquisitive over the past few years, and I think a lot of that is really in an effort to build out what they just consider to be the most comprehensive offering out there.So, yeah, so far so good. We'll keep our eyes on it, but I like what I'm seeing so far.Let's take a look at Masimo real quick. And a company that probably -- not a lot of people are as familiar with Masimo. I ran across this company back in 2011, when we were running our Real Money Portfolios here on fool.com, and it just struck me as a fascinating business because of what they do. And it's this working in pulse oximetry which is what sparked my interest in it. Ultimately, pulse oximetry is just -- they're tools that measure the oxygen levels in your blood. And if you're in the hospital, then you need to have that measurement kept track of. And so, the Founder, Joe Kiani, came up with the technology that he developed and built out in his garage, turns out it worked pretty well, and now he's got, what looks like, a $1 billion revenue business at this point.Have you ever taken a look at Masimo, Brian? Oh, yes, I have. And I love it when founders are still running the show. And that is something that really attracts me to Masimo. And for our listeners, that ticket there is MASI; and they've probably interacted with this company. If you've ever been to the hospital or doctor and they've put in that little clip on your finger or toe and they've told you what your blood oxygen level is, so that is Masimo's basically bread and butter.And this company is a razor and blade business model, that I know has worked very well for many healthcare companies and Masimo is certainly no differently ... ... I love those models. Those are the best models ... ... I completely agree, it's one of the things that I look for in any potential medical device company, is the recurring revenue. And that's exactly Masimo has in spades. And last quarter, in the fourth quarter, we saw basically a continuation of the same growth that we've seen from this company for year-after-year.So, top-line growth was 12%, which is pretty good for a company of this size. Their gross margin is expanding and their operating margin is expanding. So, that's something that is music to my ears as investor. I love it when companies can consistently grow their top-line at a double-digit rate. And use margin enhancements throughout the income statement to just go into even faster growth on the bottom line.And the bottom-line here is, this is a company that's just doing what it set out to do. For next year they're basically calling for 11% top-line growth and continued margin enhancements. So, they have made some investments to build out their product offering. And I think this is a great slow-and-steady market-beater. I think this is a great pick. Yeah, I like it too. I own it personally. I think I'll be hanging on to those shares for a while. Let's take a real quick look at UnitedHealth, this is obviously the behemoth in the space, the biggest insurer out there. Some people love it, some people hate it, but the bottom-line is that they are going to be a fixture in our healthcare system for a long time to come.And, hey, listen, it's been a nice day for UnitedHealth thus far, I think that's probably a little bit more political in nature, given the results that we're seeing pouring from Super Tuesday, but regardless it's still a business that is doing very well, making a lot of money. I mean, 19% growth in earnings for the quarter here.Outlook for 2020, calling for somewhere in the neighborhood of $16.40 or so in earnings per share at the midpoint. And to keep their medical care ratio in check. Lower is better, right? That means that they're able to not have to overspend on healthcare, they are being efficient and effective -- hopefully, being effective.What do you think about UnitedHealth these days, given its size and position in the space? Yeah. And to give our listeners a sense of this company's scale, I mean, this company's market cap is $270 billion; it is a monster of a company. In the land of healthcare giants UnitedHealth is the biggest giant. So, it's incredibly impressive to see a company of this size producing 19% growth.And the really fascinating thing about this company is, over the last couple of weeks, we've seen this stock trade wildly. I mean, we're talking about double-digit moves, which is just an enormous bump in market cap, both up and down basically based on the latest news out of the elections. So, whether or not there's going to be a candidate that earns a Democratic ticket for -- that's pushing Medicare for all or not.So, normally this is a \"slow-and-steady, doesn't-move-much\" stock, but really that volatility has been amped up. But no matter what, this is a very steady-Eddie performer, it just keeps doing, kind of, what it does to your point. Their medical care ratios are, kind of, going to bounce around, but overall this company has proven to be a steady-Eddie performer.But there's no doubt that this year is probably going to see some big volatility for all of the health insurers based on the way that the 2020 elections go. So, that is something for investors to keep in mind. Yeah. And given our conversation on Teladoc just a little bit earlier, UnitedHealth is making investments in telemedicine and digital as well. They've got this thing called virtual visits, of which Teladoc is actually a provider. So, I just thought that was very interesting to see that relationship. They're competitors, I'm sure, but they are also partners in that value chain and that's always fun to see.Okay. Let's get to the last stock in the basket, one that really tugs on my heartstrings, Brian, and it's because I have three dogs at home. Idexx Labs, talk about razor and blade models, this is another one, isn't it? Yeah, these guys are focused on the pet care market. So, if you've ever been to the vet, if you have a pet and taken them in for any kind of diagnostic tests, the odds are pretty good that Idexx Labs is making money off of you. And they have the razor and blade business model. So, they place these systems and then they get recurring revenue from these system sales.And you want to talk about another company that has just been a steady-Eddie consistent performer. This company has just consistently grown the top-line at the low double-digits and just margin enhancements up-and-down the income statement to produce double-digit growth in the bottom-line. This has been a monster winner for investors over the long time. And we all know that spending on pets is going nowhere but up, as pets continue to become more and more seen as members of the family. So, just a steady business and a great performer. Yeah, you know, I was just actually at the vet yesterday, taking our youngest dog in for his annual checkup shots, all that good stuff. And I mean, as you can imagine, with three dogs, I spend a decent amount of time at the vet, just taking him in for regular visits. And we've had our same vet here for the last ten years we've been here and they're just a wonderful practice.And I always ask him about Idexx when I go in, because he uses Idexx equipment and it's always nice to get sort of that boots-on-the-ground perspective from folks using that kind of stuff. And he never wavers from this, he always comes back with, \"You know what, Idexx is the best, and it's not because they are the cheapest,\" he says, \"it's because they have the best research,\" their research that lets them develop new and exciting products that are making his job, ultimately, easier and helping -- you know, we talk about better outcomes in regard to patient care as far as people go, it's leading to the same type of thing, better outcomes as far as pet care goes. And so, yeah, diagnostics are a big deal because it helps see around some of those corners and prevent some problems.And we saw another animal healthcare company, , which is another favorite of mine. And honestly, it probably should be the Wildcard in this basket. Zoetis is focused more on the vaccines and whatnot, but they recently made an acquisition of Abaxis, which is in the diagnostics market as well. And I think that acquisition was meant to give Zoetis a little bit more competitive stance there against companies like Idexx. But clearly Idexx is continuing to lead the way.And I think, for me, what I constantly keep an eye on with them is, just what they're spending on research and development. They have such a good business model that allows them to keep on spending on research and development. And if I ever saw that number start ticking down, that's when I would actually start worrying about this business, because there's not a whole heck of a lot out there I'm worried about with them. It just seems like veterinarians are OK with the pricing because the products and the equipment is just so good. Yeah, and one thing that I personally like about Idexx, and any business that's involved with pet care, is its healthcare but there's zero insurance risk, right, you're not dealing with third-party providers, it is a cash pay business. And that is very, very attractive. So, there's much less reduced risk on anything changing in the industry; that's awesome. Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean, we know there is pet insurance out there, but that's not really the majority of the market there. It is, for the most part, a cash business. And that's, yeah, another really attractive part of Idexx there, so.Yeah, you know, that's a review of the Healthcare and Wealthcare basket. Again, it seems like the returns are really telling the gist of the story there. Clearly, I'm thrilled with its performance and as an owner of a number of those companies. In fact, I think UnitedHealth Group is the only one I don't own, Brian, and I think maybe this is going to be a good year to look for one of those dips and perhaps add some shares of that to my portfolio, just to have all my bases covered. I would bet that you're going to get your chance this year, yes. All right, folks, well, that's going to do it for us this week. Remember, you can always reach out to us on Twitter @MFIndustryFocus or you can drop us an email at , let us know how you're doing.

I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2020. IDEXX achieved continued strong financial performance in Q4, which supported delivery of full year revenue and EPS gains aligned with our long-term financial goals. In terms of highlights, we achieved 10% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by 11% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, and 10% organic growth in our LPD and Water businesses.Solid fourth quarter gains supported full year organic revenue growth of over 10% and nearly 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Our full year EPS was $4.89, an increase of 21% on a comparable constant currency basis, supported by 120 basis points in comparable constant currency operating margin improvement. Note that our comparable growth rates and comparable operating margin improvement metrics now exclude impacts from Q4 CEO transition charges. These charges reduced operating profits by $13.4 million in Q4 aligned with our expectations, and EPS by $0.14 per share after tax approximately $0.04 better than initial projections reflecting updated tax provision estimates.Full year EPS results included $0.22 per share and tax benefit from share based compensation activity $0.05 per share above our guidance estimates. We also saw an additional $0.04 of below the line upside to our earlier guidance estimates related to final tax provision estimates, and lower than projected interest expense. We are well positioned to build on the strong results in 2020, while maintaining our outlook for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue growth reflected in our increased guidance range of $2,620 million to $2,655 million in annual revenues, which include updated FX estimates. We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.12, to $5.42 to $5.58 per share, reflecting 13% to 16% comparable constant-currency EPS growth.Positive revisions to our preliminary guidance range reflects the flow-through of our 2019 performance with consistent operational improvement assumptions and favorable updates to projections for interest expense, share based compensation tax benefits and FX impacts. We'll walk you through the details over 2020 guidance later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results by segment.Q4 results were supported by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were up 11% organically driven by 11% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, net of a modest equivalent days headwind overall. By region, US CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 10.5% organically, net of a 0.5% equivalent days impact. Consistent strong US gains were supported by low to mid-teens organic growth in reference lab sales, double-digit gains in VetLab consumables and solid gains in rapid assay revenues.US CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven, with net price gains trending in the 2% to 3% range. We also maintain high levels of customer retention across modalities. US CAG Diagnostic revenue growth continues to outpace broader market trends. Total visits per practice were relatively flat in the quarter on a same store basis with a 4.3% increase on overall same-store practice revenue. Total market clinical visit growth was 1.8% in Q4 following relatively strong Q3 results with some moderation in visit gains earlier in the fourth quarter, offset by stronger gains in December.For the full-year, clinical same-store visit growth increased 2.5% of the 7500 practices in our data set up from 2.1% in 2018, reflecting continued solid market expansion and diagnostic services. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 12% organically in Q4, net of a modest overall equivalent days headwind. International results reflected mid-teens organic growth in consumable revenues supported by a 25% year-on-year expansion in our Catalyst installed base outside of the US.Strong consumable gains of nearly 20% in Europe and continued strong gains in Canada and Latin America were moderated to a degree in Q4 by impacts related to the timing of shipments in Asia, which benefited Q3 2019 and prior year Q4 results, as well as equivalent day impacts. For the full year, international consumable revenues increased nearly 20% organically. International reference lab sales increased organically at consistent high single-digit rates in Q4 with solid gains across our major regions.For the full year, global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased nearly 12% organically, reflecting 11% gains in the US and 13% growth in international markets aligned with our long-term goals. By modality, global reference lab and consulting services revenues expanded 11% organically in the fourth quarter, supported by nearly 1% of equivalent day growth benefit with an additional 2% of reported growth benefit related to the initial integration of Marshfield Labs.Full year organic growth of 11% in lab revenues was driven by consistent strong growth in the US, supported by continued high same-store sales growth at IDEXX customers. Global VetLab consumable revenues grew 12% organically in Q4, net of a 1.5% equivalent day headwind. For the full year, VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically driven by double-digit growth across US and international markets supported by increases in diagnostic test utilization and ongoing expansion of our premium instrument installed base.We had another excellent quarter in terms of high quality instrument placements in Q4, supporting double-digit year-on-year growth and our economic value index or EVI. Global premium placements increased 13% year-on-year in Q4, driven by 23% year-on-year growth in catalyst placements supporting a 19% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst installed base. Overall, we placed 2,517 catalysts in the quarter with 456 at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 8% year-on-year. And 1,119 new and competitive placements in international markets, a 24% year-on-year increase.We also achieved 1,248 premium hematology placements, up -- excuse me. We also achieved 1,248 premium hematology placements, up 7%, and 713 SediVue placements, down 4% compared to strong prior-year levels. Overall, our SediVue global installed base is now over 8,900 instruments of 35% year-on-year. Rapid assay revenues grew 4% organically in Q4, reflecting solid gains across US and international markets, net of a 1.5% equivalent day headwind. For the full year, rapid assay revenues grew nearly 8% organically, reflecting continued solid growth of 4Dx Plus, Specialty and first-generation products.Growth and high customer retention in our rapid assay business continued to benefit from ongoing expansion of our engaged SNAP Pro installed base. Supported by an additional 10,000 placements in 2019 bringing our global installed base to over 37,000.Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging system revenues increased 9% organically in Q4 supported by double-digit gains in VSS and continued solid expansion of digital imaging services.Overall, global CAG revenues grew nearly 11% organically in 2018 and we're targeting continued double-digit organic gains in the CAG business in 2020. In terms of our other lines of business, Water revenues grew 10% organically in Q4, including approximately 1% benefit from equivalent days, supported by solid gains across our major regions. For the full year, Water revenues increased 9% organically with faster operating profit growth, resulted in 47% full-year operating margins. We're very pleased with our continued momentum in the Water business and are targeting continued high single digit organic growth in this highly profitable business in 2020.Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q4 increased 10% organically. Strong Q4 growth results were supported by benefits from the sales of diagnostic testing programs for African Swine Fever in China, which offset declines in core swine diagnostic testing, as well as solid growth in poultry testing and herd health screening. Q4 results also benefited from favorable year-on-year comparisons related to timing of government and distributor orders. For the full year 2019, our LPD revenue was up 6% organically with relatively higher operating profit growth, benefiting from productivity improvement and cost controls.We're pleased with our progress in expanding our LPD revenues and profits in 2019 in a very dynamic global climate. In 2020, we're targeting flat to modest organic growth in our LPD business as benefits from growth in our pregnancy testing franchise and African Swine Fever testing programs are moderated by expected ongoing pressures on broader swine diagnostic testing in Asia and Bovine government disease control programs in Europe, as well as tough compares related to strong 2019 herd health screening levels.Turning to the P&L, gross profit was up 10% on a reported basis in Q4 or 11% adjusted for foreign exchange impacts. Gross margins decreased slightly on a constant currency basis, reflecting increased investment in our Reference Lab business related to day lab capacity, route expansion, system investments and acquisition integration, which offset benefits from moderate net price gains and continued strong consumable revenue growth. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which benefited gross profit were $3.5 million in Q4.Operating profit in Q4 was flat as reported, including impacts from CEO transition charges. On a comparable constant currency basis, operating income increased 12%, reflecting solid profit gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments supported by high revenue growth. As expected comparable constant currency operating margin gains were relatively flat in Q4. Operating expense growth increased to 10% on a comparable constant currency basis, driven by increases in global CAG commercial capability and R&D.As we'll discuss in our guidance update, investment impacts will carry into the first half of 2020. For the full year, operating profit increased 13% as reported or 16% on a comparable constant currency basis. This reflects an operating margin of 23% and an increase of 120 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes CEO transition charge impacts. Constant currency operating margin gains reflecting a balance 50 basis points of gross margin improvement and 70 basis points of operating expense leverage on strong volume growth.EPS in Q4 was $1.04 per share including $0.05 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 17%. For 2019, EPS was $4.89 of 21% on a comparable constant currency basis. For the full year, foreign exchange rate changes decreased EPS by $0.05 per share, net of FX hedge gains of nearly $11 million. Full year EPS results included $19 million or 22% per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which provided 3.7% of benefit in our 2019 effective tax rate of 18%. We had interest expense of $30.6 million for the year, net of approximately $2 million of capitalized interest related to major facility projects.Free cash flow was $304 million for 2019 or 71% of net income. Capital spending came in at $155 million, including $58 million of combined investment or approximately 14% of net income related to our Westbrook Maine headquarter expansion and German Core Lab relocation with some favorability to earlier estimates related to timing of major project cash deployment.We allocated $304 million of capital toward the repurchase of 1,215,000 shares for the full year 2019 at an average price of $250 per share. This included repurchases of 532,000 shares in Q4 for $139 million. Our balance sheet is in an excellent position. We ended the year with $991 million of debt, $90 million in cash and $560 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.4 times -- 1.45 times gross and 1.32 times net of cash at year-end.Our strong financial performance and disciplined capital allocations supported achievement of a 46% after-tax return on invested capital, excluding cash and investments for 2019.We're well positioned to build on the strong performance in 2020 with the financial -- with a financial outlook aligned with our long-term goals. We're increasing our reported revenue guidance range to $2,620 million to $2,655 million, up $7.5 million at midpoint, including approximately $5 million of benefit from updated FX assumptions. We are maintaining consistent guidance for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue growth, supported by continued strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 11% to 12%.Our guidance assumes 0.5% growth rate benefit from completed 2019 acquisitions, which is offset by a projected 0.5% FX growth headwind resulted in projected revenue growth of 9% to 10.5%. We are raising our 2020 EPS outlook to $5.42 to $5.58 per share, an increase of $0.12. This aligns with a comparable EPS growth of 13% to 16% reflecting a consistent outlook for 50 basis points to 100 basis points of comparable constant currency operating margin improvement. The $0.12 increase in the EPS outlook compared to our preliminary guidance includes approximately $0.05 in combined benefit from the flow through 2019 operating performance and favorable updates to assumptions for interest expense and projected reductions in average shares outstanding.We are now projecting approximately $35 million in net interest costs in 2020, and a 1% to 1.5% reduction in average shares outstandings -- average shares outstanding with both metrics aligned with an assumed maintenance of our net leverage at 1.5 times EBITDA. Our updated outlook also reflects $0.05 in projected tax benefit from share based compensation activity. We're now projecting an effective tax rate in 2020 of 20% to 21% including $7.5 million to $9.5 million or 1.5% in tax rate benefit from exercise of stock based compensation in 2020, which equates to $0.09 to $0.11 per share.Finally, our guidance benefited by $0.02 from updated FX assumptions. Overall, we're now projecting an estimated $0.09 negative year-on-year impact from FX, net of $5 million of projected hedge gains in 2020. In terms of free cash flow, we're targeting deployment of $140 million to $155 million in capital spending, including approximately $35 million related to the completion of our Westbrook headquarters, German Core Lab projects and the acquisition of real estate associated with the US core lab. For 2020, this results in an outlook for free cash flow of 75% to 80% of net income, including approximately 7% impact from these discrete investments.In terms of our first quarter outlook in 2020, we expect Q1 reported revenue growth in the 9.5% to 11% range, reflected organic gains of 10% to 11.5% including a projected 1% equivalent tailwind related to the leap year.We expect our operating margins will be moderately below the prior year levels, reflecting stepped up commercial and lab investments advanced in the second half of 2019. And as we continue to integrate our Marshfield acquisition and onboard our Westbrook headquarters expansion. We expect operating margin gains in 2020 will be driven by second half performance as we grow into our scaled investments, including our new headquarters and German Core Lab facility.That concludes the financial overview. Let me now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. -- Good morning, and thank you, Brian. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2019 with double-digit growth across our Companion Animal, Livestock and Water Diagnostic businesses. Core CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, which now represents over three quarters of overall company revenues grew 12% organically for the full year. Excellent execution across our businesses enabled us to deliver organic revenue of 10% plus and comparable constant-currency EPS growth of 21% aligned with our long-term financial goals. Return on invested capital at 46% for the year was exceptional. The progress we are advancing on key strategic fronts, positions us well to build on this performance in 2020.Outstanding commercial execution is an essential pillar in our organic growth strategy and we consistently see a high return in increasing these field based capabilities, that allow our sales professionals to spend more time with customers. The expansion in the number of our global customer facing resources and investments and enabling commercial systems in areas like Salesforce Service Cloud were two areas of focus in 2019. We completed the US commercial expansion in Q4 and start the year with our expanded US team in seat and trained. We now have 530 field based professionals in the US to support market development, more than double the number from five years ago.As we enter 2020, we anticipate some settling in during the first quarter of the expansion. Our sales professionals, including those newly recruited, developed relationships in their new or reconfigured territories. Notably, we accomplished this expansion in Q4, while delivering 425 new and competitive Catalysts placements in the US, a record number. We also continue to make progress with Preventive Care with 360 new enrollees in the quarter to reach over 3,800 enrollees in the program to date.Customers are embracing the IDEXX preventive care turnkey solution, and increasingly view it as a foundational pillar in their own practice strategies. We believe that our North American commercial resources are properly balanced at this point with the addressable market opportunity, and in 2020, we will focus on driving productivity in our expanded sales force, which becomes even more effective over time with tenure and with deeper customer relationships.Our commercial capability and performance in international markets also continues to advance, as they build tenure and competencies with key commercial programs like IDEXX 360. The commercial teams' priorities have been driven by the economic value index of an instrument placement that prioritizes high value competitive chemistry placements, resulting in 24% growth in new and competitive Catalysts placements in Q4, to a record of more than 1,100 units.Our Catalyst installed base outside of North America grew 26% year-over-year, supporting nearly 20% organic revenue growth in IDEXX VetLab consumables internationally in 2019. We expect to gain global leverage and further strengthen execution in 2020 with our enhanced field global commercial organization as previously announced. Leading with innovation includes expanding our testing platforms is another key growth pillar. We are excited by the new innovations that we announced at VMX earlier this month. These were enthusiastically greeted by customers as clinically rigorous and value-added since veterinarians embrace new and expanded tools that enable them to raise the standard of care in workflow efficient ways.This year, we are bringing bile acids to our Catalyst platform, with shipments expected this quarter. Catalyst's bile acids as a measure of liver function brings reference lab test quality in clinic. This is a great example of how we constantly make our Catalyst platform more valuable to customers. Catalyst has steady innovation heartbeat with eight clinically important test launched over the past eight years. The technology for life benefit of catalyst is supporting continued global expansion of this best-in-class testing platform. Following another great year of instrument placements and customer retention as of the end of 2019 approximately 41,000 practices of Catalysts installed.Even with the successful installed base expansion, we estimate there remain approximately 70,000 addressable placement opportunities for Catalyst alone around the world. Our innovation focus increasingly use this large clinical datasets with AI and machine learning to develop highly capable algorithms that assist clinicians with even the most challenging patients. This is a case with SediVue Dx, our groundbreaking platform with Neural Network 5.0, leveraging 350 million images launching this quarter.We are adding advanced bacteria detection capabilities made possible by proprietary reagents leveraging patent pending technology at no additional charge for our 8,900 customers. Seeing bacteria is clinically relevant and especially challenging because of their very small size. The difficulty of seeing bacteria in highly cluttered image, because debris could be mistaken for bacteria due to similarity in appearance.Moreover, because our in-clinic analyzers are all connected by smart service, we will be able to quickly update our global installed base with no customer disruption. In reference lab, our broad and differentiated service portfolio including fecal antigen Dx continues to support strong same-store customer growth because the fecal antigen test, does not rely on the visual confirmation of parasite eggs, it's able to uncover twice as many infections as O&P alone, identifying the presence of intestinal parasites earlier in the lifecycle of the infection.We're also further expanding our reference lab offering with an exciting new service, Digital Cytology announced at VMX for launch in North America in February. Cytology results often have at least a two day turnaround time. With our new digital cytology service, we are transforming the speed at which customers receive results with expert interpretation to within two hours, seven days a week, 365 days a year. We're able to do this by leveraging existing capability of an integrated IT workflow, the wide adoption of customer-facing applications like VetConnect PLUS, a field service diagnostic workforce of about 150 field service reps to install and train customers and a global network of more than 100 veterinary critical pathologists.We continue to invest in further improving our lab service offering internationally. We're excited about adding our state-of-the-art core German Reference Laboratory in late spring of this year to our sophisticated global and regional hub-and-spoke laboratory network. Adoption and utilization of IDEXX SDMA continues to advance nicely in clinic and lab diagnostic modalities. 75% of global catalyst customers have ordered Catalyst SDMA and now run at 3.5 million times. In fact, in North America that number is almost 80% adoption. IDEXX SDMA has also been included in almost 28 million chemistry panels at IDEXX reference labs.Customers are increasingly seeing SDMA, a direct measure of GFR impairment or kidney function as a standard of care. In fact, the American Animal Hospital Association has updated their canine diagnostics wellness testing guidelines by life stage, and testing guidelines now for the first time include SDMA. Our veterinary software offerings continue to enjoy robust customer adoption. Customers who use our software applications believe that they are an outstanding enabler to delivering excellent patient care and to running their practices in an efficient manner.Q4 was another strong quarter for new placements of Cornerstone, Neo, Animana and SmartFlow systems. In North America we had record patient management software placements, including cloud-based and on-premise software for 63% year-over-year growth in installs for the quarter. We introduced a much improved user experience update with Cornerstone software version 9.1 in March of last year, and we are pleased that well over half of our installed base upgraded by the end of 2019.Work on Cornerstone cloud continued to progress on schedule in Q4 with very positive customer feedback, positioning us to scale for commercial launch later this year. IDEXX Web PACS enjoyed another strong quarter with 23% year-over-year increase in subscriptions and a customer installed base of more than 4,500 subscribing practices. We recently released for the end of Q1 delivery a cloud-based software update. It provides new functionality powered by artificial intelligence automatically that corrects image orientation and sorts images by body part, potentially shortening read-time by 25%.Overall across these multiple integrated software offerings, we are providing the most comprehensive technology stack offering relied on by independent practices and corporate groups around the world. In addition to our progress in our core CAG business, we also had strong performance in our Water and Livestock Diagnostic businesses in the fourth quarter with both achieving 10% organic revenue growth. We continue to expand our high return Water business globally to focus on commercial execution. Our livestock business has also shown tremendous resilience this year in the face of macro challenges and continued input from the African Swine Fever in Asia.Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the long-term potential of our business and our ability to sustain its high growth. One of our key strategic goals is to grow CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, which in 2020, we're targeting at 11% to 12%. Major drivers include the strong global momentum and expanding our installed base of premium instruments, continued customer adoption of IDEXX's differentiators like integration and ongoing new platform features and our expanded commercial capability aligned with building on this momentum.Over the next 25 years, we see tremendous opportunity for ongoing growth of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues with a global addressable Companion Animal Diagnostics market of over $30 billion with the majority of that existing outside of the United States. We remain focused on our commitment to providing exceptional service to our customers and improving the standard of care to enable the best clinical decision-making and healthy practice growth.Before we open the call to questions, I want to thank our employees and congratulate them for the accomplishments in 2019, in pursuit of our purpose to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. Okay, and with that, we'll take questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take the first question from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Brian, maybe just starting off on how we should be thinking about kind of the cadence of organic growth this year. I think you said the first quarter would be 10% to 11.5%. I think that includes 100 basis point benefit from the leap day. So if we back that out, I think the range is consistent with kind of the full-year guidance that you gave for organic growth. So should we be expecting sort of a relatively consistent cadence over the balance of the year? -- We will obviously provide more detail as we work through the year. But I think that's an accurate read, Nate, is that we've got a full year outlook of 9% to 10.5% will have some benefit from days for -- in Q1, we have, I think a bit of a headwind in Q2. But net-net, on balance for the year, those should wash out. And I think our 11% to 12% recurring CAG growth is very much in line with the, the trends that we've been seeing, if you adjust our fourth quarter results for the days impact and for some of the shipment timing effects we noted in Asia, which were modest but can impact the growth rate a bit, where we're basically right in the middle of that range and looking to build on that in 2020. -- Yeah. And I would add to that, we're well positioned to sustain that 11% to 12% gate that we reflect and are going for 2020, you start with the fact that it's good market backdrop. We saw good clinical visit growth over 2019, 2.5%. We have really nice growth and momentum in our, the expansion of our premium installed base, 16% in total, 19% in Catalyst, 35% in SediVue and those resulted in consumables growth as customers use those products. We're pleased with the adoption we see around IDEXX. Innovation customers are very enthusiastic about the, that the differentiators we've introduced in past years, as well as VMX and we have an expanded sales force, which is, which is out there partnering with customers driving awareness and education and ultimately consideration. And then, we note that as Brian mentioned in his remarks, we have very high retention across all of our modalities. Customers tell us that they appreciate the differentiators we bring like integration and the platform extensions they come to rely on. So we're feeling like we're in a very good position to sustain that growth. -- Thanks, Jay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on your comments on the end market, you kind of noted a strong 2019. Obviously, 4Q is a little bit softer. I know there is kind of always quarter-to-quarter volatility. Is that sort of kind of what you would attribute the 4Q number to? And I think Brian you had mentioned in December was maybe a little bit stronger, I'd just be curious to know if you've seen improvement continue into January. -- Yeah, so the Q4 was solid 1.8% clinical growth. Keep in mind, we focus on the clinical growth piece that's where the veterinarian actually sees the patient and where diagnostics is used as a whole. Now that came off of a fairly strong Q3 and it's noted a little soft going into that -- going into the quarter, but picked up in December. So we're a positive on the market, we think it's a strong market in 2020, and we don't see anything from a change standpoint. -- Thanks for the questions.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. -- Yeah, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of follow-ups on the new Digital Cytology. I'm curious, number one, if you can speak to the early feedback you've got particularly at VMX. And then, number two is my follow-up. I'm curious what the revenue will look like from that. I know there is an instrument but also reading it the reference lab, so will that be in the equipment or reference timelines or how should we think about the revenue model? Thanks. -- Right. Thank you, Ryan. Let me give you the sub-market backdrop and feedback from VMX customers who were really very enthusiastic about Digital Cytology service. Typically that a veterinarian will see patient every day with lumps and bumps. And they will take a sample, prepare a slide, look at it under a microscope and then decide whether or not they need to send it out for expert interpretation. That process very often takes couple days. But it can -- depending upon when they send it in, like on a Friday can take four or five days or so. So they were very, very accretive and enthusiastic about the ability of being able to send it to us and get a result back with an expert interpretation within two hours, and being able to do that all hours of the day, every day of the week and all days of the year. So the -- and the reason we were able to do that by the way is because we were able to fit that into our existing infrastructure and investments that we've made, in terms of integrated IT workflow, having field service organization, which is out there who can help install these systems and onboard and train customers on slide preparation, having clinical pathologists around the world to be able to provide that service.In terms of market size, and then I'll hand it over to Brian to talk a little bit about revenue. The way we think about this is about 5% of practices are higher volume users of cytology. So, we define that as five plus cases per month. About 6,000 of IDEXX practices actually sent today out, cytology to our reference lab for expert interpretation at 6,000 of about a little over 20,000 practices that we do business with in reference labs in some measure. So that gives you just a scope of what we're talking about. We think as they continue to use this, there is potential benefits in using more of it over time, and more customers adopting it. -- Yeah, and I think the way to kind of think about it financially, Ryan is it, is a a factor that will be supportive of sustaining the 11% to 12% CAG Dx recurring growth. Company, including the strong growth that we've seen in US reference Labs, it's a, it's a valued service and a differentiator and I think something that we, we believe can support continue to expand that franchise. And in terms of instrument revenues as Jay noted it's a relatively smaller set of the market that would likely be earlier adopters of the instrument, and we'd anticipate this will be integrated into 360 type program placements more in the second half of the year as we kind of build market awareness and get the service up and running, but it's not calling it out as it just take material driver I think it's something we anticipate we will build over time. But we're very excited about it as another example of how IDEXX is adding to the scope of services that we're providing, adding to our differentiation and value and leveraging that to drive the strong double-digit growth in CAG Dx recurring revenues that we're soon to achieve. -- Great, thanks guys. I'll hop back in the queue.Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, how are you doing? I want to follow up on an earlier question, just on market conditions. Just get a little bit more specific, maybe you could, I guess help put my mind at ease. I've had a lot of questions over recent days and weeks about some international markets, the wildfires in Australia, toward the end of the year, you've had similar weather in California or heat wave in Europe affect you. Just curious if that had any impact. And also on the recent Corona virus outbreak in China, just a lot of attention in the market, obviously, and if you could sort of size your China exposure, how much of that is Companion versus Livestock? And if you've seen anything in terms of that visit or sort of what you're seeing there in that market and how that factors into your expectations for 2020? -- Yeah. Why don't I -- why don't I start with that Mike and hopefully I can get on some of your specific question, I'm sure Jay can expand on that. But in terms of the Corona virus as context China for IDEXX is a little less than 2.5% of our overall revenues, our overall revenues in China. So we are a relatively smaller exposure to that market. Over half of that revenue is LPD. So in terms of the more consumer-driven aspect of that business, it's a relatively smaller exposure. We have seen limited impact to date. We are monitoring it, of course, and -- but have not factored a specific kind of impact into our outlook at this point. We've got a range for performance, we're comfortable with that. And I think the headline there it's relatively, relatively smaller for IDEXX and it's relatively early on to kind of be calibrating more impacts.I think you had a specific question on the Australia wildfires. We did not see a meaningful impact on that in our results. Again it's something that we're monitoring, but we, we have very good results in Australia, continued good results. And I think we've, the European market we highlighted that we had nearly 20% consumable growth in the fourth quarter, outstanding instrument placements, I think the market and continued solid results in lab. So I think we feel the market backdrop in Europe looks quite healthy. -- Yeah. Thanks. A quick follow-up. I appreciate all the color there. You also cited a lot of investment on the gross margin line. You saw that in this quarter and you mentioned some of that's going to continue through 2020 across the reference lab and the rest of the business. Could you help us think through the pacing there sort of how that progresses over the course of the year. And is that, is this a slight step-up in investment, is it something that's going to be the run rate going forward? Or is this sort of relatively one time that should play out over the course of, you'll see the benefits of this over the course of many quarters. -- Yeah, I don't think there is any investment in our businesses as truly one time. I think we're always adding capability, but what we are trying to highlight was that we had through the second half of 2019, a number of investments that we had advanced in the lab front in terms of our expanding out capacity, adding day labs. We had some system investments that we've been making initial integration of Marshfield, which will continue and obviously some of the investment we made in the commercial organization in the US. And just trying to highlight that that is going to be on a year-over-year basis carrying into the first half of 2020. And there are a couple of discrete factors that will be additive to that, and that's basically our Westbrook headquarters, which is coming online in Q1, so we'll have the depreciation of that starting to factor into our opex growth, and in the second quarter, we will be having the impact of the German Core Lab coming online.So the net of that is -- it wasn't intended to signal incremental investment in the labs other than those discrete areas in the Marshfield acquisition, but just trying to highlight that we anticipate our margin gains that we're targeting for next year will be second half driven. We'll have some moderate pressure in Q1 and basically just as we grow into those investments and we would reinforce our long-term goals of 50 basis points to 100 basis points plus of constant currency annual margin improvement supported by strong recurring revenue growth. So no changes on that front. -- Great. Thanks, Brian. Really appreciate all the color.Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe just a couple more high level one for me. Jay, on the competitive landscape that's evolved or maybe that you expect to evolve, Zoetis has had Abaxis for some time now, and they purchased a couple labs. I know it's early, but -- and you got another player that's also making a bigger push in international markets. So curious for your thoughts and any color or details that you see on calling and a potential evolution from a competitive standpoint? -- Yeah. Good morning, Jon. Thank you. So the -- it's always been a competitive market and it's clearly still a competitive market and we continue to perform very well, as we've highlighted this morning. Our focus is really growing and adding value for our customers. A lot of our volume growth, as Brian highlighted, comes from same-store sales, comes from existing customers, creating awareness and adoption of relevant testing. So from a strategy standpoint, it's really continuing to be able to work with those customers, introduce the innovations, take our commercial capability, expanding commercial capability, partner and help those practices succeed. So that's really the focus. The -- a lot of competitive intensity, but that really hasn't changed and we continue to do well and we continue to experience moderate price increases on the 2% to 3% net basis. So we're feeling good. -- Okay. Great. And there is a few surprises I thought on the P&L, so I'll stick high-level. Jay, your thoughts on and willingness to work with other players in the industry to help drive diagnostics growth. And what I mean by that is, that's something what you want to do, you're working with Trupanion in some shape, way or form in pet insurance but there was chatter at VMX that you're going to partner with Chewy with sort of their Petscriptions platform. And so as leading the company, I'd love to get your thoughts on how you see these opportunities evolving for the company over the next couple of years and IDEXX's willingness to take a more aggressive role there? Thank you. -- Yeah. So we've had ongoing partnerships with the specialty diet and pharma and software companies in the marketplace. The way we tend to think -- I'll address that the software piece and the integration piece specifically. The way we tend to think about that is we take an open systems approach. So if a group of customers once it reaches a certain size of critical mass come to us and say that they would like us to integrate an application into our PIM systems, then we do it. We want to be able to give the customers the workflow that they desire. But in terms of overall partnering at VMX, we participated in a dog park study which showed the efficacy -- the superior efficacy of fecal antigen, so we're always looking for ways in appropriate set of partnership structures of developing the market for diagnostics. -- Okay. Thanks for your time guys.Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks. I had a similar question just given some of the bundling tactics of your competitors. I was curious if you could better leverage your unique positioning in this market as sort of an agnostic player, but also partner with large pharma manufacturers to do your own creative bundling with therapeutics or other product offerings. I guess, have you contemplated those sort of partnerships or collaborations more so recently than you have in the past, I'm just curious how that's evolving? Thanks. -- Yeah. So when we -- the -- when we talk to customers, what the customers tell us is that they, when they're looking at diagnostics and they are looking at what solutions to adopt, they believe that it's highly differentiated, it's a highly differentiated category in their practices. It's a decision that they make through the lens of how to deliver best care. It tends to be separate from how they think about therapeutics or specialty diets. They are making typically long-term decisions because of systems that they're buying that need to be integrated that they may have in their practice five years, 10 years. So from a buying standpoint and partnering decision, the customer really separates those two, so the -- that hasn't changed with the recent acquisition of some of our competitors. -- Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then where do you stand now in terms of market share on your PIMS system? Where are we at across the industry in terms of converting to cloud-based systems, and can you speak to your positioning around the competitive front there as we head into some sort of potential wave of system upgrades as well? Thanks. -- Yeah. So we did -- we've done very well this year in terms of PIMS placements. Cornerstone, we've been able to upgrade more than half of our installed base of Cornerstone with a completely new user interface. We've been able to do this because we have a field-based organization of field service reps who go out and partner with customers. We also our Neo system, which is really more geared toward general practice customers and mobile customers is data cloud base that's received just I think very enthusiastic reception and we've been able to grow that nicely. But the key is, it's not so much in the PIM system per se, it's in the connectivity that we're able to provide with between software and our diagnostics and the applications that work together. So what customers tell us is they appreciate our PIMS systems.But what they really like is they like the fact that it all works better together. So the PIMS and the applications and VetConnect PLUS in the diagnostics and that ability to support their workflow clinically and from a business standpoint and capturing the charges and work that they do is what sets us apart and continues to really provide strong differentiation. -- Okay, thank you.Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James, your line is open. -- Thanks for the question everybody. A lot has been asked, so I'll keep it relatively brief, but just on Marshfield has the integration gone as expected, was there anything that sort of surprised you and I guess from a customer reaction perspective. I think sometimes we view some of the regional players as sometimes viewed as an alternative to the larger options that are out there in the market. So, has there been any push back from customers. And then from a margin perspective, the gross margin, I think in 4Q was maybe a little lighter than we had expected. So what's the opportunity to kind of on Marshfield and in general, how much maybe did mix impact of the quarter, but on Marshfield specifically to capture synergies and get kind of that incremental revenue up to a similar to your consolidated lab margins or kind of how you view that in terms of the extra capacity that you've added with the acquisition. So, any color there would be great. And I appreciate the feedback. -- Great yeah, so the Marshfield -- the Marshfield integration is on track. We're excited by Marshfield, it really, we welcomed over 2000 customers from Marshfield and they now have access to IDEXX's differentiated tests like SDMA and fecal antigen and VetConnectPLUS. And the initial reception has been enthusiastic from those customers, we -- keep in mind that a good number of those customers were IDEXX customers already. They used one of our modalities, they may have used our software systems. So it's not like they didn't know us. This just gives us such a chance to work more closely with them and to provide reference lab services. I'll turn it to Brian. Brian like to make a remark on margin and what we see there. -- Yeah. As expected, we as -- we're working to integrate, Marshfield, there is -- there were some impacts from that and that we did highlight that as a one of the factors and that will continue into the first half where we have work going on, on that front. But look over time I think we've demonstrated and we're confident that the addition of customers into our national lab network and supporting them through our over 50 labs now in the US, which is how we think about this business is a national business is something that we would anticipate in getting leverage from and is supporting the longer-term goals that we have for margin improvement from our reference lab network. So it was a near-term factor, will be a near-term factor to a degree, and we'll get leverage in that over time, it will support our margin improvement going forward. -- Thanks. I'll leave it there.Thank you. And we'll take one final question. -- Yes, this will be the last question. Thank you.Thank you. That will be from the line of David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question. So some of the feedback from veterinarians on the cytology instrument has started the conversation in oncology, so I apologize, I'm going to kind of ask a industry kind of wide question here, but does this, how do you see the oncology market kind of playing out in the next say, three to five years. Is there opportunities here in diagnostics in the reference lab, is there opportunities in therapeutics kind of the way we have in the human market with say cancer profiling or early detection of cancer. Just if you can give me kind of a broad overview of that and maybe just cytology kind of start that conversation? -- Yeah, so the oncology services is something that exists in the marketplace today. It's centered more around specialty practices and there's lots of different areas in oncology just like there are on human side in terms of both drugs, therapeutics and LINAC systems and chemotherapy. So that's a, it's a very broad question with lots of different areas from a diagnostic standpoint, it's something we're always taking a look at, around genomics and proteomics and being able to detect cancer earlier.Certainly, Digital Cytology in many instances, you're looking for cancer. So it does begin that discussion when a patient comes in with lumps and bumps and wants to know whether or not that their pet is OK. Okay. And so with that, thank you. With that, we'll conclude the call. I want to thank our employees for the very strong progress and performance in Q4, for the full year of 2019 and for the advancement of our purpose, which is enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock around the world.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.\u00a0After all, the newsletter they\u00a0have run for over a decade,\u00a0, has tripled the market.*\u00a0Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now.

Instead, they want to beat it by buying into . While picking out individual stocks or specific industries is clearly riskier than simply buying an index fund, I have one oft-overlooked industry that looks to be the closest thing to a no-brainer investment trend that you'll want to be a part of.Ladies and gentlemen, behold the \"paw-tential\" of the pet industry.Image source: Getty Images.Think about this for a moment: When the American Pet Products Association (APPA) first conducted its annual survey of pet ownership, 56% of households owned a pet. As of 2019-2020, the APPA's National Pet Owner Survey found that 67% of households (nearly 85 million homes) now owns a pet. This includes more than 63 million dogs, nearly 43 million cats, 11.5 million fish, close to 6 million birds, and millions of other reptiles and small animals.Not only is this a numbers game that's shown no signs of slowing, but there's been an ongoing shift in thought as to how Americans view their four-legged friends. Back in 2007, Harris conducted a poll that found 88% of pet owners consider their pets as part of the family. But a more recent poll from Harris, conducted in 2016, found that 95% of pet owners consider their furry friends as family. With this emotional attachment building among American households, it's  to spend money on the health, happiness, and well-being of four-legged, winged, and gilled family members.\u00a0According to estimates from the APPA, $75.4 billion was to be spent in the U.S. alone on pets in 2019. This includes $31.7 billion on food, $19 billion on veterinary care, and another $16.4 billion on supplies and over-the-counter products. At no point over the past 25 years has there been a year-over-year decline in U.S. pet industry expenditures.\u00a0I'm going to go ahead and repeat this last point with some added emphasis. Despite the dot-com bubble bursting in the early 2000s, and the steepest recession in 70 years hitting the U.S. a little more than a decade ago, U.S. pet expenditures have gone up .Improved emotional attachment, rising pet ownership statistics, and a 25-year (and counting) streak of increasing U.S. pet industry sales is what makes this the no-brainer investment you'll want to be a part of.Image source: Getty Images.The big question, of course, is where to get started? Here are three pet-focused stocks that cover some of the fastest-growing trends in this industry.I'll begin with perhaps the : insurance. That's where   comes into play.According to Trupanion, only between 1% and 2% of all companion pets in the U.S. and Canadian markets are currently insured, presenting an incredibly long runway opportunity to become the go-to source for pet insurance. The company ended September with almost 614,000 enrolled pets, of which more than 479,000 were part of its subscription enrollees. This subscription service should prove to be Trupanion's bread and butter given that it's highly predictable and unlikely to see much, if any, customer churn.Trupanion also happens to be on the cusp of recurring profitability. Following a $0.02-per-share profit in Q3 2019, it's clear that this business model works. As long as Trupanion can continue to take advantage of its veterinary-level partnerships (most pet owners learn about insurance while at their local vet office), thereby keeping its marketing costs in check, and enrolls pets at a double-digit rate, .\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Another huge opportunity can be found in what we feed our companion pets. Remember, more than half of all pet expenditures in 2019 was derived from food, supplies, and over-the-counter products. This is why   should be a stock .Just as people have opted for fresher, organic, or natural food options for their diets in recent years, we've begun to see a distinct push for better food options for our furry friends. Freshpet prides itself on providing pet foods and treats with natural ingredients. In fact, Freshpet foods typically require refrigeration, speaking to the freshness and ingredients used.In the company's most recent quarter, Freshpet managed net sales growth of 28.5%, with adjusted EBITDA of $12 million, an increase of 78.5% from the prior-year period. In commenting on its , the release notes that it was \"driven by velocity, innovation, and distribution gains.\" In other words, product is flying off the shelf faster, consumers are responding well to new product offerings, and Freshpet has found its way into a larger number of retail doors. This looks to be a recipe for long-term success.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Last, but not least, consider a leading diagnostics and information-technology provider in the pet care space,  .As noted, around $17 billion was spent on veterinary care last year alone; and it's a figure that's liable to increase every single year going forward, much like healthcare costs associated with people. That's what makes IDEXX, a provider of diagnostic equipment for veterinary offices, a long-term winner.The secrets to IDEXX's success are twofold. First, its business is , which leads to higher operating margins over time. While IDEXX does generate revenue by selling its numerous diagnostic systems, a good chunk of its margins over the long haul will derive from selling testing strips and other supplies that are used frequently with its diagnostic systems. Thus, as its base of in-use systems grows, so should its percentage of high-margin revenue.Secondly, IDEXX is able to provide a full suite of solutions through its supportive software. Being able to integrate its diagnostics with its software creates a seamless ecosystem that expedites decision-making in the vet's office. Though IDEXX's stock isn't cheap, a  isn't out of the question.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Organic (non-) revenue and adjusted earnings per share increased by 12% and 21%, respectively, on a constant currency basis. EPS of $1.24 beat analyst estimates by $0.10 per share.Investors probably didn't like that management lowered their adjusted earnings outlook. However, management blamed the revised guidance on the negative impact of $0.18 in \"charges associated with CEO transition in the fourth quarter.\"Nonetheless, IDEXX appears to be performing well. In the earnings press release, CEO Jay Mazelsky said, \"IDEXX delivered outstanding operating results in the third quarter, supported by continued strong growth in CAG [Companion Animal Group] Diagnostics recurring revenues.\"It may take investors a while to reset expectations, but IDEXX should continue growing. Early 2020 guidance calls for revenue growth between 9% and 10.5% (over 2019). Adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase between 17% and 20% next year.IDEXX's stock currently has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 51. While its shares generally trade at a high valuation, , even by IDEXX's standards. Supporting the high valuation is management's belief that the business has a long growth runway, as it seeks to win the business of millennials, who are more willing to take their pets to the vet than previous generations.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As we\u2019ve noted in this space before, the rally of the last few months has been strangely quiet.\tIndeed, the 0.78% gain in the  was the second-largest daily rally of the last six weeks. The index still has gained nearly 5% over that stretch. This simply has not been a bull market full of irrational exuberance, or anything close. Rather, U.S. stocks have marched steadily higher at a relatively modest pace.With five weeks left in the year, the hope is that Monday\u2019s bigger rally is the first step in  that will drove more gains heading into 2020. If that\u2019s the case, Tuesday\u2019s three big stock charts highlight potential opportunities. None of the three stocks are necessarily cheap, but all have a chance to gain if sentiment strengthens. The one catch might be that these big stock charts show real risk if broad market strength doesn\u2019t materialize.\tThe first of Tuesday\u2019s big stock charts,  (NASDAQ:), actually looks a bit dicey at the moment. There\u2019s little argument about the strength of Costco as a business, but recent trading suggests some concern about valuation near $300:\tLike Costco,  (NASDAQ:) has been a long-term outperformer. Shares have gained 890% over the past decade and have more than tripled since the beginning of 2016. But like COST, the second of Tuesday\u2019s big stock charts shows some weakness and the fundamental aspects of the case suggest caution:\tLike COST and IDXX,  (NASDAQ:) seemed bulletproof for years. At July highs, ULTA stock had more than tripled in five years. But  in late August sent shares plunging 30%, and the third of Tuesday\u2019s big stock charts doesn\u2019t yet suggest a rebound:As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["\"Dog is a man's best friend,\" is more than a playful expression, as it turns out.\u00a0According to a survey conducted by Mercure Hotels, a dog-friendly lodging company, more than half (53%) of dog and companion pet owners admit they enjoy the company of their pet more than that of their human best friends.Our love for companion animals shows up in our bank statements too. U.S. pet owners are expected to spend a record $75 billion on their pets this year, including $19 billion on veterinary care alone, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0the American Pet Products Association.\u00a0image source: getty imagesIn other words, like family members, our pets are non-negotiable. Consider\u00a0spending for a dog or cat a fixed monthly bill, like you would rent or a mortgage. Pet owners willingly eat ludicrous costs for great pet care even if they're in the midst of financial hardships., a diversified pet healthcare company and the industry leader in diagnostics for companion animals, is arguably better positioned than anyone to capitalize on those of us who make Instagram accounts for our pets.\u00a0IDEXX sells the table-top diagnostic machines to vets for a one-time fee and then sells the testing kits on a per-use basis (think \"\" model).\u00a0One of the company's most popular products, Catalyst One, screens blood samples from dogs and cats for up to 33 diseases in as little as eight minutes. It's a time saver for vets and, potentially, a lifesaver for pets.The company boosted its earnings per share (EPS) to $1.24 for the  of the 2019 fiscal year, a 21% year-over-year increase when accounting for foreign currency movements. Revenue also climbed 12% on an organic basis from the previous year.\u00a0IDEXX's growth has consistently outpaced that of the pet care industry.\u00a0But there's plenty more to like about this healthcare juggernaut.A \"\" -- or a company's ability to maintain competitive advantages and safeguard its long-term profits and market share -- matters more than the near-term flow of news, a company's growth outlook, and any of the other factors that jostle a company's daily stock price. It's perhaps the single most important determinant of future profits.IDEXX isn't just coasting on the moat it's dug out. It's actively working to widen it with aggressive research and development efforts. In fact, the company estimates that its research budget represents a staggering 80% of all global R&D that goes into companion animal diagnostics.\u00a0And it's paying off. IDEXX's equipment and software are truly state-of-the art. For example, the VetConnect Plus service sends results from say, a blood or urinalysis test, straight to a vet's mobile phone as soon as they're ready, shortening the agonizing time frame between the test and result for pet owners.\u00a0But pet owners aren't the only ones who appreciate the commitment to improved care. According to the Brakke Veterinary Technical Services Survey, vet practices believe IDEXX offers the best overall technical service to its customers, placing it above competitors in the \u00a0including\u00a0  and  .\u00a0More vet practices said they were more likely to recommend IDEXX's products than those of any other pet diagnostic company.When it comes to point-of-care (POC) diagnostic instruments, the company claims up to a 99% customer retention rate.\u00a0It's this type of loyalty IDEXX has established with both vet practices and animal lovers that seems to only further solidify its dominant market position. In fact, the company's been so effective at wrestling away market share it's been called out for exercising monopoly power.\u00a0In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission flagged IDEXX for unfair trade practices claiming the company was shutting out its competitors by locking in exclusive distribution agreements. IDEXX eventually agreed to a settlement that prohibited concurrent exclusive distribution arrangements with three national distributors of POC diagnostic testing products. Some analysts expected IDEXX to subsequently lose substantial market share.Only, that didn't happen.\u00a0Since that settlement, the stock's jumped more than 450%.Today, IDEXX is still the global leader in its industry, with an estimated 60% of the market share for veterinary diagnostics tests and instruments. Zoetis holds the second-place spot with about 30% share, and Heska carries no more than 9% of the market.When assessing the value of a company like IDEXX, sometimes a quick glance at a few valuation metrics alone can be a bit misleading, especially if investor enthusiasm is at or near an all-time high.\u00a0That's why we dig a little deeper.The company's 53.90  is markedly higher than the \"medical-instruments\" industry average P/E of 31.06. So yes, on paper, based on this single metric, the stock is overvalued.\u00a0So is IDEXX an exceptional company at a bad price?Well, given its strong earnings history of 16% per year over the last decade, what it really means is shareholders believe IDEXX will continue to outperform the companies in its industry.If there's a cause for concern, it's the company's net debt position. It's generally better to seek out companies that hold net cash positions, which they're expanding, so they can use that cash to reinvest in their business and increase margins and profitability -- and ultimately, shareholder value.However, a closer look at IDEXX actually reveals the company's maintained a strong balance sheet with leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA of 1.39 times gross and 1.24 times net of cash at the end of the quarter.We don't know when the company will move from responsible debt management to, well, debt-free (the company's long-term debt of $760 million has grown more than 25% just since the end of 2018).\u00a0But here's what we know right now: Pets are an integral part of the American family more than ever, and IDEXX's innovative spirit in tandem with its core market dominance, make this industry leader a smart addition to any growth-oriented portfolio.\u00a0With new CEO Jonathan Mazelsky in tow, this top dog's still got ample runway ahead, both domestically and overseas.\u00a0Get a piece of this company, because if you've got a pet in the house, chances are, sooner or later it'll get a piece of you.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While it's important to note that most economists are not forecasting a recession, investors may still want to position themselves for one, or at least increase the weight of defensive stocks in their portfolios. In this context, here are three investment themes and stocks to prepare for a recessionary scenario.Image source: Getty ImagesFirst, let's consider a few types of businesses, and the attributes that position them to outperform in a recession.Now, let's review some of the details behind these assertions.You'd be hard-pressed to find many groups of stocks that grew both revenue and earnings through the last recession, but that's exactly what the auto parts retailers did, as the chart below shows. Trailing 12-month (TTM) revenue and earnings rose in the 2007-2011 period and it's no coincidence that U.S. light-vehicle sales declined over the period. Simply put, declining sales of new cars mean more miles driven by older cars -- which is music to the ears of those whose business it is to keep those vehicles on the road. data by Indeed, a similar pattern has been occurring in recent years, as first a slowdown and then an actual decline in light vehicle sales has been accompanied by sales growth for the auto parts retailers. data by When the next recession occurs, it's a safe bet that automobile sales will decline further, and auto parts retailers will benefit accordingly. The pick of the bunch is probably O'Reilly Automotive. Its relatively high exposure to the \"Do It For Me\" (DIFM) market (around 43% of total sales) means it's less exposed to threats from online competition. Professionals in the DIFM segment usually require their parts immediately, and will buy in-store if they can, as opposed to the Do It Yourself (DIY) crowd, who may have more time flexibility and willingness to wait for an e-tailer's delivery.During the last recession, Zoetis was still the animal healthcare segment of pharmaceutical giant  . It has since spun off publicly, but to get an idea of how it might do as a stand-alone business in a downturn, let's focus on how it performed when it was part of Pfizer.The picture is complicated further by Pfizer's merger with Wyeth (which added animal health solutions) in 2009, so I've used the figures for the legacy Pfizer animal health operations. Its flat growth in 2009 was a fairly commendable performance in a year when U.S. GDP shrank by 2.5%.Data source: Pfizer presentations.After a near 42% stock price rise so far in 2019, Zoetis now trades at 30 times its estimated 2020 EPS of $3.98 -- hardly a superficially cheap stock. There's little doubt it's been bid up by the market in part for its recession-resilient qualities. That said, if you are worried about a protracted slowdown in the economy, Zoetis is probably a good place to park some of your money.Ball Corp. is arguably the most interesting investment opportunity in this batch. It currently derives around 90% of its earnings from beverage packaging -- the rest comes from its aerospace operations. And here too, the evidence from the last recession suggests that Ball has the ability to grow its earnings during a downturn.One reason for that is that the consumption of canned beverages -- and thus, demand for Ball's products -- isn't particularly tied to the cyclical behavior of the economy.\u00a0In addition, its costs are heavily exposed to the\u00a0prices of raw materials, principally aluminum. If a protracted recession causes a slump in demand for aluminum then the decline in\u00a0Ball's cost of sales due to lower aluminum prices could more than compensate for any revenue lost, even as it passed through those some of those lower prices to its customers.A good example comes from 2009, in the heart of the Great Recession.Beverage can packaging sales volumes in the Americas and Asia were up 2%, but sales revenues were down 3% \"primarily as a result of the impact of lower aluminum prices\" according to SEC filings. However, Ball's overall cost of sales fell in 2009, more than compensating for any lost revenue -- as shown by the fact that earnings grew in 2009 and 2010.Data source: Company presentations.Fast-forward to today. The company has divested itself of its more-cyclical food and aerosol container packaging businesses, and is in the middle of ramping up capacity to meet the demand growth generated by the trends toward preferring aluminum packaging to plastic. Consequently, CEO John Hayes said he now believes long-term unit volume growth is more likely to be 4%\u00a0annually, rather than the previously forecast 2%.Ball has already proven it can grow earnings in a recession. With its enhanced growth prospects in place, it could do so again.\u00a0\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This close attachment to our pets is precisely what   is banking on.Image source: Getty Images.IDEXX develops and manufactures products and services for companion animal and livestock veterinary, as well as for water quality testing. Think of it as the for animals.IDEXX estimates the global companion animal diagnostics market at $33 billion, but only 11% of that is penetrated today. With nearly 90% of the market underserved, the opportunity for any company is vast. Based on the past five years' rate of growth, IDEXX estimates that global companion animal diagnostics could expand roughly 8% per year for the next 25 years and still not fully penetrate the available market.As one of the market leaders, IDEXX serves approximately 5% of the available market. Competitors range from large companies like Antech Diagnostics (a division of Mars Inc), , and to many smaller ones. But with a large underserved population, market share is up for grabs.IDEXX feels the love we have for our pets \u2014 87% of its revenue is generated by its companion animal diagnostics segment, with nearly two-thirds of that coming from the U.S. It grew 11.9% in 2017 and 13.6% in 2018, and management forecasts growth will be 9% to 13% each year for the next five years. Margins have also been rising: Gross margins improved 14% annually for the past three years, and operating margins expanded more rapidly\u2014between 18% and 21% each year.The animal diagnostic industry is not unlike the human one: Market leaders need to have innovation prowess, a robust distribution model, and an integrated IT platform. IDEXX delivers on all fronts, from its newly developed diagnostic testing instruments to the breadth of its software offerings, including electronic health records. In addition, its direct distribution model allows the company to forge close relationships with its customers and keep retention high. Part of that retention stems from having innovative instrumentation. In 2018, IDEXX spent between 5% and 6% of its annual revenue on research and development.But unlike the human diagnostic market, the companion animal one has a distinct advantage: Veterinarians, for the most part, do not have to deal with insurance companies. U.S. healthcare's convoluted structure, in which consumers receive care but insurance companies pay for the services, means that diagnostic companies, like providers, are forced to negotiate prices with the payers. In its second-quarter , for instance, Quest Diagnostics attributed part of its lower earnings to Medicare pricing pressure; blamed contract changes and the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act for its lower margins. These headwinds do not exist in the animal health industry. Therefore, veterinarians can perform tests they deem necessary without a choke hold from an outside force. However, because of the high out-of-pocket costs, some pet owners may be unwilling or unable to pay for expensive tests, lowering the actual available market opportunity.Like other diagnostic players, IDEXX uses a razor-and-blades business model. Once a testing instrument is sold and installed -- sometimes at a minimal profit \u2014 the company has a recurring sales stream from single-use consumables, like testing strips, that are necessary to operate the instrument. This revenue is highly profitable and accounts for nearly 90% of IDEXX's total company sales. The launch of its SediVue Dx instrument in 2016 exemplifies the benefits of the model. The installed base grew from 1,500 units in the first year to nearly 6,600 two years later. During that time, segment revenue grew 27%, while gross profits rose 30%. This example illustrates the connection between installed instrumentation, revenue growth, and margin expansion (although this one installed instrument was not the only reason for the growth). IDEXX's recurring revenue grew over 13% last year. As its installed base expands, sales should increase at an even faster rate.IDEXX serves almost half of the penetrated companion animal diagnostics market today, putting it in a leadership position. The market has recognized this: Its stock is up 33% this year. But the stock is not cheap. Trading at a 2020 price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 48 times, it is more expensive than competitor Zoetis, but less than Heska. However, when considering its growth rate, IDEXX's P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 2.8 times is more desirable than Zoetis' or Heska's. But its free cash flow (FCF) yield is lower: 1.1% compared to 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Although the company has shown balance sheet discipline recently, using its cash to pay down debt, its long-term debt-to-total assets was still high in 2018, at roughly 39%. At the same time, its current ratio, while above the 1.0 threshold that signals short-term liquidity is intact, is only 1.15.\u00a0The expanding market and IDEXX's growth expectations point to an attractive investment opportunity, but it may not be for everyone: Its expensive multiple, low FCF, and debt load suggest that risk is elevated, and a more desirable entry point may be worth the wait.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 14% organically, including nearly 2% of equivalent day growth rate benefit, reflecting double-digit gains across US and international markets.EPS of $1.24 per share increased 21% on a comparable constant currency basis, that is benefiting from better than expected organic revenue growth, which supported a 130 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins. Excellent operating results are keeping us on track toward strong full year financial performance. In terms of our 2019 revenue outlook, we're refining our full-year guidance to $2.395 billion to $2.405 billion, a $5 million increase at mid-point incorporating our strong Q3 performance.This reflects an updated full-year organic growth outlook of 10% to 10.5% overall and 11.5% to 12% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, both at the higher end of our previous guidance range. We're adjusting our 2019 EPS guidance to $4.72 to $4.78 or 15% to 16% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. This is $0.12 per share lower than our prior guidance midpoint incorporating $0.18 per share in projected Q4 charges related to our recently announced CEO transition.Adjusting for this impact, our outlook is $0.06 per share higher at mid-point, incorporating benefits from a very strong third quarter operating performance and lower projections for full year net interest costs. In terms of our preliminary 2020 outlook, we're projecting revenue of $2.610 billion to $2.650 billion, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9% to 10.5%, supported by sustained high growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.Our 2020 EPS outlook is $5.30 to $5.46 per share, or comparable constant currency EPS growth of 17% to 20%. As we'll discuss, our 2020 EPS outlook incorporates $0.11 per share on projected headwinds from year-over-year FX impacts and expectations for approximately $0.12 per share and reduced tax benefits from share based compensation activity.Let's begin with a review of our Q3 revenue growth performance by segment. Excellent third quarter revenue growth results were driven by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting 14% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, including nearly 2% growth benefit from equivalent days in the quarter.By region, US CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13% organically, including nearly 2% of growth rate benefit from equivalent days, reflecting continued strong gains in consumables and reference labs. US CAG Recurring Diagnostic growth remains primarily volume driven, with net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range. We also maintained consistent exceptionally high levels of customer retention across modalities.IDEXX US CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth continues to outpace broader market trends, which improved in the quarter. In Q3, total visits per practice growth was 1.4% year-on-year with clinical visits for practice growing at 2.7%, and overall revenue per practice increasing 5.3%, reflecting continued solid growth trends in the US Companion Animal healthcare market.International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 16% organically in Q3, including approximately 1.5% of equivalent day growth benefit. International consumable revenue gains normalized for approximately 2.5% of benefits from equivalent days sustained at approximately 20% and international organic revenue reference lab growth improved to high-single digit rates.Globally, reference lab and consulting service revenues grew 12% organically in Q3 supported by consistent low-to-mid-teen volume driven gains in the US. Robust US lab growth continues to be driven by strong same-store sales growth at IDEXX customers, augmented by net customer acquisition benefits and moderate net price gains. As Jay will discuss in October, we closed on the acquisition of Marshfield Laboratories, a national service provider based in Wisconsin, adding to our US market capabilities.Global consumable revenues increased 18% organically in Q3, including nearly 3% of equivalent day growth benefits. These results reflected strong growth across US and international markets, driven by increases in diagnostic test utilization and expansion of our installed instrument base. We had an outstanding quarter in terms of high quality instrument placements, supporting double-digit year-on-year growth in our economic value index or EVI.Overall premium instrument placements increased 14% year-on-year, driven by 18% year-on-year growth in catalyst placements which supported an 18% year-on-year increase in our global catalyst installed base. Globally, we placed 1,898 catalysts in the quarter with 360 at new and competitive accounts in North America and 910 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also achieved 965 premium hematology placements globally, up 18%, and 589 SediVue placements, in line with strong prior-year levels. Please note that we've expanded the data shared in our quarterly earnings snapshot available on our Investor Relations website to include premium instrument placements by category and region, as well as quarterly tracking of our global premium installed base.Rapid assay revenues grew 10% organically in Q3, including nearly 3% of equivalent day growth benefits, reflecting continued expansion of 4Dx Plus, Specialty, SNAP fee line and first-generation products. Growth and the high customer retention in our rapid assay business continues to benefit from expansion of our engaged SNAP Pro installed base, supported by an additional 2,683 SNAP Pro placements globally in Q3, bringing our global installed base to over 34,000. Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 6% organically in Q3, driven by continued strong gains in VSS recurring service revenues. Overall segment revenue gains were constrained in Q3 by comparisons to very strong prior-year digital system placement levels.In terms of our other business segment performance in the quarter, Water business revenues grew 7% organically, supported by continued solid growth across US and international markets. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased nearly 10% organically. Third quarter results were driven by strong year-on-year gains in Asia-Pacific markets, which benefited from a favorable prior year comparison. The prolonged outbreak of African swine fever continues to negatively impact the swine population in China. However, demand for new diagnostic testing programs and increased diagnostic testing for alternative poultry food sources offset lower recurring swine testing volume levels in Q3. Health herd screening levels, well down from strong prior-year levels, were also relatively higher than expected in the quarter.Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q3 increased 19% as reported and on a constant currency basis, driven by solid profit gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments. Operating margins increased 130 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage on high revenue growth. Gross profit increased 13% as reported or 14% on a constant currency basis in Q3. Gross margins increased 60 basis points on a constant currency basis, supported by mix benefits from strong consumable revenue growth, lab productivity gains and moderate net price increases. Foreign exchange hedge gains which are reflected in gross profit were approximately $3 million in Q3 and approximately $7 million year-to-date.Operating expenses in Q3 increased 9% as reported and 10% on a constant currency basis, resulting in 70 basis points of constant currency operating margin leverage. Operating expense increases were driven by growth in R&D spending, and increased costs related to our expanded global CAG commercial capability.EPS in Q3 was $1.24 per share, including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity, which was approximately $0.03 per share higher than projected. On a comparable constant currency basis EPS increased 21%. Foreign exchange net of favorable year-on-year hedge impacts had an immaterial impact on operating profit and EPS in the quarter.Year-to-date free cash flow for the third quarter was $195 million. We continue to expect free cash flow of 60% to 65% of net income for 2019. This reflects a consistent outlook for full year capital spending of $160 million to $175 million, including approximately $70 million of combined incremental spending related to our Westbrook Maine headquarter expansion and our German Core Lab relocation.Our strong cash flow generation supported the allocation of $91 million in capital toward the repurchase of 330,000 shares in the quarter. We've maintained a strong balance sheet with leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA of 1.39 times gross and 1.24 times net of cash at the end of the quarter. We continue to maintain 2019 full-year outlook for a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at similar multiples of EBITDA.We now project annual net interest expense of $31.5 million, an improvement of $2.5 million compared to our previous guidance. In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2019, as noted we're refining our full year reported revenue guidance to $2.395 billion to $2.405 billion, reflecting an organic growth outlook of 10% to 10.5% and CAG Recurring Diagnostic organic revenue growth of 11.5% to 12% both at the higher end of our prior guidance range.At midpoint, this reflects a $5 million reported revenue increase, factoring in our strong third quarter performance. In this updated outlook, modest projected benefits from our recently completed US Lab acquisition are offset by refined projections for FX impacts. For the full year we now expect a 2% headwind from FX on revenue growth. In terms of EPS, we are lowering our 2019 full year guidance by $0.12 per share at mid-point to $4.72 to $4.78 per share, incorporating $0.18 of the impact related to the CEO transition.This results in comparable constant currency growth of 15% to 16% for 2019, including approximately 4% of growth impact related to projected Q4 transition charges. Costs related to the separation agreement will lower full year 2019 operating profit by an estimated $13.4 million and year-on-year operating margin improvement by approximately 55 basis points. Incorporating this impact, our updated outlook is for 55 basis points to 70 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement or 110 basis points to 125 basis points of improvement excluding the Q4 transition charge impact, which is consistent with the higher end of our prior guidance range.Our full year operating margin outlook includes expectations for higher levels of year-on-year operating expense growth in Q4, including FX from the advancement of an additional expansion of our US commercial field resources, which Jay will discuss in his comments. Strong full-year operating margin performance excluding transition charge impacts and benefits from lower projected interest costs yield approximately $0.06 per share in full-year operational EPS benefit compared to previous guidance.Our updated EPS guidance assumes of 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 20%, including approximately 1% of impact related to CEO transition costs. This tax rate also includes an updated estimate of $15 million or approximately 3% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of share based compensation, netting approximately $0.02 of upside compared to previous guidance. At the midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about 17% per share in full year share based compensation tax benefit.Operational and share based compensation tax benefit upsize are mitigated by $0.02 per share of negative impact related to the strengthening of the US dollar since our last conference call. Our 2019 EPS guidance now assumes $0.06 in negative full-year impact related to FX charges net of hedge impacts and for the full year 2019 we're projecting hedge gains of $11.5 million. As we look out at 2020, we're targeting continued strong revenue and profit growth consistent with our long-term goals. Our preliminary revenue outlook is $2.610 billion to $2.650 billion, reflecting expectations for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue gains, supported by a sustained high growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.Our guidance reflects expectations for overall reported revenue growth of 9% to 10.5% with an estimated 0.5% foreign exchange headwind related to the recent strengthening of the US dollar, offset by year-on-year benefits from completed 2019 acquisitions. Our preliminary 2020 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.46 per share incorporates expectations for operating margin improvement of 100 basis points to 150 basis points on a constant currency basis, including approximately 50 basis points of year-on-year improvement related to lapping the Q4 2019 charges related to the CEO transition.As rates assumed in our press release, we estimate FX will decrease reported operating margins very approximately 30 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.11 per share, net of established hedge positions, which we estimate will result in $6 million of net pre-tax gains in 2020. Our projected 2020 effective tax rate is 21% to 22%. This outlook assumes $3 million to $5 million or approximately $0.05 per share in share-based compensation tax benefits, assuming our current share price. Note that our projections for share based compensation tax benefits incorporates timing of future option expirations.As IDEXX transitioned from 7-year to 10-year option lives in 2013, this has the effect of lowering the level of options scheduled to expire in 2020, contributing to a $0.12 reduce projected tax benefit in 2020 compared to 2019. For 2020, we are projecting a 1% reduction in shares outstanding related to share repurchases at assumed consistent net leverage ratios and net interest expense next year of $36 million. Adjusting for changes in currency and share-based compensation tax benefits, this 2020 EPS outlook equates to a projected 17% to 20% comparable constant currency growth rate. We look forward to providing an update and more detail review of our 2020 guidance in our year-end conference call.That concludes our financial review, I'll now turn the discussion over to Jay. -- Good morning, and thank you Brian. IDEXX's third quarter results reflected solid growth across our Companion Animal, Livestock and Water Diagnostic businesses. An outstanding achievement by our IDEXX team globally. High growth in CAG Diagnostic revenues continues to lead our performance with attractive flow through benefits the profit, keeping us on track to deliver strong full-year operating results.Excellent commercial execution is a key theme in our continued growth momentum and enhancing capability in this area consistently delivers a high return on investment. In our US CAG business, we benefit from the increased IDEXX engagement with customers in an under-developed diagnostics market with solid growth momentum, as evidenced by the 2.7% growth in same-store clinical visits seen in the quarter.Our US commercial team remains highly productive, delivering 13% CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth in the US, including approximately 2% benefit from equivalent business days. Execution was excellent across the board, resulting in both impressive revenue gains from all modalities and sustained high customer retention rates. Increased customer engagement is helping to drive sustained low-to-mid teens organic growth in reference labs, led by same-store testing expansion and double-digit organic gains and consumable revenues supported by our expanding premium instrument installed base.Instrument placements were excellent in the quarter, led by 14% year-on-year growth in the US new and competitive Catalysts placements. This supported a 10% year-on-year expansion of our US Catalyst installed base and double-digit growth in US EVI. SNAP Pro placements were also robust in Q3 with over 2,200 placed in the US, up 77% year-over-year. SNAP Pro brings significant workflow, electronic medical record and charge capture benefits. The complement are differentiated rapid assay point of care diagnostics. Importantly, customers who are connected to SNAP Pro are highly engaged and stay with us longer.Our US commercial team continues to make excellent progress in advancing our Preventive Care Initiative. In Q3 we enrolled 330 new practices, bringing our total enrollees since program launched to nearly 3,500, almost two-thirds of our VDCs has had at least one new customer enrollee in the quarter. As discussed at Investor Day, a key commercial goal is to inspire customers, increase the use of medically relevant blood work in clinical visits, when we consider blood work as a representative proxy for diagnostics utilization. It was included in only about 8% of critical wellness visits in 2018.The increased rate of diagnostics testing with blood work in practices post enrollment in our Preventive Care program is notable, specifically if we take our 2017 Preventive Care enrollees who have now been in a program for over a year, the average annual increase in the percentage of wellness that include blood work is approximately 1% per year since 2016. This compares to approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points of annual increase for non-enrollees. These convincing early success indicators reinforce the 1% to 2% contribution, the annual CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth potential we see from this initiative.Our strong growth in the US demonstrates Diagnostics as a category continues to grow in importance and relevance to the veterinary profession. Our customers are turn asking our category experts to spend more time partnering with them. The combination of increasing customer engagement and key growth initiatives like IDEXX Preventive Care, strong operating results and commercial momentum, and a healthy product pipeline gives us confidence to once again expand our commercial presence in the US. We are already under way with an 8% expansion in our US field based professionals, which we expect to be largely in place by the beginning of Q1 2020.As with our past field expansions, these are thoughtfully planned and supported by detailed regional analytical modeling that considers a number of factors, including territory size and specific geographic differences such as traffic patterns and population growth. The most important factor is the market opportunity as calculated by our ability to grow our installed base, expand diagnostic testing and expand category share across in-clinic and reference lab modalities. While we've said this before, it bears repeating the data continues to prove out that the more time we spend with customers, the more they grow with IDEXX. This expansion will bring us to an estimated 530 field based professionals in the US, up from 490 at the end of 2018. We're very excited by the opportunity this expansion affords us heading into 2020.The category of diagnostics is increasing in importance on a global basis as well. And as a result, we're seeing the benefits from our recently completed CAG commercial expansion in international markets. We saw 16% international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth in Q3, including approximately a 1.5 equivalent business days growth benefit. These gains were again led by international consumables growth of approximately 20% organically. Normalized for equivalent business days and supported by continued expansion of our Catalyst installed base, which increased 26% year-over-year.Our international reference lab showed improvement year-over-year, high single-digit growth, benefiting from the completed commercial expansion, strong commercial execution, as well as focus on customer service and IDEXX 360 programs that are increasingly multi-modal in character. The IDEXX 360 program is gaining traction with our international customers, supporting excellent instrument placements and double-digit growth in EVI, benefiting from a 28% year-on-year increase in placements of new and competitive accounts internationally.In addition to excellent commercial execution, the ongoing adoption and expansion of IDEXX differentiators, one of our industry leading investments in innovation is a second key theme supporting our strong growth performance. Our strong reference lab growth in markets like the US, for example, continues to be supported by high growth in parasitology, driven by growing adoption of our proprietary fecal antigen test. In the US, approximately 60% of parasitology panels run at our Reference Lab included Fecal Dx antigen in the third quarter, up from approximately 50% in Q3, 2018.Our performance leading 4Dx Plus franchise also continues to expand. In the US, in addition to sustained solid growth in clinic, we're seeing high levels of incremental growth in 4Dx Plus testing in our reference labs, following engagement with our Preventive Care programs. As we've highlighted in the past, only approximately 36% of dogs in the US receive a vector borne disease test of some kind, while only approximately 15% of dogs in the US receive a full vector borne multi analyte test. This expansion of 4Dx Plus usage is a very encouraging sign with additional long-term benefits for vector borne disease testing.We also continue to make excellent progress advancing SDMA as an essential element of the chemistry panel, which our reference lab customers have benefited from since 2015, now launched to our Catalyst installed base in early 2018. We now have over 70% of Catalyst customers globally who have purchased Catalyst SDMA while almost 60% have used it. This has translated into a total of $2.9 million runs since it's introduction on a slide.We're also very excited about the new SDMA based chronic kidney disease staging guidelines that were issued in September by the International Renal Interest Society. This is an expert panel of internationally renowned nephrologist, who establish evidence based clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. The full incorporation of SDMA into CKD staging guidelines reflects the widespread recognition that SDMA is an accurate measure of kidney function. The impairment of which may be due to kidney disease or a third disease processes. These updated SDMA based staging guidelines are the next step in improving not only early diagnosis of CKD, but also tailoring treatment to individual patients. IDEXX SDMA has transformed the landscape of veterinarians manage patients with impaired kidney function.Finally, we continue to extend our capability and advantages in veterinary software by advancing our software on multiple fronts simultaneously. Our goal is to provide a truly comprehensive technology offering that both independent practices and corporate groups around the world rely on to run their businesses. Q3 was again a strong quarter for global placements of new Cornerstone, Neo, Animana and SmartFlow systems. Inclusion of software systems to the IDEXX 360 program is accelerating commercial efforts in North America. In the US practice management software placements grew 35% year-over-year. Sticking with the US, we've seen an unprecedented pace of Cornerstone upgrades to version 9.1 with more than 2,700 practices upgraded year-to-date across North America, driven by customer demand for the all new user interface and streamline clinician experience. We achieved yet another critical development milestone for Cornerstone cloud in Q3, which is now successfully running in a live environment for more than a quarter. Initial customer feedback is extremely positive and we look forward to eventually making the many benefits of the cloud available to thousands of customers that value Cornerstone as the standard-bearer in practice management software.Q3 was another strong quarter for growth for Web PACS with a 29% year-over-year increase in subscriptions, our enterprise management and analytics platform for corporate groups continues to make big strides, providing a command and control center for corporate group C-Suite, and VetConnect PLUS, the most widely used app in veterinary medicine had another strong quarter, growing our new functionality for sharing diagnostic results with pet parents and growing to more than 29,000 engaged practices globally.In addition to our strides in growing our business organically, we're also pleased to highlight our recent acquisition of Marshfield Labs and the addition of their employees. Marshfield is a highly professional well-run laboratory that has a national customer base with a relatively stronger presence in the mid and upper Midwest regions. We look forward to quickly bringing our unique innovations like SDMA, Fecal antigen and VetConnect PLUS to name just a few to Marshfield customers, many of whom we work with today. In summary, we feel very good about our business progress across a range of strategic fronts and believe we are well positioned to build on this momentum in 2020 and deliver on our long-term financial goals.Before I conclude and on behalf of all my IDEXX colleagues around the world, I'd like to extend our thanks to Jon Ayers and our best wishes for Jon's continued rehabilitation. Jon's love and affection as a pet parent of cats translated into his deeply held beliefs and the unique role that pets in their care plan our lives. As a result, here he's reminded us of what's possible and what IDEXX can contribute to our unique diagnostics and software that expand the health and well-being of the pets wee love. It's Jon's vision that IDEXX as an organization will remain committed to helping strengthen the role and relevance of the veterinarian as the key to improving the lives of pets and animals and the people who love them. On a personal note, I'm looking forward to continuing to work with Jon, both on the Board of Directors and as a trusted advisor.And with that, we'll open it up to Q&A.[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, how are you doing? -- Good morning, Mike. -- Good morning, Mike. -- First off, congrats on the quarter, really, really solid results in 3Q, but I want to ask on the 2020 outlook briefly. First on the operating margin gains, you highlighted a couple of different moving pieces with the CEO charge in the fourth quarter, but you've also seen some really strong gains in gross margins this year, how should we think about the moving pieces in the progression next year, you talked about 100 bps to 150 bps operating margin constant currency. How do we think about price on the gross margin line from the cost controls in SG&A, you also have the sales force expansion that you talked about in the US? So a couple of different moving pieces. So how does all shake out?And then a follow-on just on the broader outlook for next year. Slightly more conservative view for the topline, organic 9% to 10.5%. I realize still very early on, but anything really changing in the market just high level or is this just any particular area you could point to within reference labs or consumables and instruments or it's just -- is it just initial guide when I take a cautious glance at the markets? -- Yes, let me start with the operating margin clarification. You're right, we have a compare here with the CEO transition charges that we tried to highlight. So our preliminary outlook of 100 basis points to 150 basis points, we noted included 50 basis points related to the comparison of favorability related to the charge. So if you adjust for that, it's 50 basis points to 100 basis points, which is very consistent with our long-term goals and what we were indicating what our goals were for 2020 back in the Investor Day. I -- we are demonstrating that this is a leveragable business model that delivers nice profit flow-through when we grow at the rates we're targeting and have a good progress with that as reflected in our Q3 results and our outlook for 2019.I would highlight heading into next year we have a couple of factors that are built into the operating margin outlook. One is that we have two significant new facilities that are coming online next year, our new Core Lab in Germany as well as our new Westbrook headquarters. And we will -- that will involve a level of incremental costs and we'll grow into that over time, but initially that will be something that has the effect of moderating margin gains.And as you pointed out, we've got the US expansion, the additional expansion of US commercial resources. And we have a pretty healthy growth right now on our year-on-your investment as we're fully ramped with our international expansion that we implemented a little earlier this year, and we're investing in our R&D initiatives consistent with our stated goal. So we've got a healthy level of investment, some factors that will moderate kind of the upside on that, but we feel very comfortable with the underlying 50 basis points to 100 basis points of improvement outlook for next year.On revenue, the 9% to 10.5% we noted reflects a consistent outlook for sustaining continued strong CAG Dx recurring revenue growth, which is really the main driver of our growth outlook. We're looking to build on the solid progress we've made on both the US and international fronts on growing CAG Dx recurring revenues, which are right in line with our long-term goal ranges.In terms of overall growth, I would highlight we are continuing to maintain a calibrated outlook on LPD revenues that is influenced by, we still have some macro factors going on with African swine fever and we are -- we do know we're going to be up against some tough compares on health herd screening, which is a relatively smaller business for us, but we had a much better than expected growth this year in that area and we are cautious about some potential pull back on that as dairy producers in places like Australia and New Zealand will rebuild their herds in 2020. So, it's a smaller business for us, but at the margin that kind of reinforces just our comfort levels with the 9% to 10.5% overall organic growth outlook. -- And Mike, just in terms of the market itself, we feel good about where the market is. As Brian indicated, we saw 2.7% clinical growth in Q3 over 5% revenue growth, 5.3% and that doesn't include new practice formation. So our outlook assumes that the market stays in that range. -- Great, thanks.And we'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Jay, one for you in regards to Marshfield Labs. It's a little unique to see you purchasing lab assets not alone in the US. I'm curious what the strategy was there and then more specifically outside of the lab network and the client base you will get from them, was there anything proprietary that can be broadened into the IDEXX Labs existing network that you garner from the acquisition? -- Yes, Ryan thank you for that question. We're very excited by the Marshfield acquisition. It's a high quality, very professional laboratory, we're adding approximately 2,000 Marshfield customers, these -- some of which we already do business with. Our focus is really on being able to maintain continuity of service, understand the needs of those customers better and enter into some of the innovations that we have like SDMA and fecal energy and VetConnect PLUS over time to them. So, it's say a -- we think it's a great acquisition. It's a great laboratory and it fits in well with our overall strategy. -- And then I may have missed this, this is a different question. But in commenting on the 8% uptick in Q4 on the North American customer facing organization, is there a specific focus of the hires you're making there, if it's vet tech, is it field sales reps, is it -- anything in particular that it's kind of a focus and will you be changing the territories at all or is it just augmenting existing territories? Thanks. -- Alright, thank you, Ryan. Let me give you an overview of the wide and I'll give you some background on the way. Essentially at its core, we're adding 23 territories and our model is, we have a VDC per territory. So we'll be going from 227 territories to 250. On average, that the VDC today has about 110 accounts and post implementation of the expansion will be down to about 100. And as is the case when we expand the number of VDCs, we augment the number of field service reps to support them, generally two VDCs per single FSR. So in addition to the 23 VDCs in new territories, we're adding 12 FSRs. So that represents the core of the change.And I think he really is, when you take a look at our market, we've been growing strongly in the US and the average business we do with the -- with our customers has grown. And so from both the depth and breadth standpoint, we have many customers that are 40% to 50% bigger in terms of the business they do with us, just compared to three years ago. Their expectation as they do more business with us is that they see more of us, whether it's full staff trainings or understanding their practice better, identifying opportunities where we can help them. And then you layer on top of that initiatives like Preventive Care, which take relatively more time of the VDC upfront including things like on-boarding and getting those customers calling Marshfield Labs that I mentioned and the couple thousand of new customers, there is a real draw on the capacity of our commercial channel.We tend to look, there is a couple metrics that we look at that sort of guide our thinking about this. One is a reach the revenue metrics, so if you take a look at Q3, we're about 90% reached the revenue which is where historically we like to be. But when you take a look at reached customer, which incorporates not just IDEXX customers, but competitive customers, we're about 75% or so. So we're a bit lower than we like to be, we think there is really good opportunity outside of the IDEXX installed base still. So that guided our thinking and how we implemented this. -- Okay, that's super helpful. And I want to just wish my best to Jon as well. Thank you. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Ryan.And you have a question from the line of Erin Wright. Please go ahead. -- Alright, thanks. Do you know how much of the Marshfield customers are IDEXX customers on the point of care side or generally speaking, how much overlap maybe there is, so we can think about like an opportunity for cross selling and what does that put your US Lab count at now following the Marshfield transaction? And then can you kind of just broadly speak to the broader competitive environment across reference laboratory. Are there any changes there? I know that there has been some more competitive movements on the SDMA side or for kidney disease testing. I guess how do you compare your SDMA capabilities at the reference lab compared to others? Thanks. -- Right. So there is -- I'll take a few of those, there is a number of questions in there. As I indicated, there is about 2,000 in total Marshfield customers, many of who we do business with currently, we haven't broke out the specifics in terms of, in what modality or across all the modalities. Generally speaking, most customers in the US do business with us in some fashion, whether its Rapid Assay, or our software product. So we do think that there is a really nice opportunity to cross sell our full solutions, but our focus is really first on being able to understand those customer needs and work with them.In terms of, you had mentioned, specifically competition to SDMA. In our view there is really no comparable offerings to SDMA in the marketplace. We continue to make excellent progress expanding SDMA adoption as a differentiated, I give you some statistics in terms of not only the reference lab, but SDMA on slide with our Catalyst. We're super excited by the updated guidelines a virus that elevates SDMA really from an adjunct date hurt chronic care disease treatment into a primary recommended diagnostics biomarker, alongside creatinine of course for staging of CKD.An important thing to keep in mind in terms of these staging guidelines is that veterinarians rely on them to classify by the patient, severity and progression of kidney disease. So this guidance the treatment paths that they take, it helps the market standardize on best care approaches for the patient, it drives, we think, more standardized or better outcomes for the marketplace as a whole, it assures the pet parents that their pets getting the best treatment. So we think this is a really big deal and it's something we're really excited by. -- And Erin to your point, we had 52 labs before -- in the US before the Sanofi adding the few additional locations including the Core Lab from Marshfield, which were, as Jay mentioned, is a really high quality operation. -- Okay, great. And then just generally speaking. Also, how would you characterize current demand trends across the veterinary market. I guess you alluded a slight acceleration in the clinical visit growth this quarter, what was driving that you think and is that normalized for the day impacts as well? Thanks. -- Yes, I mean, we think the market is healthy, it's 2.7% clinical growth and that's the important metric that we track because it involves -- those visits involve diagnostics testing, the overall practice growth is 1.4 and revenue at 5.3 was pretty healthy. It's -- we think it's largely consistent with what we've seen in the past, there does tend to be some variability quarter-to-quarter. We've got a pretty good beat on the market as a result of the -- our analytics approach with 7,500 of practices we take data from five, five of the leading PIMS systems. So I've got a nice proportion of both regional and practice size representation in this data, and I think what it's showing is pretty consistent, strong growth across the market. -- Hey Erin, just on the days impact to clarify it. Basically what we had in Q3 was an extra Monday. And so what that really impacted was our business we do a lot of shipping on Monday, so you saw positive benefits to consumables and in Rapid Assay which we highlighted and actually very limited impact on labs and it wouldn't have really impacted the market metrics in that context, it's more of a shipping dynamic. -- Got it. Thank you.We'll go to the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for the questions. I wanted to follow-up on the revenue guidance, Brian, I didn't hear a range for your expectations for the CAG Diagnostic recurring growth next year. I just wanted to know if you could kind of talk about the type of growth you expect and kind of what the key factors we should have in mind that would influence the growth outlook for next year? -- Yes, in our preliminary guidance, we don't get that granular, we did want to highlight that in the 9% to 10.5% outlook, we're looking to sustain the high level growth that this year we're guiding to 11.5% to 12%. So, all indications are we're trending quite well and looking to build on that, in the US right now, we're about 11.5% adjusted for days year-to-date and kind of 13.5% in international and international actually improved a bit in the quarter, we had relatively better reference lab growth which is something we've been working on. So we're looking to build on that and we'll be sharing more specifics as we get through the finalization of our planning for assesses [Phonetic] and we'll share that on the year-end call. -- Excellent. Numbers that you gave, it looks like you saw some nice improvement internationally, specifically in new and competitive placements. Could you maybe just talk about what drove that, and specifically what you're seeing in China? I think that had been a little bit of a drag earlier this year. I just wondered if you had seen improvement there? -- Yes. So we saw really nice placement growth and consumables growth internationally, 20% normalized. And I think there is a couple of factors. It's clearly been an ongoing focus for us. I think the maturing of our VDC model -- continuing maturing of our VDC model is helpful. The -- we're getting nice traction with the IDEXX 360 program with our international customers, I think they appreciate what that brings in terms of flexibility and the ability to access our solutions. And the products themselves, it fits our international markets really well. I think we've said in the past that our Catalyst One was initially designed for international markets in terms of its cost profile and physical footprint and we just -- we continue to see that, bear out in our sales momentum. And Brian is going to address the China question. -- Yes, China, had a very good performance on new and competitive placements and we continue to work through the lapping of compares to prior levels where we had a high levels of VetTest upgrades. So the mix has shifted. We are -- that does constrain our overall revenue growth and reported revenue growth somewhat. But I think the underlying quality of the placements when we're doing new and competitive accounts across regions contributed very high quality performance from our lines in the quarter and the double-digit EVI gains that we talked about. So we feel good about the progress we're making across markets and that sets us up well. It's really about expanding our global installed base. And as Jay highlighted, we are up 18% year-on-year with our Catalyst installed base globally and that really sets a solid foundation for continuing to grow our consumable revenues at high rates.We'll go to the line of David Westenberg. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thank you for your taking the questions. So just first, you noted customer shifting preferences to cloud based solutions. I know that PIMS typically has very high barriers and switching out seems -- it is rather on the difficult side. So are you having a lot of success in terms of switching customers or adding on that cloud, the Cornerstone cloud solution, is that the way you kind of see the market shaking out? Can you just maybe run through competitive dynamics in that -- in the PIMS market please? -- Yes. So I'll take that. Thank you for the question, David. The -- our PIMS offering is very broad. So we address the market in the more of the advanced workflow with Cornerstone, but also those practices that may be single or mobile practices with Neo. And what we see is, our veterinary customers, like all customers, whether independent of industry appreciate these benefits they specifically focus on workflow, does it help them address the challenges both from a care delivery standpoint, as well as a business standpoint in the practice. And what they're telling us with Cornerstone 9.1, which is our most recent revision is that they really appreciate the improvements we've made in the user interface and the ability to do the work that they do with fewer clicks with just all the ease of use benefits. So we're seeing really nice placements across the board. It's included as I had mentioned in our IDEXX 360 program. So, more customers are deciding, choosing to go along with us in terms of diagnostics and software what they find is when they do that it works better.In terms of Cornerstone cloud, that as I indicated is really in field trials at this point. We think the marketplace over time will migrate at least in part. As you had indicated, PIMS systems tend to be a bit sticky, but I think customers increasingly recognize that there are some benefits that having their software in the cloud in terms of lower cost for being able to maintain the hardware in the practices and somewhat more quick or a number of revisions that they can expect on an ongoing basis without having to shut down their practices for an hour or two hours that type of thing. So lots of benefits, we think over time that the market will move in that direction and we'll be ready for it. Keep in mind our Neo Practice Management System is already in the cloud. -- Yes. Right. Thank you very much for the color. And I'm just going to do one really quick housekeeping question, I really do appreciate how you call out the extra day in the quarter. So I was just wondering on in terms of housekeeping, is there a extra day or one less day then in Q4 that we need to be -- then we need to anticipate? And then maybe as we look at 2020, is there any kind of growth headwind in terms of extra days there? Just as a housekeeping question? -- On Q4 we will have one less Monday, but we anticipate some positive benefit around the holiday week timing. So, I think it's a modest net headwind, there may be some mortality impacts, but we're not calling that out. And the team is telling me, what do you -- the next year is it's relative -- we get some benefit in Q1 for leap year, but I think on the full year it's relatively neutral.I appreciate it. Thank you so much.We'll go to the line of Jon Block. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks guys. Good morning. Jay, maybe the first one for you. Just curious about the increased North American sales force. I guess why now? I think it was a couple quarters ago, you said you guys were sort of good with your commercial infrastructure. And I get it. It's a business that responds well to increased investments, but just curious what you're seeing in the marketplace that cause you to move now versus maybe in a couple of quarters? And then I've got a follow up. -- Yes. So, Jon, I think it really comes down to what I was describing earlier. Number of our customers, a large number of our customers in our territories have gotten bigger over time and there is more demand from the VDC in terms of working with these customers. It's an expectation that they have as they use more broader and deeper. And then when you take a look at some of these initiatives like Preventive Care, as I mentioned, they really do require more time upfront in terms of getting these customers on board it and helping make them successful. We added a couple of thousand more customers from Marshfield Labs, as well as what we said at Investor Day, it's $11 billion addressable market, $3 billion in wellness visits alone. So we continue to see that when we apply time with customers that they grow more and use more of our Diagnostics, and we do better, it really just comes down to that math. -- Okay, fair enough. And then, Brian, maybe the second for you on the guide, some moving parts of stock-based comp, I think largely in line. But the point of revs was a tad below where we were. So I guess the question is, does this bake in what we may see from a new product standpoint in 2020, does it reflect that? And then, part B, that is just, I thought you alluded to net interest expense of $36.5 million, which seems like a decent step up year-over-year despite rates continuing to go down. So I want to make sure I got the right number there and if so, why do we have a step-up? Thanks guys. -- Yes, just on the -- your first question. Our outlook for 2020 incorporates for projections for growth across the business, including adoption of our current innovations and any new introductions. So that's factored in. We feel it's very much in line with kind of how we've been trending. We always target growth, Jon, at the higher end of what we talk about. That's what we try to execute and just calibrate that appropriately. But we're looking to build on the strong growth rates and are very comfortable with the outlook and the context of our long-term goals.And on your question related to interest expense, it was $36 million and that included an assumption for -- we did not assume a change in interest rates. So, I think that if there are reductions in things like variable interest rates, we would -- there may be some modest benefit to that, but that was our assumption and it assumes a flat net leverage ratios, so basically we will -- we saw some benefit this year of reductions in interest rates, we're not projecting the underlying interest rate reductions into next year in the broader market.Our final question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, thanks for the question. I guess, Brian, as we think about the 2020 guidance, I assume you're contemplating the inclusion of Marshfield Lab. So it looks like Marshfield has about three or four reference labs with particular strength in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio. One is, can you give us a sense of what your share was for reference lab in those regions and how you think that might bump it up? And then can you give us a sense for what level of growth you think that Marshfield could add in basis points to your reference lab line in 2020? -- Yes, so just on Marshfield, it's a lab with national customers. So we see this is adding to our national capability, Within our guidance markets, roughly $15 million, the annualized revenue we expect is about $15 million for Marshfield that's what's baked in and it's offset by FX. So, in terms of when you see our reported and organic numbers, those two factors offset. So it's a -- we've got that factored in. We are very excited about adding Marshall to the IDEXX family and working with their employees and very pleased with their capabilities, and as Jay mentioned, I think there is real opportunities for us here nationally to leverage our innovations and expand our IDEXX business with those customers. -- That's excellent. And so I also wanted to ask about potential expansion internationally. I believe you have over 900 people on the field globally, which is certainly a significant global infrastructure. But can you give us a sense for where you're at internationally and whether or not you're contemplating future sales hires OUS? And I guess related to that, you've got the new lab in Germany opening up next year. Can you just speak to some of the dynamics in play, both competitively and organically internally focused in Europe for 2020? -- Yes. So we're -- we just completed our expansion in Europe and internationally and we're comfortable where we are. We think we have the right capacity to address the opportunity and our growth projections. So at this point, there is no additional plans to go beyond that, it's really -- our focus at this point is really maturing out the organization. What we find is that it takes time to continue to develop deeper relationships with customers and with those deeper relationships we're able to grow. So that's really the focus.In terms of the reference lab marketplace, as Brian indicated earlier, we're pleased with where we are right now. We're focused on being able to improve our reference lab performance and we think over time with the IDEXX 360 program and the maturing of our VDC sales organization, we can build on that. We're excited to be able to bring on the new reference lab in Germany, we think that that positions us well for additional capacity in the future, but no other specifics at this point.Okay. So, thank you. With that, we'll conclude the call. I want to thank our employees for the very strong progress and performance in Q3 and the advancement of our purpose, which is enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock around the world.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $260.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $252.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $265.92/share today.\n\nBecause the $260.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of IDXX stock at the current price level of $265.92/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $270.00.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the April 2020 put at the $230 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $7.50.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.3% return against the $230 commitment, or a 6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to IDXX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.

So unless Idexx Laboratories, Inc. sees its shares decline 15.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $222.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $7.50 from $230), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $230 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the April 2020 put at the $230 strike for the 6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

While it's far from clear that the global economy -- or even the U.S. -- will fall into a recession in the next few years, there are warning signs. It's quite possible that a major country like Germany could be in a recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction) by the time you read this article. Moreover, history suggests the global economy will fall into recession at some point. What's a worried equity investor to do? Here are three suggestions.The three ideas are as follows:Image source: Getty Images.A quick look at the share-price charts of O'Reilly, AutoZone, and Advance Auto Parts in the two-year period straddling the last recession shows a significant outperformance. There's a reason for this, and it's the tendency for consumers to skip buying a new car in troubled times in favor of running older cars longer. That's good news for auto parts retailers because older cars need more servicing. data by \u00a0Shaded areas correspond to recessions.\u00a0As you can see below, that relationship appears to have continued in the last few years as U.S. retail car sales have passed a cyclical peak -- throw in a recession, and they are likely to decline further. data by The sector looked like\u00a0  and the three stocks had \u00a0But are they still a good value, particularly with concerns over .The answer to the valuation question probably depends on whether there will be a recession and how long it will be. An extended period of economic decline will lead to employment instability and consequently falling car sales. Of the three, O'Reilly is probably best positioned to deal with the long-term threat from Amazon due its relatively higher share of its revenue from in-house repair\u00a0revenue -- the company generates 43% of its revenue from professional mechanics (as opposed to DIY). This is important because professional customers tend to need the parts immediately. And O'Reilly has arguably the best distribution system in the industry with 90% of its stores receiving what it says are \"multiple same-day deliveries of hard-to-find parts\" from its hubs.  This is something Amazon will find very hard to replicate.The qualifier is important! Despite its defensive nature, healthcare isn't entirely recession-proof. That said, three companies are well worth looking at. Animal health (for livestock and companion animals) is a specific area that shouldn't be significantly hurt by a recession. Indeed, 's former animal health businesses -- now spun off into a company called   -- .\u00a0Another exciting option in the healthcare sector is veterinary diagnostics company \u00a0 -- a company that .\u00a0A third option, industrial company  , is actually more of a healthcare company these days. It's attractive because of its excellent management team and heavy exposure to life sciences, diagnostics, and water-quality treatment. Progress in 2019  and\u00a0the addition of 's biopharma business later this year will give management an opportunity to boost its growth rate. Danaher's best days .\u00a0History suggests that severe market dips are usually a good time for investors to start picking up stocks for the long-term. In this context, if you are worried about a recession causing a slump in asset classes such as equities then it's a good idea to keep some cash in reserve in order to take advantage of buying opportunities in your favorite stocks.\u00a0All told, it's easy for investors to talk themselves into doomsday scenarios regarding the economy, and memories of 2008-2009 are still fresh.

During the Great Recession, for example, as the S&P 500 plunged nearly 38%, the price of gold climbed more than 19%. data by .But this simple strategy comes with a variety of options, including the buying of bullion, gold exchange-traded funds, or gold mining stocks. One of the best options currently available to investors, however, is\u00a0 royalty and streaming company Franco-Nevada. Digging metals out of the ground is a capital-intensive endeavor, so mining companies often make deals with royalty and streaming companies, which provide them with money upfront in return for the rights to purchase a certain amount of gold (or other metal) at a preset discounted price, or to receive a percentage of mineral production from a mine. Consequently, Franco-Nevada can profit from the successful development of mining assets, yet it is involved in neither the development of the projects nor their operations, thus reducing its risk.Although Franco-Nevada has exposure to silver, platinum group metals, and other commodities, gold is the greatest contributor to its bottom line. In 2018, for example, gold accounted for 63% of the company's adjusted . With 55 energy-related assets in its portfolio, the company is clearly interested in more than the yellow stuff, but with 38 precious metals projects in the advanced development phase and 200 more in the exploration phase, investors can be sure that gold will continue to play a central role in the company's portfolio in the future. In fact, management's stated intent is to generate 80% of revenue from precious metals over the long term.Eating out less often or passing on the latest Hollywood blockbuster at the multiplex are just a couple of ways people may choose to tighten their belts during a recession. And when it comes to pets, they might wait a bit longer to buy a new chew toy for Fido after he destroys the old one. But one area where people aren't likely to economize is on providing adequate health care for their furry little friends. Therefore, Idexx Laboratories, which\u00a0proclaims itself \"the global leader in veterinary diagnostics, software, and water microbiology testing,\" is a naturally appealing stock to hold during steep economic downturns. Although the company provides services for a wide range of animals, from pets found in the home to livestock on the farm, it's the former category that comprises its largest business. In 2018, the companion animal group (CAG) segment -- i.e., its pet health business -- accounted for 87% of overall revenue.Idexx Laboratories has a geographically diversified footprint, delivering its solutions to customers in more than 175 countries. How does this relate to its financials? Customers outside the U.S. represented 39% of revenue in 2018. This global exposure could mitigate the company's risk in case of a U.S. recession.\u00a0While some local initiatives may take a back seat during financially troubled times, neglecting the local dump is not an option for municipalities. Consequently, companies that deal in trash and recycling services, like Casella Waste Systems, which operates in six states in the Northeast, are a compelling option for investors concerned about a recession. But it's not merely the fact that Casella Waste Systems can expect the demand for its services to remain strong through trying economic times that makes it attractive. It's also management's commitment to improving the company's financial health.Image source: Casella Waste Systems.The company has reduced its total debt from $537 million in 2014 to $496 million as of the end of Q2 2019. Furthermore, it has reduced its consolidated net leverage ratio from 5.4 in 2014 to 3.2 as of the end of the recently completed second quarter. Recognizing the more secure financial position that the company has achieved, S&P Global Ratings upgraded its debt rating from B+ to BB- this past February, and  \u00a0followed up with an upgrade from B1 to Ba3 this past June. And management recognizes that its work at shoring up the balance sheet isn't over. It has targeted a consolidated net leverage ratio of 3 to 3.25 by 2021.Besides the less debt-laden balance sheet, the company's ability to generate strong cash flow makes it an attractive option for investors. Whereas free cash flow represented 2.8% of sales in 2015, it represented 6.1% of sales in 2018, according to . And management forecasts that free cash flow will grow 10% to 15% annually through 2021.\u00a0When considering how to prepare a portfolio for a recession, there are typical approaches such as gaining exposure to gold -- one of the most common safe-haven investments. And for investors who find this desirable, Franco-Nevada's business model as a specialized financier of sorts is a compelling option. Those who prefer to avoid exposure to gold may be more interested in Idexx Laboratories and Casella Waste Systems -- two companies that deal in products and services that will undoubtedly remain in high demand, even during the most challenging of economic periods.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IDEXX delivered continued strong financial performance in the second quarter. In terms of highlights, Q2 revenues of $620 million grew 7% on a reported basis or 9% organically. Results were driven by continued strong 11% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of a combined 0.5% growth headwind related to Brexit order timing and equivalent day impacts.The quality of our growth was excellent in the quarter reflected in strong US CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our major modalities, and 39% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements in international markets, which supported solid global EVI gains and continued high growth in consumable revenues.Profit performance continued at a strong pace in Q2 supported by continued high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and high profit flow-through. EPS was $1.43 per share, an increase of 19% on a comparable constant-currency basis, reflecting a better-than-projected 120 basis point improvement in constant-currency operating margins.In addition to strong operating profit gains Q2 EPS results also benefited from $0.04 per share in upside related to share-based compensation tax benefits. While our CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue growth remains strong and on track with our full year 11% to 12% growth goals, our overall Q2 organic growth of 9% was at the lower end of our projected growth range for the quarter, impacted by a few select factors.We fell short of our goal is to build on very high prior year international chemistry upgrade levels with the majority of our Q2 upgrade placement shortfall in China. We also saw increased pressure on China LPD revenues in Q2 driven by the African swine fever outbreak, as well as a relatively higher than projected impact from Brexit and equivalent day effects in the quarter.These factors were largely specific to the second quarter. We've refined our full year revenue outlook to incorporate these effects, we're raising our full year EPS guidance reflecting continued benefits from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and disciplined P&L management.In terms of our full-year revenue outlook , we're maintaining our guidance for 11% to 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We're refining our overall organic growth guidance to 9.5% to 10.5% lowering our high-end growth outlook by 0.5% incorporating our second quarter results. Our updated full-year revenue guidance is now $2,380 million to $2,410 million, $10 million below our prior midpoint revenue range, reflecting $5 million in operational refinements and approximately $5 million of impacts related to updated FX estimates.We're raising our 2019 EPS guidance range by $0.05 per share at mid-point to $4.82 to $4.92, or 17% to 20% growth on a comparable constant-currency basis. This outlook reflects $0.02 in EPS benefit at mid-point related to higher expectations for operating performance, driven by our raised outlook for 100 to 125 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement and lower projected interest expense.Our guidance builds in a $0.04 per share increase from updated projections for share based compensation tax benefits incorporating Q2 upsides offset by a $0.01 negative impact related to updated FX assumptions.We'll review our updated 2019 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with the review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Q2 results reflect a continued strong performance in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $547 million, up 10% organically driven by a 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, including strong global gains across our major modalities.As noted, our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in the quarter was net of a 0.5% headwind from Brexit order timing and equivalent day effects, which were relatively greater than anticipated impacted by the timing of European holidays. Year-to-date CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.4% in line with our full-year goals.Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 9% overall and 7% organically in Q2, driven by double-digit organic gains in VSS revenues. We saw continued strong sales results across our practice management platforms and growth in recurring software services earnings on our expanding PIMS and application install base.Our diagnostic imaging business also continues to achieve high levels of digital radiography instrument placements and growth in recurring services although organic revenue gains in the quarter were moderated by comparisons to high prior year instrument placement levels.Our Water business revenues grew 10% organically in the second quarter to $35 million with consistent mid single-digit growth in the US augmented by high growth in Asia and Latin America, aided by our expanded direct sales presence. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q2 was $33 million reflecting relatively flat organic growth. Strong organic growth in health herd screening revenues aided by a favorable prior year comparison in the quarter and solid gains in poultry and pregnancy testing were offset by greater than projected pressure on swine diagnostic testing revenues related to impacts from the African swine fever epidemic in China, as well as moderate declines in European disease eradication program revenues.By region, US revenues were $389 million in the quarter, up 9% organically driven by an 11% organic increase in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. US recurring revenue gains were supported by double-digit growth in US reference labs and consumables and high single-digit gains in rapid assay sales. US CAG recurring diagnostic growth continues to be primarily volume driven, with net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range across our major modalities.IDEXX's growth continues to outpace broader market trends. In Q2 total visits per practice growth was 0.7% year-on-year with clinical visits per practice growing at a greater amount at 2.1% and overall revenue per practice increasing 4.4%. Market growth results were slightly moderated from Q1 levels, which were refined following our latest dataset refresh. Note that these metrics are on a same-store basis and don't include growth benefits from incremental practice formation which we estimate at approximately 1% annually.International revenues in Q2 were $230 million, up 9% organically driven by 11% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. As noted last quarter, we saw benefits in Q1 related to advanced ordering ahead of the previous Brexit deadline. These effects reversed in the second quarter, which along with an unfavorable impact related to the timing of European holidays, reduced overall international CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains by approximately 1.5% and consumable gain by over 2% [Phonetic].Adjusting for this dynamic, international consumable gains were nearly 20% in Q2 supported by our commercial executional focus on expanding our global Catalyst install base. International CAG Diagnostic revenue gains were moderated by consistent mid single-digit revenue gains in our reference lab business. This is an area targeted for improvement in the second half of 2019 aided by relatively more favorable year-on-year comparisons and benefits from our expanding veterinary diagnostic consultant business model.In terms of segment performance. our Q2 results reflected strong global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities, and continued progress in expanding our premium installed equipment base globally. Globally, EVI was up solidly in Q2 compared to very strong prior-year levels, driven by growth in high quality Catalyst placements.In North America, we placed 319 Catalyst at new and competitive accounts as well as 159 second Catalysts at larger IDEXX accounts. Second Catalyst placements are supporting continued strong consumable growth and high customer retention rates aided by steadily expanding 360 degree program and other long-term contract commitments These results compared to strong prior-year new and competitive Catalyst placement levels of 346 units and 95 second Catalyst placements. Along with limited VetTest upgrades, total North American Catalyst placements were 486 in the quarter, up 8% supporting a 15% year-on-year growth in our North America installed base, including approximately 5% of growth benefit from upgrades completed in the second half of 2018 at Banfield.In international markets, we placed 761 Catalysts at new and competitive accounts or 66% of total placements, up 213 units or 39% compared to the prior year. Total international Catalyst placements of 1,149 units were down 4% compared to very strong prior-year levels, which had high levels of VetTest upgrades in Asia-Pacific markets.As noted, while our new and competitive Catalyst results were excellent, we did fall short of our goals in Q2 to build on our high prior year levels of upgrades and expansion markets such as China, which contributed to a shortfall to our quarterly instrument revenue goals. Despite these dynamics, our international Catalyst installed base reached nearly 21,000 units in Q2, up 28% year-on-year and over 5% compared to ending Q1 levels.Overall, we placed 3,171 premium analyzers in Q2, down 2% year-on-year. Total Catalyst placements were 1,635, down 1%, reflecting the tough compared to high prior year VetTest upgrade levels. We achieved 602 SediVue placements in Q2 down 16% compared to very strong prior-year levels, which benefited from a high percentage of our early 360 degree program agreements, including [Indecipherable] compared to a more recent mixed shift, which is included relatively more Catalysts as part of our 360 program commitments.We placed 934 premium hematology instruments globally in the quarter, up 7%, with a continued high attach rate with new and competitive Catalyst placements. In addition to these strong premium instrument results, we've placed a record 2,663 SNAP Pro's in Q2, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to over 30,000, with over 27,000 installed in North America, helping to support increasing retention rates in our rapid assay business.CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q2 with $32 million, a decrease of 7% organically off a strong compared to 2018, which included mixed benefits from very strong placements of higher priced SediVue instruments. Benefits from our growing instrument base test and software innovation and expanded direct commercial capable continue to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains across our major modalities.Instrument consumable revenues of $175 million, grew 13% organically in Q2 , net of a 1% growth headwind related to Brexit order timing and equivalent day impacts. Results reflect double-digit gains in the US and normalized growth of nearly 20% in international markets. High volume driven consumable gains were supported by continued expansion of SediVue and SDMA on a slide with each contributing nearly 1% to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter.Reference laboratory and consulting services revenues of $214 million grew 10% organically in Q2. US lab momentum continues to be very strong reflected in low to mid-teen volume driven organic reference lab revenue gains and sustained high customer retention levels.Overall lab growth was moderated by consistent mid single-digit organic lab growth in international markets. Rapid assay revenues of $69 million grew 9% organically in Q2 reflecting continued expansion of 4Dx Plus specialty and first-generation products, supported by planned promotional programs and high customer retention levels aided by our expanded SNAP Pro install base.Rapid assay gains continue to be primarily volume driven augmented by moderate net price gains.Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q2 was $164 million, up 13% as reported or 14% on a constant currency basis, supported by operating margin gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments. Operating margins were 26.5% up 120 basis points on a constant currency basis, or 140 basis points as reported, reflecting moderate gross margin gains and stronger than projected operating expense leverage.Gross profit was $358 million in Q2, up 8% as reported or 9% on a constant currency basis. Gross margins of 57.7%, increased 30 basis points on a constant currency basis, supported by product margin gains reflecting benefits from moderate net price increases and strong consumable and rapid assay growth. These gains and scale and productivity benefits in our US Lab business were offset by planned investments in lab capacity and systems, as well as incremental year-on-year costs associated with expanded software field service resources.Foreign exchange hedge gains which are reflected in gross profit were approximately $2.5 million in Q2.Operating expenses in Q2 were up 4% or 6% on a constant currency basis, resulting in 90 basis points of positive operating margin leverage. Constant currency operating expense increases were driven by growth in R&D spending, and increased costs related to our expanded global commercial infrastructure with some favorability relative to our expectations for the quarter relative to the ramping of cost growth in these areas.Overall operating expense growth was moderated in Q2 by relatively limited constant currency growth in G&A costs, reflecting low year-on-year corporate function and benefit cost growth and LPD cost controls. EPS in Q2 was $1.43 per share, an increase of 16% as reported and 19% on a comparable constant currency basis.Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q2 2018 and 2019 decreased operating profit by $2 million and EPS by $0.01 per share. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% in Q2 including benefits of approximately 3% to our tax rate or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity, which is approximately $0.04 per share higher than projected.Free cash flow was $99 million for the first half of 2019. We continue to expect free cash flow of 60% to 65% of net income for 2019, reflecting a consistent full-year outlook for capital spending of $160 million to $175 million. This includes approximately $70 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and our German Core Lab relocation or about 20% of net income.We allocated [Indecipherable] in capital to repurchase 86,000 shares in Q2. Year-to-date, we repurchased 353,000 shares for $74 million for an average price of $210 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong, we ended Q2 with $956 million in debt, $111 million in cash and $597 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility.Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.49x gross and 1.31x net of cash and investment balances. We're refining our 2019 full-year outlook for a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1%, which reflects more recent stock price trends and assumes that we maintain net leverage ratios at current levels. We now project annual interest expense of approximately $34 million, an improvement of $2 million more than offsetting these impacts.In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2019, our full year reported revenue guidance is now $2,380 million to $2,410 million reflecting refined expectations for 9.5% to 10.5% overall organic growth, and consistent 11% to 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.Our reported revenue outlook reflects a projected 1.5% to 2% full year FX revenue growth headwind at the rates assumed in our press release. As noted, we're raising our 2019 full year EPS guidance $0.05 per share at mid-point to $4.82 to $4.92 reflecting an outlook for 17% to 20% comparable constant-currency EPS growth.Refinements to our revenue outlook are more than offset by increased expectations for full-year operating margin improvement now projected at 100 to 125 basis points, generating $0.02 of operational benefits including net upsides from revised projections for full-year interest expense and share account reduction.Our EPS guidance assumes a 2019 effective tax rate of 19.5% to 20%, a 50 basis point improvement compared to earlier guidance and a $0.04 of reported EPS upside. This tax rate includes an estimate of $12 million to $14 million or approximately 2.5% and projected full year tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation.At midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about $0.15 per share in full-year benefit. We now estimate the foreign exchange rate changes will decrease EPS -- reported EPS by $0.04 per share, a $0.01 greater impact than our last outlook, ahead of approximately $11.5 million in projected hedge gains. For the third quarter outlook, we expect reported revenue growth of 9% to 10.5% and organic revenue gains of 10.5% to 12% including 1% to 1.5% equivalent day growth benefit.We expect Q3 2019 operating margins to increase 50 to 100 basis points above prior year Q3 levels on a constant currency basis and we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be approximately 21% including projected benefits from share based compensation exercise activity.That concludes the financial review. Our business momentum remains strong and we're on track to deliver our 2019 financial performance aligned with our long-term goals.Let me now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. -- Good morning, and thank you, Brian. IDEXX's second-quarter results build on our strong start to 2019 and reflect the strength of our recurring revenue business model keeping us on track toward excellent full-year results aligned with our long-term goals. Our performance was led by solid 11% organic growth and our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues were 11.5% normalized for Q1 Brexit pull-in and equivalent day impacts. This expanding highly durable annuity contributed 77% of IDEXX's total revenues in Q2.Let me start with a few reflections on the quarter. We were especially pleased with the strength of our US performance in Q2, where we drove 11% recurring CAG growth reflecting strong gains across all CAG recurring diagnostic modalities. We saw continued momentum in our US reference lab business whereas previously communicated, we continue to invest in operational enhancements such as new courier routes, new day labs, and weekend service. These investments provide service level and results turnaround improvements, both of which support customer retention and new customer acquisition.In our North American VetLab business, Catalyst placements were up 8% including second Catalysts placed at high testing volume accounts, which also support customer retention and help drive continued double-digit consumable gains. Of note, the Rapid Assay business grew at 9% organically, benefiting from superior clinical accuracy, effective promotional programs and improving customer retention.The business was also aided by our expanding SNAP Pro install base and increasing leverage of IDEXX multi-modality testing capability. Reinforcing our long held [Indecipherable] , we're seeing strong evidence of faster rapid assay 4Dx Plus growth at IDEXX practices that also use our lab services and are adopting preventative care protocols.Globally, instrument placements were solid during the quarter, considering tough compares at overall quality with notable strength in international competitive Catalyst placements which were up 39% . Our premium install base continues to expand nicely and we don't see a change in the competitive environment. These placement gains along with ongoing increases in testing utilization drove continued strong growth in international consumables. International consumable sales were up nearly 20% normalized for the impact of Brexit order timing and equivalent days aligned with our strategy to develop the significant in-clinic opportunity in international markets.Continued solid momentum across our business is keeping us on track for 11% to 12% CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue gains this year and comparable constant-currency EPS gains at the high end of our long-term goals.Let me share some additional highlights related to progress on key fronts in our growth strategy. We continue to make solid progress advancing IDEXX Preventive Care. Our high same-store sales growth at the practice level in our US Labs business is being driven in part by the adoption of preventive care diagnostics, what we call IDEXX Preventive Care. To-date through Q2, over 3,100 practices have enrolled in the Preventive Care Program since its inception with 370 new practices enrolled in the quarter, a quarterly high for first time enrollees.IDEXX Preventive Care practices are growing CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue at approximately 14% on a trailing 12 month basis versus 11% growth for IDEXX's US customer base over the same period. Virtually our entire VDC[Phonetic] population in the US has now successfully partnered with customers in their territories to deliver IDEXX Preventive Care. In fact, the top 50% of our VDC population as ranked by their engagement in preventive care exceeded their first half territory revenue goals by approximately 200 basis points.It's a great example of how we create market growth. We always start with the customer and patient need to understand we're appropriately applying IDEXX diagnostics like fecal antigen and IDEXX SDMA can uncover more underlying disease. In the case of preventive care, we bring the relevant test together to create preventive care protocols that closely aligned with our customers consume diagnostics testing, along with compliance driven pricing that support the practice of best medicine.We leverage big data to raise awareness and practice standards showing the medical benefits of applying appropriate diagnostics testing for preventative care to all pets, not just older dogs and cats. Our field organization also plays an important role in customer success and market growth, representing a key reason we went to a high frequency trusted advisor model. We're able to invest time and resources to help customers achieve their patient and business goals.In early Q3, we introduced our IDEXX Anywhere Urinalysis Bundle, available exclusively to IDEXX Preventive Care customers. This offering combines the convenience and pricing of preventive care diagnostics run at the reference lab with all the clinical advantages of fresh urine run in house on the SediVue. This innovation is enabled by our unique integration capabilities between the IDEXX VetLab Station, practice management software and the IDEXX reference lab providing to customers a seamless ordering and billing experience across modalities.We believe this multi-modality customer-friendly solution could help further accelerate our preventive care momentum and help support SediVue placements and associated utilization. We continue to have exceptional performance with our SNAP Pro placements of over 2,300 placed in the second quarter in the US alone, up a 100% year-over-year . We continue to methodically transform our rapid assay customer base into a razor and blade business model, as a SNAP Pro mobile instrument brings significant workflow and charge capture value to the veterinary practice. We see higher growth in rapid assay loyalty with customers adopt to SNAP Pro active and connected workflow. With the placements in Q2, we are now just a bit south of 65% of our SNAP 4Dx Plus revenue coming from these active and connected SNAP Pro customers.I'd also like to provide an update on the status of our international sales force expansion. Our international business performance is strong, as evidenced by the continued high growth in the economic value of instrument placements and international CAG recurring growth at 12.5% in Q2. Adjusted for approximately 0.5% combined headwind for Brexit order timing and equivalent day impacts.We've now completed the second full quarter within the expanded model and the commercial teams are responding well. Having had responsibility for three such initiatives in the US, [Indecipherable] to building out an expansion, as we onboard new sales professionals, develop their expertise in diagnostics and our product offering and grow their customer relationships. We track key metrics on our progress, like tenure which chopped nicely in Q2, since experience correlates well with effectiveness. We expect to see further business benefits of these efforts in the second half consistent with our experience in the US, our field effectiveness increased every quarter with tenure and deeper customer relationships.Moving to the veterinary software portfolio, Q2 was another very strong quarter for global placements of Cornerstone, Neo and Animana systems. In North America, practice management software placements grew 44% year-over-year for the quarter. Neo recently launched in Canada and Australia complementing Cornerstone in both of those markets.Speaking of Cornerstone, we continue to see an unprecedented pace of Cornerstone upgrades diversion 9.1 driven by customer excitement for the modernized user interface and improved easy use. We have upgraded close to 2,000 Cornerstone users in less than four months, a record and testament to customer enthusiasm, and I'm pleased to share that we achieved a critical technical milestone in the development of Cornerstone club, currently in field testing, which we will make available in the future and will bring the many benefits of the cloud customers that value Cornerstone as the go-to-high-end practice management system.Q2 was also a strong quarter for Web PACS, one of our nine cloud-based software-as-a service offerings, which experienced 34% year-over-year increase in enrollments. Other software offerings from IDEXX are advancing nicely, including the development of an enterprise management and analytics platform for corporate customers.In summary, we feel very good about our business progress across a range of strategic fronts and believe we are well positioned to sustain strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue growth and EPS gains aligned with our goals. We look forward to sharing more about the enduring growth potential we see for our business and our long-term strategy to capture this potential at the upcoming Investor Day later this month.Before I conclude, I wanted to extend our best wishes to Jon Ayers, as he works through his rehabilitation process. The strong results, we continue to deliver, reflect the deep and talented team that Jon has develop at IDEXX, and I know you have great confidence that IDEXX will keep delivering against our purpose and potential.And with that, we'll open it up to Q&A. Cynthia[Operator Instructions] And we will go to line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hi guys, thanks for taking the call. I want to start on the reference lab. The overall numbers, I mean that was one area that came in a little bit later relative to expectations and talked a little bit about the US performance and how well that held in. But international, it seems like continues to land just a little bit, I wonder if there is anything going on there, I mean we've talked in the past about the EVI and the focus on the point-of-care offering. But I want to see if the dynamic changed at all. I wonder if there was any impact of the heat wave in Europe, like we've seen in the past or anything like that? -- Yes, Mike. Why don't I just kind of clarify the numbers. the reference labs' trends in Q2 were very consistent with what we saw in Q1. I think our -- we have some normalization going on, but the US was -- the Q1 was 14%. It was like 13% normalized in Q2 and we had mid single -- very consistent mid single-digit gains in international. So we didn't have a change in trend and Jay can talk more on this, but as you know we've been sort of signaling target improvement as we work through the year on the international labs and we'll have some more favorable compares, Jay, if you can expand on that. -- Yes. Just some additional context setting, our overall business performance internationally was quite strong, we solved the 12.5% normalized CAG recurring growth performance and as Brian indicated in his remarks, really strong competitive and new placements associated economic value with the International consumables growth at nearly 20% normalized. So overall, very good performance, as I indicated, we're still in the process of building out the VDC expansion and yeah the fixed time as our VDCs continue to build relationships with their customers in the markets and we know with time comes additional effectiveness. Keep in mind that we started with very strong country organizations. A lot of our sales professionals and country managers in international have been with the company in nondiagnostics for a decade or two decades. So that's the base, we're building up on and additional the representing phenomenal product line across that broad-based diagnostics offering, so we're feeling good about where we are and expect to continue to build up that capability in the second half. -- And just to reinforce something Mike on performance versus expectations ,we felt very good about the recurring CAG growth in the quarter, if you normalize the effects we highlighted it was 11.5%, that's where we are year-to-date, in range with what we're trying to achieve for the full year. So relative to what we were targeting. this was an area that was right in line with what we're hoping to achieve. -- All right, that's helpful. And a quick follow-on, if I could. I've got [Indecipherable] questions. Since you brought up the comments on China, that was a little bit surprising. Could you just walk us through what happened there, what you saw in the quarter, what your expectations are for the rest of the year? -- Yes, we had a couple of effects that were related to China. Let me break them down, and it may be LPDs. the user want to start with, we've been working through the African swine fever impact. As you know, China is not a big part of our overall company revenues. It's 2.6% last year roughly, evenly split between LPD and CAG and the -- but within the LPD business the swine testing business in China is a meaningful part of our LPD revenues and we saw an acceleration in decline on the African swine fever from the Q1 levels. It's a business still little tougher to predict, we sell into larger laboratories and so it's a little less visibility than some other aspects of our business, but that was a couple of million below what we were expecting to achieve in the quarter and we feel like we've got that reasonably calibrated, we've got some other initiatives we're advancing to mitigate that and we've got some promising trends in other parts of the business, health herd screening that we feel good about. So I think the net-net, we think we've got that factored in, but that was a surprise in Q2. On instrument placements, we had excellent competitive instrument placements in China, the challenge that we had was we had very strong prior year VetTest upgrades as well and I think in retrospect, we probably had overly aggressive goals going into this year to both to make progress on the competitive -- noncompetitive front and to build on those strong upgrade. So it's always been a competitive market, wouldn't necessarily related to softness in the market per se. I think it's more, as I mentioned, in retrospect that we probably had aggressive goals there but I think there is, that's another point of contact. So China is smaller for us overall, but I think in the quarter had some impacts, but we feel we've got that calibrated in the updated outlook. -- That's really helpful. Thanks.Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels, William Blair. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. And I will also start by wishing Jon the best in his rehabilitation. Jay, maybe one for you, you talked about the record enrollment of fixed 370 practices in the IDEXX Preventive Care program. Can you speak a little bit toward what's driving that, it seems a little bit unique. I think we typically see kind of a rapid growth in early adopters and then [Indecipherable] slowly in the vet space, so what's driving such strong momentum there for your business. -- Sure. Thank you . Ryan for the question. We think it really starts with the fact that there is a very sizable market opportunity and I'm going to refer my comment specifically to North America, in the US, we think that the US Preventive Care market, addressable market is about $3 billion, [Indecipherable] about $1 billion Navidea serve that and we have about a third of that. So we're still in the early stages of being able to develop this marketplace. And then you look at just that sort of benchmark and provide some background context on the opportunity, you know a fairly small percentage of companion animals are getting tested today. We've cited statistics and data in the past that about 15% of dogs coming to a practice for clinical visits undergo a chemistry test, only 15%, and that vector borne disease side, little over third. So 36% canines in any given year get some form of vector-borne disease screening that could be something as basic as heartworm, only 15% are getting the full vector-borne disease screen, 4Dx. It starts with this a very sizable opportunity and then from a programmatic standpoint the IDEXX Preventive Care program I think it really hits the sweet spot in the marketplace. We have care protocols designed specifically for preventative care, wellness screening, it's price that really drive compliance with the client, we are able to provide tools and training for the practices and repeat follow-ups. So from the standpoint of operationalizing or implementing a concept that our customers are quite interested in to begin with, but I have struggled in the past, to be able to get good traction with this, we think we have really hit the sweet spot and our field is trained and excited by it. And consequently, driving growth with it. -- Super helpful color. And then just as a follow-up on a different topic, the operating margin performance continue to display upward pressure despite the investments you're making. Can you maybe highlight what some of the key deltas are between prior expectations versus kind of the expectations you had going into the year, what are really the major upside drivers there. Thanks. -- Yes, I think a couple of factors. I think we always benefit from good execution on growing the CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. So I think there the incremental flow-through from that growth is high gross margin for us. And. I think that always if we're executing well, which we have been, supports a good P&L profile. We have had, as I mentioned in my comment, somewhat slower-than-anticipated ramp in some of the growth we're projecting for R&D and sales and marketing, nothing to be concerned about. It's more just in a world where there's a lot of competition for talent, where we don't have all our positions filled the way that we had originally projected. And we're confident we can get on that track, but we had some upside related to that. And we've had good G&A management, we've been disciplined in the corporate functions, we had better-than-expected benefit costs, which is something that we have -- our HR team does a tremendous job of managing that area and I think we're seeing good results as a company from thatthat's been favorable. And so those are some of the drivers. I think it's broadly Ryan more just reflective of the health of our business model when we're growing the recurring CAG revenues well that has good favorability for us. -- Thanks for the call.Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open . -- Great, thanks. And I do wish Jon all the best in his recovery as well, we are all thinking about him here and thanks for taking my questions as well. I guess a follow-up to the last question there kind of on the profit experience that obviously was pretty strong and were there any some timing dynamics, were you saying that some of the costs were potentially pushed out to the outer quarters or how should we be contemplating that quarterly cadence in terms of the profit dynamics for the balance of the year. -- Somewhat more modest. I would say in terms of pushing out timing and I think it's more of the ramp of the costs, Erin . So we are a little favorable in Q2 and we're anticipating we will be back on track in the back half of the year and that's reflected, we shared a 50 to 100 basis point constant-currency improvement in Q3. So that reflects that we're seeing the cost growth particularly in R&D and in the international sales and marketing going to ramping as we work through the year.So it. We had that I would say is the bigger driver was -- and we had some specific benefits just in terms of things that we've been managing effectively in the quarter, but we feel comfortable with effectively where we have an outlook for the second half. That's more 50 to 100 basis points, which is in line with our longer-term trends and goals. -- Okay, great, thanks. And then on the preventative care side what could adding instead of your urine analysis to the program add for you, is this significant in terms of financial contributions or placement trends are and how much of your existing tenant preventative care users are actually already incorporating your urine analysis in their program. I'm just curious what this could add.Thanks. -- So we thank you for the question. We think over time that it will help support. So our preventative care momentum over, there is a majority of customers who already use urine as part of the testing panel for preventative care, and one of the requests from customers that they wanted to use measure because it's more clinically relevant. So being able to provide multi modality screen for customers was extremely well received in the marketplace. We're enthusiastic about it and we think it also by the way, help [Indecipherable] over time. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks guys, good morning. Maybe two questions on some similar themes that were already touched upon, but just to go to preventative care, I think, Jay, you might have mentioned roughly a 300 basis point premium growth rate from those called it PCC adopters or just non-adopters and maybe you can elaborate on that a little bit. Do you think we see that delta why didn't further over time. And maybe if you were to isolate the practices that did adopt PCC where were they previously, in other words, where they 7% or 8% jump to 14% or 15% anymore granularity would be helpful. Thanks. -- Yeah. just in terms of that 300 basis point improvement, we think that those customers are using more diagnostics that they have got from largely testing geriatric patients that testing adopted senior patients and incorporating diagnostics in their-in their panels. I think what the data shows is that they had perhaps assumed that if a dog or cat was well and was an adult, but they did do diagnostic testing, they didn't need to do it and what the data showing is that there are very significant -- we're able to uncover -- very significant number of abnormalities that require follow up in doing testing. So we think that it's just a classic case of being able to demonstrate that the clinical benefit of doing testing more broadly across the population of patients, in terms of how that plays out differentially in terms of growth over time, we'll see, we expect that continue to see benefits, but that's a, that's a function of ... -- Jo we will share more in that at Investor Day that's obviously part of the long-term strategy and will share how we're thinking about them. -- Okay, great. And then sort of a quick follow-up, two small ones, first on new products, you got that Analyst Day coming up. Right. As you just mentioned, if you got a lot to discuss what is the belief that new product introductions or more of, call it an industry conference event rather than a Wall Street event and the other small one would just be on the $5 million inorganic revs coming down and certainly seem like it did not occur in CAG recurring. So we were to isolate it Brian, is sort of 50-50 between, call it LPD and the instrument side. Thanks guys. -- Yeah. two questions. And just on the first one let's say is we intend to have discussions on new products when we're ready to bring them to market. So I think we're, you should anticipate we'll have those discussions, close to when we're ready to bring products to market and we're not going to be trying to time at around investor events, if you will know events. But I think we want to have this lined up as best we can in terms of executing with their business. And in terms of the -- the dynamics versus deltas versus our expectation in the quarter, Jon, that was pretty much it was three things. It was the international upgrades where we had great competitive placements, but we are probably a little aggressive on trying to do that and build on the upgrades. It was LPD China specifically African swine fever effects and to a degree, we had underestimated the days impacts in Europe somewhat. We didn't flag that 0.5% impact heading into the quarter. And we know there were some impact, but that turned out to be just where the days fell a little bit more significant than we anticipated but some total that was about $5 million $6 million delta to where we thought will come in and we're basically just flowing that through. We think it's largely second quarter and we calibrated effectively and feel very good about the year. And as you pointed out, recurring CAG right on track and healthy year-to-date trends right in line with we're hoping to achieved for the full year. -- Perfect, thanks for your time guys.Thank you. And as a reminder [Operator Instructions]. We will go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thank you. And I also want to send my best regards to Jon in his recovery. I guess my first question is just on the, how you guys are thinking about. I know you're not ready to guide for 2020 but you've posted some really strong growth in premium instruments as you've talked about in recent quarters and you are going up against a difficult compare as we think about our models for next year. Recognizing that instruments are only 6% of your revenue, how do you think about growth rates in instruments going forward given difficult compares . -- We intend to continue to build on our rate of placements. I think that the more important metrics to kind of focus on are broader than just placement growth, we're obviously as we're growing our placements, expanding our install base that supported by improving retention so we pointed out in this quarter the 15% percent year-on-year growth in the North American Catalyst install base of 5.5 points of that is the, Banfield expansion and 28% internationally. So we're, this is a business where if we're adding more instruments and doing a better job retaining our customers that installed base continues to grow, its the flywheel effect and that forms the foundation for additional drivers of growth. Right. In terms of expanding adoption of our innovations on this platform -- on our platforms, adding new innovations as we've done in recent years as well.And that's all supported by the enhanced commercial capability that we have, the VDC model and that all flows into the strong double-digit recurring CAG growth delivering and we intend to deliver in the future. So it's, it's one metric as you pointed out where we're building on bigger numbers, we want to keep growing on that but there is a broader model here in terms of driving increased utilization and innovation on these platforms that grow in capability over time that that support the double-digit growth. -- And just to add some color to Brian's remarks. The key element of our of our strategy, Mark, is to be able to continue to drive menu expansion, which in turn supports the CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. So if you take a look at Catalyst, for example, we have a technology for life type philosophy, 7 new assays as part of the menu in 7 years latest being progesterone. It's a great example of bringing a real time care measurement to the clinic. As you know, the [Indecipherable] event is a tight window in the veterinary and wants to be able to advise the breeder in terms of the optimal time and you're able to do that in a real-time basis with Catalyst in the clinic, that drives serial testing. In the case of SediVue, you got a great example, with SediVue, the Neural Network 4.0 which we released earlier in the year, based on $75 million images more geared toward in the 4.0 release, liver function, bilirubin and ammonium. So we've got excellent customer feedback on that, that we continue to drive through menu expansion more, more testing utilization. So that's a key element of our strategy. -- Excellent. And I also wanted to just ask about the end market trends look strong to us, you reported clinical visits grew 2.1% this quarter, do you expect clinical visits to hover in that, call it 2% growth rate. And then I also wanted to ask about how you're thinking about competitive dynamics for next year given Zoetis expecting to complete their integration of Abaxis on their SAP.? -- Yes. So from a market performance standpoint topline practice revenue growth was 4.4% that the clinical piece you indicated was 2.1%. We think that's the relevant piece for at least for our business, because that's where the diagnostic testing occurs as part of those visits but pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past as a little bit of variability quarter-to-quarter, but we think it was a strong quarter. It supports the CAG Diagnostics recurring growth profile that we achieved in the quarter and that we've indicated from an outlook standpoint we expect going forward. And I also think that when you take a look at some of our market development activities like preventative care, that will continue to drive the market part of what we do is we create markets we manufacture our own growth. In terms of the, your second question on competitive dynamics, we haven't up to now see the change more broadly speaking in the competitive landscape. We're always looking and anticipating that, but our focus is really on our customers and servicing our customers with solutions that address both their clinical and business needs. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open . -- Thank you for taking the question. And my best to Jon as well. So can you give us an update qualitatively or quantitatively on SDMA on a slide, is it running above, below or at expectations in terms of contributing to growth. And how do you see this as a kind of a multi-year growth driver. Thank you.Yeah. Thank you, David for the question. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made on our Catalyst SDMA. In fact, close to 60% of customers in the second quarter actually used SDMA on Catalyst, that's a global number since introduction, or close to 70% of customers have actually purchased SDMA for Catalyst. Another benchmark connected with that is, we've now run over $2 million SDMA tests on Catalyst since its introduction. Now that's on top of the 22 million test plus 22 million plus tests that we run at the global reference labs since introducing that test on the reference lab. So we think from a customer perspective -- customers have really accepted SDMA as an essential element of the chemistry panel, they see significant clinical value, not just for sick patient visit but also well visit testing. One study, it will share more of this at Investor Day is looking at well patient testing. When we move from a just a basic preventive care straight, so chemistry, CBC the one that includes SDMA. We see a 40% increase in profiles that indicate the need for further action. So really clinically powerful. I think our customers appreciate that and we're seeing the type of uptake in the metrics, I shared with you that support it. -- Got. All right, thank you. And then I'm just maybe to around consolidators in corporate clients. Can you talk about changes in demand around software, middleware [Indecipherable] Smart Flow. Are these good conversation starters, are these revenue drivers, are they kind of maybe cross selling opportunities. Can you just walk us through the more the software part element of the corporate customer base. Thank you.I'd be glad to do so. Just as a background, keep in mind that you know the whole notion of corporates and consolidation, it's not a new dynamic in the marketplace, IDEXX has quite a successful track record in partnering and growing with corporate accounts over time. But when you talk to the corporate account CEOs, they generally identify commonly three top issues. One is staff engagement and retention, the second one that you pointed out is really this notion of enterprise scale in IT and software, and the third is want a continued drive or improve profitable growth in their corporate practices, and we address all three, as a company. Starts with diagnostics because diagnostics is connected to the information management piece and they I think recognize diagnostics as a profit center, it drives the care envelope. It's an important part of their practices, that is in subject some of the same headwinds that they may see in product sales whether it's food or therapies and there's a lot of evidence that when we provide these type of solutions to them their staff who desire to practice best medicine remain more highly engaged. From an information management standpoint, now getting specifically the core of your question, our customers are corporate customers, place a very high premium on integration and helping them out with workflow and workflow optimization and the type of solutions that support that are Cornerstone or PIM Solutions, SmartFlow VetConnect PLUS, enterprise management and analytics packages that we come up with. SmartFlow is a great example where they are really resonating with an application that works with our PIMS and other third-party PIMS that provide embedded connectivity that helps them with workflow, optimization and communication in the staff, it automatically captures charges, if they desire to go paperless or paperless slight, it has electronic forms. So these are the types of things that they are looking for and highly responsive to. -- Great, thank you.Next we'll go to the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for the question. A lot has already been asked, so I'll keep it quick. But just as we think about kind of IDEXX 360 and more conversations about leveraging the multi-modality approach, how has that evolved relative to kind of layering in your end like you mentioned, and some of the dynamics competitively. Has there been any change there and how do you continue to drive that as it really a competitive advantage for IDEXX relative to what others in the space can replicate. -- Yes. So we obviously have differentiation, because we have multi-modality solutions and have the ability, like we've just with the IDEXX anywhere urinalysis bundle, to be able to provide the best clinically from a solutions standpoint wherever it makes sense to be tested. So I think it's largely supportive of helping the practice, the way they want to. -- And I'd point out, we've seen steadily increasing rates of growth in cross CAG agreements with our customers and that's been a trend that's been ongoing, but really has accelerated with concepts like 360 and the advancements that we continue to make and just bringing together broader capability to information management innovation and so to your point, it's an area that is building momentum and you see that in the strong growth in EVI and as well as increasing retention rates across modalities . So it's -- it's definitely been core to IDEXX's strategy for a long time, and we're executing very well again with certain programs like 360 to just help to reinforce that. -- Okay and then just one more quick one, I think, following up on a question that I think Jon asked, but when we think about preventative care and the uptick in growth relative to the base, can you help us think about sort of the ramp of how fast an account says, all right we want to layered in with the pricing, you suggest, etc., etc., to seeing that that outcome. What the sort of the ramp looks like and how, if there's any kind of color, we should be thinking about or you think about the tail to that as we get out further from the first year, the second year, I know it's still early, but any color there would be great. -- Yeah, I mean, just keep in mind from a background standpoint that it takes time. It's a change management event in the practice. It's not just the veterinarians, but the veterinary techs, receptionist, the whole practice has to change, focus into a new testing category or approach. So it takes time. We'll share some insights at Investor Day in terms of what that looks like, but there is no one role that fits all. -- A very good progress and it's supporting our high reference lab growth and we're seeing benefits across the business. So it's something that'll -- that will build over time and like many of the things that we have in our business there is a very long runway for development, which bodes well for sustaining high growth for the long run. We have time for one more question.There will be a follow-up from the line of Michael Ryskin, Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for squeezing me for the follow-up. I just want to confirm something from the prepared remarks, I thought I heard you say that the 3rd quarter organic guide was 10.5% to 12% for the total company, I recognize, you've got the extra selling day and that should be a sizable 100 to 150 bps tailwind but that's still, just trying to look at the comps from prior year. You still have a much tougher comp 3Q versus 4Q? So I was wondering if there's anything other than going on in pacing between 3rd quarter and 4th quarter as you go through the year and also how you think about some of the, you called out the guide for the second quarter, OUS instrument placements may have been too aggressive. So, I just want to get a sense of how the aggressive guidance in 2Q factored into your outlook for 3rd quarter and beyond. -- I'd, just on the 3rd quarter, we talked about to restate 9.5% to 10.5% overall organic and 10.5% to 12% recurring with the day-to-day and a half and I think the day benefit is a little bit higher on the recurring piece, Mike. So it's, largely reflective of the year-to date-trends adjusting for the -- the days and we feel very good about our momentum and our ability to deliver that. So it's not anything specific to Q3 timing, other than the day change. -- Okay, got you. I think I heard you wrong in the overall number then. -- I would say on the instrument, look we're, as you know we've got, we're always trying to build off of high base, we were executing very well on driving EVI gains and expanding our Catalyst install base and we think we've got our full year and back half outlook appropriately calibrated. -- Thanks.Okay, thank you all. With that, we'll conclude the call, I want to thank our employees for the very strong progress and performance in Q2 in the advancement of our purpose, which is enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock around the world.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IDXX options chain for the new August 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $240.00 strike price has a current bid of 35 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $240.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $239.65 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $278.12/share today.\n\nBecause the $240.00 strike represents an approximate 14% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of IDXX stock at the current price level of $278.12/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $280.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.55% if the stock gets called away at the August 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IDXX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing IDXX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $280.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $280.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

But the last rookie set a high bar for him: Senior analyst Emily Flippen notched a new record score in her debut. Can Bush do better than Flippen? Can you do better than Bush? We'll find out. And of course, along the way, Bush and Gardner will share some investing insights that could be valuable to you.To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our .

After all, the newsletter they\u00a0have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0quadrupled the market.*\u00a0David and Tom\u00a0just revealed what they believe are the\u00a0\u00a0for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0to learn about these picks! At the end of every quarter, a lot of money managers are indulging in something known as window-dressing, where within their mutual funds, they're selling off losers and buying winners -- in order to show publicly at the end of that quarter all the stocks they have in their fund, which they're required to do, and they like to show winners. We don't window-dress at . We're not a mutual fund. Why would we do that?What does the end of the quarter mean to us? It means \"The Market Cap Game Show: Episode 8,\" coming up.[...]Hi! Welcome to the Market Cap Game Show! I'm David Gardner, host of   happens about 12 out of every 13 weeks of every quarter, but one of those weeks is our game show. I'm really happy this time to be joined by a brand-new contestant, my friend Aaron Bush! Please say hello! Hello, everybody! Honored to be here! Thank you, David! Absolutely! Aaron, you and I have worked together for years at , more recently at . Spectacular launch of that service, Aaron! Not a bad beginning. We picked stocks. Initially we did with Matt Argersinger, and then we added Emily Flippen to our team. But we picked those stocks in December of this year. Roughly, where's that 20-plus-stock portfolio for members, just six months later? We're up about 60% right now. Which is amazing! And one of the companies in that  portfolio will be one of the 10 stocks today on the Market Cap Game Show. Just a little bit of a spoiler alert.So, the Market Cap Game Show. A lot of you, I hope, have listened to at least one of these. But we always have new listeners every quarter we do this. So I think the first thing, Aaron, is that we should briefly define \"market cap.\" Could you please define \"market capitalization\"? Sure. The market cap is how big a company is. It's the size of however many shares there are, multiplied by the share price. Ultimately, that leads to a company like  being $500 billion. That is roughly their market cap, I think. It's roughly the size, and that's priced based on future cash flows, future expectations, etc. That's right. So all stock prices are set every single day, even as we speak, as you're listening to us. If the stock market's open, people are shaking hands right now, a buyer is shaking hands with the seller saying someone's in, someone's out, at that price. That price, multiplied by the number of shares, in total for that company, is the price tag for that company. Aaron, you gave a good example of Facebook. Let's go with another example, the traditional example that we use for the Market Cap Game Show. What is the company? I believe it is . You're absolutely right. Etsy, Aaron, 120 million shares outstanding for Etsy, the stock recently at $66.95 as we're taping -- 120 million times $66.95 is, what? Off the top of my head, that is about $8.05 billion . Thank you very much for that, taking it out to a second decimal. So Foolish of you. So, yeah, that's how it works. Now, if you're new, you know why the market cap matters: It gives you a quick sense of how big these companies are. If a company is at a $100 billion price tag, that's a lot bigger than a company at a $10 billion price tag. Sometimes, if we really like both of them equally, we'll start thinking maybe we should recommend or buy the smaller company because maybe it has an easier chance of doubling or tripling from $10 billion than from $100 billion. But the truth is, Aaron, as you well know, we have companies at all ranges of sizes. It's not really so much what the market cap is today. It's where we think it might go one day. Yeah. Most people, when they buy a stock, focus so much on the price. The price per share. Right, the price per share, not the price of the total company. And that's just backwards, David. It's backwards. It is. I think it's because people have never been taught market capitalization. They didn't have a game show that they could grow up with around the fire, calling the family and all the cousins in, multigenerations sitting around the fire listening to the Market Cap Game Show. Is that how it is in your household, David? [laughs] I always picture it in a very Norman Rockwell way, not just for me and my household, Aaron, but for you and your extended household, and everybody's. That's just how I picture things. Maybe I don't have it right. It's quite the dream. [laughs] [laughs] So, Aaron, of course I want to launch right into the game. But as is my wont, I went back and listened to last episode, Episode 7 of the Market Cap Game Show. And I just wanted to humorously reflect on -- with Emily, in this case -- how I was leading off the top of that show.I was talking about the hype around IPOs in 2019. \"Hype\" is a neutral term for me; I'm not cynical. There's a lot of excitement about these, and some of these have been great IPOs.  had recently come public when we taped in March of 2019. I was talking about how   would come out and come public somewhere around $100 billion. And I was saying, probably I wouldn't recommend that stock, because it's already $100 billion. How high could Uber go? On May 23, 2018 , for  -- we don't usually give away new service recommendations, but for this one exception, I will make an exception -- May 23, Uber was my new pick for . That was only a few weeks ago. I'd forgotten that I was inveighing against that three months ago on this game show. What made you change your mind? I think it was specifically, Aaron, that the IPO came out, and Lyft had fallen off some, so Uber came out of the gate not with a really hyped, exciting IPO. In fact, a lot of the stories -- you'll remember, it wasn't too long ago, people were saying it was a failed IPO, it didn't do so well. So, it started to fall. In fact, Uber, today, the stock is at $44 a share. Again, some people who don't know market cap think that that's the value of the company. But you and I know, and we all know because we just defined it, that $44 a share is just the price per share. But if you were to multiply that by the number of Uber shares, you'd get Uber's market cap, which is roughly...? [It's] $75 billion. That's exactly right! Well done! $75 billion. So already, Uber is priced $25-billion-plus less than initial expectations. So that started making the contrarian in me start to rise up a little bit and roar. People think Uber isn't ever going to make money, this is not a good company, these kinds of things. So I was like: \"I think Uber is going to be around a long time.\" [snaps] It passes [snaps] the snap test, which I did a couple of weeks ago on the show, picking some stocks; Uber clearly, for me, passes the snap test. So that's why I recommend it. I'm happy to say, we picked it at $40.47, Aaron. It's $44 today, so it's up almost 10%. Beating the market so far. We'll see. So far, so good! Do you own Uber? I do not. Would you ever buy it? I'm open to it. I think, similar to you, I just have recognized that it already is a big company. Also, of course, companies change, they grow, they improve, but just seeing how much money Uber is burning right now, just looking at that makes my eyes bleed a little bit. Understood. I'm open to it, but I think I like other things a little bit more. Not the top of your watch list. Not the very top. Well, maybe some of the 10 stocks featured on this Market Cap Game Show may not just be on your watch list, but in your portfolio. We'll see, Aaron. I want a couple of ground rules, first of all. Aaron has no idea which stocks I picked. He's been in the soundproof booth the entire time. This is a surprise to him. Aaron, is it fair to say you're a little nervous? You know that feeling when your teacher quizzes you in front of class, you have a little bit of anxiety? Now, imagine that your co-founder, your mentor -- your boss, in some sense -- is quizzing you in front of thousands of people. It feels a little bit like that. But also, we're talking about stocks, we're talking about investing. I love hanging out with you, David! Thank you! So, the pros definitely outweigh the cons here. That's really well-put! And you grew up with this stuff, Aaron. Few people are better-positioned to succeed than you. We realize this is just one sample size, 10 stocks. You're not even actively working on  anymore, or . You have some other callings here at The Fool. So, you're looking at a stock universe that you don't look at up and down every day for full pay, salary, here at The Fool. Somewhat. How many stocks are in the  universe right now? Two hundred thirty-eight, although that includes some doubles, like ['s] Google A and Google B  ,  and . Tracking stocks. So, this is a random 4% or so of that universe? Yes. Is it is somewhat randomized. I do kind of randomize from the universe, but I'm typically going to be favoring companies that it's at least interesting to talk about. I'm not going to take some obscure tiny biotech which we would have to explain to people unless I randomized it and decided to include it this time. We'll have to see. Well, I look forward to whatever you throw at me. Hopefully I don't embarrass myself too much! So, ground rule No. 1, Aaron, you have no idea what's coming. God bless you!Ground rule No. 2, while Aaron might think it's about him, and I might think it's about me, and we're just talking to each other in-studio, nope! That's incorrect. This is about you! Ground rule No. 2, you are playing the game along with us. I'll always pause, give you a moment to think about what your number is, and you're going to play against Aaron. In fact, let's go ahead and rock the hashtags in the coming week: #IBeatAaron, #ILostToAaron, #ITiedAaron. Let us know how you're doing. We play this game for you; Aaron's just a foil and I'm just the empty card-reader emcee.Finally, ground rule No. 3, we accept answers within a 20% range above and below the actual market cap. Earlier, Aaron, you rocked some math for us. You said Etsy was $8 billion: Twenty percent higher than that is $1.6 billion, [so] $9.6 billion down to $6.4 billion, that's the range. [And] $6.4 billion up to $9.6 billion would be all correct, guessing the market cap for Etsy, which will not be one of the 10 stocks. It's kind of Valhalla, where it's the eternal example that we'll use at the start of every show. No gimme for you, Aaron! That's fair! [laughs] So, I think we have all three ground rules set. It's time to play the Market Cap Game Show (TM).[music]So, Aaron, one of my favorite things about you -- I like a lot about you, I really do -- but one of my favorite things is that I remember talking to you from your college dorm room via Skype back in the day, just chatting. I remember that. That was fun! It was! You were a freshman at the University of Texas. Yes. I remember that you grew up with The Motley Fool. Your mother in particular was a longtime member -- is, I hope, still a longtime member. Still is, absolutely! You interned with us as a younger kid. And there I was, talking to you from your dorm room, University of Texas. Within a year or two, where were you? I was right here with you, David. Here at Fool HQ. That's right! You, in fact, decided -- what was your thinking at the time? You decided, \"I'm going to leave Texas. I'm just going to go to work for The Fool.\" Well, I kind of already knew, for the most part, what I wanted to do. Having been in school for a little while, I knew I had a better sense of what I could get out of school and what I could learn for what I want to do. Take that, take the financial elements of it. And I just realized, most people, when they think about dropping out, in a lot of senses, they think backwards about the risk. In my mind, it would have been riskier to not take an opportunity that was presented in front of me, where instead of having to pay for school, I get paid; where plan B, going back to school, was always right there the whole time. So I figured, hey, let's see how this goes. I can always go back.But I feel good, The Motley Fool's a great place with great people, I get to do what I love to do, and hopefully get better at it. So far, it's working out, and I'm really happy that it is. It has been our good fortune. Now, obviously, this is a choice that is not right for everybody. I know there are probably some parents, again, right there at the fire with multigenerations all around listening, Norman Rockwell style, to this game show. And they're like, \"Please, Aaron, don't tell my son or daughter to leave college!\" That's true. The key to dropping out is all about dropping in to something better. Don't just drop out for the sake of dropping out. Have a clear sense of what you're going to do next. That's awesome! Now, running the numbers, as we are wont to do at The Fool -- I think it's fairly compelling these days with such high college tuitions and a lot of student debt, which has become a social crisis -- you start running the numbers on \"instead of having paid that tuition, if I'd invested that, and then let that compound over the course of time...\": It can be pretty stark. Absolutely, 100%! I know I've said this in front of the crowd that we had at Fool Fest, our big event where lots of members come and join us. Just a few weeks ago. I said that I think higher ed is the next big short. I think that's true. It might take some time for that to pan out, but absolutely, I think the cost of college and the debt load that it is imposing on an entire generation right now -- something's going to have to break at some point, and we will come up with better solutions as a society. I believe that. I'm optimistic about that. I've enjoyed the conversation. I'm almost reminded that we're playing a game, aren't we? Yes. We're actually playing a game. It makes sense to have had that conversation since Company No. 1 is  , ticker TWOU. This is a company, speaking of Fool Fest, where the CEO Chip Paucek was one of our guests at Fool Fest a few weeks ago. 2U is a company that enables people to distance-learn, to -- via remote positions -- participate in the classrooms, get degrees. More graduate- than undergraduate-focused. A company that has been a Rule Breaker for the last couple of years.If things do change, if all of a sudden tuition is just too high, maybe 2U's positioned, with some optionality, to start taking some of that business and educating people at a cheaper rate using the internet. Chip, the CEO, would be the first to say that's not the plan; I asked him that, and he said that's not the plan. That wouldn't make his partners -- some esteemed universities like University of North Carolina, or Berkeley, Georgetown -- they wouldn't be very happy about that. But thinking out loud, it seems at least a possibility.Aaron Bush, I know you're already thinking about it. What's the market cap of 2U? I'm going to give our listeners at home, around the family hearth, a quick sec to think about what 2U's market cap is. All right, that second is now over. Aaron, within 20% either way, what is the market cap of 2U? [It's] $2.2 billion.[ding] Wow! That was really good! The answer as we speak is $2.4 billion. You were really, really close. Players at home, if you were anywhere from $1.9 billion up to $2.9 billion, go ahead and give yourself a star, a check. Count it as a single. You're on base. Aaron, you're on base. Your first-ever Market Cap Game Show stock! I got a hit! You're 1 for 1, baby! You're batting a thousand. I could end right here and call it a perfect batting average. But I'm in for the love of the game. Do you have any thoughts about 2U? They kind of remind me of    in a sense that I think they own the category that they're in, in large part. When a university wants to optimize distance education for master's degrees and such, it makes a lot of sense for them to partner with 2U, [which] has a track record of off-loading a lot of the heavy technical and operational burden. For schools that are looking to do that, and I think more and more schools are looking for more flexible programs, 2U is really well-positioned. I think it's similar to Zillow in the sense that, in the same way that a lot of schools rely on 2U, a lot of real estate agents rely on Zillow in order to build attention, have options for consumers who are looking to buy or sell a home.What I like about Zillow that I'm not seeing in 2U right now, though, is that Zillow recognizes where the future is heading. CEO Rich Barton is back. He's going to change Zillow up. They're starting to buy properties now. Right. I think the future of real estate is that more technology platforms will be the intermediaries for transactions. I don't want to go too off the grid here on this, but instead of getting bids just from lots of different individuals, you'll also get your bid from Zillow, you'll get your bid from Opendoor. They're taking the necessary steps to change where the future is going. 2U, I don't see them making those steps to go to where the future is heading. They're partnered with the status quo. It's a big industry. It is, and it's been around for hundreds of years. Brands like Harvard and Yale -- Hook 'em Horns, University of Texas. Yeah, UT. These brands have been around longer than most companies. So, I totally understand why they want to support the status quo; their business is supported by it. But I'm not sure that's where the future is heading if you're really looking for transformational growth. But we'll see. It's a massive market. Tons of people go get education anyways. Hopefully there can be more than one winner there. Before we go to stock No. 2, I first picked 2U in  in 2016. It's up 7% since then, which might sound good; the problem is, the market's up 43% since then. 2U had more than doubled in that first year or two. It was a strong winner. But it really has sold off. It's been cut in half over the past year. We'll have to see -- very interesting company going forward.Company No. 2. When I think of all the internet early on companies, and how well-known they are today, the ones that survived -- for example, you may have heard of . Yes. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon.com. You know that company? I'm familiar. What year were you born? I was born in '94, the end of '94. That's awesome! I mean, that's right around when Bezos started the company. You're about as old as Amazon! I am! I think The Fool is right around there, too, if I'm not mistaken. We are, July of 1993 -- a newsletter to our parents' friends. We launched on AOL August of 1994. There was another company back then that was perceived to be an even bigger deal than Amazon for some years. We even, I think, at different points, as Rule Breakers, thought, \"This company has a better model. They're bigger than Amazon.\" Later, they started rocking , which was the way to pay for the goods on this company's platform. The company is  , EBAY. And yet, when I think about the companies that are still around today and still pretty big, it's amazing how seemingly off the reservation eBay is within the global conversation of e-commerce, etc.So, yeah, eBay, it's still out there. It's still profitable. It's prospering. It's pretty big today. I'm on the Wikipedia page right now for eBay. Of course, Wikipedia pages can change. By the time, dear listener, you look this up, it might have changed. But as of right now, this is a line in the first paragraph of the eBay Wikipedia page. Here it is, I quote: \"eBay is a multibillion-dollar business with operations in about 30 countries, as of 2011.\" Wow!So, eight years ago, they were in about 30 countries. That's the present-day Wikipedia page talking about where eBay is globally as of 2011. Someone needs to update that. I agree. Our listeners are smart. I wouldn't be surprised if we go ahead and do that. A lot of people wouldn't know that Devin Wenig is the CEO of eBay today. A lot of people still think about maybe Meg Whitman, or they think about Pierre Omidyar, who basically started this company -- as, by the way, AuctionWeb, and the date was Sept. 3, 1995. Wow! They pretty much clubbed us, because The Motley Fool pretty sure has a sub-billion-dollar market cap. This company, hint hint, no big spoiler alert, has a larger than $1 billion market cap. They started after us. They crushed us from a size standpoint.Aaron and my players at home, within 20% either way, what is the market cap today of eBay? [It's] $25 billion.[buzz] No. Not far off, but too far off for me to give you a correct answer. Now, I know many of our listeners who are smarter than we are probably got this one right, Aaron, and you weren't far off. It hurts me a little bit not to be able to give this to you. But the market cap of eBay today is $35 billion. At the low end, dear players, if you said $28 [billion] or higher, and at the high end, if you said $42 [billion] or lower -- $28 [billion] to $42 [billion]. That's simple math, right? Twenty percent of 35 is just 7. As a football fan, I know that: seven, 14, 21, 28, 35. So $28 [billion] to $42 [billion], correct answer for eBay. Not far off, Aaron! It's a bummer. I've actually never bought anything on eBay, so I was skewing low based off personal experience of, \"a lot of people might be like me.\" But I guess there are some people out there that like eBay a little more than I do. [laughs] Isn't it amazing? The company's worth $35 billion. I just don't feel like eBay gets the respect or press attention of companies one-third its size. eBay also owns other things. StubHub. Yeah, they own StubHub. And they have a big classifieds business, too, which is bigger, I think, outside the U.S. than in the U.S. But, yeah, without piecing those things together...props to whoever out there got it right. It started with Beanie Babies back in the day. In  in 2002, I originally recommended PayPal, and then eBay bought PayPal in full some years after that. Then, later, eBay spun PayPal back out. Today, it is a thriving corporation. I'm not exactly sure what PayPal's market cap is today. Let's go with $145 billion. Wow! Aaron, nice! That won't be one of the companies in this Market Cap Game Show, but impressive that you could rock that. Interesting, isn't it, to think that it's five times the size the market cap of eBay today? PayPal, which was an upstart back in the day. Anyway, fascinating couple of companies. Both winners to buy and hold. In fact, last five years, eBay's stock up 90%; market up 45%. eBay has doubled the market for patient shareholders over these last five years.Company No. 3. Now, Aaron, earlier I mentioned that one of the 20-plus  stocks is featured in this Market Cap Game Show. So I'm thinking you're probably a ringer for this. Not only that, but this one came up last time with Emily. And, indeed, one year ago on the show with Matt Argersinger, I asked him about this company; he got it wrong. Emily got it right. I'm going to predict, Aaron, that you get it right. Have you ever used Tinder? I actually have not, no. You've never used Tinder? I have never used a   product. Amazing! To me, anybody under the age of 30 probably has at least swiped left or right at some point. I think that's true, pretty much. Except for you! I mean, I guess I just haven't had issues out there. [laughs] [laughs] Well, it's not even necessarily issues. This is the No. 3 way that people globally meet their spouse or partner. I believe, Aaron, that you have a girlfriend. I do! Good, so you don't need the online medium. I don't think she would approve of this market research. [laughs] I appreciate that. And I will say also that I've never used a Match.com or Tinder product myself. But, indeed, Match Group has been a wonderful stock. It's been a winner. And anybody who's listened to  has probably heard me mention it over the months and years. It's one of those that we keep going back to, as it passes the snap test big-time for me. It's one of those companies I think we could all own and do really well on in the next 10, 20 years. Just buy and hold, and keep watching this global winner prosper.Aaron and players at home, within 20% either way, what is the market cap of Match Group, MTCH? Let's go with $20 billion.[dwoing] I got a dwoing? That's awesome! That's only the second time that's happened on this show. Well done, Aaron! Yes, that is the rarely used sound effect when one of my players -- Emily did it once last time -- nails it right on. Yep, that's right, Aaron, and players at home, market cap for Match Group is $20 billion today. That means if you said anywhere from $16 [billion] at the low end to $24 [billion] at the high end, you have gotten it right. Matt, a year ago, said $8 [billion]. That was his guess. It was actually $12 [billion], so he got it wrong.But think about that. It was $12 [billion] a year ago. Now it's $20 billion today. That's up about 70% over the last year. It's been a remarkable outperformer. It's natural that some people might think: \"Well, maybe it's due for a pause. It's had quite a run.\" Even before we quizzed Matt with it a year ago -- we picked it several years ago -- it's been a multibagger for  members.Aaron, what is our general attitude when thinking about where stocks are headed? Are we looking backward? No, we do not look backwards, David. We look forwards! Because that's all that matters next, right? What's going to happen next? Yeah. Market caps are based on the future inherently. It's about future performance. You're absolutely right! So, this  stock has been a big winner. Overall, , it's been a pleasure to work on that together with you, Aaron! Absolutely! Match has helped that. Yeah, Match has helped. The market since December, by the way, up 16%. So, here I am promoting , and yet, we're not even selling it right now. It's not on offer. Nobody can join. I think it's going to pop back up in August. I was checking with the team today. I guess we're advertising for two months from now, which is really not when you want to buy your ads. Stay tuned for two months!... When was the last time you spent time in a hospital bed or a surgical table? It's been a really long time! You may never really have spent time there. I have, occasionally. Our next company, ticker HRC,  , is the world leader in higher-tech hospital beds. I know this, at least one older member of my family recently moved into one of those beds that's much easier to raise up and lower down. It's just easier, as we get older, to get in and out of. Hill-Rom is the leader within that; also, surgical tables and other things around the hospital and furniture.By the way, Aaron, you're looking a little blank to me, which is the way I like my contestants. No, I have thoughts. [laughs] I'm wondering, Aaron, if one of those thoughts is that this company was split off from its parent company, , in 2008. That was not one of my thoughts, but that's a good one. It's kind of a fun story, but that's a longtime company. Hillenbrand distinguished itself, I think it may have even been mentioned in Peter Lynch's book , because it makes funeral caskets. That part of the business, which is a longtime business and a big performer -- businesses in and around death, Wall Street usually doesn't favor those. It's not sexy to talk about. But often, that's what causes slow, sleepy stocks like Hillenbrand Industries to outperform over time.Now, Hill-Rom was split out from Hillenbrand and is the hospital furniture company. Before I ask you the market cap, Aaron, it sounds like you had a thought to share. I'm just piecing some of these things together that you're throwing out. It's a spinoff, which probably means it's a bit smaller-ish in size. The name Hill-Rom doesn't strike me as some new, cool, hip company; they've been around for a while. But they're also not so well-known as to be immensely popular. So, I'm thinking of a range in which a spinoff that's been around for a while that isn't immensely popular would sit. I mean, I can't tip my hand here at all, but I like in general how you're thinking about this. I like the logic. Thank you! It only matters if I get it right, though. All right. One final thought I'll add is, this was a recommendation recently in . Well, it was last November, so this has been around for a few months. Some of our listeners probably own ticker symbol HRC, Hill-Rom Holdings.Aaron and players at home, what is the market cap of Hill-Rom Holdings, within 20% either way? Oh, boy! $7 billion.[ding] Wow, we almost had the rare double-dwoing sound for perfection. Aaron, it's $7.1 billion. Are you serious? I am dead serious! Let's go! Players at home, if you said anywhere from $5.7 [billion] to $8.5 billion, give yourself a mark in the plus column. Yep. There we go: Hill-Rom Holdings, one maybe to look into. I'm shocked right now! Not only are you shocked, Aaron, you're batting .750, which is a great start for a rookie in the Market Cap Game Show. Thank you! All right, Company No. 5. Back to one of my favorite websites -- yep, on my top 100 list of all websites, Wikipedia, definitely top 10, possible top five for me: Wikipedia says of this company that it offers the widest range of global benchmark products across all major asset classes based on interest rates, equity indices, foreign exchange, energy, agricultural products, and metals. It goes on to say it has been described by  as \"the biggest financial exchange you have never heard of.\" The company is  ; CME, shorthand for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This is a global leader in derivatives, options, and futures. The ticker symbol of CME Group is, logically enough, CME.Aaron, have you ever traded an option? I have, yes. I have not. What did you do? When I was just learning about options, I sold a put on , which essentially just means that you receive income up front for the option to buy a stock at a potentially lower price down the road. I was just learning, so I wasn't putting too much time into it. It was a lark. You were a kid. But the thing is, NVIDIA's stock went down, I got put the shares, and then I sold out. And NVIDIA has been a 10-bagger since then. I see! So, I have used options. I got my little bit of income up front. But ultimately, I still made the wrong call there. Understood. Well, this has been a wonderful performer, first picked in . I picked it in August of 2017, so coming up on the second anniversary. This may help, this may be a minor spoiler, I don't know: It's up 49% from that day. The market's up 16% over that time.Aaron, players at home, what is the market cap within 20% either way of CME Group? CME is big. I think it's the biggest exchange business in the universe. I'm going to go $70 billion.[dwoing] Yes, that sound means that Aaron nailed it right on once again! Wow, the legend is starting to grow! Aaron Bush! Let's hope that the second half lives up to the first half! Incredible! I'm starting to freak myself out here. It's got to be slightly helpful when the actual fact, which is $70 [billion], is a round number. You were probably not gonna say $71 [billion] or $69 [billion]. You were spitballing a little bit. A big market cap gives you a larger room for error. That's right. So, players at home, if you said from $56 billion to $84 billion, give yourself, along with Aaron, a big plus mark. Aaron, you are now 4 for 5 as we finish the first half of the Market Cap Game Show. I look forward to see if you and your competitors at home can keep the music going.All right, Company No. 6. This is a brand that was initially aimed, clearly, at women, and succeeded so well that as the company grew, the brand began to extend to men. It is an apparel brand. If you are somebody who knows or loves yoga, you may or may not love  , but I know you know it. The ticker symbol is LULU.This has been a wonderful performer for . Since December of 2010, wow, nine good years, the stock has rocketed up more than five times in value. We'll talk in a sec about what you had to do to go through those times, to get to where we are today. Sometimes those stocks go way up and way down, and you've just got to keep holding nine years later.But without really needing to explain this company or its products, moving right along -- Aaron, players at home -- what is the market cap of Lululemon Athletica? [It's] $22 billion.[ding] The correct answer was $24.5 billion on the nose. Aaron, you don't want to hit it on the nose again? I'm sorry! I have to leave that to someone else this time! At the low end, $19.6 billion was allowable and correct; at the high end, $29.4 [billion]. So, from $19.6 [billion] to $29.4 [billion]. But, yeah, Lululemon, a pretty big-scaled company today, in the $20 billion-ish level of market cap. It's fun, isn't it, just to be able to compare that $24.5 billion to eBay, and know that eBay is $35 [billion], so eBay is still $11 billion larger. But then, a company like Match Group, as much as we love it, is smaller today than Lululemon Athletica. Part of the pleasure of the Market Cap Game Show is playing that competitive score game and learning more about the world. Yeah, it's really interesting how companies that are so different are the same size, from their various combinations of revenue and profits and everything that they do. That's probably my favorite thing about market caps, being able to make those radical comparisons. ...\u00a0So, nice job. I believe at this point you are 5 out of 6, which means I'm starting to wonder if I didn't make it too easy, or are you just that awesome? You threw out Hill-Rom Holdings. That didn't feel easy to me. [laughs] Before we go to Company No. 7, I want to point out that we initially recommended -- bought -- Lululemon at $36 in 2010. Eighteen months later, it had gone to $80. That felt really good. It more than doubled in 18 months. And then, over the next two years, it went from $80 to $40. That's right, it got cut in half and put almost back where we'd started. And then, three years later, as the market's recovering a little bit, it goes from $40 to $60. Not bad. Still, not back to the $80 we had several years before. But at the end of 2017, the stock was sitting right around $60 as we moved into Thanksgiving 2017. Today, it's $187. This company has totally taken off. It's rocked it! Aaron, do you own any Lululemon in your wardrobe? Unfortunately, no. I don't own the stock, either. I own Under Armour apparel, and Under Armour stock, which has not done as well. I think the market cap of Under Armour is half the size of Lululemon, which is interesting, also, to think about. That really is. Rocking the wrong company! I wish we had more time to talk, but we've got to keep moving.A reminder -- #IBeatAaron if, in fact, by the end of this show, you did outscore Aaron Bush on this month's Market Cap Game Show. We might see more of these -- #ILostToAaron if you end up losing. If you end up tying Aaron -- that's probably going to be impressive, we'll see -- #ITiedAaron.Company No. 7, I recently saw when I was in Columbia, Missouri. Actually, I was driving down from Chicago O'Hare Airport, where my flight to Columbia, Missouri, had been canceled. I've been rocking the hashtag occasionally on , last couple of months -- #OHatred --because that's my feeling about O'Hare Airport. The third consecutive time I've been canceled or massively delayed, any time I go through O'Hare. That's crazy! It is crazy! We had a ski vacation earlier this year. We had six days set aside. One of those days, we lost sitting in O'Hare, actually sleeping in the Hilton at O'Hare. The only airport I can think where there's a hotel right there in the airport. And now we understand why, because that happens so often, it seems. I'm not bitter.But one of the companies that we don't see as often here on the East Coast, which represents for many convenience, and for others pizza, in the Midwest, especially, is  . Now, Casey's General Stores I first picked in January 2015. What do I love about it? I love that it's the friendly convenience store. Often in the more rural areas in the U.S., there's not as much competition there. Also, they sell a lot of pizza. And people really like their Casey's. That feeling that people have -- again, we're all around that family hearth as we play the Market Cap Game Show -- that warm, fuzzy, happy feeling with your family, that's there for a lot of people when they cross into a Casey's General Store, especially since it's the only store nearby that might have gasoline or pizza for them at a certain time of night. So that's the role that Casey's General Stores, ticker CASY, plays.Aaron, before I ask you the market cap, as a Texan, do you have Casey's? Have you ever personally been into a Casey's General Store? No, and I've never seen one, I don't think. You need to see more of this country! I think so! I need to go on a road trip! It's the heartland, baby! Actually, I really do appreciate that. That was Capital Camp 2019, Patrick O'Shaughnessy's and Brent Beshores' baby. I've already mentioned that on this show, and the fun that I had there in Columbia, Missouri, just a month ago. But yeah: Casey's General Store.Aaron and everybody playing at home -- no doubt some of us really love our local Casey's as we listen to this, ticker CASY -- what is the market cap of Casey's General Stores? I'm going to go for a dwoing here. $5.5 billion.[ding] [laughs] You got awfully close! For a second time, you were literally within $100 million, which may sound like a lot, except it's just 0.1 . The market cap for Casey's General Stores is $5.6 billion, which means at the low end if you said $4.5 [billion], at the high end if you said $6.7 [billion] -- you, along with Aaron Bush, score that.Now, Aaron, you've participated as a leader within our  service and the  portfolio. Has Casey's ever been part of a portfolio that you've overseen here at The Fool on behalf of our members? No, it hasn't been. No good reason why, it just hasn't ever made the cut. Well, I'm happy to say it is up 82% since our January 2015  recommendation; the market's up 51%, so that's 31 percentage points ahead. It took a lot, though, it's taken a big comeback to get there.Wow, Aaron Bush, 6 out of 7! We've got three left. You're near setting the all-time record. If you get two of these, you will set the all-time record, really, on the Market Cap Game Show. Initially, I just saw you as my friend Aaron Bush, but you're increasingly looking like Babe Ruth to me. You're transforming before my very eyes. I think those of us who are watching this podcast -- we film some of these and put them up on YouTube -- you may see, Aaron may look different to you at this stage than he did at the start of this podcast. Well, I'll say, part of this just is, it's my job to be looking at these companies. But I'll take any praise that you'll give me, David. Thank you! You're very welcome! I feel like you're just going to kill this next one, so let's get it over quickly. Alphabet is the company, ticker symbol GOOG . Initially it was Google -- we all remember Google. I'm just checking here: Google started on Sept. 4, 1998, 20 years ago. Wow, what an amazing 20 years for this company! Starting from nothing in September of 1998, growing to what it is today.Aaron, I feel like you've probably pegged a few of these. In my mind, you'd already missed Hill-Rom, you probably hadn't gotten Casey, you were feeling a little bit worse for the wear, so I was throwing you a bone. Now, players at home, maybe you are feeling worse for the wear. I probably would have been in your place. Maybe you're happy to know that I'm going with a big, really well-known company. Clearly, children today are raised knowing the market cap of a company like Alphabet. Right? They must be! If they were, Aaron, within 20% either way, what would the kids of America -- no, of the world -- be saying the market cap of Alphabet today is? Ticker GOOG. They'd probably be saying it's somewhere around $900 billion.[ding] Wow, really well done! Aaron, you're now 7 for 8. You were kind of far off on this one. Somewhat surprising. And yet, you're right, [with] these bigger numbers, there's a huge band. The market cap of [Alphabet] as we tape is $769 billion, but $900 [billion] falls within the band of acceptability -- which at the low end is $615 billion, at the high end is $923 [billion]. So, if you said anywhere from $615 [billion] to $923 billion, you nailed Alphabet.It is worth noting that today, we say Alphabet. Back when we first picked this stock in 2008, we called it Google; that was the company name back then. It's also worth knowing that it's just been a four-bagger since May of 2008. It's beaten the market by about 120 percentage points, so it's been a good performer, but it is a bigger company that came public. Even though it was a four-bagger, we picked it one year later; it had dropped some -- 2009, the Great Recession. It's a five-bagger from there. But, 10 years later, a five-bagger, still only about 100 percentage points or so ahead of the market. So, not one of those raging winners, Aaron. Yeah. I could have done better, David. [laughs] No, I think I was thinking Amazon; I think [it's] more like $900 [billion]. And I know they were neck and neck for a while. But I guess something has changed. Well, speaking of big companies and, Aaron, you being 7 of 8: Our last two, one of them is a pretty big company. It's a recommendation that you brought to . It hasn't been one of our best picks. It is a little down from where we initially picked it; the market is up over that time. You can say a little bit about that in a sec. The ticker symbol is TCEHY.This was designed for me to drop you over the head a little bit for, on my watch, picking a slight underperformer, at this point -- and yet to also give you a \"gimme.\" And yet now, I feel like you're about to set the all-time Market Cap Game Show record as you answer the market cap of  , ticker TCEHY, within 20% either way. I think it's right around $400 billion.[ding] And, unsurprisingly, Aaron, you are right. But surprisingly, you just set the all-time performance record in a Market Cap Game Show as a rookie. Oh, my goodness! Which is amazing, because Emily did that with seven just a few shows ago. And now, you have topped Emily! She's in Scotland as we speak. Aaron, you're going to have some bad news for her when she returns. I guess so. Maybe one of these game shows later, we need to have a competition. [laughs] I have thought about how to torque this format into a multiplayer game. We'll see about that. I do enjoy just the intimacy of one on one. But Aaron, I should mention, the market cap is $417 billion. Players at home, if you said from $334 [billion] to, yep, the round number, dead spot-on, $500 [billion], anywhere from $334 billion to $500 billion, you got it right.Aaron, can you briefly lay out, 60 seconds or so, give us 30 seconds on what this company does, and 30 seconds why we still like it even though it's a little down? Sure. Tencent, for one, is the largest gaming company in the world -- behind huge games like , for example. They also are the leading social media company in China, behind QQ, but more importantly WeChat, which is a staple for Chinese citizens and many people outside of China, too. These two businesses together generate tons of cash. If you were to say a third pillar of the business for Tencent, that would just be all of the investments that they're making, venture-style investments that they're making in other companies. They have a really impressive roster of businesses. All right, Aaron, at this point, it's pure cream. From here, it's just pure greatness. You've already achieved the greatest score yet. There could be some other player -- it could be you later on -- who comes and does even slightly better. You shouldn't let up at all at this point. But I realize, you're now flying precipitously close to the sun. It reminds me of the Greek myth of yore. You're a younger guy, and you made your own set of wings today. They've got some wax in them. You're getting precariously close to the sun. Well, let's hope they don't burn up on this last question. [laughs] OK, well, talk about bad transitions, this company has absolutely nothing to do with burning that I can think of, although if we thought hard enough about it, we might. But one of the truisms of our time is that there's a new member of our family for a lot of us. They wouldn't have thought this 500 years ago or 100 years ago, maybe even 50 years ago. But increasingly, Fido, Fluffy -- the pet, the family pet -- the pets, increasingly, we view them as members of our family. That is certainly one of the more important trends of the last 25 years. As investors, we have benefited by identifying some companies working within that space.Now, sometimes Fido is sick. Sometimes Fluffy needs some diagnostics. That's where this next company, our final one for the Market Cap Game Show, steps in:  , ticker IDXX. Aaron, did you grow up with a pet in the Bush household? When I was young. But I have a dog now actually, too. I am familiar with some of these bills that can arise. [laughs] Do you have pet insurance for your dog? I think so. Maybe? I don't know! I don't know whether that's a good answer or not. It's more my girlfriend's dog than my dog. I just take care of it. I understand. So, presumably, she named the dog. The dog's name is Donut, which probably had more influence from me. People don't need to know this, but we had a hamster whose name was Donut Hole because it looked like a donut hole. So we graduated the next pet to being Donut. I think you're right, in a sense, people didn't need to know that. And yet I think there's a humanity to that, that I personally appreciate. Shout out to Donut, who probably is listening somewhere near the Bush family home fire. Or, at least your girlfriend's family's home. But anyway. I feel like I'm just stalling.Aaron, players at home, within 20% either way: What is the market cap of Idexx Laboratories, ticker IDXX? [It's] $25 billion.[ding] Wow! $23.4 [billion] was the correct answer. At the low end, $18.7 [billion]; at the high end, $28.1 [billion]. The only thing better than Idexx Labs' performance -- and it's up 309% since we picked it in April of 2014 for  -- the only thing better than that 309% performance was Aaron Bush's .900 batting average. He walked in with no batting average, he walks out with the greatest batting average in Market Cap Game Show history as of now. I'm stunned! But it's not quite perfection. I'll have to come back in and seek perfection next time! [laughs] Aaron, before I let you go, do you want to give a tip to players at home? Clearly, you prepared in some way, shape, or form that most of us would do well to learn from. I mean, honestly, if you enjoy following stocks, instead of looking at the stock price, look at the market cap. You pull up your brokerage every day to see what's going on, don't pay attention to the stock price, pay attention to the market cap. If this was the \"Stock Price Game Show,\" I probably would have been 2 or 3 out of 10. It really just shows, what you prioritize and what you think about every day, I think, pays off. 'Nuff said! Thank you, Babe Ruth! Well, yeah, we'll see. Next time, it could be completely different. But now that I have some clout when it comes to market caps, I will give some advice.[music] All right, well, a reminder -- wow, if you can rock the hashtag #IBeatAaron, good on you! I'm looking forward to meeting you one day if you scored 10 out of 10. Aaron just scored 9 out of 10 on the Market Cap Game Show. Emily's all-time record had been seven. Wow! I'm wondering if I screwed up my pregame preparation. Too many softballs? I need to check in briefly with my producer, Rick Engdahl. Rick, I'm full of self-doubt. Did I go easy on Aaron? There [were] a couple of softballs in there, I think. But I did hear at one point that Aaron was helping in the role of Emily's coach, so he might have had a little secret sauce when he came in here, too. I did not know that. So, basically, Emily had been mentored -- Emily, our previous greatest player, had been mentored by the man himself! I've no doubt that Emily was coaching Aaron just as hard! [laughs] It can be helpful to memorize market caps. I mean, if you, player at home, or Emily or Aaron -- admittedly, they do it more full-time than most of us -- but if you actually want to memorize market caps, I think that's great! I think that's a better world! If more people really know, to the first or second decimal, the market caps of these companies, I think that's a world that's smarter, happier, and probably richer, too.Well, next week on this show, it's going to be your mailbag.

That's an increase of 4% from 2017, with the expectation of a similar growth figure in 2019. There are a countless number of surveys that support this claim and some really interesting numbers to go with.Image Source: Getty ImagesOnes that stood out included:$480 million was estimated as the amount paid on costumes for pets in the U.S. for 2018.One in 10 dog owners has created a social media page specifically for them.71% of millennials said they would take a pay cut if they could bring their pets to work.There are a number of shifting social norms that appear to have led to this. Perhaps the most convincing argument is the age at which people are getting married. In the 1950s, the average age at which women got married in the U.S. was 20, while for a man it was 23, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Fast forward to today and couples are delaying tying to the knot until much later \u2014 27 for women and 29 for men. Instead, they are choosing to focus on their careers and education in their early adult years.There's also been a big shift in the size of families. In his brilliant book, '', Hans Rosling points out that, back in 1948, women had 5 children on average. That number was stable until about 1965 when it began to fall dramatically. Today, the world average is 2.5, with that figure starkly lower in developed nations.So today we see people either delaying or completely foregoing having children, and in their place, they are adopting pets. Furthermore, in those families that have both children and pets, the families tend to be smaller and therefore the pet is elevated to a more important member of the family.When looking at this global trend here at there are two stocks that we like.\u00a0 is the largest pet insurer in the U.S., providing medical insurance plans for dogs and cats both in the U.S. & Canada. Even though the U.S. leads the world in pet care spending, it lags behind when it comes to pet insurance. It's estimated that only 1% of pets in the U.S. are insured. Compare this to the UK which is 10% and Scandinavia at almost 25%.Today, 90 million dogs live in 60 million U.S. homes. From the same National Pet Owners Survey, we also know there are 95 million domestic cats in 50 million households. These numbers just keep growing, year after year.Founder and CEO Darryl Rawlings, who still owns over 7% of the outstanding shares, started Trupanion because his family had to euthanize their dog in the face of a hefty vet bill. From those first days in Canada, the business expanded into the U.S. and became the first North American pet insurer licensed to provide its own underwriting.By the end of 2018, Trupanion had over 520,000 enrolled pets and have forecasted to hit between 650,000 \u2013 750,000 by Q2 2020. With a 98.58% retention rate, Trupanion is forging a fantastic recurring revenue stream for itself, with plenty of growth opportunities in this untapped, underserved market.\u00a0 is the world leader in pet diagnostics for companion animals. Idexx sells the table-top diagnostic machines to vets for a once-off fee and then sells the testing strips on a per-use basis. This is the  that brands like Gillette and Nespresso have perfected and is incredibly attractive, offering long-term recurring revenue and tying your customer to your product for many years.In a recent study, Idexx found that one out of every seven of these tests uncovered a significant issue in adult animals, with those numbers higher for animals in the latter part of their lives. With animals unable to tell vets what is wrong with them, diagnostic tests essentially become the \"voice of the animal\".Already firmly established in the U.S., growth opportunities exist in cross-selling to existing customers, as well as in Europe, where spending on pets is starting to see the kind of explosive growth that North America has witnessed over the last ten years. The company crossed the $2 billion mark in sales last year, while spending on companion animal diagnostics is predicted to grow between 6 and 8-fold over the next 25 years.Idexx are the biggest identifiable spender on research and development in this space (they have some private competitors that don't report it), have strong client relationships, and a great management team fostering innovation. If you see the trend in pet spending all around you and want to get in on the action, this is a great long-term buy-and-hold investment.Image Source: MyWallStThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [", a diversified pet healthcare company, reported its second-quarter results on Thursday.Revenue growth  at 7%, although the number would have been a little bit higher had it not been for currency movements. Steady margin improvements allowed the company to report 16% growth in EPS, and management boosted guidance in response to the broad-based strength.Data source: IDEXX Laboratories.Image source: Getty Images.Longtime CEO Jonathan Ayers is currently on medical leave after sustaining a severe spinal cord injury in a bicycling accident. It is unknown how long he will be away.Interim CEO Jay Mazelsky shared the following commentary with investors:IDEXX business momentum remained strong in the second quarter, driven by high organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. The solid performance we continue to deliver is the result of a deep and talented global team, an unrelenting commitment to innovation, a unique multimodal strategy, and our durable recurring-revenue business model. We're well positioned to build on this foundation through the expansion of key initiatives like IDEXX Preventive Care, which is building momentum as a driver of increased diagnostic testing, supporting faster growth for engaged IDEXX customers.\u00a0Management refined its full-year guidance in response to the second-quarter results. Revenue is now expected to land in a range of $2.38 billion to $2.410 billion, an adjustment from its prior range of $2.385 billion to $2.425 billion. This represents organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 10.5%, which is a reduction from its prior outlook range of\u00a09.5% to 11%.\u00a0EPS guidance was adjusted to a range of\u00a0$4.82 to $4.92, which represents a $0.05 jump at the midpoint from its prior outlook. This new range represents\u00a0growth of 13% to 15% on reported EPS growth, or 17% to 20% on a comparable constant-currency basis.Management continues to believe that free cash flow will be about 60% to 65% of net income due to its heavy spending on its headquarters in Maine and relocation of a laboratory in Germany.\u00a0Mazelsky ended his prepared remarks on the  by stating that IDEXX remains poised to achieve its long-term goals: \"In summary, we feel very good about our business progress across a range of strategic fronts, and believe we are well positioned to sustain strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue growth and EPS gains aligned with our goals.

Today is Wednesday, June 26th. We're talking . I'm your host, Shannon Jones. I have a very special guest joining me here today, none other than Jason Moser, live and in the flesh, fellow  -- sorry, not , host. Sure, but one could argue the two are very interrelated. It's all the same! If you've got good financials, it'll keep you healthy. Bad healthcare will ruin your financials.\u00a0 That's a great segue! I've got Jason here today to talk about his Healthcare and Wealthcare basket. Yes, it's all interconnected, all related. Jason, always thrilled to chat with you. I'm really excited to get into the Healthcare and Wealthcare basket. But before we do, it's probably good to dive into the news. I think I've seen 20 to 30 different headlines just today about this one merger. The one deal.\u00a0We've gotten many emails, on , people are hitting me up. What do you think about it? It's all about this AbbVie-Allergan deal. Let's run through quickly here what that deal is all about. Then we can dive into our thoughts and opinions.\u00a0On Monday, AbbVie announced it would be acquiring Allergan, maker of Botox, in a cash-and-stock transaction worth about $63 billion. Each Allergan share would receive 0.866 AbbVie shares and $120 in cash. Roughly, that works out to about $180 a share, about a 45% premium on the prior day's closing. A pretty hefty premium. This is the second-largest deal of the year. A lot of the  listeners will know we talked a lot about the -deal that kicked off this year at about $74 billion. AbbVie, though, trading down about 14% on the news. Allergan, up about 25%. Not uncommon to see the acquirer get beat up. But they're getting slammed.\u00a0 It does seem like the disparity is a little bit bigger than normal. Yeah. So, we'll dive into all of that and more. One thing, Jason, here at Fool HQ, there is not literally one person I've met so far that has said, \"Wow, this is a great deal! I can't believe they waited so long to do this!\" [laughs] It feels like we're all like, \"Yeah, I get it.\" It's one solution to what seemed like a problem that wasn't going away. It sounded like there was a lot of noise being made for Allergan to split up in some capacity, to maybe realize some value for shareholders that way. This is the opposite of splitting up, joining forces with another company. It does seem like, at least, the two joining together, they're somewhat complementary. I don't know there's a heck of a lot of overlap there. In a space where scale obviously matters, particularly when you're facing problems like Allergan certainly is facing, a lot of key drugs coming off patent, some drugs that they were hoping for a bit more success and aren't panning out, and slowing growth across all lines. It's understandable. I'm not sure that I necessarily think it's the best thing in the world. But it's a big deal, like you said. It's a huge deal. $63 billion. You've got basically two mediocre companies that have been looking for growth literally anywhere, now joining forces to become one humdrum, mediocre company, still looking for growth. \"Mediocre\" is the perfect word.Let's talk a little bit about AbbVie. You mentioned this. They have been desperately in need of diversification. Their bread-and-butter drug is Humira. It made about $20 billion last year, about 60% of sales. A huge chunk of their revenue. But it's facing a huge patent cliff. Actually went off its core patent I believe in 2016. But it's that patent exclusivity, particularly here in the U.S., that is on tap for 2023. AbbVie and their legal team -- I have to commend them, they're probably one of the most creative legal teams out there, aside from Allergan -- they've been trying to stem the tide. They've done over 100 different add-on patents to push away a lot of the competition. Hasn't really worked. We've already seen biosimilars in Europe starting to drive down sales. Humira, during the first quarter of the year, global sales fell about 23% already, ahead of this 2023 time frame. AbbVie here is desperately trying to throw the kitchen sink at the problem, but there just hasn't been anything meaningfully accretive to their top line, particularly when it comes to their pipeline. They've got an approved drug, several in the pipeline. You're looking at maybe about $9.5 billion in annual sales just coming from expected drugs. That's not nearly enough to take care of that $20 billion Humira problem. No, and you look on the other side of the coin there with Allergan, they're facing a lot of the same problems there. I was digging into their 10-K yesterday to get a better idea of how reliant they are on Botox. I think that's the name probably most people associate with Allergan. Botox is interesting in that most people probably think of it as an injection to help cure wrinkles. It's somewhat... You can say it, Jason. You can say it. I don't want to say superficial, but I think it's kind of silly, personally. We all get older. Just accept it, embrace it. But some people don't, so Botox cosmetics helps that. There is a Botox therapeutics side of the business, which is something we always need to mention. There are migraine implications where Botox does help. It's not a drug that is purely cosmetic. But either way, when you combine the two together, you're talking about over $2.5 billion in sales that Botox is responsible for Allergan. That growth rate is slowing down a lot as well. Between Botox slowing down, the patent cliff that you were talking about there, it goes back to that thing you said. You've got two mediocre companies coming together. I don't know that necessarily makes for one great company. Maybe it makes for a big mediocre company. Is that something we want to invest in?Not necessarily, Jason. Not for me personally. We actually got a question about this, like, \"What should I be doing with this as an AbbVie shareholder?\" -- and even some from Allergan shareholders. I think, from an Allergan perspective, you talked about Botox. This is a drug, it's their bread and butter, as you mentioned, but they're already facing generic competition. The FDA approved a cheaper version of Botox. We actually did a show on it in February, about the wrinkle wars that are now starting with a company called . You've got your bread-and-butter drug under pressure, their No. 2 drug, Restasis, which is for eye disease, also facing generic competition coming in 2024. Of course, just like AbbVie, they've been trying to throw the kitchen sink at this problem. I don't know if you remember this, but Allergan was the company that, to try to protect their patents, they actually attempted to sell it to a Native American tribe for patent immunity.\u00a0 Huh. I don't remember that. [laughs] Oh, my God! One of the most bizarre legal cases I've ever heard. Even from a strategy perspective, really strange. So I think there was a lot of doubt cast on Brent Saunders with Allergan after that. This is a company very much under pressure. You've got two companies trying to hold things together. Also, Allergan has a massive amount of debt, to the tune of about $21 billion. If this deal goes through, it would make for a combined balance sheet net debt of $18.5 billion, plus another $40 billion added to get this deal closed.Yeah. This is a market where debt loads are usually pretty heavy because these companies have to invest so much money in developing these drugs, and typically, you need to develop a lot so you have a pipeline that can shore up any weakness or headwinds when you run into situations. So, they tend to feed on a lot of debt, which is fine, to a degree. Typically, they add the income statements that can help facilitate and cover that debt. But it's always something worth noting, particularly if you see two companies like this that are really running into some headwinds growth-wise.Yeah. I think with Allergan here, what AbbVie is trying to do with this acquisition, it's not about growth, it's very much more about, we need to fund R&D and we need to pay down some debt. You've got these cash cows like Botox that I think can help them do that, but this is definitely not a growth story. If you're a growth investor, don't expect to see any growth or innovation. Allergan is not one that invests heavily in R&D in and of itself. This is really about debt, and it's also about funding continual R&D.It still leaves the question, Jason, where is growth going to come from with this combined company? That's still the bigger question, and why you saw AbbVie take such a hard hit right after this news was announced. I feel like maybe this is a defensive acquisition. Do you think that's a good way to put it? On AbbVie's part. I think that's fair. It's a very expensive defensive acquisition at $63 billion. That's a four-times multiple on 2018 revenue right now -- which is not unheard of in the biopharma space, but those multiples tend to go with growth opportunities, not so much from a defensive play.\u00a0I can see why they did it, but I would have loved to see AbbVie actually go after maybe smaller incremental deals that could actually drive growth long-term, rather than one huge, massive $63 billion deal. It didn't address the issues that a lot of the investors have been poking and prodding AbbVie for.\u00a0You still have a lot of lingering question marks. If this deal closes -- it's expected to close in early 2020 -- we'll have to wait and see what that looks like. But ultimately, to your point, this is just a defensive play. If you're an investor shareholder in either of these companies, as long as you're comfortable with that, and recognize this is not necessarily about growth, I think you're OK.You raised a really good point there. I feel like, if I were going to be on that call and ask management one question, it would be along the lines of what you were talking about there. Instead of making this one mammoth acquisition, why wouldn't you go out there and try to find a bunch of smaller pipelines with some more attractive prospects? To your point, that is a ton of money they're spending on basically one business with some questionable prospects. I have to believe there are a lot of smaller little biotech opportunities out there with some pipelines. Kind of the way we talk about investing in this space anyway, right? Taking that basket approach, invest in a bunch of small biotechs, because some of them won't pan out, but some of them will. Why wouldn't they take that same approach? Clearly, they have the money to do it. I guess we'll never know.We'll never know. We'll never know.We'll have to get on their next quarterly call and ask them that very question, Shannon.I'll hold you to it, Jason. OK!We'll be sure to keep all of our listeners up to date on all the latest happenings with this deal as it pans out. Jason, before we dive into the stocks in your Healthcare and Wealthcare basket, let's set the stage a little bit for our listeners who may not be aware -- what led you to this basket approach, specifically this basket approach within the healthcare and wealthcare space? Probably some folks are familiar with the War on Cash basket that I did. That was something that came to be with Chris Hill and I just lobbing back the question every quarter on as to why we hadn't bought stocks in some of those companies, because clearly, it was a huge market opportunity. What I'd thought was, it's a big market opportunity, and it's not like you have to pick one winner. That was the impetus behind this basket as well. When you look at healthcare, as you and our listeners know, it is a massive market opportunity, not only on a domestic level, but a global level.To put that into context, when you look at total national health expenditures as a percent of GDP here, just in the country, you're talking about a number that's closing in on 20%. It is a big part of our overall economy, and that number is only continuing to go up. I don't think it's reasonable to assume that our neighbors here across the river are going to crack the code of healthcare anytime soon. It's going to be an expensive market that'll keep on growing. So I thought, well, I like big and growing market opportunities, and there's not one company that's going to win this space, there are a lot of them. So I just took a stab at trying to find some of the companies in the space that I felt like could do well in the coming five, 10 years. Great! A basket approach. I think it makes a lot of sense, Jason. We recently put out, I believe it was an Instagram question, about, do you invest in healthcare stocks? I'd say the No. 1 theme for those that said they did not was because they felt it was too risky. For a lot of them, they were talking about biotech and pharma, which is exactly right. Very risky, very aggressive strategy. But I like the basket approach, in particular the stocks that you have in this basket, because each of these stocks -- we'll get to them in a second -- serves a very critical need within the healthcare system. They have opportunities, given all the reasons you just said, when it comes to pricing, when it comes to efficiency. This is just a simpler, less risky way to invest for those who are wanting some healthcare exposure but don't necessarily want to go the biotech/pharma route either.I do appreciate that. The biotech space is really risky. People probably associate that most with investing in healthcare, because those are probably the companies that get most of the headlines. A lot of that's just because of that sexy growth everybody's looking for. It's that growth. Everybody's looking for a way to get rich quick. This certainly is not meant to do that. It is something where I felt like I could put together four companies that gave us a nice risk profile that investors are looking to pursue. This is not a basket where these are all high-risk names. It is certainly not the only way to do this. This is one way to do it. It is a way I did it. You can tell me I'm wrong and I won't be offended. You can give me some other names that should be in the basket, and I will likely agree with you. [laughs]\u00a0But you have to draw the line somewhere, so I drew it at four companies. Typically, I look for anywhere from four to six companies to go in one of these baskets. These are companies that I've covered for a long time. To your point, I think they all fire in on their own specific part of the healthcare system where they're going to continue, I think, to grow for the foreseeable future.Yeah. Let's start with the first one. This is insurance company UnitedHealth Group, ticker UNH. Jason, tell us about this one. Why did it come across your screen, your radar? What makes it so interesting to you? We all like having access to healthcare, right? For the most part. We want to have access to it. It's a bit nebulous at times as to how we exactly do have access to it. You have a job, you get health insurance, it's not clear exactly who that's with or what you get, or how much you're going to owe when you go to the doctor, because it doesn't seem like there's any real standard pricing model anywhere at this point. But the bottom line is that the healthcare system, for the foreseeable future, is not going to work without insurance.UnitedHealth is the largest insurance company in the space, domestically and globally speaking, it is certainly spreading its wings. You look at a company in a market where the service they provide is going to be essentially necessary for the foreseeable future; the size of the company matters, I think, in this case; and there are huge barriers to entry when it comes to health insurance. It's not like you and I could go start a health insurance company. I mean, we could, but we would probably fail, because there's a lot to do in just getting that business started. They've already done a lot of that hard work. The size of the company tells you they've been doing a pretty good job at it. With vast financial resources, they're very well-positioned to deal with any and all changes that come to the regulatory landscape in the coming years. It's a big company, it's a little bit lower on the risk profile. But that was the point, to give us a bedrock company. We know it's not going to be growing terribly quickly, but it probably shouldn't have the rug pulled out from under it, either.Yeah. I love this pick, Jason! It's really about the scale and the size of this company. You mentioned it's the largest insurer in the business. Also, single largest employer of physicians. More than 35,000 physicians. Largest in terms of the pharmacy benefit managers. They processed over $160 billion in payments. It's the size and the scale that I think is important when we talk about cost efficiency with healthcare. When you have that type of size -- also, this is a company that's really been focused on data and analytics, more so than many of the others -- that plus size and scale, if I had to put my pick on one company that I think could help drive down costs, it would be UnitedHealth. I'm glad you said that. I think a lot of people will immediately think UnitedHealth, the largest insurer, healthcare for profit, this is an evil company. I understand that perspective, but I would encourage you to look at it from the other angle. It's not like UnitedHealth is the company that set up our healthcare system in this country. That's something that's been in the works for many, many years. Essentially, our politicians have given us what we've got. There are all sorts of different philosophies and takes on healthcare. I would encourage you to go read a book called  by T.R. Reid. It's a great book! He basically travels the globe and looks at healthcare systems in all different countries and compares them to ours to show where they're doing better, where we're doing better. The No. 1 takeaway from the book is, this is not an easy problem to solve anywhere. If you think that other countries have it all figured out, well, read that book, you'll see it's not quite so cut-and-dry.But yeah, I do agree with you. With a company this size, with its resources, they are going to be able to play a role in helping drive down the cost of healthcare. I think it's also reasonable to say this is a company that has to answer to shareholders, which means they need to maximize profitability. There is a bit of a delicate dance there, for sure.Oh, for sure! As we come up to the 2020 presidential election, we've heard a lot of rhetoric, Medicare for All. We'll have to see how that plays out. But this is a company that was able to navigate the Affordable Care Act waters very well. I have no doubt about them being able to navigate anything that comes down the road, should it happen. I tend to agree.Let's talk about this second one. The second company, a medical device company. This is Masimo Corporation, ticker MASI. Jason, tell us what exactly they do and why this one is compelling. This is one probably not as many are familiar with. Back in 2011, we had a thing that we did here on , some of us decided we wanted to try to run a real-money portfolio in a public-facing manner, and we were able do that. It was this initiative called Rising Stars. Masimo was a company that I found for that portfolio and bought in that portfolio back in 2011. It struck me in researching the company, what they do -- I'll translate this -- they're in the business ultimately of pulse oximetry. Whenever you go to the hospital, if you have to check in for surgery or anything like that, typically, you're going to have something in there, a device, some equipment, that measures the oxygen levels in your blood, among other things. It's essentially required. You have to have that. Doctors need that in order to assess how you're doing. Masimo is in the business of that. They make those devices. They make the equipment and the consumables that help all of that happen. It's an interesting company from the perspective that the founder, Joe Kiani, founded the company essentially in his garage. He figured out how to build this technology, then just ran off with it. Nobody has been able to develop something better.And now the company is celebrating its 30th anniversary. They've gone beyond pulse oximetry into other testing equipment and monitoring equipment. They have a beautiful razor-and-blade model. They get that big equipment in the hospital, and then the hospital has to keep buying those consumables. It gives the company this opportunity to continue to innovate. The numbers tell us that hospitals like the technology. I like the founder-led culture. It's a little bit of a higher-risk play than UnitedHealth, but still a fairly well-established company. I own shares in it personally, too. One that will continue to do well. They've actually got an augmented-reality play as well. They do! It's really interesting to me, especially as we talk about the delivery of healthcare, staying connected, being able to make decisions faster. Tell us about this AR. I think that's the cool thing about companies like these, small, founder-led companies where they're not beholden to all of this red tape and trying to figure out what they want to do. They're essentially going with one guy's vision and the things that he wants to do. He's assembled a team of innovators with them, and they try all these different things. When you talk about augmented reality and virtual reality, and how technology is going to help our healthcare system, eyewear, I think, is the big medium for augmented-reality technology in the coming years. You have Google [] and and other companies that are working on those types of things. Incorporating monitoring equipment or monitoring platforms for physicians, for example. When they're in the hospital, regardless of where they are in the hospital, they can see a patient's progress or vitals right then and there. That's a good example of what Masimo is doing to incorporate more technology into their business.This company in particular is still very early days in how they're incorporating that. But reading about the things that they're trying, it's a pretty cool business. Again, I think it all boils back down to the founder and CEO. The nice thing is, he's a young guy, too, so we should have a lot of years left to watch him do his thing.He's got a long runway! All right, I love the play there, especially with innovation. Of course, we can't talk about redefining healthcare without talking about the third stock in your basket. That is Teladoc, ticker TDOC. We've talked about Teladoc on the show. Jason, tell our listeners, what do they do, for those who may not be aware. Ultimately, it's virtual healthcare, seeing the doctor over the internet. This is a really neat business. I started following this business shortly before it went public. I had spoken with a friend of mine at the  at the time. We were talking about the company going public and what its chances were. And even back then, I thought, they're solving a problem that exists. It made me think back to, David Gardner talks about with , there was so much skepticism back then that people would ever even consider putting their credit card information on a website and buy something from a website. There's just no way! There's no security! Balderdash! Sorcery! Fast forward to today, we obviously know that result there. Anybody in the world pretty much knows that going to the doctor's office is not a pleasant experience. It's not always necessary, either. I think that's what this company was geared on from the beginning, is trying to become that new front door for the medical care experience. There are situations where you don't necessarily need to go to the doctor's office. Teladoc has built a nice virtual healthcare app that enables people to go ahead and use that app as essentially that first step in their healthcare pursuit. I can use a specific example that happened to me in my life, where I immediately thought, \"I'm sold, this is for real.\" I'm sure some people have heard this story before. I was taking my daughter to a horseback riding lesson. I saw that my eye was turning red. You have kids, you know what pinkeye is. And I thought, \"Oh, God, now I've got pinkeye.\" You know how you've got to go to the doctor, get a prescription for the drops, it's a waste of a day. So I parked in the parking lot. My daughter goes in, starts riding. I opened my phone, opened the Teladoc app. Twenty minutes later after having a video chat with a doctor in Texas of all places -- we're in Virginia -- she was able to diagnose the pinkeye, e-prescribed the eyedrops to the  by our house. I picked them up on the way home. Problem solved. $15 co-pay. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy, as they say.That's ultimately what they're doing. They're not trying to say, \"If you have a heart attack, you can use Teladoc.\" That's not what you do. But there are cases where it does work. I think what we're seeing now is buy-in in the virtual-healthcare space. The regulatory barriers have all been cleared. The regulatory environment has been changed to accept virtual healthcare. UnitedHealth is another business that is helping shape that. Believe it or not, Teladoc is actually a partner of Optum with UnitedHealth. Big base there, as well. Yeah. A huge growth opportunity -- 85% of the U.S. will contact a health professional in any given year. That translates to about a billion office visits annually. Teladoc has the potential -- actually, right now, they're doing about two million of them. When you look at that runway over the long term, huge opportunity. Mental health is one huge area. I think with a lot of the stigma associated with mental health, and it's becoming much more OK to talk about, and people are wanting assistance with mental health, that's a huge opportunity, as well, for Teladoc. It is. You mentioned a good word there, the stigma that's associated with mental healthcare. Finally, now, we have a way where someone can pursue mental healthcare without necessarily having to even leave their home. I think that really opens people up to the possibilities of even asking for help in the first place. If you feel like you need that help, and then there's the option for you to actually have a visit without ever having to leave your home, that's the ultimate form of privacy right there. We're certainly seeing the company making big investments in that space as well. It does seem like mental health is becoming a more talked-about thing here, nationally speaking. That's my perception. Totally. That's a good thing. Totally agree. I think for a company like this, it's all about access. But that brings us to the fourth stock in your basket, Jason. Access is not for humans, it's also for our furry animal friends within our family. That brings us to Idexx Laboratories, ticker IDXX. Jason, we're literally covering the entire gamut of healthcare. We've got animals now! One of these things is not like the other. Listen, this is coming from the perspective of the owner of three dogs. I've got three dogs at home. I grew up with a house full of dogs and my mom's cat. We've had animals and pets all of my life. I have a very, very soft spot in my heart for them. I could never imagine a day without them. I've been following this company for years, and part of the reason why I discovered them was because of my veterinarian. We talked about Masimo being a razor-and-blade model. Idexx is a razor-and-blade model as well. They get that equipment into the labs of the veterinarians, and then the veterinarians use the consumables to run diagnostic tests. Typically with pets, it's fairly standard. You take them in for their annual checkup, they get their shots and whatnot. But what veterinarians are finding is, particularly as pets get older, there are simple little diagnostic tests they can run via either urine or fecal or blood to discover if there are issues that are coming up far earlier that you need to address.Between that, the fact that the pet care market is such an attractive one because we feel so strongly about our pets, and it's typically a cash business. I know there's pet insurance, but most people don't use it, and I'm still not convinced that it's actually a really credible market anyway. There's a lot of things to like about what Idexx is doing. It's a competitive space, for sure. One of their competitive advantages is that they continue to reinvest in their business and develop new tests and diagnostic equipment and things. That would be a concern of mine, if they started pulling on those purse strings a little bit. Then I'd be a little bit concerned. But as it stands, they continue to invest heavily, bring new products. They've got a great reputation with veterinarians, particularly the private practices. A lot to like there. It's really a play on what is, I think, a very attractive market in pets. Do you have any pets?I don't. My husband is allergic to anything with fur. We're working on him, though. I grew up with dogs. I have a huge heart for animals in general, so does my daughter. We'll get there. But, yeah, I could see a company like this, with such a massive focus on pet care in general. I think that's an area that doesn't get enough focus right now.Probably not.The medicinal market for pets is huge. CBD now for pets!Yeah. I was talking yesterday on about , which is the company that was spun out from and they're the ones that developed those vaccines and medicines for animals. Whenever I go to the vet, I'm not lying to you, that bill, I see Idexx and Zoetis on there. You now understand why I own shares in both companies. I'm getting at least something back for that money I'm putting out there. At least something you're getting back there, Jason! To close this out, Jason, tell us a little bit about performance. How has this basket done for you?Well, the basket has done very well, I'm proud to say. The date of inception of this basket was February 9th, 2018. That's when I opened it up and introduced it to everybody. Thus far, an investment in this basket is up 55%, versus the market's performance of 11.4%. It's done very well. All four companies are absolute positive returners. Three of the four are beating the market. I will say, the one that is underperforming the market, which is UnitedHealth, is underperforming the market by 0.5%. It's pretty close. But any which way you look at it, they're all four contributing to the performance there. I think that's slated to continue.Yeah, pretty stellar performance. Jason, I'll have to have you back on the show, because we want updates on how this basket is performing. Think you'll rejoin me back on the show? You know I'll be here anytime you ask me!I appreciate that! I'm sure our viewers do as well. That will do it for this week's  show! Thank you so much for tuning in!

(Symbol: IDXX) saw new options become available this week, for the January 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IDXX options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $240.00 strike price has a current bid of $16.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $240.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $223.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $246.94/share today.\n\nBecause the $240.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.75% return on the cash commitment, or 10.57% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $240.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $250.00 strike price has a current bid of $20.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of IDXX stock at the current price level of $246.94/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $250.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.46% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IDXX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing IDXX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $250.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $250.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 45%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.22% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.88% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 29%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 28%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $246.94) to be 28%.

However, management was quick to point out that if exchange rates remain where they are today, then its\u00a0revenue growth rate would be negatively impacted by about 1.5%.Bottom-line guidance was favorably tweaked. The company expects its margin profile to remain strong, so earnings per share guidance for the full year was raised by a dime to a new range of $4.76 to $4.88. This range represents growth of 12% to 15% on a reported basis and includes currency headwinds of about $0.03 per share.Management continues to project that its free cash flow will only be about 60% to 65% of net income because the company is spending heavily to expand its headquarters in Maine and relocating a laboratory in Germany.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Operator Instructions).I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. -- Thank you, and good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered continued high revenue growth and excellent financial results in the first quarter. In terms of highlights, we achieved 10% organic revenue growth driven by 12% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. As expected, FX impacts from the strength in U.S. dollar reduced reported revenue growth by about 3%. Operating margins improved 210 basis points on a constant-currency basis, better than projected, reflecting strong gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, which benefited from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth as well as timing delays related to select IT and R&D project spending.EPS was $1.17 per share, up 16% on a reported basis or 27% on a comparable constant-currency basis. Strong revenue growth and operating margin gains drove 21% constant-currency operating profit growth. We also recognized about $0.02 per share in upside related to higher than projected tax benefits from stock compensation activity.In terms of our full year guidance, we're maintaining our outlook for 9.5% to 11% organic revenue growth, reflected in our consistent guidance range of $2,385 billion to $2,425 billion in annual revenues. We're increasing our 2019 EPS guidance range by $0.10 to $4.76 to $4.88 per share. This incorporates an increase of about $0.07 from an updated outlook for 80 to 110 basis points in full year constant-currency operating margin improvement, $0.01 to $0.02 per share in benefit from updated interest and expense projections, and $0.01 to $0.02 in upside related to updated effective tax rate projections.Our operating margin outlook factors in additional investments we're advancing this year in reference lab capacity, corporate customer support resources and customer-facing software capability while continuing to deliver a strong operating margin improvement and comparable constant-currency EPS gains aligned with our long-term financial goals.We'll review our updated 2019 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q1 performance by segment and region.Q1 results were supported by continued strong performance in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $509 million, up 10% organically driven by 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 7% overall and 6% organically with overall revenue gains constrained by comparisons to very strong prior year digital imaging system placement levels. Veterinary software services revenue grew at high single-digit rates organically in Q1, reflecting very strong sales across -- results across our practice management platforms with the continued growth of our PIMS and application install base supporting expansion of recurring software service revenues.Our digital imaging business continued to achieve high levels of digital radiography system placements and high growth in recurring Web PACS subscription revenues linked to our expanding install base.Our Water business revenues grew 8% organically in the first quarter to $30 million, reflecting continued solid growth in the U.S. and double-digit gains in international markets.Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q1 was $32 million, up 4% organically. Gains in herd health screening, poultry and pregnancy product sales were offset by moderate declines in European disease eradication program revenues, continued market demand impacts on our dairy testing business and continued pressure on swine diagnostic testing revenues related to impacts from the African swine fever epidemic in ChinaBy region, U.S. revenues were $358 million in the quarter, up 9% organically, driven by 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of an approximate 1% equivalent day headwind. Strong U.S. gains reflected continued double-digit growth in reference lab and consumables and solid mid-single-digit growth in rapid assay sales. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains were primarily volume driven with U.S. net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range.In terms of our broader U.S. market trends, this quarter, we've significantly revamped and expanded our reporting from our data set from approximately 7,500 practices, representing 5 different practice information management systems. We've also refined our weighting framework based on practice as in region prepared in collaboration with Animalytics. We're now providing same-store growth in clinical visits for practice augmenting our quarterly reporting on total same-store visit and revenue growth for Companion Animal Veterinary visits of all types.In Q1, we saw an improvement in total visits per practice grow to 1.3% year-on-year with clinical visits per practice growing at a greater amount of 2.2%, an overall revenue per practice growth of 5%. Please note that these metrics are on a same-store basis and do not include growth benefits from incremental practice formation, which we estimate at approximately 1% annually.The Q1 2019 earnings snapshot on our website shows quarterly data on clinical visit growth for 2018 and Q1 2019 as well as some additional information we've added that describes our measurement methodologies and refinements we've made to our historical data to reflect the additional insight we've gained from our data analysis efforts.International revenues in Q1 were $218 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by strong 14% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, including continued 20% plus organic growth in consumable revenues as we benefit from 30% year-on-year growth in our Catalyst install base outside of the U.S. We saw modest benefits from advanced ordering in the U.K. ahead of the Brexit deadline, which added approximately 2% to international consumable growth in Q1.International Reference Lab growth was in the mid-single digit range as we continue to advance commercial efforts targeted on accelerating growth in this line of business while sustaining strong momentum in expanding our Catalyst install base in international markets.In terms of segment performance, Q1 results were supported by continued progress in driving Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts. The quality of our instrument placements was strong in Q1. We achieved 307 placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 7%, with a high attach rate of premium hematology instruments, which drove a solid increase in EVI, our measure of multiyear economic value of instrument placements. We also placed 122 second Catalysts at IDEXX accounts in North America, compared to 59 in Q1 2018, supporting growth in customer utilization at larger accounts.Internationally, we placed 633 Catalysts at new and competitive accounts, up 20%. By region, competitive and new Catalyst placements represent 60 -- represented 69% of total placements in North America and 62% internationally. Strong Catalyst placement results and continued high retention is reflected in 24% year-on-year growth in our global Catalyst install base.Overall, we placed 2,775 premium analyzers in Q1, down 2% compared to very strong prior year levels. Q1 results were led by 1,463 Catalyst placements globally, up 4% overall supported by 443 placements in North America, a 20% year-on-year increase. And 1,020 placements in international markets, down 1% compared to record prior results, which included high levels of VetTest upgrades in emerging markets.As noted, we saw a high attach rate of premium hematology instruments with chemistry placements in Q1, which supported 823 premium hematology instruments globally, up 9%.SediVue placements were 489 in Q1, down 26% versus very strong prior year levels impacted by our exceptional SediVue placement performance in Q4 as well as our commercial focus in Q1 on capturing high EVI, new and competitive catalyst placement opportunities.In addition to strong premium placement results, we drove continued momentum with SNAP Pro with 1,099 placements in the quarter. CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q1 $29 million, a 3% decrease organically off a tough compare 2018, which included mixed benefits from very strong placements of higher priced SediVue instruments.Benefits from an expanding instrument base, test innovation and enhanced commercial capability continue to drive strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our major modalities. Instrument consumable revenues of $167 million grew 15% organically in Q1. Results reflected double-digit gains in the U.S. and continued 20% plus growth in international markets.High volume-driven consumable gains continue to be supported by expansion of SediVue Pay per Run and SDMA slide revenues, which contributed approximately 3% combined to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter.Reference Lab and consulting services with revenues of $203 million grew 11% organically in the first quarter. U.S. Lab momentum remained strong, reflected in solid double-digit volume-driven organic revenue gains, supported by expansion of our preventative care programs. As noted, International Reference Lab growth was in the mid-single-digit range supported by solid gains in Europe.Rapid assay revenues of $54 million grew 6% organically in Q1, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international markets. Rapid assay gains were primarily volume driven supported by growth in 4Dx Plus and first-generation products.Turning to the P&L. Operating profit in Q1 was a $133 million, up 18% as reported or 21% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting profit gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments. Operating margins were 23.1%, up 210 basis points on a constant-currency basis, supported by solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage. Gross profit was $332 million in Q1, up 9% as reported or 12% on a constant-currency basis. Gross margins increased 110 basis points on a constant-currency basis, supported by continued moderate CAG Diagnostic net price gains, volume leverage and productivity gains in our U.S. Reference Lab business, mixed benefits from high consumable growth as well as a solid gross margin improvement in our Water and LPD businesses. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which are reflected in gross profit were $1.4 million in Q1.Operating expenses in Q1 were up 4% or 7% on a constant-currency basis, resulting in 100 basis points of positive operating margin leverage. Operating expense increases were driven by growth in CAG, sales and marketing and R&D spending with overall spending increases mitigated by modest constant-currency growth and G&A costs, including benefits from later phasing and certain IT-related projects.EPS in Q1 was $1.17 per share, an increase of 16% as reported and 27% on a comparable constant-currency basis. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q1 2018 and 2019, decreased operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.03 per share. Our effective tax rate was 17.7% in Q1, including benefits of 4.4% to our tax rate or $0.06 per share related to share-based compensation activity, which was approximately $0.02 per share higher than projected.Free cash flow was minus $4 million for Q1, reflecting normal quarterly seasonality and increased capital spending related to major projects. We continue to maintain our full year outlook for free cash flow of approximately 60% to 65% of net income for 2019 and a $160 million to $170 million in capital spending, which includes approximately 20% of free cash flow impact, driven by $70 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and our German core lab relocation. We allocated $54 million in capital to repurchases of 267,000 shares in Q1.We ended Q1 with $1,052 billion in debt, including $100 million of new 10-year notes issued in the quarter. Our liquidity remains strong with $117 million in cash and $502 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.69x gross and 1.5x net of cash and investment balances.We're maintaining our 2019 full year outlook for a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, which assumes net leverage at 1.5x EBITDA. We're now projecting annual interest expense, net interest expense of $36 million incorporating a more favorable full year interest rate outlook.Turning to our 2019 guidance, we're reinforcing our full year revenue outlook while raising our EPS range by $0.10 per share. Our full year reported revenue guidance remains $2,385 billion to $2,425 billion, reflecting consistent expectations for 9.5% to 11% overall organic growth and 11% to 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our reported revenue outlook reflects a consistent projected 1.5% full year FX revenue growth headwind at the rates assumed in our press release.We're raising our 2019 full year EPS guidance, $0.10 per share to $4.76 to $4.88 or 16% and 19% growth on a comparable constant-currency basis. This incorporates a 30 basis point increase in our outlook for constant-currency operating margin improvement now estimated at 80 to 100 basis points for the full year resulting in approximately 7% -- $0.07 per share in improvement in our EPS guidance range. We have also refined our outlook for net interest expense and stock compensation tax benefits, which combine at approximately 3% to our full year EPS from $0.03 to our full year EPS range.We've updated our outlook for our 2019 effective tax rate to 20% to 20.5%, including an updated estimate of $8.5 million to $10.5 million or approximately 2% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation. We estimate that foreign exchange rate gains will decrease reported EPS by $0.03 per share net of approximately $11 million in projected hedge gains.For the second quarter, we expect reported revenue growth of 7% to 8.5% on organic revenue gains of 9% to 10.5% supported by consistent 11% to 12% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. We expect Q2 operating margins to be approximately 50 basis points higher than prior year levels on a constant-currency basis. This outlook incorporates the rephasing of planned first half investments, impacts of higher international commercial staffing levels and incremental investments in select areas, including increases to our U.S. state lab capacity. We expect our effective tax rate in Q2 to be approximately 21.5%, including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity.That concludes the financial overview. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments. -- Thank you, Brian. Now a little color commentary. We had a strong start in 2019 in the first quarter with organic revenue growth of 10% and comparable constant-currency EPS gains of 27%, supported by better-than-expected margin gains.Globally, we delivered a solid 12% organic growth in our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, at the higher end of our full year growth rate was strong gains across the U.S. and international regions. This expanding, highly durable annuity contributed 77% of IDEXX' total revenues in Q1.Instrument placements globally, considering both quality and quantity together, we're solid with strength in the U.S., Europe and Latin America offset by year-over-year declines in Asia-Pacific, primarily related to tough comparisons. Our premium install base continues to expand at high rates. And we do not see any change in the competitive environment.In Q1, our U.S. field organization was in it's second quarter of the latest territory expansion, and so we saw a strong momentum in placements of Catalyst in new and competitive accounts, up 7% as our the field organization inspires customers to trade up to IDEXX' advanced technology offering.We also had an exceptional quarter with SNAP Pro placements of almost 2,000 driven by the U.S., up 68% year-over-year. We are methodically transforming our rapid assay customer base into a razor and blade business model, as the SNAP Pro mobile instrument brings significant workflow and charge capture value to the veterinary practice. And we're seeing higher growth and rapid assay loyalty when customers adopt SNAP Pro workflow. With the placements in Q1, we are now well over 60% of our SNAP 4Dx coming from active and connected SNAP Pro customers.Despite tough comparisons to high prior year SediVue placements, new and competitive Catalysts and SNAP Pro gains supported solid growth in the U.S. economic value index in the quarter. They really did a great job.Europe also saw a strong -- solid Q1 growth in Catalyst placements and instrument placement value, which is impressive given they are in their first quarter of the field sales expansions. The European expansions are on their way to completion at 92% occupancy, however, 40% of field reps are in their first year. And as a result, sales productivity in Europe will be building through 2019 as field experience and time and territory advances. This is the same dynamic we saw in the U.S. when we undertook a similar major expansion in 2015.The U.S. Companion Animal market is on very solid footing, as is the pet owner in general based on macro and the trends we see. We are excited to be presenting this quarter a much expanded and improved market growth reporting as shown on the second page of our earnings snapshot with an upgrade to our methodology and an expansion in the number of practice of 7,500 in total coming from a variety of both IDEXX and third-party Practice Management Systems. Additionally, weighted to reflect the market in terms of geography and practice size and type, with the support of Animalytics, and we're grateful for their partnership. We are giving back to the industry by publishing these important metrics on a quarterly basis as part of our earnings. This is an industry with, otherwise, limited-to-no market data of this kind. Of course, the data also helps investors understand IDEXX a little bit better. From this data, we're seeing 2.2% clinical visit growth from existing practices in Q1. To get the total market visit growth, we need to add the impact of net new practice formation, which we estimate to be about 1%. Pet care in the U.S. is a very healthy market, with existing veterinary practices making investments in technology and infrastructure and new practices being open.Our growth of Companion Animal Group Diagnostics recurring revenue in the U.S. was 11% in Q1, net of about 1% equivalent day headwind. We are, and have been, growing faster our diagnostic volume than patient visit growth for several reasons: First, we're seeing same -- strong same-store sales in diagnostic volume growth beyond clinical visit growth, driven by our unique innovations and our focus on driving ongoing increases in the utilization diagnostics and pet care. Across our modalities, we estimate, this adds about 4% of incremental volume to clinical visit growth. To this, you add another 2% growth in the number of new practices that are utilizing IDEXX as their primary diagnostic partner, whether it be in-house reference lab or both. Call this customer share gain, if you will. In fact, we topped 20,000 practices sending at least 1 sample to IDEXX Reference Labs in Q1, a record for this metric in Q1.We also continue to realize 2% to 3% net price realization in Companion Animal Diagnostic recurring revenue. So add it all up, 9% volume growth from a variety of sources and 2% to 3% new price realization gets us to low-teens IDEXX recurring revenue in the U.S., aligned with the high-end of our long-term U.S. growth potential of 9% to 13%.Same-store sales, at the practice level, is being driven in part by the adoption of IDEXX' fecal offering and by preventive care diagnostics, what we call the Preventive Care Challenge, or PCC. To date, through Q1, nearly 2,800 practices have enrolled in PCC program since its inception, with over 300 new practices enrolled in the quarter. These 2,800 practices are growing IDEXX Diagnostics at just under 15% on a trailing 12-month basis.Preventative care is a great example of how we are creating new market growth with our innovations incorporated into Reference Lab PCC profiles, all of which include, at a minimum, IDEXX SDMA with the chemistry, the IDEXX CBC, fecal antigen and IDEXX' 4Dx offering. Together, they make an IDEXX PCC panel, a well justified annual pet owner investment in their pet -- in the pet's health by uncovering underlying disease as part of a wellness visit.Just think of it this way. Running a PCC panel on a pet as part of an annual physical exam is like a human getting a physical with blood work every 7 years. The only difference is that the blood work is even more important in pet care as the pet can't speak for themselves, and we got these dogs running around in dog park sniffing around and drinking from the puddles. It's just a different situation, and we're finding there is a lot of value. When a veterinary practice partners with IDEXX, with our proprietary PCC panels, their overall practice revenue growth accelerates generally without the addition of any staff.Clearly, 2019 is the year where preventative care diagnostics, driven by the expanded capabilities of IDEXX' unique offering is moving into the mainstream of veterinary medicine to the benefit of the veterinary practice, pets, owners and IDEXX' alike. And yet, we believe IDEXX is only serving 10% of the total addressable market for preventative care.We also see nice same-store sales growth in the VetLab consumables business from the adoption of new menu, including Catalyst SDMA, SediVue and now Catalyst Progesterone. Customer retention rates in the U.S. remain stable in Q1 at world-class levels of 98% to 99%. In an environment where our competitors use their only weapon, price, to compete, it is nice to see our customers do not equate price with the value and evidence the value of our innovations through their loyalty.New product launches in the quarter included Catalyst Progesterone, which is off to a strong start both U.S. and internationally. France led the launch, helping to expand the availability of poodles. We completed the update of all SediVue in the field with the newest algorithm, Neural Network 4.0, benefit of our Internet of Things strategy with our instruments.In veterinary software -- In the veterinary software portfolio, we released Cornerstone 9.1 to create excitement and rave reviews. This new release brings a transformed user experience that is more intuitive and reduces clicks, and we're seeing a more rapid take-up of this new release as a result. We had strong placements of new Cornerstone, Neo, Animana and Smart Flow systems in the quarter. In addition, this month, we formally announced the prospective availability of a cloud version of Cornerstone for our customers who value the deep and unique functionality of Cornerstone as the go-to, high-end practice management software, but also want the benefits of a cloud such as full mobile access. We're seeing a strong adoption in our IDEXX Web PACS, our cloud-based software-as-a-service offering with this new reference image library and the ability to work with both IDEXX digital imaging systems as well as those from third parties.Total Web PACS subscriptions have seen a 40% growth year-over-year. Other software offerings from IDEXX are advancing nicely, including Petly Plans for wellness plans, enterprise to support our corporate customers, and of course, IDEXX VetConnect PLUS, which continues to make steady advancement in both functionality and utilization. It is indeed a comprehensive and impressive IDEXX software technology stack.We're serving a growth market and supporting further market growth through our advanced diagnostics and software technologies. Given our success, we have in the works augmented investments planned in the North America market, including Reference Lab capacity expansion, corporate account support resources and further investments in our customer-facing software strategies. Of note, we have no plans for further expansion of our field-based footprint in the U.S. or internationally in 2019 in diagnostics, other than completing the occupancy plans in Europe and the small expansion to serve corporate accounts. With these investments, we're focusing on the remainder of 2019 on driving field sales productivity, which comes from time and territory, advancing our CRM and advancing programs such as EVI and IDEXX 360.In summary, we see very solid trends in our markets globally in 2019, and remain on track to advance our strategy of investments to further our innovation agenda such as of our outlook for about $150 million in cash R&D, while delivering our -- on our 2019 revenue goals and an augmented outlook of 16% to 19% comparable constant-currency EPS gains for the year.And Kevin, with that, I'll open the call to questions.(Operator Instructions) First question is from the line of Ryan Daniels, William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and all the detail. Brian, one for you. Operating margin is clearly stronger than anticipated. And I think you mentioned in your comments there was some IT and maybe R&D spending that was delayed. So can you dive into a little bit more of the rationale behind that? Was it related to personnel hiring given the economy? Or just noise in investment spending?And then number two, anything we need to think about regarding cadence in those items for the rest of the year on a the quarterly basis? -- Thanks, Ryan. On the project spending, it was just a normal executional timing, it wasn't a change in plans, which is when we were able to execute some of the IT and R&D project spends. We're still on track as Jon highlighted for the cash R&D spending goals this year, which are about a 15% increase, and so that will phase in relatively more through Q2 through Q4. And we'll also continue to execute in the IT front, so it was more just a timing versus our estimates.I would highlight that in Q1, we had some favorability that benefited the quarter. We had some favorable compares in our LPD business on a gross margin line. We had very strong consumable growth in -- particularly in international. Some of that benefited. We highlighted there was some Brexit pull forward that added a couple of points to growth, and we got some mixed benefits from those factors. And as we work through the years, we've highlight that they will have some incremental investments going -- coming online. In the second quarter, we'll be adding some day lab capacity in the U.S., and that's factored into our margin outlook balance here. So we're clearly feeling good about how the year started. We raised the full year operating margin goal. But I think some of those factors are moderate to gains as we look through the year. -- Okay, very helpful color. And then, Jon, my follow-up will be for you. In regards to the international sales force, can you talk a bit more about what you've seen in regards to their ramp relative to the United States? I know you said 40% are within the first year, so I'm sure there's a nice ramp curve, and maybe there's confounding factors like moving to IDEXX 360 and some of the other initiatives that make it a little hard to gauge versus historical levels. But what would you anticipate in regards to the productivity of that sales force as it both expands and matures? -- Yes. I think -- that's a good question. I think it's going to international expansions that they will -- we will see the productivity build over the course of the year. Obviously, we got a phenomenal product line, and we've demonstrated that with placements around the world. And it just gets better as we add to it with things like -- with Progesterone, and of course, the regular software updates that go to all of our instruments as part of our SmartService strategy.But it's -- the sales expansion -- so I would see -- this is a very major -- this was a very -- a major expansion we undertook over the last 4 to 6 months internationally in selected markets. Obviously, we had a very strong -- we have very strong country organizations there already, but I would say this expansion was kind of more -- for them, it was more in the order of expansion that we undertook in 2015 in the U.S. And so I would use that as a guide how we think things will progress over the year. -- Okay. Thanks for the color.Next question is from the line of Erin Wright, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks. You highlighted again in the prepaid remarks around the Preventive Care Challenge program. And can you give us a sense on when that will contribute more to financials if there's anything embedded in your guidance for 2019? Or if there's any other metrics? I think you gave some in your prepared remarks that we can track on a quarterly basis just to measure the success and progress of your efforts on the preventative care front. -- Thank you. That's a great question. That is contributing to the 11% reported growth in the U.S. recurring revenue, which a day -- which had a day of headwind in it. So that's -- that is a -- the preventative care is a big deal. And the evidence -- the medical evidence for preventative care is getting stronger and stronger as we put together the data and we share what the industry is and the key opinion leaders. And our field organization, and this is one of the reasons why we've done all of these expansions, they are bringing it to the local practice. So we're adding, every quarter, a couple of hundred practices who are moving to this new way of thinking. They're all being threatened by the retail going out of the practice, and so they're realizing that is a turn to diagnostics. That's not only a nice antidote, but it's a higher -- it's a more productive -- it's higher -- it's a more satisfying and financially impactful way to grow the practice than retail. It has higher margins, and it's a whole lot more satisfying to address issues early than to deal with them very late in their progression with the pet. And so I think we're beginning to see significant momentum.A 2,800 practice is -- that's approaching 10% of the market. That is not an insubstantial demonstration of the success of this program. And yet, of course, we're really only early days. We think every practice really should be adopting this as the best practice over time. They've got the tools and the support of our field organizations to do so. -- Okay. Great. And then you gave some great data points on the underlying market demand trends in the U.S. I'm curious if you keep track of some of those metrics overseas in terms of same-store sales, volume trends. And if so, kind of directionally here how we should be thinking about the underlying health of the international CAG market. Are you seeing a broader presence from competitors that can also help drive awareness in advanced practice protocols in Europe as well as more broadly internationally? -- Yes. Thank you. We're really pleased to be able to present, in partnership with Animalytics, the much more sophisticated U.S. metrics. As we all know, there's just like almost no data in this industry, and there are reasons for that. It's because it's not -- it doesn't have the standardization we see in human healthcare.In Practice Management Systems, we found 790 different ways to call a dog a dog, which is pretty amazing. So our machine learning and AI is really coming into play here.With regard to the comparison to international, we just -- we aren't there yet. We don't have that same capability. But generally speaking, they're the same pets and people love their pets, and the level of adoption of diagnostics is still a fraction. And so we are bringing in tension, but certainly, any attention that the industry brings to the profession of the value of diagnostics we think will help grow the market around the world. And clearly, we're seeing that with the double-digit growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues that we're seeing routinely outside the U.S. similar to the more advanced market that we have in the U.S. And it's really not -- it's really a phenomenon that cuts across all cultures and geographies. And really, it's the amount of the attention that we can bring, supported, of course, by a great product line that's going to drive this growth, which is why we've done these expansions internationally to accelerate the adoption of diagnostics in the practice of the veterinary medicine.(Operator Instructions). Our next question is from the line of Michael Ryskin, Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking the question.A few quick ones just to follow-up on some of the things you highlighted earlier. You mentioned some stalking in the U.K. tied up with Brexit, I think you said 2% to international consumables growth. So I'm thinking that's about 65 to 70 bps for the total consumables in the quarter. I just want to make sure that's correct and sort of what's your expectation for that throughout the rest of the year as the belief that, that's going to fade or sort of reverse in 2Q? Or if you could just tell us how that factors into your outlook. -- That is correct. The number was 2% international and... -- International consumables. That's exactly correct. -- International consumables. That's -- we're weighted toward the U.S. in consumables, relatively, but I think that's -- those are reasonable estimates of the overall effect. And we'll see. We don't have full insight into how the many customers we have in international markets or in the U.K. -- Or how Brexit will evolve. -- Exactly. But we were anticipating that there was a high level of concern, obviously, with the uncertainty in Q1, and we'd anticipate some pullback in Q2, but it's -- we'll see how that plays out. We don't have full visibility into that at this point. -- Okay. And then another quick one. On the instrument revenues, I think you mentioned sort of the disconnect where revenues were down, I think 3% organically, but you saw pretty solid placements across the board. You mentioned some mix in terms of a tough comp on SediVue year-over-year and how that played into the dynamic. But I was wondering if there are any good phase? Or on an apples-to-apples basis, how is pricing in instruments? You mentioned, I think, it was positive for CAG overall. But I want to focus if it was going down in the capital equipments side of things? -- Yes. I would say it's similar dynamics. We had different metrics we can look at on that front, but I think the amount of cash that we put out for -- in supportive instrument placement programs on a quarterly basis was kind of in line with the trend we had last year. We did have a couple of tough compares in the quarter. SediVue, we had an exceptional year last year and with very strong placements in Q4. And our organization was really focused in Q1 on the big new -- the competitive placement opportunities, which we saw in the quality, the numbers that we posted there. So that was one factor.Another one that we'll see going into the second quarter as well is we had very strong Vet creative test upgrade results in international markets including China last year. And so just on an absolute revenue basis, we're up against tougher compares, but net-net, we're shifting a lot of our focus toward the competitive placements, and that's helping us on the EVI front. So we feel very good about the quality of the growth. And just to reinforce, we pointed out that, year-on-year, we've got a 24% increase in our Catalyst install base globally, so that's the big driver of our consumable gains, and we have great momentum there, and we're feeling very good about that. And that's where we're confident in reinforcing the outlook for the year. -- Yes. And I just want to -- the color commentary in granular by asking that question, Mike, and highlighting that. We really -- we run the business on the economic value of the instrument placement, which of course includes the pricing of the instrument and the instrument revenues, but it also includes our estimate of the economic value of the annuity associated with that placement. And so we don't run it base on instrument revenues, so that would be the wrong way to think about the business. It's about creating value with each quarter. And it was a very solid and positive growth in the value of those placements. And it was really -- to put it in one word, it was really mixed up that -- Hence, the revenues are a little bit different than the value. -- Very helpful. Thanks guys. I'll get back in queue.Our next question is from the line of Jon Block, Stifel.Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Good morning. I'll start with gross margin. They were up really strong, 120 bps. It haven't seen sort of that level. I don't believe of a year-over-year gross margin expansion since the first half of '17. But for -- and some of the expansion was from the other businesses. You called it out a bit. But Water and LPD gross margins were up around 400 to 500 bps year-over-year. So if you can talk to what drove that? And is that step function to the new level largely sustainable on those divisions going forward? -- I think it is. Yes, it's -- we should have continued good gross margin performance across the different businesses. I would highlight some factors that are benefiting us in Q1 in LPD. We did a very strong health herd screening revenues, which are relatively higher-margin in that business. And that is -- that -- we don't anticipate that same level of growth as we're moving forward, some of that was a compare. We had some higher cost last year as well. So I think it's -- the year-over-year growth, Jon, we anticipate some moderation in that dynamic, but I think we're confident we can sustain the good margin performance we've had in the business.And Water continues to be a very healthy business for us, and I think we're -- we hope to build on that. We are, obviously, expecting this year, gross margin to be a key driver of our overall performance. The 80 to 110 basis point improvement we expect for both of that to be driven by gross margins. But there will be some moderation as we move forward, including in the next quarter, just as we advance some of the investments we talked about, and we have some of the mix dynamics exchanging as well. But we think we have captured that in our full year outlook. -- Just one more thing, Jon, I really -- I want to call out I was very pleased -- we're very pleased with the reference lab of gross margin performance in the quarter. And as you know, the U.S. is really very well with double-digit growth. That is higher than our global 11% outlook in the reference lab organically. It's really being led by the U.S. It's a very, very successful part of our strategy. We're nice -- seeing very nice gross margin growth there. Of course, we're reinvesting some of that for expanded capacity to really continue to provide an exceptional service level across all geographies in the U.S. And we've called that out as incremental investment in the balance of the year. -- Got it. Very helpful. And just a pivot to my second one. I didn't find the instrument figures too surprising. And as you mentioned, clearly, where these boxes go dictate the future annuity. But the SediVue down 26% year-over-year on a global basis was a surprise to me. I believe the in-clinic urine sediment might be around 15% penetrated in the U.S., give or take. So John, you're now a couple of years into the U.S. SediVue launch. How do you view the peak penetration rate of in-clinic urine sediment? And put it in perspective of hematology in chemistry, which might be closer to 70% and 90%, respectively. -- Thank you. The -- first of all, the SediVue, to date, has mostly been in North American product area, and it's been driven by North America. And we continue to see that could be the case in the near future.Our North American organization, particularly our U.S. organization, just had a very strong quarter in competitive Catalyst. Okay? Those are -- they have -- that lab adds a lot of economic value. Those are, in some ways, more challenging than even SediVue. And so we have the remaining SediVue opportunity in front of us that we talk about probably over 30,000 analyzers when we compare what SediVue penetration could be in relation to chemistry and hematology. I think we've laid those numbers out in conversation with investors in the past. And so really, there's no -- we don't really see any change in the ultimate opportunity for SediVue penetration, and we really, really remain a class by our own with regard to SediVue. And it keeps getting better. The Neural Network 4.0, which is a silent upgrade that went across our entire install base, brought a new menu and a greater overall experience. And we're not done yet with continued software investments in SediVue. And our customers know SediVue just gets better and better. So I think it was a quarter where the field working on the competitive Catalyst placements. And I got to tell you, I was pretty proud of our accomplishments in that regard.Also, Jon, one more thing. I know you've talked about in the past, you got to be impressed with that 68% year-over-year growth in SNAP Pro placements. I mean that's a -- that's really turning out to be a great strategy. And of course, that also takes a field effort to accomplish.Next question is from the line of Mark Massaro, Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, thanks for the questions and Congratulations to your team for putting together this really large dataset. I wanted to ask if you could maybe help me think of where the additional 2,500 practices of data came from? I think you reported out 5,000 previously. And then this is probably nitpicking, but last quarter, I think you called 30 basis points of increase. And it looks like you revised that down to 30 basis points of decrease. Is that largely a function -- and I'm referring to Q4 total visit growth. Is that largely a function of the additional practice data? Or was there something else revised like geographic location changes? -- Yes. Let me first take the first part of your question, then Brian can answer the second part. So the 7,500 practices includes -- while the 5,000 always included practices beyond our Cornerstone, which is a go-to PIMS. We greatly expanded the number of practices across the 5 major practice information management systems that are out there, only some of which are ours and some of which are third party. And in addition, not only that, we haven't just taken a straight growth. We weighted the growth across these practice by segmenting them and getting them proportionally represented to the market in terms of geography. We may have more than one geography than another, but we've adjusted for that, and it's really been with the support of Animalytics that we've been able to that weighting.So it really is a comprehensive revamp, and we've been able to apply our machine learning algorithms to figure out what are the clinical visits versus what I'd call maybe the retail or nonclinical service visits such as boarding and grooming, which of course, it's -- these are the higher quality visits, the ones that have a diagnostics and prescribe medications. So -- and services -- veterinary services that involve the veterinarian. So these are the more important -- and they get more important business so they give greater visibility. So I think long term, are trends.Brian, do you want to... -- Yes. And the -- to Jon's point, we've refined the methodologies and -- to make this even more accurate and just went back in time and adjusted the prior data to be consistent with that. So you'll see some minor changes in the historical data. But it's all intended to be apples-to-apples. -- I think we look at this practice visit growth at the clinical level, not including net new practice formation, which we do not capture in this information because we're looking at same-store sales, year-over-year. I think we see a very robust market. I would generalize stepping apart from the quarter as a whole, I think we're seeing, in same-store sales, 2.5% to approaching 3% on a sustainable basis -- practice visit growth on a same-store sales basis. And as we said, we had estimated you that about 1% to that. So I think it's a very healthy market, and it's nice to see the first quarter -- it does bounce around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But I -- it was nice to see the first quarter metrics. -- Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then as more and more animal clinics choose to join larger groups, the value of these contracts become increasingly important. Can you just speak to how you feel your positioned as -- maybe some of your competitors may have won some large deals, whether it's 3 or 4 years ago, some of these might be up for renewal. Can you just speak to the opportunities in front of you? And how you think you're positioned going forward? -- Yes. I -- we -- thank you. We think we're exceptionally well positioned, and we have very high loyalty among our corporate practices. Our corporate practices value us for a couple of reasons: First of all, we help them drive same-store sales growth, which is -- has as a very nice drop-through benefit in a practice that has high fixed costs leverage. Diagnostics is a great place to improve both the revenue and the profitability. And our field reps, along with our technologies such as preventative care and our underlying diagnostic technologies embedded in the preventative care drive, help them drive same-store sales growth.Second, there -- the number 1 issue that corporate practices have is staff engagement and retention. It's hard to recruit in the current environment. And the staff likes our products, and they're very loyal to our products, and they -- and our corporate practices appreciate on that. And so they really want to be able to support the local staff with the best technology, and that's one of the reason why we have such high loyalty because they acquire practices with our products and they keep them. And if they decide to take them out, that really usually has a pretty negative impact on engagement, which can lead to issues on staff retention, which of course, has a pretty dramatic impact on the economics of that practice. So you lose a key producer, and you got to go find someone. That's not a pleasant experience.So we -- our model works in the corporate, and you can see it in our recurring revenue growth even in the period of the slow evolution of the industry to a larger corporate sector. Our recurring revenue growth is quite strong in that regard, and those loyalty factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks is 98% to 99%. That's all-in. That's individual and corporate, all embedded. -- Great. And if I can sneak one last one in. You performed, more or less, strong across the board and kind of in line with consensus for Q1. On the reference lab segment, you are going up against tough comps from the first half of last year, and I think we kind of saw the growth rate sort of moderate based on the comp. But in particular, on OUS, it came in at mid- single digits. How should we think about the underlying demand of OUS reference lab? And can you speak to whether or not this might change when the Germany reference lab opens? -- All right. We are on track with opening the new core lab in Germany, which will really replace the existing lab in Q1 of 2020. I think your comments are correct with regard to the first half and second half compares on the international reference lab. I think it's all part of that growing. The highest and most productive use of these reps is placing instruments because that's got a very -- that's a very, very profitable business for us. But of course, we are growing our labs too. And so it's really -- it's putting all that together. There's some timing experience to pull that off. And so we've got moderated expectations on the reference lab impact of the expansion in relation to what we hope to achieve with regard to instrument placements.Next question is from the line of Andrew Cooper, Raymond James.Please go ahead. -- Just a couple for me. Kind of to the point that I think Jon was asking about. When we think about the margin dynamics that we saw in 1Q, and then the increase in the guide, it looks like this is relative to what we had modeled. Really the bulk of -- the outperformance is in 1Q, and there's not a whole lot of change in the rest of the year. So just any color you could provide on sort of how some of that fell versus your expectations and how much is, to his question, a sustainable step-up in the gross margins as opposed to a little bit more of a one-off in the first quarter. -- We did see more benefit than we anticipated, and some of it we try to highlight here. I think the broader theme is we're on track. We're reinforcing the full year outlook. We're flowing that through and maintaining our outlook while we're advancing some investments that we didn't have in our prior outlook, so we're -- I think it was -- a number of things moved in a good direction in Q1, and we're comfortable with our full year goals, and it's all aligned with the long-term goals we have for operating margin improvement. But I think you're right. There's some upside there that we're not projecting out in the balance of the year. -- This is -- generally speaking, this is an amazing business with a very, very high ROIC. It's an investable business, and so we are continuing to invest for sustained long-term growth in the profitable and enduring recurring revenues. So we look -- our plans, of course, extend way beyond the year 2019. And it's really factored into -- what we shared with you is our outlook for the year is the maximizing the growth and the value to our customers and our investors over a 5-year or 5-year-plus time frame. -- That's helpful. I guess could -- is there any way you can sort of help size where you did not make those incremental step-ups that you kind of layered in with this update, what you think the margin profile might have looked like otherwise? -- It's a relatively small difference. It's -- we haven't broken that out, but it's -- we're just trying to highlight that we're advancing some additional investments. And that's factored into the guide. -- Okay. That's helpful. And then my last one will just be higher level and again, along some of the lines that I think Erin asked about in terms of international and sort of how we think about the growth there. You've seen really strong same-store growth like you talked about in the U.S. Has that pace in terms of same-store? Then consistent internationally or faster? Or is there not too much but much more of a focus on kind of the new accounts and not as much on the same-store kind of drivers so you think there's a lot more opportunity there but it maybe hasn't kept up with the U.S.?

For the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (Symbol: VO), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $175.55 per unit.With VO trading at a recent price near $159.23 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.25% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of VO's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Jones Lang LaSalle Inc (Symbol: JLL), Idexx Laboratories, Inc.

The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents by 7.4%. Moreover, EPS declined 21.9% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 3% on a year-over-year basis to $97.7 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $102.2 million by 4.4%.Per Neogen, continued weakness in the global animal protein market and strongly negative currency conversions posed as headwinds in the reported quarter. Despite these, the company witnessed year-over-year revenue growth on strength in the international business and solid performance in the core Food Safety and genomic product lines. Thus, the fiscal third quarter was the 108th of the past 113 quarters to report year-over-year revenue increases (this includes all consecutive quarters in the past 13 years). : Revenues at the segment totaled $51.1 million, up 8% year over year. Sales of the foodborne pathogen detection tests, including Listeria and Salmonella, rose 16% year over year in the reported quarter. Revenues also included contribution from Neogen's Listeria Right Now test system. Its sales increased five times year over year. | Further, the company witnessed 17% year-over-year rise in sales of rapid diagnostics to detect natural toxins along with an 11% year-over-year increase in general sanitation product revenues. Year-over-year growth of 7% in sales of rapid diagnostics to detect food allergens also contributed to the top line. : This segment recorded revenues of $46.6 million, reflecting a 2.1% decline from the year-ago quarter. Decreasing sales of products to distributor partners into the animal protein market, including rodent and insect control products, led to the downside. Moreover, adverse impacts of the U.S.-China trade war and tough economic conditions in the production animal market dented revenue growth in the Animal safety segment.Meanwhile, growing sales of cleaners, disinfectants, detectable needles and vaccines contributed to the top line.The worldwide animal genomics business unit recorded a 15% increase in the reported quarter. Per management, this growth is partly attributable to solid revenue growth from genomics laboratories in Scotland, Australia and Brazil. Also, the upside is backed by robust revenues from genomic testing of beef and dairy cattle, swine, poultry, and companion animals globally.Gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 45.7% in the fiscal third quarter, largely because of 5.6% rise in costs. Per management, unfavorable product mix within the segments adversely impacted the gross margin.Operating income was $14.6 million compared with $15.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating income accounted for 15% of sales in the fiscal third quarter compared with 16.8% of sales a year ago, which implies a 180-bps contraction.Neogen exited the fiscal third quarter on a disappointing note. Headwinds like turbulent economic conditions in production animal markets, and trade war between the U.S. and China along with decreased sales to animal protein market distributor partners led to the Animal Safety segment's disappointing performance. Moreover, adverse currency movement lowered revenues in the fiscal third quarter by $2.5 million from the prior quarter. The effect of the negative currency movement is majorly due to weakening currencies against the dollar in Brazil and the U.K.Meanwhile, strength in the international business and solid performance in core Food Safety and genomic product lines resulted in year-over-year revenue growth. Thus, the fiscal third quarter was the 108th of the past 113 quarters to report year-over-year revenue increase. Per management, the company witnessed revenue growth in Europe, Brazil, Mexico, China and India along with other geographies in the reported quarter.

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Idexx Laboratories currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for IDXX that show why this Animal diagnostic and health care company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For IDXX, shares are up 1.15% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.88% compares favorably with the industry's 5.21% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Idexx Laboratories have increased 9.02% over the past quarter, and have gained 19.45% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 1.12% and 5.31%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to IDXX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. IDXX is currently averaging 540,176 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with IDXX.Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost IDXX's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.68 to $4.69 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that IDXX is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B.

It has been significantly getting advantages from bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets. Further, management's regular share buybacks underscore the company's robust free cash flow reserve.On the flip side, adverse foreign currency movement is a major headwind. Another concern is the company's heavy reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables and its rapid assay products. Moreover, IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development as well as expansion in the United States and internationally.Additionally, a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This Animal diagnostic and health care company is expected to pos  of $0.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.9%.Revenues are expected to be $545.62 million, up 7.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Idexx, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Idexx will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Idexx would pos  of $0.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.05, delivering a surprise of +7.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Idexx doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Despite the dip, the leader in veterinary services still looks like a good investment. data by  .Last year was another typical one for Idexx, which posted  on both the top and bottom lines through the first three quarters of the year. The company entered 2018 having grown organic revenue and earnings per share 10% and 20% year over year, respectively, in 2017, and the numbers got even better in 2018.Idexx grew organic revenue 12% year over year to $1.663 billion through the first three quarters of 2018. Earnings per share soared 31% year over year.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The momentum was so strong that management kept raising the full-year outlook through the second quarter. However, that changed in the third quarter, when management slightly lowered expectations for full-year organic revenue to grow by 11.5% to 12% year over year. The updated outlook was somewhat lower than the 12.5% organic revenue growth management had previously called for at the high end of the range.That seems like a silly reason to punish the stock, but when there is pessimism hovering over the broader market, any sign of slowing momentum can cause short-term-focused investors to hit the sell button -- especially for stocks like Idexx that trade for high price-to-earnings ratios.Idexx continues to benefit from more people, especially millennials, spending more on pet care, and pet owners will spend on their furry babies no matter what the economy is doing. This is one reason why Idexx shares typically trade for a high valuation. for continued growth in the new year, with organic revenue expected to grow 9.5% to 11% over 2018. That should translate to earnings-per-share growth of 15% to 18% (adjusted for changes in foreign currency conversion rates). Investors probably balked at management's revenue guidance, which is lower than previous figures. However, the long-term trend of increased spending on pet care is in the company's favor, which should keep Idexx growing for many years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by 7.1%.Revenues rose 10.9% year over year (up 12% on organic basis) to $545.4 million. However, the metric was somewhat in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The upside was driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, including high-teens revenue gains in IDEXX VetLab across consumable and double-digit reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services. Further, steady rapid assay sales growth contributed to the top line.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the third quarter, CAG revenues rose 12% (up 12.9% organically) year over year to $478.1 million. Water segment's revenues were up 6.7% from the prior-year quarter (up 8.9% organically) to $33.1 million. LPD revenues grew 3.6% (up 7% organically) to $29.4 million. Revenues at the Other segment declined 17.7% on a reported basis to $4.8 million.Gross profit increased 11.5% to $305.6 million in the reported quarter in spite of a 10% rise in cost of revenues to $239.8 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $2.22 billion.Management raised the EPS guidance to $4.16-$4.21 from the earlier $4.10-$4.20, supported by continued operating margin expansion and expected rise in share-based compensation tax benefits. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 41-43% on a reported basis compared with 39-43% stated previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 adjusted EPS is pegged at $4.19, within the guided range.IDEXX also provided a preliminary guidance for 2019. Full-year revenues are expected in the range of $2,385-$2,425 million, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9.5-11% (reported 8-9.5%). EPS, in the meanwhile, is projected in the range of $4.61-$4.75, reflecting annualized growth of 15-18% (constant currency) or 10-14% (reported).

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IDXX options chain for the new March 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $190.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $190.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $186.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $207.50/share today.Because the $190.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

And when we can get over 2,000 practices, 16% same-store sales growth in their diagnostics, when they start adopting preventative care.\" Later, he noted that those 2,000 veterinarian practices pushing preventative care to their clients only make up about 10% of IDEXX's total customers, leaving plenty of potential growth ahead.As it usually does, IDEXX released 2019 guidance in conjunction with its third-quarter results, which Ayers sees as a sign of the steadiness of the company's business:Management adjusted 2018 guidance, lowering the top end of guidance by 0.5 percentage points to reflect the lower expectations from farm animals and international lab growth. Nevertheless, revenue is still expected to come in 11.5% to 12% higher than last year.Earnings in 2018 are expected to be about $0.04 higher than previously anticipated -- now at a $4.16 to $4.21 per share, a boost of 33% to 35%. Most of the increased expectation is coming from higher projections for share-based compensation tax benefits, but there's also a $0.01-per-share hike from higher-than-expected operating margins.Looking to 2019, management is guiding for organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 11%. While that's slower growth than 2018, this year has a 1-percentage-point gain from new revenue standard accounting changes. Backing that out of this year's growth, the top end of the guidance is the same.On the bottom line, IDEXX's management expects to continue to have efficiency gains with earnings growing 15% to 18% year-over-year growth at constant currencies, substantially faster than revenue.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I appreciate you joining us for our third quarter .IDEXX delivered strong revenue and profit gains in Q3, keeping us on toward our full year goals. Today, I'll take you through our third quarter results and our updated outlook for the full year 2018. I will also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2019. Jon will follow with his comments.In terms of highlights for the third quarter, revenues of $545 million grew 11% on a reported basis, net of 1% foreign exchange growth headwind. Organic revenue gains of 12% continued at a strong pace, driven by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, supported by 13.5% growth in the US. Overall organic revenue growth was slightly below our midpoint projections for the quarter, reflecting moderated growth in international reference lab revenues, impacted in part by hot weather conditions in Europe.Operating profit of $117 million increased 17% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued high organic revenue growth and 140 basis point constant currency improvement in operating margins. EPS was $1.05 per share, an increase of 39% on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting strong operating profit gains and benefits from US tax reform. Reported EPS results also benefited by approximately $0.08 per share from share-based compensation tax benefits that were approximately $0.05 above our expectations for the quarter, reflecting earlier timing of exercises.In terms of our 2018 outlook, we're updating our full year revenue guidance to $2,205 million to $2,215 million based on an outlook for 11.5% to 12% organic revenue gains and updated estimates for FX impacts. In terms of our outlook, we expect to deliver full year organic growth trend -- growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in line with our year-to-date trend of 13.2%, supported by continued strong growth trends in the US and in expanding international consumable revenues.We're pulling down the high end of our most recent projected overall organic growth range by 0.5% to reflect expectations for near-term pressures on LPD revenues and tough Q4 comparisons for instrument replacements as well as updated expectations for international lab growth, which will constrain the additional CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth acceleration, we targeted for the second half of this year.We're refining our 2018 EPS guidance to $4.16 to $4.21 or 33% to 35% growth on a comparable constant currency basis, a $0.04 per share increase at midpoint, reflecting $0.01 per share increase for operational performance, supported by our expectations for operating margin gains at the high end of our previous guidance range and $0.03 of upside related to higher projections for share-based compensation tax benefits.In terms of our 2019 preliminary outlook, we're projecting revenue of $2,385 million to $2,425 million, supported by organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 11% and EPS of $4.61 to $4.75 per share, resulting in comparable constant currency EPS growth of 15% to 18% aligned with our long-term financial goals. Our organic revenue growth outlook reflects expectations for sustained strong CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue growth of 11.5% to 12.5% in line with 2018 trends adjusted for the approximately 1% and non-recurring growth rate benefit from the new revenue accounting standard change. Our EPS outlook incorporates $0.03 per share in projected headwinds from FX and expectations for $0.10 to $0.13 per share and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation activity in 2019, which I will review in more detail in my comments.Let's begin with a review of our Q3 performance by segment and region. Strong Q3 results were driven by ongoing momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $478 million, up 13% organically, reflecting continued strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13% organically, including a $5 million or approximately 1% in growth rate benefit from the new revenue accounting standard changes, primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement.Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues also increased 13% organically. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and continued strength in our digital diagnostic imaging business, reflected in a 29% increase in diagnostic imaging system unit placements.Our Water business revenues grew 9% organically in third quarter to $33 million, supported by solid growth in the US and double-digit gains in international regions, including very strong growth in Brazil.Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue in Q3 was $29 million, up 7% organically. Quarterly growth was aided by favorable comparisons to low prior year revenues related to health herd screening of export cattle into China. Gains in poultry revenues were offset by end market impacts related to African swine fever outbreaks in China, which is our largest market for swine diagnostic testing. We also continue to see impacts from lower  in key markets, which is constraining dairy testing and Bovine pregnancy test sales. Given these factors, we expect flat to modest declines in LPD organic revenues for the full year 2018 with mid-to-high single-digit revenue declines projected for the fourth quarter.By region, US revenues were $341 million in the quarter, up 13% organically, driven by a 13.5% increase in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. US recurring revenue gains were supported by mid-teen revenue growth and US reference labs and consumables and continued solid growth in rapid assay sales. US CAG recurring diagnostic growth was primarily volume driven, with overall net price gains continued to trend in the 2% to 3% range. US recurring CAG Diagnostic customer retention metrics also sustained at very high levels, supported by steadily increasing levels of customers under long-term contracts. IDEXX's US recurring CAG growth performance continues to significantly outpace solid overall US veterinary practice market growth, reflected in our dataset from about 5,000 clinics. In Q3, patient visits were up 1% and clinic revenues increased 5% compared to the prior year period.International revenues in Q3 were $205 million, up 10% organically. International results were supported by 12% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. These results continue to be driven by consumable revenue gains of over 20%, reflecting expansion of our Catalyst instrument base, and increased utilization and adoption of new tests, including SDMA. We're benefiting from our focus on high economic value placements in international regions, which drove a 36% increase in placements at new or competitive accounts in Q3.International lab revenue growth moderated to the low-to-mid single-digit range in Q3, including slower growth in key European markets, which were impacted by weather conditions which constrained sample volume sent to our labs in the quarter. Our executional emphasis on driving high competitive Catalyst placement growth in international markets has also shifted some sales execution focus from driving international lab business, which we expect will contribute to mid-to-high single-digit international lab revenue growth in the near-term, which is factored into our refine growth outlook.In terms of segment performance, our Q3 results benefited from ongoing global expansion of our Catalyst and SediVue base. Globally, we placed 3,026 premium analyzers, up 10%, supported by 20% growth in North America, which benefited from a favorable comparison to relatively moderated placement gains in last year's third quarter, as we implemented our 2017 US field sales expansion. Our focus on high economic placements drove a 26% global increase and global Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts and strong double-digit EVI gains in both North America and International. As expected, our focus on high economic placements shifted some emphasis from chemistry upgrades in hematology instrument placements in the quarter, which constrained overall international premium placement growth of 4% compared to very strong prior-year levels.Globally, we placed 611 Catalyst in total in Q3, a 16% year-on-year increase, and 821 premium hematology analyst instruments globally, down 3% year-on-year. We achieved 922 placements -- Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts in Q3 or 57% of total. In North America, we placed 319 Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts or 75% of total. This represented a 10% year-on-year increase with 15% gains in the US. As noted, international Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts increased 36% year-on-year in Q3. We also drove strong continued momentum with SediVue, reflected in 594 global placements or 18% growth, driven by 30% year-on-year growth in North America. In addition to the strong premium instrument results, we placed 1,495 SNAP Pros in Q3 globally, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to almost 23,000.Overall, CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q3 were $32 million, up 10% organically, including $7 million in revenues attributed to the accounting standard change, which now more closely aligns instrument revenue recognition with the timing of the instrument placement. This amount was primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 customer program in the US. Our expanding instrument base and benefits from new test innovation continues to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains.Instrument consumable revenues of $153 million grew 19% organically in Q3. Results reflected continued strong gains in international markets and accelerated double-digit growth in the US. High volume driven consumable gains were supported by expansion of SediVue pay-per-view -- Pay per Run and SDMA slide revenues, which contributed approximately 4% combined to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter.Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $184 million grew 11% organically in the third quarter. US lab momentum remains very strong reflected a mid-teen volume driven organic reference lab revenue gains. As noted, overall lab revenue growth was moderated by low-to-mid single-digit gains in international markets.Rapid assay revenues of $54 million grew 6% organically in Q3, reflecting solid gains across the US and international markets. Rapid assay gains were primarily volume driven, reflecting continued growth of 4Dx PLUS, specialty and first-generation products.Turning to the P&L. Operating profit in Q3 was $117 million, up 17% as reported or 20% on a constant currency basis, with results driven by continued high profit growth in our CAG business. Operating margins were 21.5%, up 110 basis points as reported and 140 basis points on a constant currency basis.Gross profit of $306 million in Q3 was up 12% as reported or 13% on a constant currency basis. Gross margins of 56% increased approximately 40 basis points on a constant currency basis compared to prior year levels, net of approximately 25 basis points of negative impact related to cost reclassifications in our lab business from OpEx to cost of revenue. Gross margin expansion was driven by lower product costs in LPD and VetLab consumables, solid price gains and benefits from high consumable growth. Overall gross margin gains were moderated by investments in lab service capacity and employee benefits, including the increase in our 401(k) match levels as part of the tax reform reinvestment as well as unfavorable impacts related to instrument program mix under the new revenue accounting standard. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which benefit gross profit were limited in Q3.Operating expenses in the quarter increased 8% on a reported and 9% on a constant currency basis, resulting in approximately 100 basis points of positive operating expense leverage. Constant currency operating expense increases were driven by higher global sales and marketing investment and higher G&A costs in the quarter, offset in part by the lab cost reclass. We incurred a $2.6 million impairment of work in progress assets related to the SNAP fecal product in Q3, which was recorded in G&A, which was offset by favorable changes in and other accruals.As noted, EPS in Q3 was $1.05 per share, including $7 million or approximately 8% per share in tax benefits related to share-based compensation activity, which as noted, was about $0.05 per share above our expectations. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 39% including benefits from US tax reform.Our effective tax rate was 14.5% in Q3, including approximately 6% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation impacts. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q3 2017 and 2018, decreased operating profit by $3 million and EPS by $0.03 per share.Year-to-date free cash flow was $180 million. We continue to expect free cash flow of about 70% to 75% of net income for 2018. This reflects a consistent outlook for full year capital spending of $140 million, including approximately $50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and our German core laboratory location as well as additional projected cash deployment related to strong program instrument placements.Our strong cash flow generation supported the allocation of $73 million in capital toward the repurchase of 300,000 shares in the quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased $1.3 million shares in an average price of $207 per share, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $1.22 billion in debt, $147 million in cash and $435 million capacity under our revolving credit facility.Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.74 times gross and 1.49 times net of cash. We continue to maintain a 2018 full year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1%, which we assumes that we maintain net leverage at 1.5 times EBITDA. We now project annual net interest expense of $34 million to $35 million, reflecting additional benefits from capital structure optimization.In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2018, as noted, we're refining our full year revenue guidance to $2,205 million to $2,215 million, reflecting an organic growth outlook of 11.5% to 12%. This reflects a full year outlook for CAG Diagnostic organic revenue growth in line with our strong year-to-date trends, which include about 1% of growth benefit related to the implementation of the new revenue standard.For the full year, we now expect a 0.5% reported revenue growth benefit from foreign exchange, slightly less favorable than earlier estimates, as the recent strengthening of the dollar offsets first half gains. Our updated organic -- overall organic growth outlook lowers the high end of our prior guidance range of 11.5% to 12.5% by 0.5%. As noted, we're planning for near-term pressure on our LPD business related to end market factors, impacted swine testing in China and dairy testing globally. We've also factored in expectations for moderated growth in our international lab business, which will constrain the additional acceleration in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth that we had targeted for the second half of 2018.For the fourth quarter, we expect reported revenue growth in the 7% and 9% range, net of an estimated 2% FX headwind. We expect to sustain high recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains in Q4, supported by continued strong US trends. We are projecting a moderation overall organic growth to the 9% to 11% range related to tough prior year comparisons in global instrument placements and expectations for lower revenues in our LPD business.In terms of EPS, we're raising our 2018 full year guidance by $0.04 per share at midpoint to $4.16 to $4.21 and narrowing our projected EPS range to reflect an outlook for 33% to 35% comparable constant currency EPS growth. This outlook incorporates expectations for 110 to 130 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement at the higher end of our prior guidance range, which supports approximately $0.01 per share and operational improvement at midpoint. Our EPS guidance assumes $0.01 in full year benefit related to FX changes net of hedge impacts in line with earlier estimates.Our updated EPS guidance assumes 2018 effective tax rate of 18% to 18.5%, 100 to 150 basis point improvement compared to earlier guidance, netting approximately $0.03 of EPS upside. This tax rate includes an updated estimate of approximately $21 million or about 5% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercises of share-based compensation. At the midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about $0.23 per share in full year benefit. This level of benefit is much higher than we previously expected for this year and reflects increased realized benefits related to the rapid appreciation of IDEXX's stock price, including earlier timing of exercises.As we'll discuss in our preliminary guidance of 2019, we anticipate that about 10% or 13% per share of the EPS tax benefit we realized this year, will not carry over into 2019. As we look ahead to 2019, we're targeting continued strong revenue and profit growth consistent with our stated long-term goals. Our preliminary revenue outlook is $2,385 million to $2,425 million, reflecting expectations were 9.5% to 11% organic revenue gains, supported by 11.5% to 12.5% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.Note that our 2019 results will now be fully comparable under the new revenue standard, which we estimate will provide about 1% of growth rate benefit to CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in 2018, that will not recur in 2019. Our guidance reflects expectations for overall reported revenue growth of 8% to 9.5%, net of an estimated 1.5% foreign exchange headwind related to the recent strengthening of the US dollar.Our preliminary 2019 EPS guidance of $4.61 to $4.75 per share incorporates expectations for operating margin improvement of 50 to 100 basis points on a constant currency basis, also consistent with our long-term goals. At the rates assumed in our press release, we estimate FX will decreased revenue growth by about 1.5% and EPS by $0.03 per share, net of established hedge positions, which at current rates would result in approximately $10 million of net pre-tax gains.Our projected 2019 effective tax rate is 20% to 21%. This outlook assumes $9 million to $11 million in share-based compensation tax benefits assuming our current share price and no change in US tax policy. As noted, this is $0.10 to $0.13 per share below the tax benefits we're projecting in 2018. We are projecting a 1% reduction in shares outstanding related to share repurchases that consistent leverage levels and relatively higher floating interest rate cost, which contributed current projections for net interest expense next year of about $38 million.Adjusting for changes in currency, share-based accounting benefits and discrete tax effects, this 2019 EPS outlook equates to projected 15% to 18% comparable constant currency growth rate, on track with our long-term goals. Our preliminary 2019 guidance factors in our most recent understanding of tariff related effects, which we currently estimate would have a relatively limited financial impact in IDEXX. This is an area we'll continue to monitor and update in our business plan as we move forward.We look forward to providing an update in more detail review of our 2019 guidance in our year-end conference call. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments. -- Hi, thank you, Brian, very comprehensive as always.Overall, IDEXX's organic growth remained strong, driven by our companion animal diagnostic recurring revenue, which increased 13.1% globally in Q3, including 13.5% growth in the US. This diagnostic recurring revenue globally constitutes about 75% of IDEXX's overall revenue. The quality of our instrument placements was strong in the quarter. Globally, we achieved 26% growth in Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts. Important because these placements are the primary driver of our organic instrument revenue -- consumable growth, which was 19.1% globally in Q3. New and competitive Catalyst at 922 units grew 10% in North America and 36% internationally, which is supporting that very strong instrument consumable growth. This reflects our continued focus on the economic value index of different types of instrument placements.EVI is an index of value to IDEXX of the instrument placement in a particular market that comes from both the instruments and consumables over the many future years. SediVue placements also continue (ph) to track in line with our robust plans, a 594 placements, up 18% year-over-year. As part of a multi-year customer agreements under our US-based IDEXX 360 program, SediVue instrument placements also help expand all IDEXX Diagnostic revenues. This builds customer retention and allows our fuel organization to focus on advancing the standard of care through the appropriate use of diagnostics, including adoption of preventative care blood work.We continue to drive mid-teens growth in our US reference lab business, which accounts for almost $7 out of every $10 of our global reference lab revenues. Q3 continues to benefit from fecal testing, up 25% year-over-year in the quarter, with the growth in this category of lab testing driven entirely by panels that include our proprietary fecal antigen technology. And now in 2018, constitute a majority of our fecal revenues. Fecal testing along with preventive care blood work is driving strong same customer sales growth of reference lab services.European lab growth slowed in Q3, due in part to the heatwave impacting parts of Continental Europe over the summer, which reduce patient sample volumes into the reference labs. Also with the introduction of our EVI incentive program to our international commercial organizations this year, while we've seen exceptional instrument placement quality growth year-to-year as noted, the prioritized (ph) focus on instrument placements in our international markets has led to some unforeseen impacts on growth rate of our international reference lab testing services.We are already refining our international executional approach to benefit all of our modalities, including importantly the introduction of our IDEXX 360 program internationally, which has had a highly successful launch in the US at the beginning of this year.Rapid assay test kits with over 80% of revenue coming from US had an excellent quarter, particularly in light of the launch of a competitive product with SNAP 4Dx earlier in the year.Peer-reviewed research with head-to-head product performance comparisons published in the quarter demonstrates SNAP 4Dx Plus's significant superior ability to detect tick-borne disease compared to the competitive product. Customers tell us unsurprisingly that test accuracy is their highest priority. Accuracy in detecting the test is after all the whole point of the test. Our commercial team is doing a great job getting the results of these peer-reviewed research to our customers as they make their purchasing decisions.Overall customer retention trends in the US continue at world-class levels of 97% and 98%, and as customers adopt, use and value our unique innovations, including but not limited to SDMA, including Catalyst SDMA, SediVue, fecal antigen, VetConnect PLUS, software integrations and the differentiated IDEXX 360 program, and we know our customers value the IDEXX Diagnostic professionals who visit their practices. As a result, we see continued solid net price realization in the US diagnostics market in the 2% to 3% range. Customer retention outside the US is even higher at 98% as high as 99.9%, supporting similar solid net price gains.We are on track with our field-based expansions. The US 2018 expansion is complete and we have transition to the larger number of territories in Q4, thus shrinking the number of customers covered by a veterinary diagnostic consultant, as a result of our 13% expansion in field-based resources. There's always some adjustments when territories are redrawn, although with the experience of two prior expansions under our belt, we're getting even better at the transition process in the US. Regardless, we have a strong instrument placement compare from Q4 of 2017. And so while we expect a strong Q4 2018 instrument placement quarter in the US, the year-over-year growth of Q4 placements will reflect both the transitional impacts of the US expansion and the tough compare.Internationally, our plan is to have the expansion completed in early 2019, when we are on track to have over 400 field-based professionals. These global field expansions, the ongoing momentum in the US and the continued high potential for growth we see in international markets, gives us confidence in our put preliminary outlook of 11.5% to 12.5% organic growth of our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenue in 2019, consistent with 2018 trends, adjusting for the 1% new revenue standard growth benefit for 2018.I want to recognize the exceptional Companion Animal Group performance in Q3 of our international teams in Germany, Spain, Netherlands, the four Nordic countries, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, China, Japan and Southeast Asia. These commercial team show us how international as a whole can advance the adoption of IDEXX innovations to help pets and pet practices all over the world.A couple of other notes. Our Digital Imaging business had an exceptional Q3, building on our Lower the Dose (ph) campaign leveraging our unique digital radiography offering that reduces radiation exposure by veterinary technicians. Q3 and year-to-date performance of digital radiography placements growth rate is in the high-20s percent, with Q4 order rate trends also looking very strong as we begin to lap some tougher year-over-year comparisons.Our Water business also continues to achieve impressive organic revenue growth of 9% in Q3, due to commercial and innovation investments worldwide. We continue to make steady progress in building our Legiolert franchise in the Water business, which contributed 1% to revenue growth in the quarter. Our Legiolert product has a long runway of growth opportunity over the next few decades. Water's year-to-date organic growth of 10%, operating margins of 46%, limited investment capital and world-class levels of customer retention above 90% make the Water business and the team truly exceptional.Overall, our business trends are strong and our revenue performance is on track with our longer-term goals, which is reflected in our 2019 guidance. We are proud to have built a business model with enduring and predictable growth and profit dynamics. Perhaps this is why we are part of a small minority of companies that provides earning guidance in the Q3 call for the next calendar year. Note that this has been our practice for every year for the last 15. And further, we have an unbroken track record of subsequently delivering within or above that next year's earnings guidance range on an adjusted constant currency basis, quite a 15-year record. Perhaps unique and a testament to our business model and our team focus on innovation and the customer in delivering financial returns. And I am deeply proud of them.So we'll open it up to questions now.Thank you (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. -- Yes, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. My first one for you, just on the international lab growth. Can you speak to a little bit more detail there in regards to your comfort that there's no competitive changes, I know you mentioned the weather, you mentioned some sales force focus on instrument placements which makes sense, given the recurring nature of that and the high margin there, but any other color you could have and maybe how much was weather related, how much was the sales force refocus? And then what the retention rates were in regards to clients in US? -- Yes, thank you for the question, Ryan. The retention rates may remain exceptional in the international reference lab business as a whole. So we really don't see that was a factor. I think it's probably a roughly equal parts weather, which impacted Continental Europe where we have a lot of reference lab business, of course, out of our German core lab network. And in part, the executional focus obviously the 36% year-over-year growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements, which drove over 20% growth in the instrument consumable revenue, very profitable revenue for us was the good aspect of our international performance. And as we move forward, and we're introducing the IDEXX 360 program, which is really wraps in all the modalities. This is something that the international organization has just started to adopt. And I think we'll build competencies there at areas as we complete the commercial expansion through the end of the year and should bode well for 2019 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue in international market, which we've targeted generally at 12% to 16% range. -- And Ryan, just to Jon's point on some of the impact being weather, we've seen an improvement early in Q4 relative to some of the trends we saw in this summer, so that's clearly was part of the dynamic. But I think the execution will shift. I think it's proved in the near-term for us to have that mid-to-high single-digit growth rate overall in Q4. -- Yes, that makes sense. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, maybe a bit too nuance, Brian, but looks like sales and marketing at about $95 million was actually down on a sequential basis, which doesn't appear to be seasonal looking back over the last few years and somewhat surprising given the sales force investments we're making. So anything nuance there to explain why that actually took a downtick in the third quarter? -- Sometimes we can have just the charges or reversal in charges that impact those areas. We're on track for the additions that we had talked about in the US expansion, and I think that's reflected in the year-on-year growth, which was high-single digit. And I think that's more indicative of how we're managing it there. There can always be some noise quarter-to-quarter. -- I mean, also I don't know that's on absolute basis, so obviously the dollar strength. -- Yes, I know that's a good point, Jon. There were some changes in the reported numbers (inaudible). -- Okay, thanks. I will hop in the queue.Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. -- Hello, good morning. -- Good morning. -- Good morning. -- Hey, just one broad question, but I'm getting this across my overall coverage universe, I mean there's a lot of concern about slowing the consumer markets and macro concerns going on, and obviously, your 2019 guide doesn't seem to imply that you're still worried about the market. And I guess could you just talk about the broader (inaudible) what you're seeing? And I guess what do you sort of looking for in terms of economic indicators that you started too worried? Then I have a follow up. -- Yes, we have a very strong business in the US, obviously, very large part of the global IDEXX revenues. We are really -- we're very effective in creating our own growth. I think in general, our diagnostic recurring revenue has grown 800 basis points higher than nominal personal consumption expenditures. And that's been expanding over the last many years as we have -- people to really appreciate the importance of blood work and care. One thing we talk about, Derik, as you recall in the Investor Day was preventative care, it's really interesting. There's just a deep well there. We have about a little over 2,000 customers who have adopted our preventative care challenge program. These customers are growing their IDEXX diagnostics revenue at 16% on average, it's over 2,000 customers. That's less than 10% of our total customers. So that's driving very strong same-store sales growth and that's a result of the commercial investments we're making.And so if these kinds of efforts, which I think have allowed us to actually expand the differential between our recurring growth and nominal (inaudible) in the US. So -- and we're seeing, obviously, the economy certainly didn't affect our 36% year-over-year growth in instrument placements across international markets, and you noted the diverse set of countries that I mentioned. And so we're pretty diversified there. So we're not going to say we're completely immune to the economy, but we're very confident. If you think -- if you look back on the 15 years, we may have had a recession somewhere in the past. And yet we've delivered on our earnings guidance that we give, which I've mentioned is relatively small number of companies actually provides 2019 guidance. And we've delivered every year including in 2007, 2008 and 2009, each year we gave guidance, the October, the year before that year, and we delivered within or above on a constant currency adjusted earnings placement on those, which really shows on those -- on that guidance, which really shows the enduring predictability of the business model. -- Great. And then just one follow-up. If I heard you correctly, you said that your US sales force expansion was done. And then I'm just curious on sort of like the international push, and how much more you're going to spend incrementally on the national sales force? -- Yes, so our international is on its way. It's going to build over the Q3, Q4 and really into 2019 and so international group are hard at work on that. And so I saw that the numbers are all factored into our guidance. Obviously, when you're growing at double-digit rates, while we are -- even with the issues in the international reference lab growth in Q3 that were weather related. We grew 12% internationally, so it really gives us confidence. The opportunity we see internationally that took 36% growth in new competitive Catalyst placements as a result of the adoption of EVI. This really gives us confidence to continue to build on, we're really some world-class country teams around the world. -- And just one follow-up, just because I've gotten hit by a couple of clients (inaudible). So I guess people feel like that the '19 guide is a little bit conservative at this point in time. I mean, obviously you've got the stock-based compensation headwinds that are sort of factored in. I guess what are some of the puts and takes on the guide for next year? And just walk through it -- estimates of different levels of consensus estimate and so I'm just -- I think people are looking for a little more color? -- So I think, Derik, the key place to start is our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook, the 11.5% to 12.5%. That's basically right on our 2018 trend. So if you take the current guide that we have that our full year numbers going to be about in line with our year-to-date growth rate of -- it's 13.2%. And then just where the benefit growth rate -- benefit we're getting from the revenue accounting standard change, which is a little bit above one (ph). It's effectively approximately 12%, that's the midpoint for next year. So I think our guide on CAG extra (ph) recurring revenues is right in line with trend.We did point out that I think our overall organic growth will be up against some tougher comparison on just higher levels of instrument replacements. We're looking to grow instruments and get benefit from the investments we're making, but we've had an exceptional year and we're going to have a tougher compare there. And I think LPD, we're appropriately kind of cautious just given the -- some of the market dynamics, it's a business that's 90% international and more heavily weighted to emerging markets and I think we're being appropriate and having a more cautious view on growth in that area. But I think the underlying core driver of our economics in our business, the CAG recurring is very much in line with trend and that's supportive of the strong operational -- financial operational outlook that we shared (ph). -- And then with regard to the additional comments from Brian, with regard to the earnings, I do want to reinforce the point that Brian made in his prepared remarks that we're going to see a step down in the tax rate benefit, projected step down tax rate benefit from stock option compensation of 10% to 13% and that may not have been -- since we've talked about the benefits in 2018 all along, we have been very, very transparent about that. In 2019, we're going to have fewer options exercise. We have fewer options expiry. We had some pull forward into this year. So that's really a non -- that's an accounting change, but is -- when we look at comparable constant currency earnings growth, we get the 15% to 18%, which is in our guide for a long-term debt (ph). -- Okay, thank you.Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Block from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks guys, and good morning. Brian, I've been jumping between calls, I apologize if you addressed this. But just want to address or -- I think how we should view margin expansion in '19. And I guess I'm going with this is, is it more shared between gross margin and OpEx leverage relative to what we've seen in 2018? And then sort of a follow up to that, I'm guessing when we think about the quarterly cadence, is the OpEx leverage maybe a little bit bigger in 2H relative to 1H as you lap some of the more recent investments? -- Yes, I think that's a good way to look at it, Jon. I think we're expecting to have gross margin improvement, driven by the things that we've been focused on, which is sustaining solid price gains and improving productivity in our operations, including global labs. And those in growing areas like our consumable revenues which have benefits for us. And we expect to build on that. I think that the OpEx leverage we do have another wave of investment here around the US expansion as well as the international expansions that we've highlighted that, we will -- we think our (inaudible) high return investments have been very successful for us as we've accelerated our growth in recent years, and just reinforces the opportunity that we see -- continue to invest in growing the market. And I think to your point that will create relatively more of a challenge earlier or we're in the year in terms of comparison later in the year. We'll share more color on that obviously as we get to finalize our plans and provide the full year numbers for you on the Q4 call. But I think that's an appropriate way to look at it. -- We always appreciative of your questions Jon and recognize the situation you are in. We are very committed to our long-term goals of 200 basis point operating margin expansion, which we're over delivering -- expect over delivering in 2018 and expect to continue to deliver on 2019 and over the long term. -- Got it. Thanks, Jon. And maybe one or two more if I may. Jon, anything on the competitive update, I mean are you seeing any changes in the field with the recent acquisition of the batches and the deal actually closing positive or negative for you guys in any alterations to pricing in the market or changes in the ways, what is coming to market overseas? And then I've got one quick follow-up to that. Thanks. -- I think we have -- the answer is really no. The one comment you may have missed in the prepared comments is that we published peer reviewed research, which shows a substantial superiority in our SNAP 4Dx, obviously an important franchise in detecting tick-borne disease and heartworm. And as I commented, accuracy is the number one criteria for customers in purchasing decisions after all, that's the whole point of running the test disease. And we're doing a great job with our close to 500 field-based professionals getting the word out on the differential.And we had a very strong rapid assay quarter in Q3, mostly US business 3% in the base of a competitive product launch against the important 4Dx franchise. The year-over-year growth of 26% globally in new and competitive Catalyst placements (inaudible) right along. And so really we haven't skipped a beat here in Q3. From a competitive point of view, our customer retention rates remain very strong and consistent maybe even slightly improved in the US and very, very high, even higher internationally. Our price realization continues in the 2% to 3% range in the US and somewhat type of price realization internationally.We believe that our opportunity here is to create our own growth. And when we can get over 2,000 practices, 16% same-store sales growth in their diagnostics, when they start adopting preventative care. And I know you did some studies on that. That's really less than 10% of our total customers who work with us on preventative care. We get 16% overall diagnostics recurring revenue growth in these customers year-over-year -- in the last year when they adopt this program. This is the opportunity that we have. And of course, we're unique in being able to do that, because our diagnostic line finds more underlying disease and finds it earlier. And so with all the additions of the SDMA or differentiated hematology fecal antigen, the quality 4Dx, it actually increases, just the medical justification and evidence based medicine to run preventative care blood work on pets of all ages. And that story is resonating and has a very, very long term runway and is unique opportunity for IDEXX to do. So really no changes in the competitive environment to answer your question. -- Got it. I will just take my last one offline. Thanks for your time guys.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Thanks. You discussed the international lab business, but I'm just curious what you've seen in terms of the competitive landscape, growth was pretty strong in the US in particular, any major changes there or what are you kind of hearing in the field? Thanks. -- Thank you. No real changes in the US. A very strong performance continuing to edge every quarter a little bit higher customer retention in the US. I think this is the continued adoption of unique value of innovations that IDEXX brings to the reference lab services, SDMA, Molecular Diagnostics, fecal antigen, VetConnect PLUS, and of course, 500 diagnostics subject matter experts that are calling on practices across the US every day. And so customers value our professionals coming in and helping them on how to advance their standards. And so it's a very strong -- the US reference lab business is very, very strong component of our overall diagnostic offering in the US. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, US generates almost $7 out of every $10 of global reference lab business. So an important element of the equation. -- Yes. Just to reinforce with some of the metrics we shared, Erin, we had 15% growth in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts. We had accelerated growth in consumable revenues, continued mid-teen growth in reference labs, solid continued volume growth in rapid assay, net price gains in the 2% to 3% range, the 13.5% overall, the US is really continuing to execute well, record levels of retention, record levels of customers on the contract, that steadily increases. So I think we're feeling great about the US business and... -- Yes, I don't want to say it's not competitive environment, it's always been a competitive environment. I just don't see any change in that competitive -- we're competing with innovation and growth and that's resonating with our customers. In addition, we have more and more of our customers who have elected to partner with IDEXX with our IDEXX 360 program, which is a very friendly way to add capital and combined with a multi-year commitment to IDEXX. -- And supported 30% growth in SediVue year-on-year North America (ph). -- So SediVue, many times when we place SediVue within IDEXX 360, we get the entire diagnostic revenue of that customer under a five, six-year agreement. -- Okay, great. Thanks. And then one last one, just drilling into rapid assay in particular here, any changes or surprises relative to your thinking on the competitive positioning on 4Dx Plus and how is the success in bundling in SNAP Pro? Are you seeing that improve overall kind of retention rates for what may be and inherently more vulnerable segment? Thanks. -- Yes, thank you. Thank you very much for that question. We published peer-reviewed research on the superior accuracy of 4Dx. And of course, this is very important to customers. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. But I do want to add a little bit more color on SNAP Pro. We had a very strong quarter for SNAP Pro placements, up 10% year-over-year in the US. And customers who have adopted SNAP Pro into their workflow are more loyal and grow their rapid assay test utilization faster than those -- that haven't. That's why we had a very solid I think rapid assay quarter in Q3. As of Q3, Erin, customers who are active and connected with SNAP Pro, meaning they are integrated with IDEXX and SmartService and everything, and they're using SNAP Pro. They constitute 57% of our SNAP 4Dx revenues in the US. This is a growing percentage over time as we continue to place instruments. And thus, we're well on our way to turning the SNAP 4Dx Plus market into an instrument-based razorblade business model.And Erin, I think you know, because SNAP Pro leverages IDEXX's unique integration of the instrument through IDEXX VetLab Station with the overall software of the practice, the practice information management system. You get big staff productivity and economic benefits from charge capture from this integration. Still totally unique to IDEXX after 10 years. And SNAP Pro built upon our overall VetLab integration ecosystem increasing the loyalty for not just rapid assay, but the overall diagnostic offering. So we are -- that strategy just continues to march along. And we are -- I think that's -- there are a lot of reasons why we had a solid rapid assay quarter in Q3 in the phase of competitive launch accuracy and also the evolution of the customer base with SNAP Pro. -- Thank you.Our next question will come from the line of David Westenberg with CL King. Your line is open. -- Thank you for taking my question. So the other one kind of on the European reference lab dynamic. You mentioned that you're talking to customers about getting them on to a little bit more of an EVI focus. And that would imply that you will have a revenue kind of catch up as these customers migrate, say, maybe more instrument. So just for the sake of our models, can you kind of just talk about how this might play out over the next few quarters and just to kind of reconcile what reference lab is going to do versus what instruments they're going do in Europe? -- So I think we feel very good with the instrument replacement momentum in Europe. Certainly, Q3 was strong quarter with a 36% year-over-year growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements outside the US, which of course was the EVI focus. And what we're going to be doing going into 2019 is starting to roll out the IDEXX 360 program internationally, which really wraps in growing the reference lab business as well as the in-house business in a multi-year partnership, along with instrument replacements. We think this will help us continue with strong instrument placements. And of course, consumable growth and also help us build the reference lab growth. -- And David, I think it's important to understand, EVI as a metric is very helpful for our sales teams and thinking about it when they're replacing or trying to replace instruments, what type of placements drive the most value. It's not intended to be something that shifts attention from growing the customer relationship and that is reflected in how we approach compensation, where we have the majority of our compensation is oriented toward overall recurring growth. I think what -- so I don't think the EVI metric should drive an issue in terms of reference lab growth. I think what we're acknowledging is that we've got a huge opportunity for instrument placements internationally in Catalyst and that's been our focus. And we've had somewhat of a shift from the sales execution toward that and that is something that we are anticipating we cab -- we move back and balance over time. And so don't see the near-term kind of dynamics is being something to be concerned about the long-term. But I think the -- just to be clear, EVI is I think not something that should negatively impact our growth in reference labs. -- Even in the near-term. Okay. Thank you very much. And then maybe just to go a little bit further on the European area, is there -- was there be any different kind of customer dynamics with the fact that there is fairly deep consolidation in Northern Europe, and maybe kind of offer what some of the challenges are there and maybe kind of some of the opportunities there are? -- Yes. So with the corporatization or consolidation that's taking place in Northern Europe, we are in excellent shape with most of the consolidators except for one, who has a competitive reference lab. And so, we think we're in very good shape to -- and in many of these are very interested in our opportunity to help them grow same-store sales, because what's happening is one hand (ph) they can grow through acquisitions. They'd also kind of like to grow four wall revenue, which have very nice drop through particularly with diagnostics and they are appreciative of the fact that we can bring resources to bear the current level through our commercial organizations. And of course, unique innovation to help drive growth. We're also have a fabulous software offering. We have leading cloud-based software in Europe, Animana. But the Smart Flow acquisition, which we're really excited about, we closed in early Q3 is a global platform and we have a strong base of customers in Europe, US and Australia. It's actually -- and adds value to really all customers with different practice information management systems, because it's workflow software.And then when we integrated with the PIMs, which we're already well on our way of doing with Neo, Cornerstone and Animana. It brings even more unique value to these customers. And so this is something I think will help us both in Europe and the US with these corporate customers that are looking for a partner who can bring a sophisticated enterprise software approach and there really isn't anyone else with the competencies and product ecosystem, software ecosystem, including cloud-based software ecosystem that can partner with our customers. And so, I think this will benefit us on both the software side as well as the diagnostic side. -- Yes, and I realize we're out of -- we're low (ph) on time, you can just answer this, yes or no. Does the 2019 guidance factor any sort of maybe late product launch? -- It factors all of our plans in place. So generally speaking, you can -- if you look at IDEXX growth in any particular year, most product launches have not really been a major component. It's really the core growth, the adoption of products we've launched over the last five to seven years. And so we're not making any product launch announcements at this point in time, but it factors in all of our plans for 2019. -- Thank you so much.And we will go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys, thanks. You had some hot weather in Europe in Q3, as we think about Q4 and into the first half of '19, can you just speak to reference lab growth? Brian, I think you might have made comments about potentially mid-to-high single-digit growth in the near-term from international reference lab. Historically, -- yes historically, you've been in the 13% to 14% growth rate in reference lab. So I guess excluding weather, is there any reason to think that, that level of growth might decelerate? -- You're talking about that would be global growth that you're referring to the 13%, 14%. -- Correct. Correct. -- Yes. I think there is nothing to say that we can't get back to those levels. We're certainly growing better than that in the US and have been. And I think we've got... -- And US is $7 out of every $10 with global reference lab buying, so an important contributor to the whole. -- So to your question, this is more of a near-term impact. We haven't gotten that granular heading into 2019, Mark, but I think there is an aspect of this that we've shifted some executional focus (inaudible). -- The other thing was there's really two facts going on, one is obviously lowers foot traffic, but the other thing is customers get concerned about sending samples to lab, when it's really hot out there, they're going to get explode along the way. And so those are the two factors which can -- and it was very clear the six weeks or so and some are (inaudible) that impacted our revenue. It wasn't the only thing for the slowdown, but it was... -- And Mark I just reinforce, the 2019 guidance basically for overall recurring growth is right in line with our year-to-date data trends (multiple speakers) -- Great. Look at the adjusted for the 1% -- 11.5% to 12.5%. So we're really seeing the fundamentals of the business continuing 2019 that we see year-to-date and through the balance of 2018 for total CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, which as you know is 75% of the total IDEXX revenues. -- Terrific. And then practice revenue of 5% was strong in the quarter. Historically, you've been somewhere in the 4% to 7% range. In terms of end user demand, did you see any changes there? -- It's remained very solid. And as you pointed out in a similar range of growth, and of course, as the overall growth in the vet clinics and we believe... -- Our customers are growing faster. -- Our customers grow faster, diagnostics grow faster and we influence that growth. So I think we're -- we feel good about the market trends particularly in the US. -- Great. Just one last quick one. I think you indicated at your Analyst Day that you intend to launch a new slide onto Catalyst sometime in 2019. Is that still your intention, and can you provide any color around what that might look like? -- Well, I think just to review the history in 2018, we launched the Catalyst SDMA slide and that has had great success. It's adopted by almost 50% of our global Catalyst base. We launched the SDMA T4 combo kit in the June-July time frame. We launched the CRP slide, which has been a great success outside the US. The US doesn't fully appreciate the value of CRP, they will in time, and we will continue to expand the menu. And we also expanded the menu on (inaudible) hemoglobin and other perimeter. So this is really a steady diet of menu expansion. We're not talking about any specific further expansions at this time, but they are in the pipeline of course. -- (inaudible) innovation.Okay. Thanks, guys. -- Thank you.Thank you. And Mr. Ayers I would like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. -- I just want to thank everybody and appreciate your attention during a very busy day. And also I want to thank all the employees. We just continue to have a great performance in terms of bringing advanced care to veterinarians, pet owners (inaudible) what drives us, it's what our purposes, and we look forward to finishing the year.And again, we are really proud to be able to provide 2019 guidance, which is something that not too many companies do. And we even more proud that we've done this for the last 15 years. And then we -- in terms of the earnings guidance and we've delivered against that earnings guidance within or above the range on an adjusted constant currency basis in the subsequent year that we provided guidance for. So it really is a testament to the team and the predictability and enduring growth characteristics of this business, driven by a very high degree of recurring revenue.So with that, we'll close the call.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This Animal diagnostic and health care company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +24.1%.Revenues are expected to be $545.63 million, up 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Idexx, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Idexx will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Idexx would post earnings of $1.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.23, delivering a surprise of +4.24%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Idexx appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

So it was no surprise that when  (NYSE: LLY) spun out its animal heath business,  (NYSE: ELAN) , with an initial public offering on Sept. 20 at an offering price of $24, investors snapped up the shares and the stock rose 50% on the first day of trading to close at $36. But is the stock a good investment going forward?In past years, Elanco's steady business provided stability and some top-line growth as the company went through some rough years of patent expirations between 2011 and 2014. But in recent years, Lilly's human pharmaceutical business has picked up and Elanco was more of a drag on growth than a boost. Lilly announced late last year that it would have a strategic review of its animal health business and the result was a decision to spin it off.The company offered 19.8% of Elanco in the IPO, selling 72.3 million shares to the public while holding on to the remaining 293.3 million shares. At the offering price of $24, Lilly raised $1.74 billion in proceeds and at today's stock price, the  of Elanco is $12.4 billion. Lilly intends to eventually separate completely from Elanco, possibly distributing its remaining interest in Elanco, currently worth $10 billion, to Lilly shareholders in the form of a special dividend.Image source: Getty Images.If Elanco's performance had been stellar, there wouldn't have been any reason for Lilly to spin it out. As it is, the record should raise some questions in the minds of potential Elanco investors.\n  \nData source: Elanco prospectus dated Sept. 19, 2018.The first thing that stands out when looking at Elanco's financial history is that revenue has been flat since 2015 and the company has been losing money on a GAAP basis every year for the last three years. Investors are generally willing to put up with losses as long as there is rapid top-line growth and a promise of big profit in the future, but growth has been elusive recently.There may be solid reasons for no growth and GAAP losses, but the detail behind these numbers should cause investors to be cautious about the stock. I think there are four reasons to be wary before buying.The biggest factor in what looks like mediocre performance by the business is the complication that has come from multiple acquisitions in recent years. Lilly has been growing Elanco by snapping up the animal health businesses from other pharma companies, including Janssen Animal Health from  in 2011,  Animal Health in 2015, and the vaccine business from Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica just last year. In the process, Elanco has been shedding less profitable products, closing unneeded manufacturing plants, and consolidating research and development facilities.The transactions have created large, noncash charges to earnings that cloud the real earnings picture. Elanco's business lost $311 million in 2017, but that includes expenses of $221 million in amortization of intangible assets, $162 million in severance expense, $90 million in integration costs for acquisitions, $43 million in inventory adjustments, and $32 million in facility exit costs. Stripping out all the acquisition-related expenses, Elanco suggests an adjusted net income figure for 2017 of $250.5 million, or $0.69 per share outstanding after the offering, but it's unclear how much of these costs will continue in the future and for how long.Further obscuring the profit outlook is the fact that the operating costs used to calculate adjusted net income may not be anything like the costs Elanco will have as a stand-alone company. The costs were based on allocation of centralized resources at Eli Lilly such as information technology, finance, legal, and human resources. The flip side of \"synergies\" that companies tout when they make an acquisition is the additional overhead and duplication that results when a business is spun out, and Elanco's prospectus doesn't offer any insight as to what real operating costs will be after the separation.Image source: Getty Images.Investors familiar with Eli Lilly won't be surprised to learn that Elanco has been hurt by competition in its companion-animal business. Despite the positive outlook for industry growth, the company has blamed competitive pressure and falling prices for lackluster performance in companion-animal products quarter after quarter, and that issue was no doubt very important in Lilly's decision to initiate a strategic review of the business.Elanco divides its companion-animal business into two categories: disease prevention, which accounted for 27.6% of Elanco's total revenue in the first half of 2018, and therapeutics, which accounted for 8.7%. From 2016 to 2017, organic growth of the therapeutic category -- revenue excluding acquisitions, strategic exits, and currency effects -- was a paltry 2%. But the bigger category of disease prevention had a  in organic revenue of 18%, managing to register an overall revenue increase solely due to the purchase of the vaccine business of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica.Elanco is dealing with energized competition from other big companies in the space, especially in its traditional area of strength in parasiticides from entrants by Boehringer and Zoetis. The solution will lie in the introduction of new products, and the company is seeing some results from its R&D investments. Organic revenue growth in the first six months of 2018 was 8% in disease prevention and 5% in therapeutics. New products, such as improved parasiticide Interceptor Plus, Galliprant for osteoarthritis, and Credelio for fleas and ticks, are largely responsible for the big improvement in companion animal growth this year.Patent protection is not much help to Elanco. About 75% of its 2017 revenue was from products that did not have patent protection. What helps is continual innovation in treatments and delivery methods, which will be a high priority for investment by the stand-alone company. It is currently working on 36 new product innovations that could result in launches through 2023. Those projects represent a lot of potential, but competitors are working on new products, too, so the landscape in the next five years remains an unknown to investors and therefore a risk.Image source: Getty Images.The companion animal market has a number of attractive qualities to it, as owners continue to pay up for care for their beloved pets while drug suppliers don't have to worry about insurance coverage or political pressure on pricing. But one problem with Elanco relative to other animal health stocks is the fact that almost two-thirds of its revenue comes not from companion animals, but food animals, and in that space, the market dynamics are a bit more conflicted.On the one hand, the world is seeing a growing demand for protein as the standard of living improves in emerging markets. On the other hand, in many parts of the world, there is increasing suspicion about medicines and additives that are given to food animals. Consumers are beginning to demand \"clean\" proteins that were produced without antibiotics, hormones, or other medicines designed to enhance animal growth. That trend is a big threat to Elanco's business.Animal antibiotics fall into two categories: shared-class antibiotics, which are used to treat diseases in both humans and animals, and animal-only antibiotics. The concern is more centered on shared-class antibiotics and the threat that pathogen resistance to the drugs in humans could increase due to exposure through the food supply.From 2015 to 2017, Elanco's revenue from shared-class antibiotics fell at a compound annual rate of 7%, while sales of animal-only antibiotics grew 4% annually. This year the situation has improved, with first-half sales of shared-class antibiotics flat and those of animal-only products growing 9% exclusive of currency effects. But the potential for new regulations and rising consumer demand for antibiotic-free protein, especially in North America, puts a large portion of Elanco's revenue at risk.Sentiment against antibiotic use in animals isn't the only thing Elanco investors need to worry about. The company also sells products with ractopamine, a feed additive used to increase the rate and efficiency of muscle tissue growth in cattle and pigs. The product is legal in the U.S. but banned in 160 countries, and China won't accept pork imports that have been treated with ractopamine. Making matters worse, generic competition has hit the products featuring the additive, helping cut sales of the company's ractopamine product for beef by a 28% annual rate from 2015 to 2017.Elanco's category it calls Food Animal Ruminants and Swine includes both trouble areas of shared-class antibiotics and ractopamine, and unfortunately is the company's biggest category at 40.7% of 2017 revenue. In 2017, revenue in the category fell 10%, and in the first six months of 2018, it is down 2%, excluding currency. A second food animal category, designated Future Protein and Health, brings together the more forward-looking product lines in animal-only antibiotics, vaccines, nutritional enzymes, and probiotics, and includes products for farmed salmon and chicken. That category, at 22.5% of 2017 revenue, had 3% growth last year and so far this year has company-leading organic growth of 12%.As noted above, it's very difficult to get a close read on what Elanco's earnings will be as a stand-alone company. In the prospectus, it does suggest a non-GAAP, pro forma number for net income in the first six months of 2018 of $177.2 million. Annualizing that number suggests full-year earnings per share is running at about $0.97, for a price-to-earnings ratio of around 34 times.Even with the positives of the animal health industry, that is a rather expensive valuation for Elanco stock, given its low historic growth, the uncertainties around its earnings, and the headwinds it faces in its primary businesses. Zoetis actually is cheaper, selling for about 30 times estimated 2018 earnings, even with the huge run-up in its stock price.Eli Lilly was smart to spin off Elanco, knowing that the market would give it a premium valuation due to the growth trends of the animal health industry. Results in 2018 so far suggest that the company's new products are taking hold and ending the stagnation that prompted Lilly's strategic review of the business.But investors would probably be better off avoiding the stock and looking at alternatives until Elanco's financials are clearer and/or the stock is cheaper. For now, Zoetis is the  in this space, with a greater proportion of its business in pets, where it is growing market share, perhaps at the expense of Elanco. Zoetis has a proven track record of growth and innovation, and although the stock isn't cheap, it's cheaper than Elanco.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $230.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $221.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $231.93/share today.Because the $230.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.52% return on the cash commitment, or 30.58% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $230.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $240.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of IDXX stock at the current price level of $231.93/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $240.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.89% if the stock gets called away at the November 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IDXX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing IDXX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $240.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $240.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.41% boost of extra return to the investor, or 20.96% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 33%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $231.93) to be 26%.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. It's Thursday, September 20th. Welcome to  ! I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio, it's the brand-new host of Monday's  . It's Jason Moser! Well, hello there! Good to see you! You know, you rattle off that ad spot at the beginning in your hosting duties. I'll tell you what, I never took your job for granted ever before. But this past Monday, it was a little bit different, sitting on that side of the table. It was a little bit different. I'm not going to lie, I was a little nervous. It was different. You're off to a great start, don't you worry! Well, thanks, I appreciate it! I'm excited to be able to do it! We're going to dip into the Fool mailbag. We're going to check in on General Electric. We have to start, though, with Darden Restaurants, which is the parent company of Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse, Capital Grille, Cheddar's. I still haven't been to a Cheddar's. Apparently, a lot of people haven't. [laughs] Yeah. Let's start with the same-store sales. Here's the thing -- first quarter profits, higher than expected. Overall, for Darden, this was a really good quarter. Same-store sales across their restaurant group was 3.3%, which is not a huge number, but that's a good number. And it's certainly higher than was expected. We see the stock dropping a little bit, but Darren's had a heck of a last 12 months. Yeah. They're having a good year this year, as well. You hit it, you hit the nail on the head there, these were very respectable results for what is a very competitive space. I think it's even tougher now, given the growth in quick service restaurants, the growth in fast casual. The competitive landscape for these guys is more competitive than ever.Every quarter, we talk about Darden. Olive Garden is what steers the ship. That's their crown jewel. Comps were up 5.3% there. I think they market that concept really well. They recognized their 16th consecutive quarter of comps growth in Olive Garden restaurants. It was interesting to hear the CEO talk about the prospects of delivery. They're not really on board yet with delivery from concepts like Olive Garden. They don't think the economics quite make sense for their customer demographic.On the flip side of the coin, Cheddar's one where the jury is still out there. It's proving to be a bit of a drag. I'm still actually not sold on that investment. It was not a cheap acquisition, at around $780 million. Total sales for Cheddar's grew 6.5%, but that was really due to opening new stores. It wasn't due to traffic. And that's a problem. And then, when you think about that, then you have to ask yourself the question, well, how many of these Cheddar's stores are they going to plan on opening? If you're having trouble genning up traffic, opening new stores isn't the answer. That just gets more expensive over time. And those are mostly company-operated stores there, anyway.I think you can see consolidation in the space making sense. You see companies like  , restaurant brands, Darden, you see Cava and  getting together. It does seem like consolidation is a way to really compete more effectively in the space, and I think Darden continues to benefit from that quarter in and quarter out. The Cheddar's acquisition really is questionable in this regard: you look over the last five-plus years with Darden restaurants, one of the things that they have been effective at is focusing on the flagship brand of Olive Garden. They sold off Red Lobster, I think it was $2 billion and change, maybe $2.2 billion, something like that. Part of the rationale there was, \"Look, we want to focus on Olive Garden.\" Obviously, they bought Cheddar's for far less money than they got for Red Lobster. But as you said, it was not a cheap acquisition. You look at this quarter, you break out the comps by restaurant, and across the board, it's 3.3%. As you said, leading the way, we've got Olive Garden, 5.3%. Cheddar's comps were negative 4%. I mean, that was a really, really a drag. Part of it is, I wonder how much brand awareness is out there for Cheddars. I don't know about you, but I have never seen or heard an ad for Cheddar's ever that I can recall. That potentially is a problem. They do a really good job at marketing their key concepts -- Longhorn Steakhouse, Olive Garden. You see good marketing campaigns centered around those businesses. And that makes sense, those are the two biggest names in the portfolio. But if they want the Cheddar's acquisition to prove out, I think they're going to have to do a little bit of a better job of creating some brand awareness, marketing that out there a little bit. Right now, I just don't think the customer awareness is quite there. Frankly, I can't even tell you what they serve or what kind of demographic they're aiming for. I guess, Cheddar's Scratch Biscuits tells you a little bit about it. But there are a lot of biscuit places out there, Chris. I make some really good biscuits at home, so I don't even know why I have to go to Cheddar's. Why? I make my biscuits at home. It will be interesting to see, when we had recently the acquisition of Zo\u00ebs Kitchen, we talked about on  at the time, Look, you look at Cava and the success the Cava has had. You look at the acquisition they make of Zo\u00ebs Kitchen. There's no way they're not converting some of those locations over to Cava. I'm wondering if we're going to see, over the next couple of years, to some small degree, some of these Cheddar's locations get flipped, whether it's to an Olive Garden or to some of the smaller brands, Bahama Breeze, etc. It's certainly a possibility. It's hard to say. I wonder, does Cheddar's maybe compete against the Cracker Barrel demographic? I don't know, it's really difficult to say. But I think that is always an out they have, if they decide that concept just isn't working out. They have some other proven concepts in the portfolio that they could certainly shift over to. Shares of General Electric are down again today, this time on an analyst downgrade. This was not the typical, \"Well, we think, we feel,\" kind of downgrade. This was specifically about concerns in GE's Power division, a gas turbine launch that looks like it's going to have a negative effect on earnings, at least in the next quarter, probably the next couple of quarters. Yeah, it's distinctly possible. I think if you're an owner of  today, then you need to take CEO John Flannery's language very seriously when he says that they are in a multi-year transformational journey. In English, he's saying, \"You'd better pack a lunch, because it's going to be a while.\" I think we've come to accept that, based on how many moving parts are still involved with this business. They're trying to shed certain assets and refocus and get the business back around its core in Aviation, Power, and Renewables. I like that move. I think that's the right strategy. The downside to that is, though, when you run into trouble in any one of those core segments, it really has a material impact on the business. I think we may see something like that play out here if there are indeed troubles with the turbine blades that were discovered from  , I believe is the power company.Flannery noted on the most recent call that the biggest challenge the company faces right now continues to be the turnaround of the Power of business. I think that tells us a lot. The core of the business is still, I don't want to say in trouble, but it sure is close. It requires a lot of working capital to operate. You look at their balance sheet today, to call it challenged is really an understatement. I think if you're going to be an investor in GE, you truly have to take a long-term outlook here. Understand that it's going to be three years before we see any real material progress.I actually think that Flannery can do it. I think that he's probably the Alan Mulally for GE. I think if anybody can get this taken care of, he can. He's proven he's not scared to go in there and shake things up. We've seen them already shed a lot of assets in order to try to streamline this business and just get back to focusing on what they're really good at. But it's going to be a bumpy ride. Give him credit for being as clear as he can possibly be. He's done that throughout 2018. He's just been very clear, like, \"Look, this is what's going on. This is how long it's going to take. You can get on board if you want, but pack a lunch.\" Yeah. That's just such a big advantage for investors. He is very transparent. You know what you're getting into. I feel like he's a no-BS kind of guy. He speaks to analysts very frankly on the calls, he gets out in front of things. I think that's a real strength that they're going to be able to benefit from in the coming years, if they're going to get this business turned around. Our email address is  . Question from Evan Machete, who writes, \"What do you know about Elanco Animal Health and this week's public offering? The company is seemingly a dynamite fit for Jason Moser's healthcare and wealthcare space. I don't usually invest in IPOs, but is this company worth watching over the next few months?\"They certainly had a great IPO. Elanco Animal Health was spun out of  . Kudos to them, because the range of the stock going into the IPO, they bumped it up $24 a share, and it took off like a rocket. Yeah. You can be forgiven if you thought Elanco was perhaps yet another venture of the Elon Musk's that was just taking him into another direction altogether. [laughs] If you like SpaceX and you like flamethrowers, wait until you check out our animal health line! Yeah. First and foremost, I'm pretty consistent with my general feelings when it comes to IPOs. I think you need to wait and watch. I think you need to give it a couple of quarters so you can assess what you're dealing with, in regard to the business, in regard to management. Given everything I've learned about Elanco, I'm going to stick with my guns on that one there.That said, I do think it is a very interesting company, given what it does. What do they do? They are in the business of animal animal vaccinations, animal health, whether its companion animals or farm food animals. They are producing a lot of the vaccinations and nutritional supplements and whatnot for that space. And it is a very big market opportunity. You look at it altogether, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of $35 billion. It's not insignificant. It's an attractive market in that it's very resilient, high barriers to entry. I think they stand a chance to do very well, given their background as a part of Eli Lilly for so long.Now, with that said, there is tremendous competition out there. If we look at Elanco today, 2017 revenues came in around $2.9 billion.  , which is another company out there in the same market, they're bringing in basically about double the top line that Elanco is, and it's a much, much bigger company. They have, of course, more resources. Now, that's not to say that Elanco can't be successful. I think they can. It reminds me a lot of a company I covered a while back called MWI Veterinary Supply. That was a business that was in very much sort of a similar line of work. They were acquired by  not all that long ago at a premium. I think a lot of that was because of the market dynamics. It's just a very attractive market.One thing to keep an eye on with this company is going to be how much they continue to devote to research and development. That's really how these businesses remain relevant. I look at a company like  , for example, which is a stock I own, I recently purchased it. They are in the business of the testing equipment and diagnostics supplies for veterinarians and the companion animal group. Not a competitor, really, with Elanco, but you could see with Idexx, they consistently devote a significant percentage of the revenue every year to research and development, to continue to advance and bring new products to the field. I think as long as Elanco does that, if we can look at that R&D line and see that they are investing in the business, they stand to do well, well.But, it is a brand new IPO. You have to recognize Eli Lilly is still going to hold a lot of control of this business, at least in the initial stages of its existence as a publicly traded company. But, yeah, there's definitely something there. I could see why this company would do well. It's a very attractive market. Before we wrap up, reminder that we are hiring here at The Motley Fool, all kinds of jobs. We're good on podcast hosts for the moment, unless... I actually have a meeting with my manager later. I think you're OK. A lot of jobs posted at  . Check that out. You mentioned Elon Musk earlier. This week on  , our guest is Ashlee Vance from Bloomberg. Talked to Ashlee, taped an interview yesterday with with Ashlee, talking a lot about Elon Musk, because Ashlee Vance literally wrote the book on Elon Musk. A great read!Last but not least, on  tomorrow, Friday, the  episode, Dylan Lewis is going to be talking about wearables, among other things. You got a sneak preview for Monday's episode of  ? Yeah. I'm having a lot of fun trying to put together some new things to try and whatnot. We'll always be doing a stock on our radar thing. We stole it from  . We call that One to Watch. I think that we are going to discuss  's relationship with banks, the relationship they've been trying to forge and haven't seemed to really do such a good job of at this point. We're going to talk a little bit about  and their attempted entry into the banking market, as well, through their Prime membership, which we know pretty much dictates everything they do. And, as always, taking some questions from  , email, and whatnot. Joined every week with Matt Frankel, he's a Certified Financial Planner. He's down in South Carolina, so he calls in and we have a good conversation. That's what we're thinking about hitting on Monday. How's he doing down there in South Carolina? Thankfully, he's OK. He's in Colombia. They avoided the worst of the flooding in whatnot. But it was a scary time for a lot of people down there, for sure. Big cleanup, and it's going to take a long time. Hang in there, Carolina!

Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.2%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 5.9%.Let's take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.IDEXX is expected to continue with its gain momentum in the third quarter, courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics' revenues. In the second quarter, this upside was driven by strong consistent gains from recurring CAG revenues, high premium CAG instrument placements and consistent high growth in digital business. Management vouches for this trend to be further retained.We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing its commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. We expect third-quarter results to reflect an increase in productivity as new sales representatives establish fresh customer relationships. Also, we anticipate the company to report solid growth in the recurring software services associated with practice management platforms and improved digital system placements.We also expect the company to register strong gains from high premium CAG instrument placements and continued solid growth in software, services and diagnostic imaging system businesses. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $477 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents an 11.7% improvement over the last reported quarter.Notably, IDEXX's 9.5-11% total revenue growth projection for the quarter to be reported highlights its organic gains of 11-13%. Overall, the consensus estimate for total revenues in the third quarter is pegged at $545.6 million.We pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business, lying on a growth trajectory of late, backed by encouraging test results in the United States as well as benefits drawn from the global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, the business witnessed 9% organic growth last reported quarter.The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high-single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018. The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at $33.4 million for the yet-to-be-reported period.IDEXX continues to expand its global footprint. It has been significantly earning advantages from bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets. Further, management's consistent share buybacks underscore the company's robust free cash flow reserve. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will influence the third-quarter conference call.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the company's heavy reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables as well as its rapid assay products. Moreover, IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development as well as expansion in the United States and internationally.Additionally, a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance. Thus, the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag, which in turn, might hurt third-quarter results.Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. It also has an Earnings ESP of +0.26%.

(NYSE:  ) (\"HSIC\" or \"the Company\") with a \"Strong Buy\" opinion and a $106 - $126 price target, or approximately 30%-50% upside potential. Spruce Point has spent months conducting a critical forensic and fundamental analysis of HSIC, including its planned spin-off of its animal health business and merger with Vets First Choice (\"VFC\"), a privately held company.With the stock market near all-time highs, and growth at a value price very difficult to uncover, Spruce Point has been restrained in the past few years to recommend a stock long with a compelling risk/reward. In fact,  was Mavenir Systems (  ) in January 2015, which was  .Our detailed research report is available on our  . We also encourage all of our readers to follow us on Twitter  for regular updates. Please review our disclaimer at the bottom of this email.Henry Schein announced on April 23, 2018 that it would spin-off and merge its animal health business with privately held VFC to create a new company to be named Vets First Corp. We believe that investors are awaiting the S-1 (new security filing) and S-4 (merger filing) to obtain more information and future projections on Vets First Corp. Given the current information void, Spruce Point conducted big data analysis and a large proprietary survey of vets that reveals significant underappreciated growth at VFC.We believe analysts are overly focused on the pressures of HSIC's dental business, and ignoring the tremendous growth at VFC. We expect that investors and analysts' focus and sentiment will shift in the coming weeks and months as the growth that we've uncovered becomes much more evident.Vets First Corporation will be run by Benjamin and David Shaw. The Shaw Family has created a tremendous amount of value in the animal health space as David Shaw was the founder of Idexx (now valued at ~$22B). The Shaw family created VFC as a result of vet practices having lost a majority of the revenue stream that they had garnered from selling prescriptions. Historically, vets were both the doctor and pharmacy for animals.However, the internet disrupted the latter for vet practices over time. Vets First Choice seeks to bring back the lost prescription revenue stream to the vet practice by bringing a front-end online pharmacy solution to all of its customers. Further, Vets First Choice helps vets manage their practice by offering insights and ways to enhance compliance (filling prescription that a vet writes) which leads to greater profits for the vets, happier pet owners, and healthier pets.Henry Schein already services over 80,000 vets around the world and is the #1 animal health distributor and solutions provider in NA, Europe and Australia/NZ (>70% customer penetration). Furthermore, Henry Schein's animal health group employs a sales staff of ~680 employees vs. ~100 employees at Vets First Choice. We believe that VFC is leveraging Henry Schein's brand, sales force and existing install base to rapidly deploy its product offering.Spruce Point likes to make investments with highly attractive risk/reward profiles. Academic research and recent data points suggest that spin-offs outperform the broader market. Typical spin-offs exhibit early selling pressure in the first few weeks of trading.However, we analyzed HSIC's shareholder base, and believe a significant amount of HSIC shareholders will not only continue to own Vets First Corp., but could also be incremental buyers. We believe the success of last week's spin and IPO of Elanco Animal Health (NYSE:  ) illustrates strong underlying demand for animal health stocks. We believe VFC will have a better sales and EBITDA growth story than ELAN.In order to assess the current growth of VFC, we developed an algorithm to process over 40,000 zip codes through Vets First Choice's  . We continue to run the algorithm on a weekly basis to track vet adoption and currently find that over 7,900 unique vet practices are on the VFC platform. This compares with  . We believe that VFC's prescription management platform adoption is accelerating and that it is adding on average +80 new vets per week.At this rate of adoption, we believe that over 9,000 Vet Practices will have signed up for the platform by the end of 2018. Given recent momentum, we believe, that Vets First Choice's \"install base\" will grow +75% in 2018. This rate of adoption is significantly above the level last disclosed by HSIC and will be a key valuation driver of sell-side analyst models.Using our proprietary \"Vets First Choice Database,\" we conducted a survey of over 100 vet practices. The survey participants offered insights into their practice's sales levels and cadence on the Vets First Choice Prescription Management Platform. Further, our survey was able to identify simple changes that vet practices could employ that would lead to greater traction with their existing install base. For example, our survey finds that vet practices who no longer fax prescriptions are currently seeing 45% higher sales on the VFC platform versus practices that still fax written prescriptions to their competition.The newly created entity, Vets First Corp will be growing its EBITDA at a faster clip than any other pure play animal health company in our peer group (Elanco (  ), Zoetis (  ), IDEXX Laboratories (  ), Heska Corporation (  ), PetIQ (  ), PetMed Express (  )). We estimate that Vets First Corp will grow its EBITDA to ~$500M in 2020, more than doubling our 2017E EBITDA of $242M. Longer-term, we believe that the install base exiting 2020 could achieve between $2.2B and $4.0B of EBITDA should each Vet practice reach between $250K and $500K of sales on their Vets First Choice prescription platform.We think the stock approaches this level by the end of this year as more information is released to the public, the spin-off nears consummation, and an expanded analyst universe assumes coverage of VFC with strong buy recommendations. We believe that investor knowledge that Vets First Choice's install base has grown to +7,900, as well as our conviction that Vets First Corp can reach ~$500M of EBITDA by 2020, merits an immediate repricing of HSIC shares today on modest industry multiple assumptions. Our upside case to $126/share (+50%) assumes HSIC/VFC garners a premium multipleSeptember 2018Source: Henry Schein Q2 2018 PresentationSource: Vets First Choice August 2018Source:  , Vets First ChoiceSource: Reverse Morris Trust: Intended to be a tax-free spin-off to Henry Schein shareholders for U.S. tax purposes, followed by a merger with Vets First Choice Expected to close: end of 2018/January 2019 Expected ownership:Source:  , Vets First ChoiceSource: Spruce Point inspected the HTML code behind Vets First Choice's Vet Finder and found that it was accessing a searchable API on the AWS server.

We believe that Idexx has a bone to pick with its former founder who we believe did not leave Idexx on good terms. Both Idexx and Vets First Choice are headquartered near each other in Maine, and are now fighting both locally and nationally for top talent. Via LinkedIn, we believe at least 35 former employees have left Idexx for Vets First Choice. We believe Amazon (  ) poses a risk to almost every online distribution business. That being said, there are some models that need high touch points and a different level of service than Amazon can provide and/or intends to provide. Akin to what has transpired with dental practices, we believe more vet practices will create or enter into group purchasing organizations ((GPO)) which may pressure prices in the long run.

For the First Trust Dorsey Wright People's Portfolio ETF (Symbol: DWPP), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $33.44 per unit.With DWPP trading at a recent price near $30.32 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.31% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DWPP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Varian Medical Systems Inc (Symbol: VAR), FleetCor Technologies Inc (Symbol: FLT), and Idexx Laboratories, Inc. (Symbol: IDXX). Although VAR has traded at a recent price of $108.94/share, the average analyst target is 12.75% higher at $122.83/share. Similarly, FLT has 11.30% upside from the recent share price of $217.21 if the average analyst target price of $241.75/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting IDXX to reach a target price of $267.50/share, which is 10.34% above the recent price of $242.43. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of VAR, FLT, and IDXX:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n  \nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Shares have added about 5.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Idexx due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.IDEXX Laboratories reported second-quarter 2018 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.23, up 29.5% year over year on a reported basis and up 33% on a comparable constant exchange rate (CER) basis. This also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2%.Revenues rose 14.1% year over year (up 12% on organic basis) to $580.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $574.9 million.The upside was driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (\"CAG\") Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains in in IDEXX VetLabacross consumable and reference laboratorydiagnostic and consulting services. Further, steady overall growth contributed to the top line.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the second quarter, CAG revenues rose 15.3% (up 13% organically) year over year to $507.4 million. Water segment's revenues were up 11.2% from the prior-year quarter (up 9% organically) to $32.6 million. LPD revenues grew 3.9% (flat organically) to $34.9 million. Revenues at the Other segment rose 6.7% on a reported basis to $5.6 million.Gross profit increased 13.6% to $332.4 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin contracted 27 basis points (bps) to 57.2% on a 14.8% rise in cost of revenues to $248.3 million.Sales and marketing expenses rose 9.8% to $96.3 million, while general and administrative expenses increased 10.1% to $61.1 million. Research and development expenses rose 9.3% to $29.5 million. Operating margin in the quarter improved 99 bps to 25.1%.IDEXX exited the second quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $174.6 million, compared with $159.2 million at the end of the first quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $153.7 million, compared with $141.5 million in the year-ago period.IDEXX has lowered the upper end of its 2018 revenue outlook to a new range of $2,205-$2,230 million (earlier range was $2,205-$2,245 million). However, the company has raised the lower end of its 2018 revenue organic growth guidance to 11.5-12.5% from the previous 10.5-12.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $2.23 billion, within the guided range.Management also raised the low end of its EPS guidance to $4.10-$4.20 from the earlier $4.06-$4.20, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 39-43% on a reported basis compared with 38-43% stated previously.

The stock has surged 51.3% against the industry's 9.5% decrease during this time frame.IDEXX's innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability has been accelerating recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. In the last reported quarter, CAG revenues rose 13% organically year over year, supported by strong CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth, high premium CAG instrument placements, and continued solid growth in software, services and diagnostic imaging system businesses.IDEXX's VetLab consumables organic revenue growth was also strong, driven by an expanding premium instrument base in the United States and international markets, including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and continued strong customer retention.We encouragingly note that IDEXX has been continuously demonstrating solid growth, globally, with strong international expansion. International revenues in the last reported quarter of 2018 rose in double digits organically, aided by considerable organic gains in international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues.Meanwhile, majority of IDEXX's consolidated revenues have been derived from sale of products in the international markets in 2017. Thus, the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies had a negative impact on the company's revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and on profits from products manufactured in the United States and sold internationally. For 2018, adverse currency movements are expected to affect the bottom line as well.Also, intense competition, along with high dependence on third-party distributors, remains a concern for IDEXX.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Integer Holdings Corporation  , Intuitive Surgical  and Masimo Corporation  .Integer Holdings' expected long-term earnings growth rate is 15%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see Intuitive Surgical's long-term expected earnings growth rate is 14.7%.

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.Thank you. And good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered continued high growth and excellent financial results in Q2, building on our strong start to 2018. In terms of highlights, Q2 revenues of $581 million grew 14% on a reported basis, driven by consistent 13% organic growth and CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, 21% growth in premium instrument places, and favorable year-on-year foreign exchange changes. EPS was $1.23 per share, an increase of 33% on a comparable constant currency basis. These results reflect strong revenue growth related to operating expense leverage which drove a 110 basis point constant currency improvement in operating margins and net benefits from US tax reform. In terms of our outlook, we're raising our full-year organic growth outlook to 11.5% to 12.5% and refining our full-year revenue guidance to $2,205,000,000.00 to $2,230,000,000.00.The reported revenue outlook is down $7.5 million at the midpoint compared to our earlier guidance, as operational upsides are offset by $20 to $25 million of negative impact related to the recent strengthening of the US dollar. We're raising our 2018 EPS outlook by $0.02 at midpoint to $4.10 to $4.20 or 32% to 36% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. At the midpoint of our guidance range, this new outlook builds in approximately $0.07 per share of full-year operational benefit related to our raised organic revenue growth outlook and updated expectations for 90 to 130 basis points in full-year of constant currency operating margin improvement, incorporating benefits from our strong first half performance. This outlook also factors in additional investments we're advancing in our global commercial capabilities, which we'll discuss in more detail today.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Idexx Laboratories wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!We're also projecting $0.02 in full-year EPS benefit, related to a lower effective tax rate, including additional tax benefit related to stock compensation activity. These increases more than offset a negative $0.07 per share impact from our updated FX assumptions, net of hedges. We'll review our updated 2018 outlook in more detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Strong Q2 results were driven by continued momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $507 million, up 13% organically, reflecting strong gains and recurring CAG diagnostic revenues, high premium CAG instrument placements, and continued solid growth in our software services and diagnostic imaging system businesses.Global CAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased over 13% organically, including a $5 million or approximately 1% growth rate benefit from revenue accounting standard changes, primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging system revenues increased 9% organically. These results were supported by solid growth and recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and continued strength in our diagnostic imaging business, driven by a 16% overall increase in diagnostic imaging system unit placements, including a 49% increase in high end digital radiography system installations. Our Water business revenues grew 9% organically in the second quarter to $33 million, reflecting continued high-single-digit growth in the US, augmented by strong gains in Asia and Latin America. Livestock, Poultry, and Dairy revenue in Q2 was $35 million, or flat organically.Growth in recurring livestock diagnostic test revenues in the US, Europe, and Latin America was offset by lower revenues in Asia related to continued soft and market conditions, including impact from lower  , globally. By region, US revenues with $357 million in the quarter up 13% organically, driven by a 12% increase in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and strong growth in premium instrument placements. US recurring revenue gains were supported by mid-teen revenue growth in US reference labs and consumables and continued solid growth in rapid assay sales. US CAG recurring diagnostic growth continues to be primarily volume-driven with price gains trending in the 2% range overall. US recurring CAG diagnostic customer retention metrics are sustaining at very high levels, supporting our continued strong US growth profile. IDEXX's US recurring CAG growth performance outpaced solid US veterinary practice market growth reflected in our dataset from approximately 7,500 clinics.In Q2, patient visits were up 1.5%, and clinic revenues increased 5.7% compared to the prior-year period. International revenues in Q2 were $224 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by 15% organic gains in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. This reflected very high consumable revenue gains over 20% year-on-year in the quarter, supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base, increase in chemistry utilization, and new test adoption. We also saw continued solid gains in European lab revenues in Q2. In terms of segment performance, our Q2 results were supported by global gains across CAG diagnostic testing modalities and rapid expansion of our premium instrument base. Globally, we placed 3,241 premium analyzers, up 21% compared to prior-year levels, reflecting 11% growth in North America and 30% gains in international markets.These results were driven by 1,651 Catalyst placements, a 39% year-on-year increase and continued strong momentum in SediVue with 716 placements in the quarter. Since our launch in early 2016, we've now installed over 5,200 SediVues globally. We also placed 874 premium hematology instruments globally in the quarter. In addition to these strong premium instrument results, we placed 1,344 SNAP Pros in Q2, expanding our SNAP Pro install base to over 21,500 with nearly 20,000 installed in North America. Strong Catalyst performance in Q2 was supported by 1,200 placements in international markets, up 55% year-on-year, reflecting significant progress and upgrading our vet test install base and strong growth in placements at new and competitive accounts. Globally, we've placed 784 Catalysts and new or competitive accounts in the quarter, up 14% year-on-year. Consistent with our strategic focus, 346 instruments or 77% of North American Catalyst placements were at new competitive accounts.Our EVI index for premium instruments was up solidly in North America in Q2, supported by Catalyst gains and 32% year-on-year growth and SediVue placements, both benefiting from our multimodality IDEXX 360 program which continues to gain traction with customers. The use of EVI is also sharpening our focus in the international markets, supporting the outstanding Catalyst placement growth results in the quarter. CAG diagnostic instrument revenues in Q2 were $35 million, up 22% organically, including $9 million of revenues, attributed to the accounting standard change which now more closely aligns instrument revenue recognition with the timing of the instrument placement. Consistent with our first quarter results, this amount was primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 customer program in the US.Benefits from an expanding instrument base, the innovation that we brought to market in the recent years, and our expanded direct commercial capability continue to drive strong, recurring CAG diagnostic revenue gains. Instrument consumable revenues of $159 million grew 18% organically in Q2. Results reflected strong double-digit organic gains across US and international markets. Adoption of our Greenfield innovation continues to build with SediVue and SDMA on a slide, each contributing approximately 2% to year-on-year of consumable revenue gains in the quarter. Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $197 million grew 13% organically in the second quarter. US lab momentum is very strong, reflected in continued mid-teen volume-driven organic reference lab revenue gains and record high customer retention levels, now over 97%.We also achieved continued high-single-digit organic lab growth in international markets supported by higher gains in Europe. Rapid Assay revenues of $63 million grew 4% organically in Q2 with similar gains in US and international markets. Solid rapid assay growth was driven by continued expansion of 4Dx Plus, specialty, and first generation products. Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q2 was $146 million, up 19% as reported or 17% on a constant currency basis, driven by high profit growth in our CAG and Water businesses. Operating margins were 25.1%, up 110 basis points on a constant currency basis, aided by operating expense leverage on our strong revenue growth results in the quarter. Relative to our expectations, we saw some favorability related to timing of OpEx investments which supported our strong Q2 operating margins. These benefits are reflected in our raised full-year operating margin guidance. Gross profit was $332 million in Q2, up 14% as reported or 12% on a constant currency basis.Gross margins of 57.2% decreased 35 basis points on a constant currency basis compared to strong prior-year levels, including about 20 basis points of impact related to cost reclassifications in our lab business from OpEx to cost of revenue. Higher investments in lab information systems and service capacity; employee benefits, including the increase in our 401K match levels as part of the tax reform reinvestment; as well as mix impacts from high instrument revenue growth offset benefits from solid net price gains and ongoing productivity improvement. Foreign exchange hedge losses which impact gross profit were approximately $1 million in Q2. Looking forward, we anticipate relatively more favorable benefits from gross margin leverage in the second half of this year as we stepped up investments in areas like US lab route capacity advanced in the second half of 2017.Operating expenses in Q2 were up 10% or 7.5% on a constant currency basis, resulting in 140 basis points to positive operating expense leverage. Constant currency operating expense increases were driven by higher global sales in marketing and R&D investment, offset in part by the lab cost reclass. As noted in our press release, we're advancing incremental investments in commercial capability and the US and international markets which will increase the year-on-year growth in operating expenses in the second half of 2018. These investments are factored into our increased full-year operating margin improvement goals. EPS in Q2 was $1.23 per share, including $4 million or $0.05 per share in tax benefits related to share base compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 33%, including net benefits from US tax reform. Our effective tax rate was 20.9% in Q2, including 3% of tax rate benefit from share base compensation impacts.Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q2 2017 and 2018 increased the operating profits by $2 million and EPS by $0.02 per share. Free cash flow was $102 million for the first half of 2018. We continue to maintain our full-year outlook for capital spending at about $140 million. This outlook includes about $50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarters expansion and our German core lab relocation or about 15% of net income. We're now expecting free cash flow of approximately 70% to 75% of net income for 2018, reflecting these investments and additional projected cash deployment related to strong program instrument placements. These program instrument outlays are directly related to supporting the expansion of our highly durable CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and yield high, incremental returns on investment capital. We allocated $106 million in capital to the repurchase of 500,000 shares in Q2.Year-to-date, we've repurchased one million shares at an average price of $195.00 per share while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $1,043,000,000.00 in debt, $175 million in cash, and $412 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.84 times gross and 1.53 times net of cash. We're refining our 2018 full-year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases to about 1% which assumes that we maintain net leverage at 1.5 times EBTIDA. We now project annual net interest expense of approximately $35 million, at the lower end of our earlier outlook, reflecting additional benefits from capital structure optimization. In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2018, as noted, we're refining our full-year reported revenue guidance to $2,205,000,000.00 to $2,230,000,000.00.This incorporates operational upsides from our higher 11.5% to 12.5% organic growth outlook, including raised expectations for 12.5% to 14% full-year organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and flow-through benefits from our strong first half performance in growing premium instrument placements. As noted, these benefits largely offset $20 to $25 million of negative revenue guidance impact from revised FX assumptions for the year related to the recent strengthening of the US dollar. At the revised conversion rate assumption shown in our press release, we now expect a full-year revenue growth benefit of approximately 0.5% to 1% from FX with a 2% reported revenue growth headwind in the second half of 2018. We're raising our 2018 full-year EPS guidance by $0.02 per share at midpoint to $4.10 to $4.20 per share, reflecting an outlook for 32% to 36% comparable constant currency EPS growth.As noted, our updated EPS outlook incorporates approximately $0.07, an operational upside related to our higher organic revenue growth outlook and updated expectations for 90 to 130 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement. Our EPS guidance assumes a 2018 effective tax rate of 19% to 20%, a 50 basis point improvement, compared to earlier guidance, netting approximately $0.02 of EPS upside.. This tax rate includes an updated estimate of $16.5 to $18.5 million or approximately 4% in full-year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation. At the midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about $0.20 per share in full-year benefit. FX impacts aligned with the foreign exchange ratio in our press release partially offset these increases to our full-year EPS guidance.We now estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will have a $0.01 positive impact on full-year EPS or about $0.07 per share below our earlier estimates. Consistent with these assumptions, we estimate net hedge gains and losses will be relatively flat for the full-year. In terms of our third quarter outlook, we expect reported revenue growth in the 9.5% to 11% range, supported by organic revenue gains of 11.5% to 13%. We expect Q3 2018 operating margins to increase approximately 100 basis points above prior year Q3 levels on a constant currency basis as we ramp our commercial investments. In terms of FX impacts, in addition to a projected 2% revenue growth headwind, we expect year-on-year FX changes will have a modest negative impact on reported operating margins in Q3. So, the reported operating margin improvement will be somewhat below the 100 basis points I noted. We expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be 19% to 20%, including projected benefits from share-based compensation, exercise of activity.That concludes the financial review. Overall, our business momentum is very strong, and we're on track to significantly overdeliver against our original goals for 2018 financial performance. Let me now turn the call over to John for his comments.Brian, thanks. Let me put those great results in context here. Our strategy is to help veterinarians around the world grow their appropriate use of diagnostics in the care of the pet, keeping pets healthy and meeting the needs of owners. The current medical standards practice today broadly define a fraction of what they could be with IDEXX's unique toolkit of tests and services assisted by software technologies. So, in the second quarter, our commercial teams around the world made great progress advancing our strategy, as evidenced by the record Q2 instrument placements and the 13% organic growth and the testing that make up our Companion Animal Group diagnostic recurring revenues. Commercial successes, driven by field presence and ever driven field productivity drove the results that Brian enumerated.The productivity drivers include our EVI or economic value index basis for instrument placements which has now been adopted globally in 2018, our IDEXX 360 program to grow IDEXX proprietary diagnostics, and our investments in salesforce automation. Our advanced CRM helps our field professionals answer the three key questions they face every day: \"Where do I go?\" \"Who do I see?\" and, \"What do I say?\" The extensive proprietary real-time data we have integrated into our CRM, salesforce.com, empowers our consultants to be highly relevant to our customers in supporting their adoption of IDEXX innovations and advancing their practices. Our IDEXX 3 program has already shown significant successes in the North American market, evidenced by the second quarter performance of 346 Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts and 650 SediVue placements up 32% year-over-year. We will be implementing the IDEXX 360 program in major international markets over the next six months.We expect this customer-friendly program will advance instrument placements further and support the enduring growth of IDEXX's diagnostic recurring revenue. A key feature of IDEXX 360 is that the customer can meet their diagnostic growth commitments by testing where they want, in-house or reference labs, and what they want. In addition, customers' adoptions of IDEXX's new and unique tests further support their revenue commitments to IDEXX while growing the adoption of these unique test innovations. Our successes, momentum, and increasing productivity of our sales and marketing team combined with the market opportunity of our unique offering gives us confidence to expand our commercial presence yet again in the second half of 2018. In the US, we are already under way with 13% expansion in our field-based professionals which we expect to be fully in place and in territory by the beginning of Q4 2018.This will bring us to an estimated 490 field base professionals, up from 435 in Q1. When we expand our presence in the field, each IDEXX professional is able to spend more time with each customer. And thus, our relationships with each customer deepens further. We have consistently found, quite simply, the more we call on customers, the faster they grow with IDEXX. We also know customers who use IDEXX for their in-house and reference labs are larger and grow their revenues faster than practices who do not use IDEXX for either. So, the deeper presence will help us with instrument placements, including the novel SediVue Dx for urinalysis, pro usage of our proprietary assays and technologies such as SDMA and VetConnect PLUS, increased customer loyalty and retention, and support the growth of IDEXX's unique strategy to advance preventative care testing at the reference lab, what we call the preventative care challenge, leveraging IDEXX's unique, expanded test menu.Note that we are pleased to see over 20,000 US customers now use IDEXX reference labs, an all-time high in Q2 of 2018, a level never achieved before in this most basic metric of IDEXX metric presence. Our successes outside the US market has led us to the same conclusion. There is a strong ROI for IDEXX when we invest in the disciplined expansion of our field professional presence. And so, in the second half of 2018, we are embarking on growth in our field presence in targeted country markets where we see the greatest opportunity. These expansions range from 20% to 100% in field-based professionals depending on the targeted country. Overall, outside the US, we're planning to increase our field-based presence to 390 professionals, up 15% from 340 at the end of 2017. This does not include increases in supporting personnel, including phone-based and marketing staff.So, in total, our global field-base presence with professionals in the field who are experts in diagnostics and software, supporting our customers, will be an estimated 880 by the end of 2018. Internationally, we've also been moving our sales structures to customer-centric models, similar to the one we put in place in North America a few years ago, and to great effect. Key markets where we have a strong in-house and reference lab with a direct sales approach such as Australia, Japan, the Nordics, and Germany have already moved to this structure over the past couple of years. Germany, in its second quarter in the new structure saws very strong instrument placements with Catalyst placements up 75% year-over-year and strong reference lab organic growth. The UK will move to this account model at the beginning of 2019, the last major market to do so within the IDEXX international portfolio.These initiatives will help us further develop the unique innovations that we have brought to the market in the last two to four years which, cumulatively, have created a highly differentiated portfolio of instruments, rapid assays, and reference lab services. The 13% growth that we are achieving is coming primarily from the core portfolio of tests and services that make up our Companion Animal Group diagnostic recurring revenues with smaller benefits from new products launched within the last 12 months. These smaller products contributed about 0.5% to our organic growth in Q4. This momentum, augmented with our expanded global commercial presence gives us high confidence we can sustain high growth and the companion animal group recurring revenues as we move forward. We like to provide an update on our new test innovations.In July, we have launched the Catalyst SDMA T4 combo kit in North America which follows earlier launches of Catalyst CRP and Catalyst SDMA, contributing to the growing IDEXX proprietary in-house testing menu. Most of the international markets will follow with the SDMA T4 combo kit launch within the next two months. This test innovation will further advance SDMA adoption and Catalyst as well as grow T4 utilization with all the benefits to customer retention, new customer acquisition, consumable revenue growth per customer that we have discussed in the past. Looking forward, we are reassessing our SNAP fecal product currently in development. We believe we have more work to do than initially appreciated to bring a fecal SNAP to the field with the level of outstanding sensitivity and specificity that we are currently able to deliver with the reference lab Fecal Dx offering. At this time, we're not in a position to provide a targeted launch date.We don't anticipate this change will impact either out 2018 or 2019 revenue growth plans, given the large number of current growth drivers already in play in our North American Companion Animal Group commercial operations. Our commercial focus in the fecal testing category will be building on the tremendous success we are experiencing with our proprietary fecal antigen reference lab offering, Fecal Dx. Our unique technology for both routine and sick animal intestinal parasite screening and testing in our reference lab offering finds more disease and finds it earlier in the infection cycle than just the traditional microscopy approach.Fecal Dx is also a key piece of our proprietary preventative care challenge that is appropriate for all life stages of the dog and cat. Combined with lab 4Dx, the chemistry panel, and with an IDEXX SDMA, and the unique aspects of the IDEXX CBC, we have assembled a comprehensive screen for the seemingly well patient to uncover underlaying diseases that are impacting pet's health and wellbeing and which can be addressed with a treatment plan. We're finding that advancing the appropriate case for preventative care testing using IDEXX proprietary panels in the reference labs is a long-term growth driver for the reference lab volumes and our existing customers in the US. The preventative care challenge really defines what IDEXX is all about: serving the pet, pet owner, and veterinarian alike. We also continue to add to our capability in providing solutions to veterinary practices to support the management of their business.Of note, our veterinary software and services business has just gotten stronger with the recent acquisition of Smart Flow just after the quarter ended. Virtually, every paper formed in the veterinary practice can be captured electronically using Smart Flow, enabling a truly paperless practice and importantly, ensuring all service charges are captured and added to the invoice and proving both practice efficiency and revenue and profitability. Smart Flow is a very innovative treatment workflow enhancement to the core practice management software systems such as Cornerstone and provide a high ROI due to its impact on productivity and the plugging of revenue leaks from hospital charges not captured. Quite similar to what IDEXX has done with diagnostic integration in VetConnect PLUS, Smart Flow also enhances IDEXX's overall software offering to our customers who need enterprise IT solutions. Practices with enterprise needs currently consist of about 10% to 15% of the global market.Wrapping up, the market, our strategy, and our execution in the field is driving strong growth in our Companion Animal Group diagnostic recurring revenue with Q2 organic growth of 13%. These recurring revenues contribute an estimated 75% of our overall IDEXX revenue. So, a core enduring growth driver. We are advancing a software strategy that builds on key elements of our strategy to accelerate customer growth and loyalty. Our raised organic growth for 2018 is reflective of the strong momentum we are building in our businesses, position us to continue to deliver on our long-term revenue and profit goals. So, in summary, all of IDEXX remain dedicated to our purpose to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees, and shareholders by enhancing the health and wellbeing of pets, people, and livestock. And with that, we'll open it up to Q&A.Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press * followed by 1 on your touchtone phone. You will hear a tone indicating that you have been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from queue by pressing the # key. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, for any questions or comments, press * and then 1. Question will come from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.Thanks. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik.Hey, Mike.Thanks for taking my call. Couple of quick questions. 1) I just wanted a little more clarity on what you just talked about, John, with Fecal SNAP. You mentioned previously it was expected in the summer of 2018. And on the last call, you said it was more about workflow and some of the earlier response you got from the early users on just optimizing the workflow. So, wanna get a little more clarity on what has changed since then and why this additional change to the fecal. And then a quick follow-up on the sales force expansion. You highlighted some of the international markets you're going, but in the United States, for example, is there any territory reshuffling associated with this? Or is this more just in each territory, additional sales force? And also, timing on how long you expect for those to get up to speed, three, six months. Things like that.Yeah. Thank you. On the fecal offering, we've been so successful with the proprietary antigen-based technology in the reference lab, combining it with core bloodwork, IDEXX chemistry with SDMA and CPC. And that fecal offering is gonna -- it's an outstanding level of sensitivity and specificity. And by the way, it's gonna advance further when we adopt the applied bio-code which is a technology we announced earlier in 2018. And so, in that context, we are continuing to evaluate the customer requirements we need for an in-house screening test for SNAP. So, really, what they -- and you heard all the investments that Brian mentioned that in expanding our reference lab, our presence, our information systems, and the field expansion, we're really going to be focusing on the reference lab side of the fecal testing in 2019. And as I mentioned, that wasn't a product that was even planned until 2019. And we don't think the change in our outlook here changes, of course, either 2018 or 2019 growth prospects.With regard to the US expansion, we're already actually hired the majority of the people as of now as part of that expansion. And they're in training the field. There's always a small reconfiguration of the territories when you do an expansion, by definition because we're adding more territories. That will take place in Q4. Typically, it takes a quarter for everything to get up to speed, but we have so much momentum, and obviously, we have a lot of supporting people in those territories: our veterinary diagnostic specialist, the instrument specialist, the professional veterinarians, that we -- and this is the third -- actually, this is the third expansion of this nature that we have done. So, we're really down the learning curve on how to do this smoothly with the field. So, that's gonna be fully in place toward the end of the year and obviously preparing for 2019.Thanks. Appreciate it. Look forward to seeing you at the analyst day.Yeah.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, seems like an important datapoint is the upped investments internationally with growing a customer-facing organization. Can you talk a little bit more about what's driving that? Is that increased demand for diagnostics that you're seeing opening up the market? Is it the company success rolling out EVI or 360 that gives you the comfort? Or is it investment ahead of potential competitors, maybe increasing their investments in the market? What's really driving that? Because it seems like a pretty big uptick.Thank you very much. We're very, very excited about the international expansion. And you're right. That is a new datapoint on the call and noteworthy that we're talking about. And it's really the fact that we've had just tremendous success internationally with our instrument business. Catalyst placements outside of North America up 55% in the second quarter. And we haven't even real -- we've only starting to achieve the benefits of EVI. We haven't even started with IDEXX 360. And we're really early days on leveraging the productivity benefits of salesforce automation, all of which working together increases the productivity of our investment. And so, given the market opportunity that we've laid out in past discussions and we'll reinforce in the investor day in a couple of weeks, we just see the opportunity to be significant. The other point I will make is that we launched SDMA for Catalyst internationally in the second quarter. And it's unbelievable what the take of it is.We had 50% of Catalyst customers outside of the US who purchased the SDMA. This is amazing because we've only been in the market a couple of months. As faster take up in the US -- I think these international markets -- our teams have done a great job. And they're more medically centric, believe it or not, than the US. And we don't even have reference labs in some of these markets that we've seen SDMA pick up, or a strong reference lab presence. And so, the proprietary nature of our offering -- once we get a Catalyst into a customer -- the loyalty of our Catalyst customers outside the US is 99.9%. And so, we really see the opportunity to double down on growth in these markets around the world.Okay. Very helpful. And given that it is a novel datapoint, just wanna get a little bit more of a reference here. Is the 15% uptick in the customer-facing organization OUS incremental to what you started with at the start of the year? Or did you have some plans to grow that, and now it's higher, and you're just talking about this 15% as an overall growth metric? So, any color there would be helpful. Thanks.Yes. It is incremental to what we had as our plan going into 2018. And it's really reflective of the exceptional performance that our teams have achieved and the maturity of our management teams and supporting functions. These are disciplined expansions. We don't do these things willy nilly. We wanna do them right. We wanna do them in a way that our customers benefit and our organization, in an organized fashion -- we know how to do this. We've done more of these expansions in the US, but we're prepared to take this kind of augmented growth mentality internationally. So, yeah. This is something that we really -- it was not part of our plans going into 2018, but we feel the ROI is there. And that's characteristic of IDEXX. We move very, very fast when we see new opportunities.Yeah. Just on the return point, if you look at the incremental growth that we're able to drive as well as the durability of these revenues, the inverse of 99% retention rate is a very long customer relationship. The return on these investments is several times what we're putting into it. And I think with the 55% instrument growth over 20% consumable growth, we're really encouraged by the momentum that we have. And I think this is a great place for us to be spending our time and our resources.And there's another interesting dynamic, Ryan, on top of everything we're talking about. What we've done in the US, we've basically upgraded all the vet test catalogues. There's less than I think 99 -- over 99% of our chemistry consumable revenue in the US is now coming from Catalyst customers. In large part, we aren't as far along, but we're well on our way. 85% of our chemistry consumable outside the US is coming from Catalyst customers. And so, while we continue to upgrade that test, we're actually turning our forces toward the new and competitive placements, and we don't have to spend as much time upgrading that just because quite frankly, there are not that many left.And usually, they're smaller or they're harder to upgrade. And so, we take the same resources and turn them to new and competitive. And of course, that accelerates the consumable growth which is why we're getting over 20% consumable growth in the international markets in Q2 because we've really turned now to the new and competitive. So, it's another reason why we feel good about augmenting our sales organization.Thank you. We'll go to line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Hi. Thanks. Can you speak to some of the more one-time factors impacting the gross margin in the quarter and the dynamics that are influencing that potentially better trend in the second half? And tied to that, can you speak to the overall price realization in the quarter and the sustainability of pricing trends in general across reference laboratory, rapid assay, as well as the consumables? Thanks.Sure. Why don't I start with price, Erin? We noted we were at a 2% net price increase in the quarter. It's very consistent with the strategy that we've been advancing. Not a lot of change on that front. I would say if anything, at the margin, we're just doing really well with new customer acquisition. And so, that's a growth-oriented investment that causes a little bit of moderation in the gross in that conversion.But that'll come back over time of course as we secure those accounts and get the benefits of growth with them over time. In terms of the gross margin dynamics, there are a number of investments that have been falling through cost of revenue in the first half. Late last year, we really stepped up some investments in our lab route capacity given the mid-teen volume growth that we were seeing in our US labs. We're rolling out and completing the rollout of our global limb system implementations that also flows through cost of revenue. We added capacity to our software services field service rep organization. And all those things are -- and we had some cost reclassification --Yeah. 20 basis points of ---- that we talked about. And so, along with the strong instrument growth, it's all flowing through gross margin at the moment. As we look ahead, we'll start lapping some of those investments, particularly the route capacity and the lab information systems will be moderating in terms of their growth. And so, looking ahead to the back half, I made a comment that we'll have more favorable comparisons. So, our increased operating margin outlook factors that in even as we're advancing these incremental commercial investments.Okay. Great. And then the sequential step-up in profits revenue in patient visit growth that you noted based on the metrics you track, do you think that there was any delay in the flea and tick season that possibly impacted overall visits and influencing your consumables or reference laboratory volume? What's embedded in your guidance also in terms of that underlaying veterinary demand trend in the US in particular and potentially what you saw over the course of the quarter? Thanks.Yeah. Thank you. I think with regard to our performance, we're not as dependent on the flea and tick season as maybe other companies that are serving the industry with different categories. But I think it was a slow start to the year that was probably weather. I think most people said April was a weird month. And then May and June were good months. And it's hard to parse this by month, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence about that. But I think the market is strong. And as you know, Erin, people love their pets. Millennials love their pets even better. And it turns out Generation Z may even be beyond millennials. So, millennials are moving into their own homes, and the first thing that comes is a pet.So, they're getting married later, having kids later, but they're getting the pet. So, I think the overall market is strong. I think our customer base, those who are using IDEXX and who are regularly working with IDEXX, we're finding this preventative care is a big growth driver. And that's one of the things that is driving particular our reference lab growth in the first half of the year.Okay. Great. Thank you.Thank you. And as a reminder, for any questions or comments, press * and then 1. And we will go to the line of Jonathan Block from Stifel. Your line is open.Thanks and good morning. Maybe two and change in terms of questions. John, you detailed the actual headcount associated with the recent expansion. Where is the approximate US call cycle after this most recent expansion of the sales force? And then where's the optimal call cycle as you see it after factoring in your level of innovation?John, we get that question all the time. The more we call on customers, the faster they grow with IDEXX. And because the adoption of our innovations is still a fraction of what it could be, the adoption of preventative care is still a fra -- just really, at the earliest stages. And the other thing is -- and we are really starting to see huge productivity from our CRM at salesforce.com. It's pretty impressive. A rep can now basically quickly sort their territory by any number of metrics of, for example, adoptions of what customers have purchased SDMA on a slide. And they can sort it and then pick the top opportunities, drop it right into map anything. And they got two days of calls on that particular topic. And it's really powerful. And it's used by the entire sales management team. That is really -- what we've been doing is building the infrastructure. And now we're starting to see the real benefit. So, we're going to -- this expansion allows us to make more calls on customers.And we expect a good ROI. It's hard for me to say where's the end of this because we're all about advancing the standards of care. And that's what we see as the opportunity. And the most mature market in the world, the US, is not mature at all. And then we look outside the US, and we say, \"If the international market got to the US standard of care, what would it take?\" And it turns out it would take 25 years of 10% organic revenue growth to get to the US standards of care. And of course, the US isn't standing still. So, yeah. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us, and this is gonna increase the call intensity with our customers.Okay. And just to try to quantify it a bit, are you some -- call it once a month in terms of your US salesforce and how frequent they're currently calling on your customers?So, remember, we call customers, everybody out there, whether they're using us or not. Now most practices use us for something but not all. So, we're calling on them whether they're using us or not. And I'd say once a month is -- and we'll have some more of those metrics. It's hard to say, obviously. The big customers, we're calling on far more frequently than once a month. And we're calling more than just with a veterinary diagnostic consultant.We've got professional service veterinarians, and we've got specialists, and we've now got the -- Brian mentioned as part of the gross margin factor the investments we're making with field-based field support reps who help them with their software. And this is highly appreciated. And our customers who have adopted our PIMS and our apps are larger and more loyal and growing faster. And so, yeah. There's a lot of working with customers. And they really appreciate our presence because we're really bringing subject matter expertise.Okay. I'm not trying to be difficult. Let me ask one more just to be clear. This is still part of the first question. But you made a lot of the hires. I guess what I'm trying to get at, by the numbers, it seems like you are calling on much more than once a month. I understand your growth has been highly, highly impressive. But I think what we're all trying to figure out is if there a point in time where this at least goes a little bit more on autopilot rather than handholding. So, John, just to try to get the crux of the question, if you're now at -- I think it was close to 600 reps in North America, what is peak number? Is it 700? Is it 1,200? Is it somewhere in between? Can you give us some context there? And then I promise I'll move on to No. 2.I guess the question is what is peak growth? We keep accelerating our growth. So, we can spend some more time on this on analyst day.Okay. Fair enough. So, the second question is really following up on SNAP Fecal. And I know you talked about the pipeline being very robust despite the setback in SNAP Fecal, but a couple questions here. So, 1) I wanted to be clear. Is this product still likely coming to market at some point? I don't think I really knew. And then the $50 million in incremental revenue that I think was supposed to be derived from SNAP Fecal, that could have been 100 to 200 basis points of incremental growth, depending on the cadence of those revenues. So, what was the point earlier in the call that you're gonna find ways to make up some, most, or all of that through the traction that you have at the reference lab? Thanks, guys.Yes. That is our expectation.Okay. That was pretty tight, so I'll ask the last .5. With this product seemingly unlikely to hit the market in '19, a big part of the IDEXX story has been a continual cadence of new products. Should we expect this to be replaced by something else that you may have in the pipeline next year? Thanks, guys. And I'll see you in a couple weeks.We're gonna bring more products to the market next year. They're all different types and sizes. And we'll have more to say when we get closer to 2019. I do wanna say though, what we're really benefiting from is the cumulative effect of the advancements in our proprietary test portfolio. And while everybody loves new products, we've got so many new products and so many proprietary advances out there that are still early in the adoption -- and which bring along all the other diagnostic recurring revenue that -- the vast majority of our growth is just the core growth that comes from the cumulative technology we've brought to the market over the last several years.Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.Hey, guys. Thank you very much. You reported outstanding consumables growth of 20%. This appears to be the strongest I've seen in a long time. And I guess Brian, for you, I think you indicated that both SediVue and SDMA on a slide added I believe two points to consumable growth in the quarter. Can you --That's right.Okay. So, that's clarified. And then as we think about -- I know you're not prepared to guide 2019. These products are certainly very early. Should we be thinking about these products as potentially two points additive into 2019 as we think about next year?So, a couple clarifications. Organic growth in consumables globally was 18%. It was over 20% internationally. These are long adoptions cycles. So, these products will continue to augment consumable growth in 2019.I think the way to think about it is consistent to how we talked in our long-term strategic plan where we highlighted a long-term potential for 9% to 13% recurring CAG growth. And we're obviously at the high end of that range right now. And incorporated in that were benefits from SDMA, SediVue, other new products, including fecal antigen labs, which I believe was -- I think we had a half point to a point in total from fecal antigen. So, these are things that build over time. And they all go into the mix and, as John pointed out, combine with our commercial approaches and integrated strategy to hitting those growth numbers. So, we're not trying to signal that we are adding to that long-term growth potential. We'll talk more about that at investor day. But I think we're executing quite well and at the high end of what we've been targeting to achieve. And we think with the additional investments we're making, we're looking to build on that momentum and sustain that into the future.Great. And then last quarter, you indicated that 42% of your Catalyst install base had adopted SDMA on a slide. Do you have an updated number on that? And I think you were hoping to get to maybe somewhere around 60% of your install base at the end of the year. Is that still maybe on track?Yeah. Thank you for that question. The 42% was a US number because we really haven't launched it internationally. We're right now at 50% globally. Sorry, almost 50%. 49% globally. And so, we're pretty happy with what the international did. International's at 50% and US is at 48%. That averages 49%. So, we're really pleased with the progress at this point in the year.That's great. And maybe one last quick one. Certainly, a very strong quarter highlighted by organic revenue growth that beat our forecast. Just wanted to ask on the rapid assay piece --FLEX4 from Abaxis  . Can you just speak to your view on what the proforma growth rate of that market is? Is that mid-single-digits? High-single-digits? Or can you talk about any competitive dynamics there?We achieved a little higher than 5%. I think we're at 6% in Q1 and 4% organic growth in Q2 in our rapid assay business, which, as you know, is predominantly a North American business, a US business. So, that was both in volume and price. There was a new test out there. Always, a new test generates some interest. I think the bloom is off the rose on that right now because I think customers appreciate the accuracy and sensitivity of our tests. And by the way, that's the reason why you buy these tests and run them is so they find the disease. And when they don't find -- customers are realizing it's pretty obvious that it's not capturing a lot of the disease that the 4Dx is. But we had to work through that. We're working through that, educating customers every step of the way. And so, there was some impact on that, certainly in our numbers in the second quarter.Consistent with what we had baked into our plans this year.Thanks. Look forward to the analyst day.Thanks, Mark.Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open.Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, I'm really excited about the adoption of SDMA in the clinic. Now I know that no customer is unique, and you're gonna see across the board behaviors. But can you give us a sense on how your customers are adopting -- what percentage of chemistry panels are they adopting, if you can give us that? Or if you can't, maybe can you just give us some anecdotes about how they're using it right now? Anything right now is helpful in understanding how quick that's going to be adopted.Yeah. Thank you very much. It's a great question. So, customers are at all different stages of the journey to belief and understanding in the immense clinical value that SDMA adds to a chemistry panel. We have several hundred customers in the US who are well along that journey and including SDMA, and the large majority of their panels are running SDMA at a large percentage of what they're running core chemistry panels. But we've got a lot more Catalyst customers than that. And there are people that are partway there. There are people that are just starting that journey. And so, this is a change in established doctrine. Over 50 years, we've made a lot of progress with the reference lab. But I think the availability of Catalyst SDMA is bringing new excitement.And I think we're seeing more and more customers. As they get experience with SDMA, they realize there's an essential element of the chemistry panel. We're gonna show some really interesting data, some of our big data on the impact that SDMA has at the analyst day, David, which I think you'll all find interesting. And this is why we're expanding our field resources because we gotta bring that story to the practice. And it's a great medical story. It's about medical education. And medical education is what advances the adoption of things like SDMA and our other proprietary expanded test menu.Thank you very much. So, just one last question in terms of international. So, one of your competitors was acquired by a large company that has international expansion. So, can you remind us a little bit about macro outside of the US, the utilization behavior, how Greenfield it is, whether or not somebody else in the market really has an impact in terms of the reach there, and what you can do there in terms of the Greenfieldness? I know that's not really a word. But just remind us about the international dynamics, please.Yeah. There are Greenfield customers. We think outside of North America, estimated to over 60,000 opportunities that either the small number of remaining vet test upgrades, competitive analyzers, which we're routinely swapping out by the way, and also of the Greenfield. The Greenfield's probably about a third of that 60. And yet, it's expanding because these markets are growing. People love their pets worldwide. And the medicine is advancing. And we're a driver to advancing that. So, we really do see a lot of growth opportunity globally which is why we're embarking upon this 15% expansion in our field-based professionals between now and the end of the year when you look at our internationals field as a whole.Thank you. And I will see you in two weeks.Great.And with that, speakers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.Yeah. Thank you. Thanks to you all for the call. And again, I wanna thank all the IDEXXers who are working hard to achieve our purpose of enhancing the health hand wellbeing of pets, people, and livestock around the world. It's why we do what we do. And along the way, we're generating a nice return on it. But we just have so much work ahead of us. It's what propels us. And we're pleased to be able to share those results with investors. And look forward to seeing you all either in person or through the reg FD presentation at our analyst day in a couple weeks. Thank you very much.Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service.

This also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2%.Revenues rose 14.1% year over year (up 12% on organic basis) to $580.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $574.9 million.The upside was driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (\"CAG\") Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains in in IDEXX VetLabacross consumable and reference laboratorydiagnostic and consulting services. Further, steady overall growth contributed to the top line.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other. | In the second quarter, CAG revenues rose 15.3% (up 13% organically) year over year to $507.4 million. Water segment's revenues were up 11.2% from the prior-year quarter (up 9% organically) to $32.6 million. LPD revenues grew 3.9% (flat organically) to $34.9 million. Revenues at the Other segment rose 6.7% on a reported basis to $5.6 million.Gross profit increased 13.6% to $332.4 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin contracted 27 basis points (bps) to 57.2% on a 14.8% rise in cost of revenues to $248.3 million.Sales and marketing expenses rose 9.8% to $96.3 million, while general and administrative expenses increased 10.1% to $61.1 million. Research and development expenses rose 9.3% to $29.5 million. Operating margin in the quarter improved 99 bps to 25.1%.IDEXX exited the second quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $174.6 million, compared with $159.2 million at the end of the first quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $153.7 million, compared with $141.5 million in the year-ago period.IDEXX has lowered the upper end of its 2018 revenue outlook to a new range of $2,205-$2,230 million (earlier range was $2,205-$2,245 million). However, the company has raised the lower end of its 2018 revenue organic growth guidance to 11.5-12.5% from the previous 10.5-12.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $2.23 billion, within the guided range.Management also raised the low end of its EPS guidance to $4.10-$4.20 from the earlier $4.06-$4.20, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 39-43% on a reported basis compared with 38-43% stated previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 adjusted EPS is pegged at $4.17, within the guided range.IDEXX exited the second quarter on a solid note. Moreover, solid year-over year growth in organic revenues and a raised EPS guidance for 2018 are encouraging.The stellar performance was driven by strong sales at the CAG business. The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth. Management's innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth.IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector having reported solid results this earnings season so far are Intuitive Surgical  , Chemed Corp.  and Align Technology, Inc.  . While Intuitive Surgical sports a Zacks Rank of 1, Chemed and Align Technology carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Intuitive Surgical reported second-quarter 2018 adjusted EPS of $2.76, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IDXX options chain for the new August 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $190.00 strike price has a current bid of 80 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $190.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $189.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $235.53/share today.Because the $190.00 strike represents an approximate 19% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

(Symbol: IDXX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $220.33, changing hands for $221.28/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 3 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $211.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $225.00. The standard deviation is $8.082.But the whole reason to look at the  IDXX price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with IDXX crossing above that average target price of $220.33/share, investors in IDXX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $220.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

These companies have a competitive advantage over players from other industries, courtesy of big data analytics, biotechnology and software development.The medical device fraternity is likely to gain from the recent deferral of the 2.3% Medical Device tax. The companies plan to hike R&D spending which will provide them a competitive edge in the long haul.Per an article by Emergo, the industry is projected to attain to $173 billion through 2019. and  are two close contenders in the Medical Instruments space.Notably, the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see Masimo has a  of A, while the same for STERIS is B. This instils investors' optimism in the stock. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, are profitable picks.Here, we make a detailed analysis of the companies' fundamentals to determine which is currently better positioned.With a market cap of $5.05 billion, Masimo develops, manufactures and markets a family of non-invasive monitoring systems.Based in Ohio, STERIS develops, manufactures andmarkets infection prevention as well assurgical support products and services.Masimo has a strong international presence. Recently, the California-based company's technologies were integrated by UAE Ministry of Health & Prevention (MOHAP) in nine hospitals. A raised guidance for 2018 also buoys optimism.STERIS' focus on inorganic expansion has been a positive. The company's acquisition of U.K.-based outsourced sterilization services provider - Synergy Health plc - is a significant move. In November 2017, the company sold the Synergy Health Healthcare Consumable Solutions (HCS) business to Vernacare.In the past year, STERIS' shares have gained 28.9%, significantly above Masimo's rise of 6.4%. The Medical Instruments  has declined 3.2% in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Masimo's current-year earnings per share is pegged at $2.89, reflecting a growth of 18% from the previous year. The same for STERIS is projected at $4.71, indicating a growth of 13.5%. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Masimo's current-year revenues is pegged at $843.8 million, showing growth of 5.7% from the previous year. STERIS is expected at $2.75 billion, reflecting growth of 5%. | Thus, Masimo has a competitive advantage over STERIS, considering current-year earnings and revenue estimates.Since 2009, Masimo's revenues totaled $798 million, at a CAGR of 10.9%. Since 2009, the company's earnings reached $2.82, at a CAGR of 15.5%.Over the same period, STERIS' sales amounted to $2.61 billion at a CAGR of 9.1%. The company's earnings have increased to $3.77 at a CAGR of 8.7%.Here too, Masimo beats STERIS.Our comparative analysis indicates that Masimo is positioned better than STERIS, considering current-year projections and fundamentals.A few other top-ranked stocks in theMedical Instruments space are Integer Holdings Corporation  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc  .Integer Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.6%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.79%.Let's take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.IDEXX is expected to continue with its gain momentum in the second quarter, courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics' revenues. In first quarter, this upside was driven by strong consistent gains from recurring CAG revenues, high premium CAG instrument placements and continued high growth in digital business. Management vouches for this trend to be further retained.We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing its commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. We expect second-quarter results to reflect an increase in productivity as new sales representatives establish fresh customer relationships. Also, we anticipate the company to report solid growth in the recurring software services associated with practice management platforms and improved digital system placements. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $499 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents a 13.4% improvement over the last reported quarter.Notably, IDEXX's 12-13.5% revenue growth projection for the quarter to be reported highlights its organic gains of 10.5-11.5%. Overall, the consensus estimate for the total quarterly revenues is pegged at $574.95 million. predicted to influence IDEXX's second-quarter results are:We pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business, lying on a growth trajectory of late, backed by encouraging test results in the United States as well as benefits drawn from the global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, the business witnessed 12% organic growth last quarter. Management also eyes gains from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe along with benefits from Brazil go-direct initiative. The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high-single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018. The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at $32.8 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter.IDEXX continues to expand its global footprint. It has been significantly earning advantages from the bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets. Further, management's consistent share buybacks underscores its robust free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will bear reflection on second-quarter conference call.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the company's heavy reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables as well as its rapid assay products. Moreover, IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development as well as expansion in the United States and internationally.Additionally, a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance. Thus, the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag, which in turn, might hurt second-quarter results.Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

This time, the recommendation bin is fuller than usual, because one Fool wants to send investors toward a sector rather than a single stock.So while Fischer is pitching cloud software company  (NASDAQ: APPF) and Bush suggests cybersecurity player  (NASDAQ: CBLK) , Moser is going with a healthcare basket: insurer  (NYSE: UNH) big dog, medical device maker  (NASDAQ: MASI) , pet-focused  (NASDAQ: IDXX) , and remote medicine leader  (NYSE: TDOC) .A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. All right, let's get to the stocks on our radar. Steve will hit you with a question. Jeff Fischer, what are you looking at this week? Speaking of cloud software, AppFolio, ticker APPF, is another semi-recent IPO. Market value of only $2.2 billion. Annualized sales of about $160 million, so it's a small company. But it's profitable, and it's been profitable for a long time. That's in its DNA, which I like a lot. AppFolio provides cloud-based software to their real estate market and the legal market. Two very large markets that it's growing into. Then, it plans to offer more markets beyond that. So, it has a good long-term outlook. Steve, question about AppFolio? When do you get to not call yourself a cloud-based company? You know, that's the funny thing. Almost every software company is going to be cloud-based in the end. So, when will we drop that moniker? Maybe pretty soon. Jason Moser, what are you looking at this week? Chris, you know I like baskets. I'm going a little bit of a different direction here and talking about the Healthcare and Wealthcare basket. It's four companies in the healthcare space: UnitedHealth Group, ticker UNH, big dog insurer; Masimo, ticker MASI, in pulse oximetry; Idexx Labs, IDXX, because hey, pets are people, too; and also Teladoc, you may have heard of it, Chris, ticker TDOC.This basket of stocks, in equal proportions, 25% each, since inception -- in San Francisco, I released that out February 9th -- it's beating the market 37.2% to 5.5%. I think it's a great way for investors to get exposure to the healthcare market without putting all of their eggs in one basket. Steve? Which one do you buy first? I think you have to go with Teladoc, man. They're making real waves in this virtual healthcare space. Aaron Bush, what are you looking at this week? I'm looking at Carbon Black, ticker CBLK. This is another recent IPO, an interesting cyber security company. The company has been around several years, but it's actually acquired its way into a competitive position in next-gen endpoint security, essentially, security around devices that connect to a network. They're also becoming a cloud company. They haven't always been. Revenue growth is around 35%, but their cloud growth is over 200% right now. As this becomes a larger percentage of revenue, it should accelerate the business. Steve, question about Carbon Black? Given that we tell people to wait on IPOs, how much longer should we be waiting? I think it just depends on the company. I don't think you always have to wait on IPOs. I think a lot of times, some great market-beating companies are great buys at the very beginning. Steve, do you have something you want to add to your watchlist? I think I'm going with Teladoc. Good man!

Far-reaching innovation like gene therapy, newer drug combinations, patient monitoring with the help of big data this year will shape up the medical fraternity of the United States.The Medical Device market has further gained momentum owing to the recent two-year suspension of the controversial 2.3% Medical Device tax. The 2.3% excise tax was implemented in 2013 as part of Obamacare on MedTech manufacturers, significantly restricting R&D activities.According to an article published in Xtalks, the Medical Device tax was responsible for a $34-million reduction in R&D spending along with a $188-million decline in overall sales.However, it is to be seen whether the tax will be fully eliminated or resumed after the two-year period.

Further, steady overall growth contributed to the top line.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (\"LPD\"); and Other.In the first quarter, CAG revenues rose 16.8% (up 13.1% organically) year over year to $470.8 million.

Let's get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man behind the glass, Steve Broido, is going to hit you with a question. Ron Gross, what are you looking at? Steve, do you like wheels? Yes, yes I do. I've got Titan International for you. Ticker symbol TWI. Small-cap manufacturer of large industrial wheels. I have talked about it quite a bit, as Steve will attest to. They have finally turned the cyclical corner. Sales are up 19% this quarter, fifth consecutive quarterly increase. $14 million profit vs. a $10 million loss, love to see that. EBITDA was up 144%. I mention that because 144 is another word for gross, and it just makes me happy. Shares up 13% this week on the news. Still plenty of room to run. It was even higher earlier in the year, until we started throwing around words like tariffs and trade wars. So, something to keep an eye on there, but I think the stock has some room. Steve, question about Titan International? I understand they're doing some interesting thing with shapes of wheels, some being oblong, some being -- Square? Did you see on  ?  had a square wheel that they were trying to hock on that thing. Can you confirm or deny that they're -- I deny, wholly and completely! Andy Cross, what are you looking at? Steve, do you like food? Because Middleby is what I'm looking at. Symbol MIDD. Maker of food service equipment for commercial and home kitchens. TurboChef and Viking are two of their big brands. They just announced an acquisition of JoeTap, the maker of nitro brew dispensers, for those of us who like cold coffee. That's a really fast-growing area. Questions I'm looking for is, the top line growth has really slowed, so, asking Selim Bassoul, who's a very well-respected CEO that we've been invested behind for many, many years, questions about their growth opportunities. Steve, question about Middleby? For Middleby to grow, do they need to continue to acquire? I know they acquired Viking at some point, five years ago or so. Is that how this company grows? They do, Steve, yeah. They have to continue to make those acquisitions. The Viking one has been a struggle for them. There's lots of questions about how they're going to continue to grow, especially in a market that, people aren't going out to restaurants like they used to. So, how is Middleby going to get that growth back? Jason? Well, Chris, I was thinking yesterday, as our new puppy took another dump on our floor -- [laughs] Woah! -- that's there's just not a whole heck of a lot that he can do to keep me angry with him for very long. It's like, for five seconds, and then I'm like, I can't be angry with him. No matter what he does. Idexx Laboratories reported earnings this week, another great quarter. Ticker is IDXX. This is part of my healthcare and wealthcare basket, for some of you out there who may know. Top line up 16%, almost all organic growth, and 17% growth in recurring revenue with its pet diagnostics business. And that's the really nice part about this business, its razor and blade model. And I'll tell you, the market is paying up for it, paying around 50X full-year estimates now. This is not a cheap stock, it's not one that I would probably go out and buy right now. But I think it's performing well for a reason. Steve? Are you walking this dog? I'm walking the dog all the time. I'll tell you, we have the invisible fence guy coming by next week, and we're going to put one of those little invisible fences on the inside stairs, so he can't get upstairs, at least we'll minimize the damage. You got a stock you want to add to your watchlist, Steve? I think I may go Middleby.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: The Motley Fool.

IDEXX's strong business momentum continued in Q1, reflected in another quarter of excellent financial results. We achieved 16% reported revenue growth driven by 13% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, 21% growth in premium instrument placements and favorable FX changes.Our reported revenue and 12% overall organic growth results reflect the implementation of the new revenue-accounting standard, which now more closely aligns instrument revenue recognition with the timing of the instrument placement. In Q1, $12 million of revenue was attributed to the implementation of the new revenue standard.A significant portion of this amount related to the introduction of a very successful multimodality customer program called IDEXX 360, which drove strong U.S. premium instrument placements in the quarter. EPS was $1.01 per share, an increase of 32% on a comparable constant-currency basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, solid operating-margin gains, and net benefits from U.S. tax reform.In terms of our outlook, we are maintaining our full-year revenue guidance of $2.205 billion to $2.245 billion, as $15 million of operational upsides reflected in our updated projection for 10.5% to 12.5% full-year organic revenue growth are offset by impacts from the strengthened U.S.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Idexx Laboratories wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!dollar.We're increasing our 2018 EPS outlook, $0.02 per share to $4.06 to $4.20 or 30% to 35% growth on a comparable constant-currency basis. This incorporates our higher revenue outlook and consistent expectations for 75 basis points to 125 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement, resulting in a $0.04 per share full-year operational upside. Our outlook also incorporates an additional $0.02 in projected benefits from stock compensation activity. These upsides are offset by a negative $0.04 per share impact from updated FX assumptions.We will review our updated 2018 outlook later in my comments.Let's begin with the review of our Q1 performance by segment and region. Please note that, as we review our results by segment, the organic growth rates referenced include benefits attributable to the new revenue standard. Q1 performance was led by continued momentum in our companion animal group. Global CAG revenues were $471 million, up 13% organically, driven by strong gains in recurring CAG revenues, high premium CAG instrument placements and continued high growth in our digital business.Global recurring CAG diagnostic revenues increased over 13% organically despite a 1% equivalent day headwind.These results included a $4 million, or about 1%, benefit from revenue accounting standard changes, primarily related to impacts from our modified retrospective restatement. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging system revenues increased 10% organically. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and 40% year-on-year increase in digital system placements.Our water business revenues grew 12% organically in the first quarter to $29 million, reflecting solid growth in the U.S. and strong gains in international markets, including about 3% in year-on-year growth benefit from our Brazil go-direct initiative.These benefits will moderate as we work through the year. Water growth in Q1 reflected about 2% growth benefit attributed to later ship-off cutting rules under the new revenue standard.Livestock, poultry, and dairy revenue in Q1 was $32 million, up 2% organically. Strong gains in pregnancy product sales, solid growth in recurring livestock diagnostic test revenues and higher herd health screening levels were offset by continued market demand impacts on our dairy testing business and moderate declines in European disease eradication program revenues.By region, U.S. revenues were $327 million in the quarter, up 13% organically, driven by 13% growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and strong growth in premium instrument placements.U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by continued strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables, and high-single-digit growth in rapid assay sales supported by solid volume gains in our 4Dx franchise.U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic price gains continued to trend in the 2% to 3% range. U.S.recurring CAG Diagnostic customer retention metrics also continued to improve supporting our accelerated growth profile. IDEXX U.S. recurring CAG growth performance continues to significantly outpace U.S. veterinary practice market growth reflected in our dataset from about 7,500 clinics.In Q1, patient visits were up 0.6% and clinic revenues increased 4.8% compared to the prior-year period, a slight moderation from recent trends impacted in part by less favorable weather comparisons.International revenues in Q1 were $210 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by 13% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. This reflected continued high consumable revenue gains supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base and increasing utilization and strong growth in European lab revenues.In terms of segment performance, Q1 results were supported by the expansion of our premium instrument base and strong global gains across CAG diagnostic testing modalities. Globally, we've placed a Q1 record 2,822 premium analyzers, up 21% compared to prior-year levels.These results were driven by 1,403 Catalyst placements, a 24% year-on-year increase, 664 SediVue placements, up 72%, and 755 premium hematology instruments globally. In addition to the strong premium instrument results, we placed 1,190 SNAP Pros in the quarter, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to over 20,000.Continued strong Catalyst performance was driven by 1,034 placements in international markets, up 39% year-on-year, and 288 placements in new and competitive accounts in North America. Consistent with our strategic focus, 78% of North American Catalyst placements were at new or competitive accounts in the quarter. Globally, our installed Catalyst instrument base increased 22% year-on-year in Q1, reflecting 10% year-on-year growth in North America, and 37% year-on-year gains in international markets.CAG diagnostic instrument revenues in Q1 were $31 million, up 12% organically, including $7 million in revenues attributed to the accounting standard change.As noted, this amount was primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 customer program in the U.S., which provides customers with benefits from doing business across IDEXX's product lines, and supported our success in driving SediVue and Catalyst placements in the quarter.Our EVI index increased at a double-digit pace in North America. And we're now using this approach in our international markets as well, aligning our placement strategy globally with maximizing recurring CAG Diagnostic annuity revenues. Benefits from expanding instrument base, test innovation, and enhanced commercial capability, continued to drive strong recurring CAD diagnostic revenue gains across our major modalities.Consumable revenues of $150 million grew 17% organically in Q1. Results reflected strong double-digit organic gains across U.S.and international markets. Our focus on innovation continues to drive growth in real-time care with SediVue and SDMA in a slide [ph] contributing nearly 3% combined to year-on-year consumable gains in the quarter.Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $187 million grew 14% organically in the first quarter. Gains were driven by continued mid-teen organic reference lab gains in the U.S. Strong U.S.gains continued to be primarily volume-driven, reflecting high levels of growth with existing customers and steadily improving new-customer acquisition and customer retention rates.We also achieved high single-digit lab growth in international markets, compared to strong prior-year growth levels, supported by higher gains in Europe. Rapid assay revenues of $52 million grew 7% organically in Q1. Continued solid rapid assay gains were driven by volume growth in 4Dx and first-generation products, supported by seasonal stocking programs, as well as continued net price gains.Operating profit in Q1 was $113 million, up 23% as reported, or 18% on a constant-currency basis, driven by high-profit growth in our CAG and water businesses. [Audio gap] of 100 basis points on a constant-currency basis, supported by solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage from our strong revenue growth results in the quarter.Gross profit was $303 million in Q1, up 17% as reported or 13% on a constant-currency basis. Gross margins increased 50 basis points on a constant-currency basis. These gains were supported by continued solid net price gains and volume leverage in our VetLab and reference lab businesses, which offset effects from reinvestment of U.S. tax reform benefits and about 20 basis points of gross margin impact from opex to cost of goods, cost reclassifications in our lab business.Foreign exchange hedge losses, which impact gross profit, were approximately $2 million in Q1.Operating expenses in Q1 were up 15%, or 11% on a constant-currency basis, resulting in 50 basis points of positive operating margin leverage. Operating expense increase has reflected year-on-year impacts from our expanded U.S. commercial capability, higher levels of R&D investment, growth in enabling information technology capability, and impacts from reinvestment of U.S. tax reform benefits.EPS in Q1 was $1.01 per share, including $9.6 million, or $0.11 per share, of benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which tends to be highest in Q1. On a comparable constant-currency basis, EPS increased 32% including net benefits from U.S. tax reform. Our effective tax rate was 14.3% in Q1, including 9.2% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation impacts.Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q1 2017 and 2018, increased operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.04 per share.Free cash flow was $11 million in Q1, reflecting normal quarterly seasonality. We continue to maintain a full-year outlook for free cash flow of 80% to 85% of net income for 2018, including approximately 15% of free cash flow impact driven by $50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine, headquarters expansion and our German core lab relocation, as well as $5 million of incremental growth capital investment supported by additional cash flows associated with U.S. tax reform. Incorporating these investments, our 2018 free cash flow outlook will project capital spending remains at $140 million.We allocated $86 million in capital to repurchase 465,000 shares in Q1.We'll also use our increased flexibility under U.S. tax reform to optimize our global cash and debt balances, resulting in a reduction in our revolving debt outstanding. We ended Q1 with $1.020 billion in debt, $159 million in cash, and $442 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.87 times gross and 1.58 times net of cash and investment balances.We're maintaining our 2018 full-year outlook for a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at approximately 1.5 times EBITDA.We continue to project annual net interest expense of $35 million to $36 million.In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2018, as noted, we're maintaining our full-year reported revenue guidance of $2.205 billion to $2.245 billion, incorporating $15 million of benefit from a 1% increase in our expectations for a full-year organic revenue growth now projected at 10.5% to 12.5%. This outlook reflects consistent expectations for 12% to 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and increased expectations for instrument revenues, including benefits from our strong Q1 performance and growing premium instrument placements.Operational revenue upsides are offset by a $15 million adjustment to our FX assumptions, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We currently estimate a 1.5% revenue growth benefit in 2018 related to foreign exchange at the rate shown in our press release, resulting in full-year reported revenue growth of 12% to 14%.We're raising our 2018 full-year EPS guidance $0.02 per share to $4.06 to $4.20, reflecting an outlook for 30% to 35% comparable constant currency EPS growth. This incorporates 4% in operational upsides related to our higher revenue outlook and consistent expectations for 75 basis points to 125 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement.We're also refining our outlook for 2018 effective tax rate to 19.5% to 20.5%, including an updated estimate of $12.5 million to $16.5 million, or approximately 3%, in full-year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation. This provides $0.02 per share on EPS upside compared to earlier estimates. Offsetting these benefits are updated projections for year-on-year impacts in foreign exchange rates at the rates shown in our press release.We now estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will increase reported EPS by $0.07 per share, approximately $0.04 per share below earlier estimates.This is net of approximately $5 million in currently projected hedge losses. There's been a significant amount of movement in currency rates in recent days related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and our outlook incorporates recent FX rate levels. In our 10-Q, we highlight sensitivities to change in currency rates.Based on our projections an additional 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce the balance of year revenue by approximately $6 million and operating income by approximately $1.7 million net of hedges.In terms of our second-quarter outlook, we expect reported revenue growth in the 12% to 13.5% range supported by organic revenue gains of 10.5% to 11.5%. In terms of our P&L outlook, we expect gross margins to be relatively flat in Q2 compared to prior-year levels, reflecting relatively tougher year-on-year comparisons in the quarter, as well as impacts from tax reform-related reinvestment and lab information system cost reclassifications. We also expect relatively higher year-on-year growth in operating expenses in part driven by the timing of R&D investments.Combined, we expect these factors will lead to flat Q2 2018 operating margins compared with prior-year Q2 levels of 24%. We expect our effective tax rate in Q2 to be 21% to 22% including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity. That concludes the financial review. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments. -- OK. Thank you, Brian. Our strategy to an advanced standard of care for pets around the world is purring along nicely as we wrap up the first quarter of the new year. Great results shared by Brian.Sales force and professional productivity in growing the business with our customers was the standout theme for the quarter. And this is evidenced by our companion animal group diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 13% globally.As investors know, we have moved to an economic value index, or EVI, to measure quarterly instrument placements both for our reps commissions and for IDEXX. EVI measures the quarterly impact of the value of instrument placements in building profitable recurring revenues. Prioritizing efforts by EVI of placements and powers our field professionals to allocate their time and efforts to a mix of placements and programs that maximize long-term shareholder value.In Q1, we moved to this EVI compensation and measurement system with our international operations, building on the success of the North American field transition to EVI at the beginning of 2017.As Brian mentioned, the EVI of our North American placements grew double-digits in Q1 of 2018 supported by exceptional growth of SediVue. For the rest of the world, the year-over-year growth in EVI from instrument placements was far stronger supported by both strong unit placement and a greater percentage of Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts. Of note, new and competitive placements of Catalyst outside of North America was up 56% year over year in Q1. We also continue to align our commercial efforts across our modalities to support customer growth and advancements in the standards of care.In Q1, our German team successfully transitioned our commercial organization from two different roles focused separately on instruments and labs respectively to a single account coverage model that we have used in the U.S. for the past several years. In this model, a single sales force supports and advances the full IDEXX offering of in-house instrument and reference lab diagnostic offerings. Our German team executed this transition brilliantly.Along with being fully direct in Germany as we are in most markets around the world, we're now set up for accelerated growth in this very important country just as we have achieved in the U.S. since we made the change to a customer-centric sales model. Innovation continues to be a key driver globally. Expanded menu on our instrument platforms,\u00a0including T4, SDMA, and CRP, an inflammatory market, grow the same customer instrument recurring revenue and contributed to our 17% organic instrument consumable revenue recurring growth as well as growth.Another contributor, of course, was growth from SediVue recurring revenues that came from new instrument placements. New menu adoption by our Catalyst customers will continue to be a growth driver for years to come and of course increase the value of new Catalyst placement.Our remarkable test for kidney function, IDEXX SDMA, had its first quarter of general availability in our in-house Catalyst chemistry platform in North America in Q1. In this short period, 42% of North American Catalyst customers have adopted the test in the clinic, with the vast majority of these already using it on a regular basis.Having our proprietary SDMA test on our in-house instrument advances several strategic growth objectives for IDEXX. Obviously, Catalyst SDMA generates a new stream of instrument consumable recurring revenues.Second, it further secures the long-term loyalty of Catalyst customers as the test is unique to IDEXX. Third, as customers add SDMA to their in-house profiles, they build upon their reference lab experience with IDEXX accelerating to what we term the journey to believe that SDMA is an essential element of the routine chemistry panel.The independent KOLs at the pinnacle of veterinary medicine have already completed this journey as they have been involved with and informed of the full complement of studies, which provide the irrefutable evidence of SDMA's clinical value as an early indicator of a variety of diseases that have in common that impact kidney function. To put a point on this, in one study, looking at the blood profiles of dogs and cats having a wellness exam adding SDMA to the existing chemistry panel of 21 tests, just one additional test, uncovered another 50% of patients versus the baseline of 21 tests that needed further work-up.In other words, even in seemingly healthy patients, SDMA dramatically increases the detection of hidden problems. The statistics show just how important and profound SDMA is as a diagnostic innovation in routine wellness and in fact the importance of routine wellness testing not to mention sick animal testing.Catalyst SDMA was launched in Canada in January and the UK in March.The other major international countries will follow in Q2 with a few in Q3. The addition of the SDMA T4 combo kit for Catalyst, another advancement in point of care testing will launch in about a month in North America.Speaking of new products and update on our SNAP Fecal launch timing. The assay is performing well and detecting intestinal parasite and our expected regulatory approval timeline is on schedule. The product prototypes are currently in field trials with customers, part of our disciplined new product development process that we use with all products and development.And as is typical of any product, we get many new insights into newer market products in the hands of technicians and practice before the formal launch.We've concluded there are certain workflow improvements that need to be made to deliver the exceptional customer experience expected from IDEXX. We anticipate these changes to be relatively straightforward but will take a few extra months to validate. Given this pushes the launch into the very busy Q4, we're planning our formal launch at the beginning of the New Year.Our new revenue guidance, which we've increased on a constant-currency basis by $15 million for the year, fully reflects this new SNAP Fecal timing assumption. The guidance reflects tremendous momentum we have in the business today.I might note that with all the innovations that we have in the field and that we're bringing to the market in 2018, our field has no shortage of new products and services to sell, be it in reference labs, in-house instruments, and new test menu.I also want to comment on our veterinary software offerings with double-digit constant currency growth in Q1. In Q1, we had more than 1,600 customers who use our cloud-based practice information management software or PIMS. And we continue to grow our overall PIMS software customers and revenues, which include the franchise, Cornerstone, and DVMAX product lines. All four of our PIMS software platforms are undergoing major investments leading to advanced capabilities for our customers, improved user experience and the support of multi-location corporate accounts, a growing segment of the market.Our cloud-based applications that customers subscribe to, in order to add value to their PIMS whether IDEXX PIMS or third-party, are also advancing in customer numbers and capabilities.These apps include cloud-based software to support wellness plans, digital radiography packs, client communications, multi-practice enterprise management, and a specialty referral CRM for managing relationships with specialty referral clients to referring veterinarians.The granddaddy of all veterinary software applications in terms of footprint and the global market is VetConnect PLUS. With over 22,000 practices who use VetConnect PLUS each month, 12,500 of which are in the U.S. We broke 2 million results views in the U.S. alone in Q1, 2.9 million globally.That 2 million is an average of 160 results views for every active VetConnect PLUS IDEXX account in the U.S. market.We estimate that no other veterinary software in the world has even half the number of active accounts on a global basis. And IDEXX diagnostic customers that are highly engaged with VetConnect PLUS grow their diagnostic revenues at a rate three times faster than non-engaged VetConnect PLUS customers, which is why we're pleased that the adoption and utilization of VetConnect PLUS grew more than twice the rate of our underlying diagnostic volumes in Q1.Between our PIMS, our apps and the VetConnect PLUS franchise, we are uniquely positioned in veterinary software globally. And our guidance contemplates, as Brian mentioned, with the R&D accelerated investments in these platforms in 2018.Our software strategy confirms several strategic advantages for IDEXX.We can help our customers grow faster, grow profitably, while supporting staff engagement and productivity, so important to practices in the current labor environment. We accelerate IDEXX diagnostics usage and loyalty and grow the profitable recurring revenues of both diagnostics and our veterinary software and services, and digital radiography businesses.In conclusion, the key elements of our strategy are clicking innovation and commercial execution which drives adoption of these innovations, and a software strategy that builds upon our diagnostic offering to accelerate customer growth and loyalty. All of us at IDEXX remain dedicated to our purpose to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees, and shareholders by enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock.So with that, Cindy, we'll open up the call to Q&A.Thank you. And we will go to the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Thanks so much. Can you speak to the nature of the Fecal SNAP timing change? Just what are you seeing in the initial field testing? And should we think of a bigger ramp in Fecal SNAP in 2019? I guess how much was truly embedded in 2018 assumptions originally? And also maybe the competitive landscape, are you seeing anyone in the wings as far as the Fecal SNAP test goes? Thanks. -- Yeah, great. As we mentioned, this really has no impact on our 2018 guidance. Our field team has a tremendous number of offerings to sell. Catalyst now with SDMA and the SDMA T4 combo kit, SediVue which just tremendous runway ahead of us, what a great product, hematology, we're still highly differentiated in hematology, the reference labs, both growing utilization and winning new customers.Our preventative care is a big growth driver, an organic growth driver for us and the industry's SNAP Pro placements.You saw the digital radiography, the software, the VetConnect PLUS with major advancement. So really, we see the small amount of revenues that we had in our original plan is really being supplanted by growth in all these other areas, and really gives us confidence for the year.In fact, Q1 is the most logical time to launch a new point of care SNAP assay at the beginning of the year with a lot of focus on new products. We're going into the season for testing most intestinal parasites around people's minds in the summer when dogs are the dog parks. And we do not expect or see anything on the competitive front.This was quite frankly the assay, which is performing very well. It took us 10 years to find that and develop the reagents for the three key worms, which we offer by the way in the reference lab. We have a fecal antigen, one of the big drivers of reference lab growth. And that's all a proprietary reagent.So, we think this will be a proprietary product for a long time certainly if you look at the length of our patents. -- And Erin, it will obviously provide a nice uplift for our growth in terms of being all incremental compared to this year. I think you had a question on competitive to this, this is not related to anything going on competitively. -- OK. Great. And then I think your competitive placements overall for instruments were pretty strong. I guess what was some of the key drivers of that? I mean any sort of promotional activity or just better traction and better sales force maturity there? Anything you could, I guess, elaborate on would be great? Thanks. -- I think we're continuing to innovate in how we advance the customer's journey to belief in the importance of our innovative diagnostics and the care of the pet. I would put it mostly on sales force productivity and not just sales force but of course the supporting marketing. We have the importance of our other professionals in the field whether they are the professional service veterinarians and the field support reps. Our international had a tremendous growth.I think that was the adoption of EVI for international, obviously, the U.S. is getting stronger and stronger in understanding how EVI can drive profitable growth.And yeah, we still are discovering innovations to advance the customer's journey to believe in all areas, whether they are the importance of a fresh urinalysis to preventative care. It's amazing the amount of hidden disease. We've done a study for wellness really well, absolutely nothing wrong, by the way, nothing wrong to the pet owner, nothing wrong to the veterinarian upon the exam, and yet one in eight dogs and cats in the adult age, one in six in senior and two in five in the geriatric category have evidence of underlying disease when you run the basic chemistry, hematology, and SDMA.I mean these are extraordinary numbers. And we're bringing these numbers to the field. I mean, they are both the importance of testing and of course the addition of our unique proprietary assays such as SDMA and our advancements in the hematology area, which remain unique.And so this is a huge opportunity for growth. It's shocking that only 14% of clinical visits in our customer base, which is probably more advanced than the customer base generally, include a basic chemistry panel whether sick animal or well, and roughly half the visits are wellness.So, there is a tremendous opportunity for growth ahead of us in the diagnostic category, and of course, that's going to relate to overall practice growth because when they find things, then they need to address them. -- Great. Thank you so much.Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. -- Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, I was hoping you could provide a bit more detail or color around IDEXX 360 in regards to when that was launched and what it encompasses? And I'm curious if that's primarily targeted at new customers or new placements or if that's more broadly positioned across the entire customer base? -- Well, thank you again for the question, Ryan. It's really an interesting question. It's certainly not a boring question. It's been very successful to us, the launch of the IDEXX 360 program in the first quarter of 2018, in North America.We call it 360 because it's all-encompassing or complete. And really what it is, is it's a friendly way for customers to adopt more of our portfolio and also adopt more of our menu in our instruments. And so, the reason why it's called 360, it's all an encompassing or complete diagnostic offering and really leverages the fact that we have a complete portfolio of in-house and very full in-house with the urinalysis and the rapid assay and the reference lab to grow the business.And a second reason is it gives a 360-degree view on the patient's health. Because you can combine both what you might run on an in-house test with what you might reflex or run on the reference lab and have all that available to you in VetConnect PLUS with advanced testing options that are unique to IDEXX.So it is a program which leverages the fact that we're in all the modalities and makes it easier for customers to adopt, whether it's new systems or come over to our reference lab growing same-store sales, winning new customers on a modality basis, and as you can see, it's been very successful, which is interesting because any new programs sometimes take the field a little while to learn and they picked this one up relatively quickly in the first quarter with great success. -- Great. That's helpful color. And then as my follow-up, one on the sales force more specific to the international operations. You discussed Germany, in particular, is moving to kind of a single sales team like the United States.And I know internationally the EBI launched. How broad if you look at your non-U.S. business now, have you kind of move that toward the U.S. sales model with the combined team in EBI? And how far along or what inning do you see that in because I know that could be a big uplift for international growth longer term? Thank you. -- Yeah. It turns out people love their pets all over the world and the opportunity for us is in basically every market depending on its size. And so we're about 99% of our companion animal group revenues are sold direct which gives us full opportunity to work with the customers to grow utilization. And as you know utilization and just diagnostic protocols outside of the U.S.are behind where the U.S. is.EBI, although not 100%, it's essentially adopted in all of our direct markets. There are a couple of remaining small markets that are still in process. And for the most of the markets, we do have a customer-centric veterinary diagnostic consultant model.Germany is a very important country for us. Because there is a tremendous in-house opportunity for us and, of course, we have very strong lab presence that we're augmenting with building out an expansion and a new core lab in Germany which, of course, will be a network for a variety of European countries as well as Germany.And so each country has its kind of unique aspects in terms of our sales model but we're very pleased. It's not easy to translate. As you all told us when we did this several years ago in the U.S.market, it is not easy to move sales roles. And I'm just very proud of our German team for doing it and showing that it can be done. I think we leveraged a lot of learnings from the U.S. in doing that in Canada.We're pretty much a common model in Australia. So as you can see here, it's becoming more and more but it's a step-by-step process. We're not fully adopted yet. -- OK, great. Thank you so much.Thank you. [Operator instructions] We will go to the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I had a couple questions on some of the moving pieces for the quarter.You had, by our notes, one fewer selling day, and you also talked about the weather impact in the U.S. in the Northeast in March [Inaudible] others. And then there is also Easter timing in Europe. So I was just wondering if you could sort of parse out the headwinds from those issues? I mean you still put up a good print despite that but I'm trying to get a sense of sort of the underlying performance if you normalize for these one-off effects? -- Yeah. It was basically 1% headwind on recurring revenues, which we noted. The weather is a hard thing to parse. I think it didn't impact our business.We had a great quarter. I think in the market overall it likely had somewhat of a headwind but it's just a little tougher to estimate but I think the one -- -- It was a normal winter and last year was a mild winter. -- Yeah. -- OK. -- And so it just reinforces we had great performance, very strong performance. I'd point out in markets like Europe, we had up against a tough compare in the lab business, we had a really nice quarter there as well. So very pleased with how we started the year particularly in the context of some of that. -- Got it. That helps. And then to clarify one other point. The accounting change, the revenue recognition, ASU 2014-09.On the 4Q call when you raised the guide for the year by 50 bps, you called out that that was due to that accounting change. And then in this quarter you recognized, you called out an incremental $12 million. That looks like it's right about the 50 bps for the year. So is it right that you're not expecting any more incremental revenue for the rest of the year from the accounting change? -- Yeah, why don't you take -- -- Those are two different things. So obviously what we talked about in the Q1, much of that was anticipated in Q4, right? So it wasn't incremental for the Q4. And this now aligns with instrument revenues. -- Yeah. Why don't I just take a minute to give you a little background on the accounting impacts because it takes a minute to kind of digest and understand but, look, as context, we raised our outlook for 2018 by $15 million and that reflected the Q1 performance that Jon talked about as well as our updated projections for placements and program [Inaudible] which are all aligned with this new revenue recognition standard. And I think it's important to understand that under the new standard, the instrument revenues are now going more closely track placements. So if you think across the different programs that we have, revenues under volume commitment programs and rebate programs and outcome programs are all basically in that aligned now with revenue recognition, the time, and the placement.When you look at the accounting, what's attributed to the accounting impact, calculations of what's attributed can be impacted by changes in program mix which are independent of how many you place? So, for example, under this new accounting guidance, 100% of the revenue from a new program like IDEXX 360 is treated as being related to the implementation of the new revenue standard.And the reason why is that under previous GAAP, this is basically a volume commitment program. Those revenues would have been deferred.So basically what you have is program mix shifts, which don't impact our view on placements, which drive revenue are attributed to the accounting standards. You just can't take that first-quarter effect and multiply it by four. What we did is we're updating our placement view.We took up the full-year numbers based on the strong start. It's all aligned with the new standard that has upfront revenue recognition. And as we work through the year, we'll do the reporting to go what's attributed to new standard but I wouldn't focus on that metric as for how to get at our revenue outlook if you will. -- OK. Got it. I really appreciate that, Brian. If I could squeeze in one quick one.You talked about pricing gains for the year on CAG. Specifically in the rapid assay, the 6.7% organic, strong volume in 4Dx but can you talk about pricing on that, specifically for rapid assays and then for the 4Dx, was there anything going on in the quarter? -- Our pricing was up. I mentioned that. -- Yeah. -- We had kind of the seasonal stocking programs we typically do. And that increase was net of those sets of programs. And our outlook for the year is we're trending in that 2% to 3% range and that's consistent across the modality. So we're continuing to get solid net price gains but more of our growth is being driven by volume growth, and we've got excellent momentum on that front. -- Got it, great. Thanks so much, guys. -- Thank you, Mike.Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe 2.5 questions, just one small clarification.So the first one, just 1Q 2018 market growth was a little lighter, market growth that is, was a little lighter per your metrics, actually in line with some of our checks as well. So anything that you can share for April, Jon, or just at a higher level I guess what I'm asking is do you think this was all weather specific, and that the overall industry trends remain solid? That's the first question. -- I'd say, in summary, I think the overall industry trends remain quite solid. Q1 can be a little bit bumpy. -- Yes. -- But we see overall trends are quite solid. There is no reason to believe that they are not. And I would have mentioned that the revenue growth at the practice level was really not that different than what it has been historically at that 4.8%. -- Got it. OK. And then just certainly impressive to increase the guide, especially considering the new timing on SNAP Fecal antigen. And I should have always thought about IDEXX, you're the innovator maybe at least one new product per year.And so should we now think that SNAP Fecal antigen is that product for 2019? Or I guess any other tricks in the bag that you can allude to? And then I'll just have my final clarification question. -- Yeah. I mean the product we're really pleased about right now is the Catalyst SDMA. This is an enormous product. It's interesting.You saw the 42% adoption rate in a very short period of time in the U.S. market, which really just shows the underlying demand for an estimate that we've built from the reference lab. Now some of those customers don't even use our reference lab. And so maybe they will use our reference lab now that they see the value of SDMA.And then we [Inaudible] completely differentiated hematology offering. Obviously, SediVue is going great guns.And so when you launch a product, you've got like several years, many years of growth ahead of you. Clearly SNAP Fecal will be a big focus of launch in Q1 2019. I'm not ready to talk about any other products at this point in time but you should expect, of course, continuous improvement in our existing products. So we just launched, for example, the new image algorithm for SediVue, Neural Network 3.0.And we expect to have a cadence of annual algorithm improvements that comes from the fact that at this point we have over 1 million patients that have been run on SediVue, and we use that with machine learning to advance the algorithm. Of course, it's unique to our smart service, the fact that all those images come back every day. And so the products will continue to have incremental advancements but we have good product launch now scheduled for the beginning of 2019 with the SNAP Fecal. -- OK, perfect. And a clarification, and Brian I think this is for you and hopefully, I don't butcher this too bad but you put up organic growth in CAG of 13.1%. The accounting change, if I remember correctly last quarter, was a 50 bp tailwind for 2018. Was that sort of going to come on board ratably throughout 2018? Or maybe asked differently, normalized for that accounting change, were you essentially at 12.5% for this quarter? Hopefully, that makes some sense.Thanks, guys. -- Yeah. I'm going to go back to kind of the earlier responses that I gave, which is I think when you're trying to take what's attributed to the accounting change and adjust growth rates, I don't think will help you understand the trends in the business. And that the way the accounting disclosure work is, you attribute benefit to the accounting change for a new program like IDEXX 360 as if it's 100% related to an accounting change. And obviously, this is a successful new program.It's just a mix change.So what I'd say is the underlying growth we were above where we thought we were going to be because we had really good instrument placements. And as we look at the updated full-year outlook, we've flowed that through, and we took it up more based on the momentum that we see and our estimates of what the program mix will be. And basically under all the programs, Jon, now the instrument placements, the revenue is much more aligned with when you place the instruments. So we feel comfortable with that.And we'll try to help you understand the growth rate impacts, etc., but I think the underlying momentum of the business is very strong and sustainable under the new recognition standards. -- OK, perfect. Thanks for your time, guys. -- Thanks.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions and congrats on a great quarter. My first question is really on the news of Henry Schein's decision to spin out its animal health business and merge with your neighbor, Vets First Choice. Vets First Choice seems to be making some inroads by engaging pet owners.And so I guess I'm wondering if you can comment on the strategy of working directly with the pet owners, does that potentially have any overlap with any of the initiatives you have in your software initiative? -- Well, first of all, we would like to congratulate Henry Schein and Vets First Choice on their merger. As you know, we've moved away from distribution a number of years ago and we have a fully direct model which has been very, very successful for us. I would say that anything that engages pet owners, and in this case, I think it's more compliance with Vets First Choice, it's more compliance on therapeutics and preventatives and that kind of thing but anything which grows the profession is good for the profession and is good for IDEXX. And so we see this as if this is pulled off and good, it's going to be a positive for us and a positive for practices as we firmly believe that if practices can better serve pet owners, the underlying demand for pet care is underserved but dramatically underserved.And anything we can do or others can do to help practices, better engage with pet owners is a good thing. So, yeah, so that's our point of view. -- Great. And then I know that Neo is a product that you guys launched a couple of years ago. Can you just give us an update on how the traction of that platform is going? Are you perhaps contemplating your software strategy in the context of what Vets First Choice is doing in the market? -- We're very pleased with the progress, Neo which is cloud-based. We're also pleased with Animana and between the two of them, we have 1,600 customers who use our cloud-based practice-management software. And of course, we also have a variety of apps which integrate with ours and other third-party software that add value for the customer. And so this is I think an exciting area, it's a dynamic area.We made some accelerating investments in 2017 and more in 2018. And we really have an unparalleled U.S. and global footprint when you add up our PIMS or apps or VetConnect PLUS presence, all of which are back to that prior point of helping customers run their practices better, more efficiently and engage with pet owners better and thus advancing the growth of the professionals. So we really think we have a sort of unparalleled offering and it's very important for us.And we'll continue to be growing it as part of our diagnostics and software strategy. -- Great. And if I can, one last quick one. I think at VMX you indicated that your total T4 slide hit about 60% orders in its first year of launch. You are well on your way on SDMA and a slide at 42%.Do you have confidence that you can meet or exceed the T4 launch with SDMA? -- I'm going to tell you, 42% within months of launch is an amazing, amazing accomplishment. And nothing happens fast in vet and the adoption rates are typically very slow. And in that context, the adoption of SDMA and the slide has been exceptional. And so we're very, very pleased with the success we've had.We've really been fully in the market in the U.S in January. We took some preorders in the fourth quarter but we're really just ramping up for the last four months. So I think that's a great number. And the nice thing about SDMA and the slide, as I mentioned, it actually increases the economic value of a placement of a Catalyst because it's a parameter that customers purchase.And thus the consumable stream from a Catalyst placement goes up just like with T4.And then as I mentioned we are going to have the SDMA T4 combo kit, which I think is another kind of subtle but it's going to be very appreciated by our customers because then they can just drop both those in together and with a chem panel and with older dogs and cats you really want to add T4 and of course you also have a very strong case there to add SDMA to that for in-house testing. So we're very pleased with that strategy. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here. Just a quick one from me. As we think of SediVue, kind of the placement trajectory there.Can you give us a little bit of color on what percentage of those are going to new customers versus back into the base and then on top of that, sort of what the attachment rate is relative to a new Catalyst placement there? And then lastly, if you can give us a little bit of an update if there are any changes to the pull through you have been seeing per day there that will be great? Thanks. -- Yeah, I would say that there's not a material change to your last question in the pull-through. You would think that with exceptional value that your analysis adds to clinical insight, you would think and yet that's really to my prior point, things don't change that fast. And so where I think we've said 3,000, 4,500 in consumables per placement of SediVue.And to your earlier, it's really all of the above. We're selling into our installed base.We're selling to customers when they buy the full suite. We're selling to customers who don't buy the full suite but maybe they're going to buy the full suite later. It's now very mature, very sophisticated instrument with huge differentiators. Of course, we've got the pay-per-run, which customers love because they don't have to buy consumable inventory in advance.We just had a very, very successful second year Free UA Day, which we can do because it's pay-per-run. We had one customer run 100 urinalyses in one day. That's a lot of urine. And that was a lot of clinical insight.And what we're finding is just like when you run a chemistry panel, there is a tremendous amount of clinical insight that you wouldn't always expect. When you run that urine, you find a lot of hidden diseases and you're getting a better differential.So I think you're going to find that in time a practice will feel incomplete without in-house urine sediment analyzer, just as they do today in large part with chemistry, hematology, radiography. This is a core component to be able to reach the basic standard of care in veterinary medicine in the U.S. and then, of course, we have the whole international, which we really haven't even gotten started on yet because we're having so much success with placing Catalysts as you saw from the numbers but following on Catalyst over the next decade we'll have a second wave with a very sophisticated urine sediment analyzer in the form of SediVue. -- Great. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.Thank you. And with that gentleman, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. -- Yeah, thank you. We're just very pleased with our organic growth of 12% driven in large part by the CAG diagnostics recurring revenue of 13%. That component of our revenue, that CAG diagnostics recurring revenue constitutes 76% of the company's total revenue. It's a real driver, although the other parts of the company are well too.I want to certainly congratulate our water business. It had an exceptional 12% quarter but it is a high-single-digit organic grower with mid-40s operating margins and very little invested capital. It's really an exceptional business and our team is doing a great job there. They did a great job with the go-directs in Brazil.And then, comparable constant currency EPS growth of 32% was driven by strong fundamentals of our revenue growth and margin expansion and further aided by the net benefits of tax reform.So I just want to congratulate the IDEXX teams around the world for their successes in Q1 and the momentum we have in the business. I think everybody is very, very excited about what we can bring back to veterinary medicine. People love their pets; millennials love their pets even more, and we can help veterinarians take care of those pets, live long, healthy lives.With that, we'll conclude the call.

This is because depending solely on retained earnings for business growth is next to impossible.It is worth noting that among equity and debt - the two most common options used to boost a company's future earnings - debt is the more popular one. This is perhaps due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing. Moreover, interest on debt is tax deductible, which makes it an attractive option.However, debt financing has its own drawbacks. The problem arises when leverage, referred to as the amount of debt a company bears, becomes exorbitant. In particular, companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario.Of course, this does not mean that debt financing, which is an inherent instrument for corporations to grow their earnings, should be a taboo in corporate financing.Nevertheless, given the current macroeconomic scenario in the United States, in favor of interest rate hikes, the market seems to be not so suitable for borrowers. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee began lifting rates from near zero in December 2015.Therefore, to be on the safe side, investors should try to avoid stocks that bear large debt loads. Empirically, several leverage ratios have been constructed to measure the exact amount of debt risk a company faces in order to safeguard investors from debt traps.Debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, which has been used to evaluate a company's credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders' EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company.With the first-quarter reporting cycle in full swing right now, investors must be targeting stocks that are exhibiting solid earnings growth. But if the stocks bear a high debt-to-equity ratio, in times of economic downturns, their so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.Considering this, it will be wise for investors to select companies with low leverage. These are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

This is because depending solely on retained earnings for business growth is next to impossible.It is worth noting that among equity and debt - the two most common options used to boost a company's future earnings - debt is the more popular one. This is perhaps due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing. Moreover, interest on debt is tax deductible, which makes it an attractive option.However, debt financing has its own drawbacks. The problem arises when leverage, referred to as the amount of debt a company bears, becomes exorbitant. In particular, companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario.Of course, this does not mean that debt financing, which is an inherent instrument for corporations to grow their earnings, should be a taboo in corporate financing.Nevertheless, given the current macroeconomic scenario in the United States, in favor of interest rate hikes, the market seems to be not so suitable for borrowers. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee began lifting rates from near zero in December 2015.Therefore, to be on the safe side, investors should try to avoid stocks that bear large debt loads. Empirically, several leverage ratios have been constructed to measure the exact amount of debt risk a company faces in order to safeguard investors from debt traps.Debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, which has been used to evaluate a company's credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders' EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company.With the first-quarter reporting cycle in full swing right now, investors must be targeting stocks that are exhibiting solid earnings growth. But if the stocks bear a high debt-to-equity ratio, in times of economic downturns, their so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.Considering this, it will be wise for investors to select companies with low leverage. These are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy.Considering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers. The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above. A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.48%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.3%.Let's take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.IDEXX is expected to continue with its gain momentum in the first quarter, courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics' revenues. Last time, this upside was driven by consistent strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables plus owing to a high-single-digit increase registered in rapid assay sales. Management vouches for this trend to be retained further. | We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing its commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. We expect first-quarter results to reflect a rise in productivity as new sales representatives establish fresh customer relationships. Also, we anticipate the company to report exceptional customer retention rates for reference labs as well as instrument consumables in the United States and worldwide.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $460 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents a 5.9% improvement from the last-reported quarter.Notably, IDEXX's 13-14.5% revenue growth projection for the quarter to be reported highlights its organic gains of 9.5-10.5%. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total quarterly revenues is pegged at $525 million.. predicted to influence IDEXX's first-quarter results are:We pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business, lying on a growth trajectory of late, backed by encouraging test results in the United States as well as benefits drawn from the global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, the business witnessed 16% organic growth last quarter. Management also eyes gains from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe. The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high-single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018. The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at $28.3 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter.IDEXX carries on to expand its global footprint. It has been significantly drawing advantages from the bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets. Further, management's consistent share buybacks underscores its robust free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will bear reflection on first-quarter conference call.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the company's heavy reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables as well as its rapid assay products. Moreover, IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development and expansion in the United States plus internationally.Additionally, a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance. Thus, the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag on first-quarter results.Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's Earnings ESP of -0.90% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Here are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:Baxter International Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.86% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings  has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Stryker Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and is a #2 Ranked player. You can see Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is pegged at 93 cents.Per the company, the upside in reported EPS was driven by revenue growth, solid operating margin gains and impressive benefits from the U.S. tax reform.Revenues rose 16.4% year over year (up 12.3% on organic basis) to $537.7 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $526.2 million by 2.2%.The upside was driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (\"CAG\") Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable and reference lab as well as strong acceptance of rapid assays and veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems. Further, steady overall growth contributed to the top line. | IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (\"LPD\"); and Other.In the first quarter, CAG revenues rose 16.8% (up 13.1% organically) year over year to $470.8 million. Water segment's revenues were up 16.2% from the prior-year quarter (up 11.8% organically) to $29.1 million. LPD revenues grew 10% (up 2% organically) to $32.2 million. Revenues at the Other segment rose 23.6% (up 22.3% organically) to $5.4 million.Gross profit increased 17.4% to $303.1 million in the reported quarter. Further, gross margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 56.4% despite a 15.1% rise in cost of revenues to $234.6 million.Sales and marketing expenses rose 14.8% to $100.1 million, while general and administrative expenses increased 15.1% to $60.9 million. Research and development expenses rose 12.4% to $29 million. Operating margin in the quarter improved 100 bps to 21%.IDEXX exited the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $159.2 million, compared with $187.7 million at the end of 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities in the reported quarter was $34.9 million, compared with $31.3 million in the year-ago quarter.IDEXX has reaffirmed the 2018 revenue outlook at $2,205-$2,245 million. The company has updated the 2018 revenue organic growth guidance to 10.5-12.5% from the previous 9.5-11.5%. However, IDEXX continues to expect revenue growth of 12-14% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $2.22 billion, within the guided range.Management also raised the EPS guidance to $4.06-$4.20 from the earlier $4.04-$4.18, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 38-43% on a reported basis compared with 37-42% stated previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 adjusted EPS is pegged at $4.11.IDEXX exited the first quarter on a solid note. Moreover, solid year-over year growth in organic revenues and a raised EPS guidance for 2018 are encouraging.The stellar performance was driven by strong sales at the CAG business. The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth. Management's innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. Moreover, the strong top-line growth in the quarter was driven by considerable contributions from the rest of the business segments.IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical  , Chemed Corp.  and Baxter International Inc.  . While Intuitive Surgical sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Chemed and Baxter carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Intuitive Surgical reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted EPS of $2.44, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.6%. Revenues totaled $848 million, also surpassing the consensus estimate by 10.6%.Chemed posted first-quarter 2018 adjusted EPS of $2.72, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.37.

LeMaitre Vascular has gained 25.8% since the start of the year compared to the -2.2% move for the Medical sector and the 3.8% year-to-date return for its peer group.The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 21, 2018, LeMaitre Vascular reported EPS of $0.21 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.5%.For the current fiscal year, LeMaitre Vascular is expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share on $111.06 million in revenues. This represents a 13.95% change in EPS on a 10.1% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.12 per share on $122.35 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.96% and 10.17%, respectively.LeMaitre Vascular may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for LMAT? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.LeMaitre Vascular has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 41X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 36.4X versus its peer group's average of 19.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.73. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. | We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, LeMaitre Vascular currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if LeMaitre Vascular fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though LMAT shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Shares of LeMaitre Vascular have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Stryker Corporation  , ICU Medical  , and IDEXX Laboratories  , all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for LeMaitre Vascular. Still, the fundamentals for LMAT are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Fortunately, IDEXX Laboratories currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if IDEXX Laboratories passes the test. Thus, it seems as though IDXX shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.Shares of IDEXX Laboratories have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including iRadimed  , Integer Holdings  , and Varian Medical Systems  , all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for IDEXX Laboratories. Still, the fundamentals for IDXX are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Maybe the market can start focusing on events that are directly related to investors and our thriving economy, rather than convulsing over presidential tweets or whatever the daily headline might bring.It's very early, but the start of this season suggests that the quarter won't disappoint the lofty expectations of analysts. On Monday, Bank of America reported better than expected results, which goes nicely with last week's strong numbers from other financials like J.P Morgan Chase and Citigroup.And after the bell today, Netflix announced that it added significantly more subscribers than expected in its quarter. As of this writing, shares of the streaming giant are up more than 5.5% after hours.The major indices started the week on a strong note. The Dow climbed 0.87% (or more than 200 points) to 24,573, while the S&P gained 0.81% to 2677.8. The NASDAQ was up 0.70% to 7156.3. said Kevin Matras in In addition to the earnings news, the market also got help on Monday from an easing of Syria concerns. Last week, the U.S. and a couple of allies launched precision missile strikes against that government in response to a recent chemical-weapons attack on citizens. In the days before the strike, President Trump wrote some tweets that unnerved the market, especially given Syria's relationship with Russia. However, the operation seems to have been successful, alleviating the market's concerns for now.In the portfolios,  has been putting off new trades amid this unpredictable market, but today's performance convinced Jeremy to add to a couple of existing positions. Meanwhile,  got back into one of its favorite stocks today, and  swapped out five positions. Read the highlights section below for more... With the indices possibility moving higher during earnings season, Jeremy finally feels comfortable enough to make some moves. The editor added more allocation to two existing positions. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW), a provider of outsourced aircraft and aviation operating services, has jumped 10% since it was added to the portfolio in late March. Jeremy thinks it will runup into its earnings early next month, so he added 6% more to the holding.Meanwhile, Micron (MU) recently held its 50-day in a Fibonacci long setup, which was what the editor expected when he bought this semiconductor solutions leader earlier this month. The stock moved lower this morning, providing the perfect opportunity to add 5% more to this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). By the way, the portfolio also sold half of IDEXX Labs (IDXX) for a return of approximately 7.5%. Read the full write-up for more on all of today's activity. Diversification isn't just important among industries, but within them as well. Case in point, Kevin decided not to buy Lam Research (LRCX) on Monday since the portfolio already has one of its peers. Instead, the editor added a company that's  : NVIDIA (NVDA). The company's leadership position in AI differentiates it among semiconductors. The pullback in the group today gave Kevin the perfect opportunity to add a 7% position. The portfolio has pulled a number of double-digit profits out of NVDA in 2017 and so far in 2018; in fact, it is one of the service's all-time movers with a gain of nearly 36% earlier this year.

The ETF holds a total of $12,619,019 worth of IDXX, making it the #3 largest holding.

(Symbol: IDXX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $194.50, changing hands for $195.62/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 4 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $132.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $220.00. The standard deviation is $41.829.But the whole reason to look at the  IDXX price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with IDXX crossing above that average target price of $194.50/share, investors in IDXX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $194.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Up to now, reports have been mostly positive as we enter one of the busiest weeks of the season.But the market just can't get its mind off rising rates and concerns about tech. These issues started making an impact in the middle of last week, and the weekend didn't do much to calm the fears. As a result, the major indices had a choppy Monday session that finished mostly lower.The NASDAQ, of course, is taking the brunt of tech concerns, though the impact is being felt all over due to how important the sector has been for the bull market. Tech got a one-two punch last week from Morgan Stanley warning of soft iPhone sales AND Taiwan Semiconductor's concerns of weak demand for smartphones. The index had the most severe pullback on Monday, though it was only a loss of 0.25% to 7,128.6.The Dow started last week with a pair of 200-point gains, but it hasn't closed on the positive side since. It was down 0.06% today to 24,448.7 for its fourth straight day in the red. The S&P managed a rise of 0.01% to 2670.3.Along with concerns about tech, the market continues to watch the 10-year Treasury note as it continues to inch its way toward 3% (more on this in the highlights section below).The market will have a ton of earnings reports to digest this week, including some of the biggest tech names. We already received the report from Alphabet after the bell; the parent company of Google beat on both the top and bottom lines. Later in the week, we'll get reports from the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. Shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) moved lower during the Friday selloff despite this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) having just reported a strong quarter. This leader in robotic-assisted surgery announced a positive EPS surprise of 22% last week, underscoring the acceleration of its earnings momentum. According to Jeremy, the subsequent pullback was a gift. He added ISRG on Monday with a 10% allocation.In other news, the editor decided not to hold IDEXX Labs (IDXX) through its earnings report early next month. This leader in pet healthcare innovation has slipped all the way to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IDXX options chain for the new May 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of 30 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $155.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $154.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $195.17/share today.Because the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 21% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of IDXX stock at the current price level of $195.17/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $200.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.62% if the stock gets called away at the May 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IDXX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

The bull run through the 1990s has been the longest. Stocks scaled new highs on Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.But, recent trade war tensions, uproar in the White House, higher interest rates and half a trillion dollars of loss for tech stocks in just over a two-week span have pushed the index back to critical support at its 200-day moving average. The S&P, in fact, fell into correction territory, while volatility has more than doubled so far this year.Not all S&P stocks are, however, facing a tumultuous Q1. Some of them have been able to dish out impressive year-to-date gains and have remained unperturbed by the higher bouts of gyrations.The S&P started Q1 on a positive note. Trump's polices, including tax cuts, repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the S&P move north.The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas. This means around $1.2 trillion in foreign profits that the S&P 500 companies are hoarding be brought back. This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders - something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the campaigns days.Trump's economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate near a 17-year low. Initial jobless claims remained near the lowest level since 1970 and the number of people collecting unemployment benefits tanked to a fresh 45-year low.But, there is another major factor behind the strong American growth. It's the global economic growth, with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy expanded at rate of 3.7% last year, the fastest since 2010.Selling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum. In response to Trump's tariffs, Beijing said that it will target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. Investors panicked as a full-blown trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment.A number of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, in the meantime, pushed political-risk to the highest level since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Such events threatened to upset the Trump administration's business-friendly policies.Amid all these, the Fedhas tightened its monetary policy. At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. This hasn't gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China.Adding to the downbeat tone is also a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc's  handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump's election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.The S&P tech sector, which was the most crowded trade of the year, peaked on Mar 12 to 1,233.93, putting its market cap at about $6 trillion. However, the market cap is currently down to nearly $5.5 trillion, a decline of 8.8%, per WSJ Market Data Group.The S&P, now, has fallen more than 10% from its peak in January. The average number of stocks on the index is almost 15% below the 52-week high, while the average stock in some of the sectors are already in bear-market territory, defined as a decline of 20%, as per Bespoke Investment Group.Despite the brutal selloff of the past few weeks, some stocks have managed to give encouraging returns, thanks to a great story or maybe a little luck. Here is the rundown of the best stocks from the S&P 500 in Q1.

Efficiency, a company's ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company's financial health.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine.

In fourth-quarter 2017, the company witnessed double-digit organic revenue growth in the international business. This upside was owing to continued consumable revenue gains supported by Catalyst instrument base and average testing utilization.In international markets, the company witnessed considerable organic lab revenue gains supported by positive customer response to SDMA as well as significant growth in rapid assay sales. In addition, management experienced steady growth in reference labs led by consistent gains in Europe.Furthermore, CAG organic revenue growth in low-double digits on strong VetLab consumables and CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth is impressive. We are also optimistic about the company's expanding premium instrument base in the United States and international markets, including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and continued customer retention.Moving ahead, we expect the company to gain from the commercial launch of Catalyst SDMA Test in North America in January. IDEXX too entered into a global agreement with a diagnostic company - Applied BioCode\u00ad - in the same month.Moreover, IDEXX has a strong cash balance that allows it to carry out share repurchases.

(Symbol: IDXX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $194.50, changing hands for $197.45/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 4 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $132.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $220.00. The standard deviation is $41.829.But the whole reason to look at the  IDXX price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with IDXX crossing above that average target price of $194.50/share, investors in IDXX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $194.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Idexx Laboratories, Inc.:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Seagate Technology plc  , Micron Technology, Inc.  , IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  , Kohl's Corporation  and Motorola Solutions, Inc.  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The S&P 500, which had more than tripled on Mar 9 after a grueling spell following the Great Recession, is now on the second-longest and second-highest bull market run in history. The bull run through the 1990s has been the longest. Stocks scaled new highs on Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.But, recent trade war tensions, uproar in the White House, higher interest rates and half a trillion dollars of loss for tech stocks in just over a two-week span have pushed the index back to critical support at its 200-day moving average. The S&P, in fact, fell into correction territory, while volatility has more than doubled so far this year.Not all S&P stocks are, however, facing a tumultuous Q1. Some of them have been able to dish out impressive year-to-date gains and have remained unperturbed by the higher bouts of gyrations.The S&P started Q1 on a positive note. Trump's polices, including tax cuts, repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the S&P move north.The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas. This means around $1.2 trillion in foreign profits that the S&P 500 companies are hoarding be brought back. This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders - something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the campaigns days.Trump's economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate near a 17-year low. Initial jobless claims remained near the lowest level since 1970 and the number of people collecting unemployment benefits tanked to a fresh 45-year low.But, there is another major factor behind the strong American growth. It's the global economic growth, with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy expanded at rate of 3.7% last year, the fastest since 2010.Selling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum. In response to Trump's tariffs, Beijing said that it will target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. Investors panicked as a full-blown trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment.A number of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, in the meantime, pushed political-risk to the highest level since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Such events threatened to upset the Trump administration's business-friendly policies.Amid all these, the Fedhas tightened its monetary policy. At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. This hasn't gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China.Adding to the downbeat tone is also a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook's handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump's election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.The S&P tech sector, which was the most crowded trade of the year, peaked on Mar 12 to 1,233.93, putting its market cap at about $6 trillion. However, the market cap is currently down to nearly $5.5 trillion, a decline of 8.8%, per WSJ Market Data Group.The S&P, now, has fallen more than 10% from its peak in January. The average number of stocks on the index is almost 15% below the 52-week high, while the average stock in some of the sectors are already in bear-market territory, defined as a decline of 20%, as per Bespoke Investment Group.Despite the brutal selloff of the past few weeks, some stocks have managed to give encouraging returns, thanks to a great story or maybe a little luck.

Meanwhile, Brian Bolan has been selling a lot in his portfolios recently, but today he added one back to  and  each. Finally,  replaced five positions and banked three profits. Give it all a look below: Now that the market has calmed down a bit, Jeremy is feeling better about making some portfolio moves. On Tuesday, he added W.W. Grainger (GWW), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) supplier of facilities maintenance products. The company recently reported a strong quarter, including a 35% earnings beat and a sharply higher guidance. The pullback gives the portfolio a good entry for a stock that has just recently been much higher...and should be again. It was bought with a 13% allocation. Jeremy also added 5% to his allocation in IDEXX Labs (IDXX), which entered the portfolio earlier this month and should drift higher with further market stability. Read the full write-up for more on this new buy, including a look at its chart. Shares of J.Jill (JILL) really bottomed out a few months back, but Brian Bolan is seeing signs that this specialty retailer of women's apparel is turning things around. For example, a firm recently raised its price target on the stock and there has been some insider buying of late. Plus, JILL is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 40% in its latest quarter. The editor feels that he's getting a good name at a good price. Read the full write-up for more. The cybersecurity names have held up really well in this pullback, so Brian Bolan decided to pick a name from this space for his next buy. Qualys (QLYS) provides cloud security and compliance solutions to protect organizations from cyber-attacks and other risks. Last night, the company reported a beat-and-raise quarter, which suggests that it could be set up for a post-earnings drift higher. It also has a great history of consistently beating quarterly earnings estimates. The editor thinks this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) is all set for a boost in rank.

As part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed down to 21% from the previous 35%, thus lending a huge relief to the MedTech mammoths.However, ahead of the industry's fourth-quarter earnings release, a section of analysts expect this new tax law to negatively impact the industry due to a possible cut in overall Medicare spending, if certain criteria are not fulfilled by a specific date. The Congressional Budget Office apprehends that in absence of any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax reduction, automatic cut backs worth $136 billion including $25 billion in Medicare cuts from the mandatory budget of spending in 2018, could be triggered.Amid tax reform related concerns, the news of Congress delaying the medical device tax for another two years came as a huge boost to industry players and investors.

The market dropped more on Monday than it did all of last week\u2026and that was a pretty bad week! Without further ado, here are the ugly details. The Dow plunged 4.6% today (or 1175 points!) to 24,345.8. The S&P slipped 4.1% to 2648.9 and the NASDAQ was off 3.8% to 6967.5. That hurts\u2026The knee jerk reaction to such a massacre is to freak out. But it's really not too hard to find a silver lining in today's extreme pullback. said Kevin Matras in Options Trader. That idea permeated throughout most of the portfolios on Monday. While the market went down, the editors came in to buy. Many had been waiting for a pullback, and the past few days have provided the opportunity to pick up quality companies at prices not seen all year. In the highlights section below, you'll see five portfolios that made 11 buys in total\u2026and that's not including the eight swaps in Black Box Trader.Let's put an end to this day and get right to those moves. But first, here's a few words from Dave: he said in Momentum Trader and Surprise Trader. On Friday, Jeremy stated:  The editor wasted no time on Monday morning. He picked up these four new names:\u2022 Brinker Int'l (EAT)\u2022 CA Inc. (CA)\u2022 IDEXX Labs (IDXX)\u2022 athenahealth (ATHN)Each of these stocks are Zacks Rank #1s (Strong Buys) that recently reported strong numbers. EAT, CA and IDXX have plunged despite their results, while ATHN has NOT succumbed to market weakness. Jeremy is taking a smaller 5% position in each of these names because the selloff may not be over and he wants the option to buy more on a dip.The portfolio also sold ConocoPhillips (COP) and DMC Global (BOOM) for profits of 8.8% and 4.5%, respectively. The complete commentary has a lot more info on today's moves. And be ready for even more buys in the coming days as this selloff is playing right into the editor's hands by putting companies with strong earnings on sale. The portfolio added two names on Monday. Firstly, Lithia Motors (LAD) is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in a highly-ranked industry with a Zacks VGM Score of \"A\". Technically, the stock has pulled back to the apex of a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which is a great place for a breakout to occur. It reports on February 14 and has a positive Earnings ESP. Kevin bought to open 3 June 125.00 Calls and sold to open 3 June 130.00 Calls.The other move today was in Arrow Electronics (ARW), a major distributor of electronic components and computer products to industrial and commercial customers. Like LAD, it too is in a bullish ascending triangle pattern. However, this stock reports tomorrow and has an Earnings ESP of 1.05%. Kevin thinks that a positive announcement could set ARW for an enduring breakout. He bought to open only 1 June 82.50 Call, but would add more on a positive performance. Get more specifics about these moves in the full write-up. says Dave. The editor is speaking figuratively of course. In other words, when a strong market pulls back vigorously, it's a great time to put some money to work. On Monday, the portfolio picked up Total Fina (TOT) and Penn National Gaming (PENN).TOT is an oil and gas production company that has a solid Earnings ESP of 11.32% for the quarter to be reported later this week. This could be a real quick turnaround. PENN reports after the bell on Thursday and has a positive Earnings ESP of 7.9%. The company reported a big beat last time and its estimates have been moving up nicely over the past year. Both stocks are Zacks Rank #2s (Buys) and are being added with 12.5% allocations. Read the complete commentary for more. Kevin does not believe this is a double-digit correction, but it is deep enough to put some cash to work in front of a possible March-April rally. Therefore, the editor added more allocation to his favorite stock: NVIDIA (NVDA). The \"monster of all things advanced computing\" reports on Thursday, and he thinks it will be strong enough to make $220 a great place to add. Get more specifics on the move in the full write-up, along with Kevin's 5 takes on the market right now. And be ready for even more trades soon... The portfolio picked up a couple of stocks during the pullback: Monster Beverage (MNST) and Kirby (KEX). The chart for MNST appears to be setting up one of Dave's favorite continuation patterns. As for KEX, the company recently reported a nice earnings beat and is breaking out from its 52-week high on solid volume. Both stocks are Zacks Rank #2s (Buys) and are being added with 12.5% allocations. The portfolio is almost completely new this week as eight stocks were swapped out. The positions that left the portfolio were:\u2022 Huntsman Corp. (HUN, +4%)\u2022 Prudential Financial (PRU)\u2022 Nordstrom Inc. (JWN)\u2022 CBRE Group (CBG)\u2022 Macy's Inc. (M)\u2022 Kemet Corp.

The adjusted EPS figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Reported EPS came in at 43 cents.Full-year 2017 reported EPS came in at $2.94 per share.

The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.95 billion.The year-over-year upside was driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (\"CAG\") Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable and reference lab as well as strong acceptance of rapid assays and veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems. | IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (\"LPD\"); and Other.In the fourth quarter, CAG revenues rose 14.2% (up 11.8% organically) year over year to $433.5 million. Water segment's revenues were up 18.6% from the prior-year quarter (up 16.1% organically) to $28.9 million. LPD revenues grew 12.8% (up 8.4% organically) to $37.2 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $2.17 billion, below the guided range.Management also raised its EPS guidance to $4.04-$4.18 from the earlier $3.50-$3.62, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 37-42% on a reported basis compared with 8-12% stated previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 EPS is pegged at $3.75, below the guided range.IDEXX exited the fourth quarter on a solid note. Moreover, solid year-over year growth in organic revenues and a raised EPS guidance for 2018 are encouraging.The stellar performance was driven by strong sales at the CAG business. The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth. Management's innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. Moreover, the strong top-line growth in the quarter was driven by considerable contributions from the rest of the business segments.IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average being 9.4%. Let's take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Similar to the prior quarter, IDEXX is expected to gain from strong global growth in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues. The upside was driven by double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable and reference lab, strong acceptance of rapid assays and veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base. Management expects the solid performance to reflect in the fourth-quarter results as well.We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. Management expects fourth-quarter results to show a rise in productivity as new sales representatives establish new customer relationships and switch to commission-based compensation for instrument placements. Also, we expect the company to report exceptional customer retention rates for reference labs and instrument consumables in the United States and worldwide in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG Diagnostics revenues of $425 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for fourth-quarter total revenues are projected at $491 million, up 10.9% from the prior-year quarter. Notably, IDEXX expects 2017 revenues in the range of $1,950-$1,960 million, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 10%. | Here are the  that might influence IDEXX's fourth-quarter results:We are upbeat about growth in the Water Business, which has been on a growth trajectory of late on encouraging test results in the United States and benefits from global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, in the last reported quarter, the business witnessed 10% organic growth. Management is also looking forward to benefits from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Water revenues of $27.3 million reflects an increase of 12.3% from the year-ago quarter.IDEXX continues to expand globally. It has been significantly benefitting from the bountiful opportunities in the companion animal diagnostics market of emerging nations. Further, management's consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the fourth-quarter performance.Management also estimates 2017 EPS in the band of $3.22-$3.26, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The outlook represents year over year EPS growth of 32-34% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 73 cents shows an increase of 25.9% from a year ago.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the company's high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, IDEXX has been seeing a rise in operating expenses owing to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development and expansion in the United States and internationally.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance. The struggle to gain market traction might prove to be a drag on fourth-quarter results.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:IDEXX has the right combination of two main ingredients - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. : The Earnings ESP for IDEXX is +0.82%.

With this, IDEXX's point-of-care customers will now be able to add SDMA as an essential element to the routine chemistry panel.Per IDEXX, SDMA is an essential chemistry parameter, more reliable and sensitive as an indicator of kidney function than creatinine. This will enable veterinarians to detect acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease earlier than before.The company encouragingly stated that this commercial launch has ramped up its kidney test profile for the point of care. On a positive note, already more than 2,731 preorders for the 12-test box of the Catalyst SDMA Test have been shipped to IDEXX customers. Also, another 1,762 existing preorders were supposed to be shipped last week.The Catalyst SDMA Test has already been in use for hundreds of practices across the United States.

There are more than 28,000 Catalyst One and Catalyst Dx analyzers in use for veterinary practices worldwide.Apart from emerging a lead player in the field of veterinary renal care market with SDMA as its major development, IDEXX now explores its potential in human health.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IDXX options chain for the new February 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $160.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $160.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $155.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $163.81/share today.Because the $160.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IDXX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

Growing adoption of the company's da Vinci system, increasing procedure volumes, strategic acquisitions, continuous innovation and solid recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intuitive Surgical is the manufacturer of the da Vinci surgical system (an advanced robot-assisted surgical system) and related instruments and accessories. The system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid trauma associated with open surgery. In the last quarter, Intuitive Surgical launched two additional instruments and accessories for da Vinci X and Xi platforms in seven countries.Notably, the company initiated a limited launch of a refined vessel sealer in Europe in the quarter. Management announced plans to file the first 510(k) for FDA approval of da Vinci SP program by 2017,and submissions for additional indications thereafter.For 2018, Intuitive Surgical has strong opportunities in the U.S. general surgery market, particularly driven by procedures for hernia repair and colorectal surgery. Internationally, the company has significant opportunities in Japan, South Korea and China.On the flip side, foreign exchange movements are affecting the company's results. Though Intuitive Surgical generates a major portion of revenues from the domestic market, continued investments in international businesses are widening the company's exposure to international markets. Hence, unfavorable foreign exchange is a major concern for 2018.Further, the Medical Product space, has been a precarious game for the Republicans since day one, courtesy of President Trump's repeated failure to repeal and replace Obamacare. However, major MedTech players like Intuitive Surgical have been pinning their hopes on Trump's promise to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though its elimination is far from being achieved.In this regard, let us not forget the massive chaos in the MedTech space triggered by the failure of the first Republican healthcare bill which was proposed this summer. The so-called American Health Care Act (AHCA) failed to garner support in the House owing to solid opposition from conservative and moderate lawmakers. The persistent uncertainty has given rise to concerns regarding the sustainability of MedTech companies, including Intuitive Surgical.Investors' optimism has been growing, thanks to President Trump's promise of 'enactment of new tax reforms'. However, the market has not benefited due to the lack of favorable developments in the regulatory front. Notably, this tax had been suspended for two years and is likely to be put into effect again on Jan 1, 2018.Intuitive Surgical's price movement has been robust over the last three months.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 3 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $118.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $185.00. The standard deviation is $36.143.But the whole reason to look at the  IDXX price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with IDXX crossing above that average target price of $159.33/share, investors in IDXX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $159.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Here we take a sneak peek at the major factors driving growth for Baxter at the moment:The year 2017 has been a favorable one for Baxter on the regulatory front. Recently, management confirmed that the FDA has granted two new approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs from the facilities in Canada and Mexico. With this development, Baxter now has four operational sites approved to meet demand in the U.S. markets.Furthermore, the FDA approval of new premixed injectables is a key catalyst.

Management at Varian confirmed that training and online courses will be available from January 2018.The latest development is likely to enhance the knowledge and skills of clinicians and therapists in the global proton therapy space. In fact, continued education and training are likely to boost the availability of proton therapy products in the niche markets.Proton therapy or proton beam therapy is a type of particle therapy that uses a beam of protons to treat diseased tissue, most often in the cases of cancer. A research report by the CISION PR Newswire suggests that the global proton therapy systems market is expected to reach $2.88 billion by 2025.Favorable reimbursement policies in the United States and Europe and rising awareness in cancer-related healthcare policies along with expenditures in emerging nations are likely to propel the proton therapy space in the long haul. In fact, various reports suggest that this proton therapy space will be dominated by the United States, thanks to its massive investment in the development of therapy centers.Now coming to the leading players in the space, Hitachi, Ion Beam Applications, Mevion Medical Systems and Sumitomo also deserve a mention. Meanwhile, proton therapy market is growing in manifolds and expects to witness a stellar demand in the coming days.Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe proton therapy also holds significant promise for Varian. This is because the company's flagship - ProBeam Compact Proton Therapy System - is superior to other external beam radiotherapies available in the markets.ProBeam precisely locates cancerous tumors, thereby causing lesser side-effects to surrounding tissues. In this regard, Varian's proton therapy portfolio has products like ProBeam Proton Therapy System, ProBeam Compact Single-Room Proton Therapy Solution, ProBeam Multi-Room Proton Therapy Solution.However, the company has seen lackluster performance at the proton therapy segment recently. In the last quarter, revenues at the segment were $52 million, down 23% on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, Varian booked two orders including the Concord Medical Proton Center in Guangzhou, China for $52 million and HCG in India for $19 million. Yet, proton therapy orders grew 94% in the same period, on a year-over year basis.We believe such developments might help Varian to gain traction in the niche space.Over the past six months, Varian outperformed the broader industry in terms of price performance. The company returned 15.1% comparing favorably with the broader  's gain of just 6.7%. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500's gain of 7.2% over the same time frame.Varian has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express  , Luminex Corporation  and IDEXX Laboratories  .Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%. You can see  .Luminex represented a return of 6.2% over the last year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20.4%.

The company's acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding existing product offerings across all business segments.However, challenging global economic conditions, supply side issues, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and a strengthening dollar are likely to dent top-line growth in the near term. Stryker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Stryker added almost 35% in the last year, much higher than the broader  's return of 23.5%.Stryker's wide range of products shields the company against any significant sales shortfall during economic downturns. The company's pipeline includes products like Hip, Knee and Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgeries.In fact, solid performance in the MAKO robotic platform has been boosting revenues for long. At the end of the last reported third quarter of 2017, Stryker sold a total of 33 robots and continues to update robots in the field with the Total Knee application.Stryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost its inorganic growth profile. Recently, the company announced plans to acquire France-based VEXIM.VEXIM's portfolio is highly complementary to the interventional spine business of Stryker's Instruments division. Key products in the segment include an extensive platform for vertebral augmentation, vertebroplasty and radiofrequency ablation procedures.In September, Stryker completed the buyout of NOVADAQ for a net purchase price of $674 million to boost its visualization platform.On the flipside, Stryker recently announced the voluntary product recall of the Oral Care lineup under its Sage-Products unit. The recall pertains to a cross-contamination issue in the Oral-care solutions which were manufactured for Stryker's Sage unit by a third-party supplier. Notably, these solutions were distributed in markets between July 2015 and August 2017.For 2017, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to affect net sales nominally while adjusted earnings are expected to be impacted by 10 cents per share. Net sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be impacted positively by 1%. However, Stryker expects a negative impact on adjusted net earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of approximately 2 cents per share.Stryker's share price movement over the past year has been favorable. The company yielded a return of almost 34.4%, better than the broader industry's 24.2%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500's return of 18.3%.Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been impressive. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past 60 days compared to two lower. Meanwhile, full-year estimate has seen eleven up and four down in the same time period. This had a nominal impact on the consensus estimate though consensus estimate for the current quarter rose 1% in the past two months, while full-year estimates inched up 0.2%.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express  , Luminex Corporation  and IDEXX Laboratories  .Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%. You can see Luminex represented a return of 6.4% over the last year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.8%. The stock has climbed 39.2% over a year's time and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  ,  ,  ,  and  .The latest $1.5-trillion tax reform plan has been a landmark achievement for President Trump. As usual, in its initial stage, the nation gave mixed reactions on the controversial bill. While a few Americans slammed the new plan as a 'job killer,' others found it to be 'an excellent opportunity to fix a broken tax code.'While the bill claims to primarily focus on the easing of tax woes for middle-class Americans, the massive cut in corporate taxes tells a different story altogether. In fact, a research report by CNBC reveals that Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, slammed the new tax code as a \"a big giveaway to millionaires and corporations,\" neglecting the ones who are in real need of it.Now, it is to be seen whether the bill is fated to meet an overall failure or it gets to fulfill its promises of 'inclusive economic growth'. ,\" - Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.While the reduction in corporate taxes will encourage the development of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, the question over its profitability looms large. This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare costs, the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.The MedTech community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Such high taxes forced companies to lay off employees, limit research and development activities, and reduce capital investment.Furthermore, AdvaMed, a leading American medical device trade association, had referred to the medical device tax as a 'significant drag on medical innovation'. Notably, small device companies suffered the most. Amid such worries, a repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to resume an aggressive pace of hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor confidence in the stocks.Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in a roughly 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players. The comeback of the tax in 2018 will lead to a $15 billion rise in taxes, largely discouraging R&D activities. Undoubtedly, the future of the U.S. MedTech industry depends on the Republicans' decision on the 2.3% medical device tax.Per Trump, the democrats have established a \"lousy healthcare\" model. However, with a complete medical device tax renovation, it is being widely believed that a new set of streamlined rules will benefit the medical device space.Meanwhile, stocks with strong fundamentals will give you assured returns amid this tax conundrum. We have zeroed in on five stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and boast strong fundamentals. Notably, all these stocks promise long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10% or more.Headquartered in Delaware, NJ, IDEXX is a developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services, primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. The company also sells a series of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market.The company continues to demonstrate solid growth globally on strong international expansion. Management's innovation-based global strategy is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. Notably, IDEXX expanded its cloud technology portfolio with the addition of rVetLink. Solid organic revenue growth along with a raised guidance for 2017 buoy optimism.The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20.4%. IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2. Over the last year, IDEXX has added 29.6%, higher than the broader  's gain of 24.5%.Luminex develops, manufactures and markets proprietary biological testing technologies with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industry. The company's open-architecture multiplexing xMAP (Multi-Analyte Profiling) technology is sold worldwide and is used by leading research laboratories as well as major pharmaceutical, diagnostic and biotechnology companies for conducting biological tests.Luminex's Assay business is likely to be its key growth driver over the long term. The company also witnessed favorable tidings at the regulatory front in the third quarter. In this regard, the recent CE-IVD mark for the ARIES Norovirus Assay, the FDA approval of ARIES C. difficile Assay and the reimbursement approval of VERIGENE assay in Japan are noteworthy. Luminex is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep and is close to submitting the same for FDA review.The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.3%. Luminex has a Zacks Rank #1. Over the last month, Luminex has returned 7.7%, much higher than the broader  3.4%. You can see Irvine, CA-based Masimo develops, manufactures and markets a family of non-invasive monitoring systems. The company's flagship product - Signal Extraction (SET) Pulse Oximetry - is used to monitor blood oxygen saturation levels and protect against hypoxemia and hyperoxemia.We believe the company's expanding product portfolio will be a key catalyst. Wider adoption of its non-invasive patient monitoring technology will help the company gain traction. Masimo's SET pulse oximetry business represents considerable growth opportunities in international markets. Moreover, the FDA 510 (k) approval for the Radius 7 wearable and the O3 regional oximetry device are significant positives.Masimo has a Zacks Rank #2 and promises a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10.1%. Over the last three months, Masimo has returned 7.6%, higher than the broader  6.5%.Based in California, Align manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics, and dental records storage.We are encouraged by the company's solid InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and internationally, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. A strong summer season performance drove Invisalign growth in the global teen market. We are also upbeat about the company's signing of a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental. The company's receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack InvisAlign Aligner material buoys optimism as well.Align has a Zacks Rank #1, and promises long-term expected earnings growth of 28.9%. Over the last three months, the stock has returned 45.5%, way higher than the broader  's 5.2%.Cooper, based in Pleasanton, CA, is a specialty medical device company operating on a global basis. The company is poised to gain from an expanding product portfolio and increasing penetration in International markets. Accretive acquisitions are also a key catalyst for the long term.The company has been seeing strong growth at its CooperVision business segment of late. Notably, the segment banks on the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity silicone hydrogel lenses platforms. The CooperSurgical segment also delivered strong sales in the quarter. A strong guidance for fiscal 2017 instills our confidence in the stock. Cooper recently completed the acquisition of Procornea. This added a leading ortho-k technology to Cooper's lens portfolio and marked its foray into the emerging myopia controlled markets.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an expected earnings growth rate of 10.8%. Over the last year, the stock has added 43.9%, much higher than the broader  's 19.9%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

This last week, for the first time ever, they tried to technology in a human patient to try to cure Hunter's disease. We'll have to see if that ends up being successful or not. Obviously, a very risky stock. A lot of companies exploring gene therapies and there's a lot of different ways to make changes to DNA. If you're like me and you want to participate in this kind of investment, you might want to take a basket approach and buy more than one. Ron is talking biotechs! I'm stunned. I'm a shareholder of this company. Someone switched out Ron Gross for David Gardner when we weren't looking. Yeah, who is this guy? Steve Broido, question about Sangamo Technologies? When I hear \"waiting for FDA approval\" I want to run for the door, because it seems like so many businesses are just waiting for that critical FDA approval, and then everything will be great. Should I think differently, Ron? No, you're right. That's why biotech is so risky. You have to make sure they have the cash to succeed and stay around a long time. And that's why I advocate a basket approach. Buy a bunch of these. Jason Moser, what are you looking at? Guys, I love my dogs, that's why I'm going with Idexx Laboratories this week, ticker is IDXX. Their primary focus is on the U.S. pet diagnostics market, focus on companion animals primarily, so cats and dogs mostly. We all know the market trends there. They have a very attractive razor and blade model where they get their equipment in veterinary offices around the country and then sell the consumables that go with that equipment. They hold about 70% of the market today, and a big investment in growing their direct sales team, with a focus on higher levels of service to compete with Mars, which owns VCA, Andec, and Banfield, among others. According to my vet, those investments are working. He is an Idexx customer, and seems to be very happy with the service. We've got it on the watch list in MDP, and just waiting for the right price. Steve, question about Idexx Labs? Is there a clear tie in with an insurance provider? So, you buy insurance before any of the testing gets done, so you know you're covered? No, and that's really the attractive part about this market. The pet care business is really a cash business. There are pet insurance plans, but those revolve around catastrophic type events. General health and well-being of your animal, that's just a cash business. Matt Argersinger, what are you looking at? I'm looking at STAG Industrial, ticker is STAG. I'm adding it to our watch list in Million Dollar Portfolio. STAG is a real estate investment trust. It owns more than 300 properties, primarily warehouses, distribution centers, light industrial buildings. You kind of see where I'm going here. If you're looking to play the e-commerce trend and you're worried about the shifting retail landscape, this is one way to bet on the growth of omni channel distribution. I think it's a great little business. You get a 5% dividend yield, as well. Steve? Is that dividend going up or down in the next year? Oh, it's going up. It's going up, Steve. STAG Industrial, Idexx Labs, Sangamo Technologies. Three companies that really aren't household names, Steve. What do you think? I do like me some dividends, I'm going STAG.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["rowth stocks can be some of the most exciting picks in the market, as these high-flyers can captivate investors' attention, and produce big gains as well.

Earnings however declined 4.5% year over year.Adjustments in the quarter primarily included the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, divestiture-related items, adverse effects of Hurricane Maria and acquisition-related items. After adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of a penny, adjusted EPS was $1.06.Without these adjustments, the company's reported EPS was $1.48, up 85% year over year.Worldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.05 billion, up 3.5% on a constant exchange rate or CER basis (down 4.1% on a reported basis). The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.07 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation affected Medtronic's second-quarter revenues by $35 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52.9% of total revenues) declined 10.1% year over year to $3.73 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.24 billion (31.8% of total revenues), reflecting a 4.7% increase at CER (up 1.4% as reported). Emerging market revenues (15.3% of total revenues) amounted to $1.08 billion, up 12.4% at CER (up 9.8% as reported). | The company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 7% at CER (up 7.4% as reported) to $2.77 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales totaled $1.47 billion, up 4% year over year at CER (up 5% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions and low-double digit rise in Diagnostics at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, and strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. This apart, strong demand for the company's suite of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-P) along with growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support drove Heart Failure division revenues.CSH revenues were up 12% at CER (13% as reported) to $854 million on the back of high-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform. Moreover, the company's recent launch of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 4% growth at CER (up 5% as reported) to $452 million, driven by continued adoption of the Valiant Captiviathoracic stent graft systems and strength in the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Peripheral was driven by double-digit growth in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug-coated balloons. Moreover, the recently-launched Concerto 3D detachable coil system drove mid-single digit growth in endoVenous.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $1.95 billion, marking a 2% year-over-year increase at CER (down 21% on a reported basis) on mid-single digit growth in SI, which was affected by Hurricane Maria, and partially offset by low-single digit decline in RGR.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.86 billion were up 2% year over year at CER (same as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, offsetting declines in Spine, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies. Moreover, the Spine and Pain Therapies divisions along with the Pelvic Health business in the Specialty Therapies division in the United States were affected by Hurricane Maria.However, revenues at the Diabetes group declined 2% at CER (flat as reported) to $462 million.Gross margin in the reported quarter expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 69.9% despite a 1.8% decline in gross profit to $4.93 billion. Adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps year over year to 27.5% owing to a 0.2% rise in research and development expenses (to $555 million) along with a 0.8% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.44 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $111 million as compared with $89 million in the year-ago quarter.Medtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company maintains full-year revenue growth projection in the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $275-$375 million impact on fiscal results compared with $380-$480 million estimated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at $29.36 billion.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is expected to have an adverse impact of two cents compared with the earlier expectation of a negative effect of 3 cents to a positive impact of a penny. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.7.For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $155-$175 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected to contribute a penny to third-quarter earnings per share.Medtronic exited the fiscal second quarter on a mixed note. While the company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER, escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on the bottom line. Unfavorable currency translation also acted as a dampener.On the bright side, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the company's solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. Moreover, the company's recent receipt of FDA approval and commercial launch of Azure pacemakers with BlueSync technology buoy optimism.Medtronic currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express  , Luminex Corporation  and IDEXX Laboratories  .Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Efficiency level, which measures a company's capability to transform its available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company's potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a promising efficiency level is likely to deliver stellar returns as it is assumed to be positively correlated with its price performance.We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company's business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.This ratio is used to measure a company's capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.This is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company's potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

Earnings were also lower than the year-ago figure of 56 cents. Hurricanes hurt Patterson Companies' earnings per share by approximately a penny in the quarter.Net sales fell 2.3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion, which also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion. Adjusting the effects of foreign currency exchange, sales declined 2.8% on a year-over-year basis, including a negative impact of approximately 60 basis points (bps) from the hurricanes.Patterson Companies has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). |  This segment is a leading distributor of products, services and technologies to the production and companion animal health markets in North America and the U.K. Coming to the second-quarter performance of the platform (60% of total sales), sales increased almost 1.4% at constant currency (cc) on a year-over-year basis to $823.6 million.Companion animal sales declined 1.4%. Production animal sales increased 4.2%, reflecting strong performance across all segments, especially in the swine business. This segment provides a virtually complete range of consumable dental products, equipment, software, turnkey digital solutions and value-added services to dentists and dental laboratories throughout North America. In the second quarter, dental sales (40% of total sales) declined 8.4% at cc year over year to approximately $553.6 million. The decline was led by decreased sales of CEREC and digital technology products.Equipment sales in the dental segment fell 17.7%. Consumable dental supplies decreased 4.4%. However, other services and products, primarily comprising technical service, parts and labor, software support services and office supplies, increased 0.6%.Patterson Companiesrepurchased approximately 1 million shares of its outstanding common stock for $36.5 million in the reported quarter. The company also paid $24.8 million in cash dividends to shareholders.The company expects adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $2.00 to $2.10, way below the previously issued band of $2.25 to $2.40. Patterson Companies expects deal amortization expenses of $25.3 million or 27 cents per share. The company estimates integration and business restructuring expenses at $5.3 million or 6 cents per share.Patterson Companies exited the second quarter on a tepid note, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. Furthermore, a downbeat guidance indicates looming concerns. Lackluster performance by the dental segment is a concern. Management expects headwinds in the technology-based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018. However, we are upbeat about the company's Animal Health segment that witnessed strong sales last quarter. Patterson Companies provides a wide range of consumable supplies, equipment, software and value-added services. The company's broad spectrum of products cushions it against economic downturns in the MedTech space. We believe a diversified product portfolio, strong veterinary business prospects, accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are key growth catalysts.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express  , Luminex Corporation  and IDEXX Laboratories  .Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

But dig a little deeper, and the revenue issues weren't that big of a deal.The hurricanes hurt sales a little. And less testing of cattle is hurting the company's farm-animal testing business, although that's a relatively small fraction of sales. Finally, IDEXX increased the use of programs that result in placements of its instruments, but don't necessarily translate to immediate revenue recognition in the quarter in which they're placed -- which hurts short-term revenue, but should benefit long-term profits.Data source: IDEXX Laboratories.Image source: IDEXX LaboratoriesJonathan Ayers, IDEXX Laboratories' chairman, president, and CEO, explained how a move toward bundled sales that results in revenue from CAG instruments being recognized over five or six years, as well as rental programs in emerging markets, might hurt revenue in the short term, but benefits the company's profits in the long term:Ayers also highlighted the SDMA test that will be available on the Catalyst instrument in the next few months as a driver for future growth:Management increased 2017 earnings-per-share guidance to $3.22 to $3.26, which is $0.07 higher than the midpoint of the previous guidance, although about $0.05 of that will come from the aforementioned tax benefits. The company also released preliminary guidance for 2018, which has revenue increasing 9.5% to 11.5% year over year, with earnings per share increasing 8% to 12%, as reported, or 15% to 19% on a comparable constant-currency basis, as IDEXX plans to increase operating margins by 75 to 125 basis points.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As usual, in its initial stage, the nation gave mixed reactions on the controversial bill. While a few Americans slammed the new plan as a 'job killer,' others found it to be 'an excellent opportunity to fix a broken tax code.'While the bill claims to primarily focus on the easing of tax woes for middle-class Americans, the massive cut in corporate taxes tells a different story altogether. In fact, a research report by CNBC reveals that Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, slammed the new tax code as a \"a big giveaway to millionaires and corporations,\" neglecting the ones who are in real need of it.Now, it is to be seen whether the bill is fated to meet an overall failure or it gets to fulfill its promises of 'inclusive economic growth'. ,\" - Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.While the reduction in corporate taxes will encourage the development of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, the question over its profitability looms large. This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare costs, the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.The MedTech community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Such high taxes forced companies to lay off employees, limit research and development activities, and reduce capital investment.Furthermore, AdvaMed, a leading American medical device trade association, had referred to the medical device tax as a 'significant drag on medical innovation'. Notably, small device companies suffered the most. Amid such worries, a repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to resume an aggressive pace of hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor confidence in the stocks.Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in a roughly 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players. The comeback of the tax in 2018 will lead to a $15 billion rise in taxes, largely discouraging R&D activities. Undoubtedly, the future of the U.S. MedTech industry depends on the Republicans' decision on the 2.3% medical device tax.Per Trump, the democrats have established a \"lousy healthcare\" model. However, with a complete medical device tax renovation, it is being widely believed that a new set of streamlined rules will benefit the medical device space.Meanwhile, stocks with strong fundamentals will give you assured returns amid this tax conundrum. We have zeroed in on five stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and boast strong fundamentals. Notably, all these stocks promise long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10% or more.Headquartered in Delaware, NJ, IDEXX is a developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services, primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. The company also sells a series of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market.The company continues to demonstrate solid growth globally on strong international expansion. Management's innovation-based global strategy is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. Notably, IDEXX expanded its cloud technology portfolio with the addition of rVetLink. Solid organic revenue growth along with a raised guidance for 2017 buoy optimism.The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20.4%. IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2. Over the last year, IDEXX has added 29.6%, higher than the broader  's gain of 24.5%.Luminex develops, manufactures and markets proprietary biological testing technologies with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industry. The company's open-architecture multiplexing xMAP (Multi-Analyte Profiling) technology is sold worldwide and is used by leading research laboratories as well as major pharmaceutical, diagnostic and biotechnology companies for conducting biological tests.Luminex's Assay business is likely to be its key growth driver over the long term. The company also witnessed favorable tidings at the regulatory front in the third quarter. In this regard, the recent CE-IVD mark for the ARIES Norovirus Assay, the FDA approval of ARIES C. difficile Assay and the reimbursement approval of VERIGENE assay in Japan are noteworthy. Luminex is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep and is close to submitting the same for FDA review.The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.3%. Luminex has a Zacks Rank #1. Over the last month, Luminex has returned 7.7%, much higher than the broader  3.4%. You can see Irvine, CA-based Masimo develops, manufactures and markets a family of non-invasive monitoring systems. The company's flagship product - Signal Extraction (SET) Pulse Oximetry - is used to monitor blood oxygen saturation levels and protect against hypoxemia and hyperoxemia.We believe the company's expanding product portfolio will be a key catalyst. Wider adoption of its non-invasive patient monitoring technology will help the company gain traction. Masimo's SET pulse oximetry business represents considerable growth opportunities in international markets. Moreover, the FDA 510 (k) approval for the Radius 7 wearable and the O3 regional oximetry device are significant positives.Masimo has a Zacks Rank #2 and promises a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10.1%. Over the last three months, Masimo has returned 7.6%, higher than the broader  6.5%.Based in California, Align manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics, and dental records storage.We are encouraged by the company's solid InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and internationally, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. A strong summer season performance drove Invisalign growth in the global teen market. We are also upbeat about the company's signing of a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental. The company's receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack InvisAlign Aligner material buoys optimism as well.Align has a Zacks Rank #1, and promises long-term expected earnings growth of 28.9%. Over the last three months, the stock has returned 45.5%, way higher than the broader  's 5.2%.Cooper, based in Pleasanton, CA, is a specialty medical device company operating on a global basis. The company is poised to gain from an expanding product portfolio and increasing penetration in International markets. Accretive acquisitions are also a key catalyst for the long term.The company has been seeing strong growth at its CooperVision business segment of late. Notably, the segment banks on the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity silicone hydrogel lenses platforms. The CooperSurgical segment also delivered strong sales in the quarter. A strong guidance for fiscal 2017 instills our confidence in the stock. Cooper recently completed the acquisition of Procornea. This added a leading ortho-k technology to Cooper's lens portfolio and marked its foray into the emerging myopia controlled markets.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an expected earnings growth rate of 10.8%. Over the last year, the stock has added 43.9%, much higher than the broader  's 19.9%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to a Washington Post article, only modest changes were made to the legislation. While the President aims to give the bill a final attempt stressing on the importance of tax cut and reforms for economic growth (vote on the tax cut bill slated for Nov 16), let's see how the MedTech industry is gearing up for it.According a report by Business Insider, the Republican tax plan repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses. If the new bill gets implemented, families with high healthcare expenditure will be impacted as these expenses will no longer be deducted from their taxes. Hence, the masses will no longer be interested in expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures.A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303 of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20% excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Under the U.S. tax code, Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U.S. parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island. In this regard, the FDA recently found that around 30% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016. Undoubtedly, the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover with the approval of the bill.Without a doubt, the latest political developments have resulted in widespread volatility in the MedTech space.In such a tumultuous scenario, we have used the Zacks  to pick stocks for significant gains.

Notably, this product was earlier allowed for use in limb lengthening procedures to elongate the femur and tibia. The approval is expected to considerably drive Nuvasive's customer base.The PRECICE platform comprises an intramedullary device that on being implanted uses an external remote controller in order to non-invasively compress and distract long bones. Per the company, the key to the PRECICE platform is the magnetic interaction between the external remote control and PRECICE intramedullary nail.Notably, NSO operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of NuVasive since the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies in 2016. NuVasive continues to gain share in its NSO portfolio, which includes MAGnetic External Control (MAGEC) for early-onset scoliosis and PRECICE technology, both built on the MAGEC technology platform.Through this latest development, NuVasive expects to gain traction in the fast growing limb reconstruction and trauma market.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.8%. It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, at an average of 9.3%. Let's take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Similar to the prior quarter, IDEXX is expected to gain from strong global growth in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues. The growth in CAG Diagnostics was led by double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base.We are upbeat about the 300% year-over-year rise in the uptake of SNAP Pro units in North America last quarter.

The segment has been seeing continued strength in China. Also, expansion of the recurring pregnancy testing franchise buoys optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the LPD business of $30.3 million for the third quarter reflects an increase of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.The company continues to expand globally. It has been significantly benefitting from the bountiful opportunities in the companion animal market of emerging nations. Further, management's consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the company's third-quarter performance.Encouraged by these factors, IDEXX expects 2017 revenue in the range of $1,945-$1,965 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 10% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for third-quarter total revenues are projected at $494 million, up 10.3% from the prior-year quarterManagement also estimates its 2017 EPS guidance to the band of $3.12-$3.22 per share, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The outlook represents EPS growth of 28-32% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.17 reflects an increase of 29.9% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, management is upbeat about the 12% rise in the sales force in the U.S. market and some other areas in the third quarter.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern for the company is its high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward portfolio development and geographic expansion in the United States and internationally.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance. The struggle to gain market traction might prove to be a drag on third-quarter 2017 results.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:IDEXX does not have the right combination of two main ingredients - a positive  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. : The Earnings ESP for IDEXX is 0.00%.

However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 75 cents reflects a 20.9% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Here are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.43% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Over the last three months, the company has returned 0.9%, below the S&P 500's 3.4%.Intensifying competition, foreign exchange volatility, higher raw material costs and integration risks are primary headwinds for the company as of now. Let us take a look at the other major factors that have been impeding Ecolab's growth trajectory. Various reports suggest that the Hurricanes dealt a heavy blow on all MedTech majors. Ecolab is no exception in this regard, with forced shut downs of three manufacturing plants in Houston area. Management at Ecolab estimates third-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share at the low end or slightly below the previously forecasted band of $1.36 to $1.44. For the full year, Ecolab expects adjusted earnings at the low end of the previously issued $4.70 to $4.90 range. Despite yielding stellar returns last year, in August, management at Ecolab announced that last quarter has been a quiet one for its Equipment Care business, which registered just 2% growth on a year-over-year basis.Adding to the woes, the segment ran short of manpower in the recent past. As a result, Ecolab announced plans to divest Equipment Care to Audax Private Equity. Growing in upper single digits, the segment witnessed strong sales of $180 million in 2016 (almost 1.4% of net sales).Diversified offerings like Equipment Care have lent Ecolab a competitive edge in the  so far. Although the divestiture plan would enhance the company's focus on core businesses, it is also likely to mar net revenues (read more:  ). The estimate revision trend for Ecolab has been unfavorable. For the full year, four analysts moved north compared to one movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, full-year estimates declined 1.5% to $4.73 per share.For the current quarter, two analysts moved north, compared to five movements in the opposite direction over the same time frame. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings dropped 4.2% to $1.36 per share. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). |  Ecolab's stock looks a bit overvalued at the moment. A comparative analysis of the company's forward P/E (F12M basis) ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause for investor concern. The ratio currently stands at 25.6, significantly stretched when compared with the S&P 500's P/E ratio of 18.6.Furthermore, the stock is overvalued when compared to peers. This is because the current P/E ratio (F12M basis) for the broader industry is at 18.8.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are SONOVA HOLDING  , IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  and Luminex Corporation  . SONOVA and Luminex sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while IDEXX Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see SONOVA represented a solid return of 14.5% over the last year.

The company's five-year historical growth rate is also favorable at 8.5% as compared to 0.8% of the broader industry and 2.8% of the S&P 500 index.Taking the stable stock performance into consideration, we expect Bruker to gain ground in the coming quarters.The 52-week high came on the back of several new developments, the most recent being the introduction of the new CE-IVD marked Fungiplex Candida fast diagnostic assay, a multiplex real-time PCR test for the rapid identification of the most common pathogens associated with invasive candidiasis. The company also introduced the CE-IVD marked MICRONAUT-AM (antimycotics) test plate for the automated or manual antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) of yeasts from cultures.Recently, Bruker introduced the timsTOF Pro system for PASEF mass spectrometry at the 16th Annual World Congress of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO). Also, Bruker announced the new D8 DISCOVER Plus X-ray diffraction (XRD) system at the Japan Analytical Scientific Instruments Show (JASIS).Bruker recently completed the buyout of MERLIN Diagnostika GmbH, located in Germany. MERLIN has specialized skills in products, services and consulting in the fields of antibiotic resistance testing (ART) and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST).

(Symbol: IDXX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $159.33, changing hands for $161.76/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 3 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $118.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $185.00. The standard deviation is $36.143.But the whole reason to look at the  IDXX price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with IDXX crossing above that average target price of $159.33/share, investors in IDXX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $159.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

At this platform, the company announced Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre in June 2017. Abbott also announced that the FreeStyle Libre system is now available for reimbursement in the U.K.On the flip side, Abbott's sluggish pediatric business in China continues to mar growth.

Henry Schein's agreement with DENTSPLY was initiated in August 2005.We feel that the deal extension is a smart move by DENTSPLY as the preexisting agreement did not include the CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system and the Schick line of imaging sensors. By including the aforementioned lines of products, the company will benefit from Henry Schein's distribution network in Canada.Among the recent developments, DENTSPLY announced the renewal of its partnership with Pacific Dental Services. The duo's latest agreement extends for a period of five years which was signed in 2012.This move is also a strategic one as Pacific Dental's network consists of over 580 centers across 17 states. During the tenure of the present agreement, management expects the number of such offices utilizing DENTSPLY technologies to exceed 800.DENTSPLY's dual branding strategy, product innovation, growth opportunities in emerging markets (especially Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa), diversified product portfolio and recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The company expects a solid guidance for full-year 2017 projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.65-$2.75.On the flip side, apart from a series of macroeconomic headwinds, currency fluctuation continues to be a major dampener. In fact, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against Euro and other emerging market currencies has dented the company's growth trajectory. Furthermore, higher capital expenditure on product development is expected to keep margins under pressure.DENTSPLY's estimate revision trend looks unfavorable at the moment. For the third quarter, two analysts moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months.

The life sciences industry has been quite slow in adopting cloud-based software as compared to other industries.However, we believe that the industry is gradually realizing the benefits of cloud-based applications, particularly due to rising regulations and budgetary constraints.

The President's latest 'Executive Order' that aims to exempt certain Association health plans to buy health insurance from the core Obamacare schedule, can take the shape of a serious threat for the healthcare community at large.

In fact, the latest GOP defeat dampens probabilities of a new Republican healthcare reform with better tax paradigms, any time soon.Here we take a sneak peek into two other burning issues that are likely to impact the quarterly numbers in the MedTech fraternity. At present, the point of focus at the Capitol Hill seems to be tax cuts. The MedTech community had been quite hopeful since the change in presidential power, as Trump's proposed policies have been in favor of the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Undoubtedly, abolition of these tax paradigms are far from being achieved.Added to this, a stronger dollar, pricing and shipping-related issues as well as core market challenges are likely to affect the quarterly numbers of MedTech majors this season. Various reports suggest that the unfortunate occurrences of the hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Medtronic acknowledged the impact of the Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.Apart from the natural calamities, a rise in unemployment (though short lived) and decline in consumer income coupled with increasing aggregate spending are likely to deal a heavy blow to MedTech numbers.We have taken the help of the  to shortlist MedTech stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and are expected to yield solid results in the third quarter.

JOTEC - a privately-held maker of technologically advanced endovascular stent grafts and cardiac and vascular surgical grafts focused on aortic repair. The company has been recording revenue CAGR of 17% over the last five years.Under the financial terms of the agreement, CryoLife will pay an aggregate of up to $225 million for the deal, with around $168.75 million in cash and $56.25 million in shares of CryoLife's common stock issued to JOTEC's shareholders. The buyout is slated to complete later in 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.Through this deal, CryoLife aims at expanding the existing portfolio with products focused on aortic surgery, thereby solidifying its footprint in the fast-growing endovascular surgical market.Per management, this deal will help CryoLife diversify its business by gaining access to the $2-billion  for stent grafts used in endovascular and open repair of aortic diseases. The market is projected to value around $2.5 billion by 2021. Interestingly, CryoLife aims at delivering consistent, high single-digit revenue growth through this deal.The deal is also in line with the company's strategy to directly sell by eliminating distributors in Europe while creating cross-selling opportunities for the company's product portfolios. In the last reported quarter, CryoLife began the process of direct selling in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, expanding direct operations in Europe.At the same time, management expects the newly-added products to continue to post double-digit growth outside the United States for at least the next five years. Moreover, the deal is expected to prove accretive to the company's non-GAAP EPS at a CAGR of not less than 20% over the next five years, while contributing to gross and operating margin.CryoLife expects to gain access to the $1.2-billion U.S. stent graft market, which is projected to value roughly $1.5 billion by 2021 through the newly gained, highly competitive product portfolio and advanced research and development platform. Thus, the company expects this deal to drive growth through 2018 as well.CryoLife also provided a sneak peek into its preliminary third-quarter results.

This fact is further substantiated by a Research and Markets report published by Nasdaq. Per the report, the global aortic aneurysm market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 6.6% between 2017 and 2023.

Cardiac & Vascular Group (''CVG''),  Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (''MITG''), Restorative Therapies Group (''RTG'') and Diabetes Group - in Puerto Rico. While the facilities are gradually getting operative since Oct 2, the sites are only partially active at present on power supply from back-up generators.With considerable repairing done, the company expects the normal manufacturing process to get fully restored in the coming weeks.Medtronic has provided a statement on the company's financial health badly hurt by Maria and further affecting the overall business. Notably, in line with business continuity protocols, the company is utilizing the existing inventory levels and increasing manufacturing processes in locations outside Puerto Rico for multiple products.Medtronic projects both fiscal second-quarter 2018 revenue and adjusted net earnings to show the impact to the extent of $250 million. More specifically, the MITG and the RTG groups are expected to be worst hit. Notably, this quarter will close on Oct 27, 2017.Significantly, the company forecasts some non-recurring expenses, directly related to recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, which will be excluded from adjusted earnings. However, expenses related to the effects outside Puerto Rico will be considered operating expenses.Incidentally, Medtronic is lacks enough visibility about the impact of Maria, post the second quarter. However, forecasting a strong new product demand, particularly in the CVG and Diabetes Group, the company continues to expect mid-single digit revenue growth (on a comparable, constant currency basis) in the second half of fiscal 2018.Despite the Maria-related impact, the company reaffirmed the fiscal second quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 guidances.Among the company's many supports toward disaster management, the Medtronic Foundation has directed $1 million for disaster relief to date and is matching employee contributions to authorized agencies.Over the last three months, Medtronic has been observed to underperform the broader  .

A glimpse at the price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergen's shares have lost 13.0%, comparing unfavorably with the 3.7% gain of the industry it belongs to.The unfavorable performance was led by pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2017 revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, significantly lower than the previous range of 6.5% to 8% band. The company expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen took over PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015.

Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends the company a competitive advantage in the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind for the business in fiscal 2017.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. AmerisourceBergen witnessed a negative revenue impact from declining sales at the segment in the last reported second quarter. Revenues improved only 4% to $37.1 billion in the quarter, which might have been around 5.5% without the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an additional concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company's primary competitors are national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is witnessing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges.

AngioDynamics expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of 64 cents to 68 cents. Revenues are projected in the range of $352 million to $359 million. Furthermore, free cash flow is expected to be more than $35 million.It is important to note that foreign exchange did not have any impact in the reported quarter. However, continued softness in the Vascular Access and Venous business affected revenues in the first quarter.Growth in the core Angiographic Catheter business is also likely to fortify the company's footprint in the global space. Angiographic business falls under the company's Peripheral Vascular (PV) segment. We believe that AngioVac is a key growth driver for the PV segment. Management expects the 'Thrombus Management' platform in the PV product line to lend competitive advantage and open up significant long-term opportunities.However, AngioDynamics ended the first quarter with an outstanding debt of $96.3 million.

This development was expected at the heels of last month's major asset divestment initiative by the company. The whopping $1.045 billion purchase has been considered a major breakthrough for Integra as it will provide the company with global reach in Neurosurgery, thus connoting the core expertise within the company's Specialty Surgical Solutions.Integra expects to complete the said asset divestment soon that forms part of certain closing conditions toward the Codman acquisition. Notably, Integra has signed a definitive agreement to sell the company's certain neurosurgery assets to healthcare products and services provider, Natus Medical Incorporated  , for a total deal value of $47.5 million.The company has also decided to sell the global Camino ICP monitoring product line, including its San Diego manufacturing facility, to Natus Medical. Additionally, Natus will get hold of the U.S. rights related to Integra's fixed pressure shunts as well as the U.S. rights to Codman's DURAFORM dural graft implant, standard EVD catheters and CSF collection systems.Earlier, while announcing the set of divestitures to Natus, Integra had discussed its imminent financial impact. Per the company, in 2016, approximately $50 million of revenues were earned from the neurosurgery product lines associated with these divestitures. Taking net of divestitures and the Codman acquisition into account, the company on a preliminary basis, estimated fourth-quarter 2017 revenue contribution of approximately $60-$65 million. For full-year 2018, Integra expects Codman Neurosurgery to contribute between $290 million and $300 million in revenue and net of divestitures.Overall, the Codman Neurosurgery business is anticipated to remain accretive toward Integra's 2018 adjusted earnings per share and contribute at least 22 cents. However, for full-year 2017, Integra expects minimal contribution from Codman Neurosurgery to adjusted earnings per share. | Per Integra, Codman Neurosurgery's existing portfolio and new product pipeline in advanced hydrocephalus, neuro-critical care and electrosurgery are going to complement the acquirer's leading products and pipeline in tissue ablation, dural repair and cranial stabilization. Post the closure of this buyout, the consolidated portfolio will offer complete solutions for neurosurgery and the scale to invest as well as bring in new technologies to the table for patients worldwide.Notably, per a report by Radiant Insights, the global neurosurgery market is projected to witness an estimated CAGR of around 10-12% during 2015-2019. Taking into consideration this huge growth prospect, we believe, Integra's initiative to strengthen foothold in this particular niche area is well-timed.Overall, Integra has been consistently trading above the broader  in the last six months.

In this context, Quest Diagnostics had acquired the outreach laboratory service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, in 2016.We are also highly optimistic about the company's focus on its two-point strategy. According to Quest Diagnostics, its planned divestiture of the Focus Diagnostics products business is part of its strategy to refocus on diagnostic information services.Additionally, several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks have turned out to be major growth drivers. In this regard, we are looking forward to the company's deal with Walmart. Particularly, the company is positive about its recent agreement with PeaceHealth in the Pacific Northwest, which is expected to bolster growth in 2017.

However, continued softness in the Vascular Access and Venous business affected revenues in the first quarter.Internationally, AngioDynamics registered revenues of $16.5 million, up from $15.9 million in the year-ago quarter. International growth was strengthened by solid sales from the Oncology and Surgery business. However, the company registered $68.9 million revenues in the United States, down from $72.2 million on a year-over-year basis. The lackluster performance was led by softness in the venous business, which was more or less muted by growth in the oncology portfolio. |  Sales at this segment totaled $49.9 million in the reported quarter, lower than $52 million in the year-ago quarter.The quarter saw slow growth in the venous and core businesses, which was offset by stellar performance in fluid management and thrombus management product lines.Despite the disappointing performance in the PV segment, management expects the thrombus management platform to lend the company a competitive edge and open up significant long-term opportunities.We note that AngioDynamics is a leading player in the thrombolytic catheters space (catheter directed thrombolysis). The company boasts highly unique catheters like Uni-Fuse, SpeedLyser and Pulse Spray under the thrombus portfolio.

Per Abbott's latest update, with all the necessary regulatory clearances getting fulfilled for the closure, the company finally plans to complete the hugely contentious acquisition of Alere, Inc., on Oct 3, 2017.Notably, after a year's rollercoaster ride to overcome the regulatory hurdles, both Abbott and Alere had progressed with the merger process based on certain amended terms of the original agreement.Per the amended agreement clauses (announced earlier in April), Abbott has agreed to pay $51 per common share to acquire Alere, a reduction from the earlier deal of $56 per common share in cash upon the transaction's conclusion. This results in an expected, new equity value of approximately $5.3 billion, lower than the originally estimated equity value of almost $5.8 billion.Abbott has stated that with the successful wrap up of this transaction, its total diagnostics sales should be $7 billion. The company also anticipates to emerge a lead player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space within the broader $50 billion in-vitro diagnostics market with this takeover. The combined entity is expected to generate approximately $2.5 billion in point of care testing sales worldwide.The buyout would also enable the company to gain an access to new channels and geographies, including entries into fast growing outlets, such as doctors' offices, clinics, pharmacies and at-home testing. More to that, Alere's complementary portfolio of diagnostic products, comprising tests for infections such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue will be added to Abbott's portfolio. Significantly, Alere develops simple, rapid tests, including Alere i - the molecular test for flu and strep - to deliver reports in less than 15 minutes.Hence, the shared business will offer several options of tests in a broad array, for instance, infectious disease, molecular, cardiometabolic and toxicology testings. Also, this union would definitely expand Abbott Labs' platforms to include benchtop and rapid strep tests. Although Alere would hitherto generate over half its total sales from the United States alone, the company has a growing presence in key international markets with potential to strengthen Abbott's footprint ahead in these territories.Over the past three months, Abbott's share price has outperformed the broader  it belongs to.

The company's four strategic business units (SBU) delivered better-than-expected performance on significant contributions from Biologics and Spine Fixation.Per management, the strength in the Biologics and Spine Fixation businesses is expected to continue on the back of improved performance by sales partners, expanded distributorship network and introduction of products.Moreover, Orthofix seems to be upbeat on the encouraging response received from the Spinal-Stim and Cervical-Stim bone growth therapy devices launched earlier in 2017.

The needles offer comfortable injection experience, enhancing customer satisfaction. The device is slated for distribution this month.Coming back to the news, BD and Euroclone plan to launch these molecular assays outside of the United States from 2018.The molecular assays leverage on the company's flagship platform BD MAX System to detect infectious genital mycoplasmas, including Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species, which are generally unidentifiable by the conventional methods. However, the assays are currently not available for sale in the United States.Per management, the addition of these assays to the existing BD MAX portfolio along with the company's other assays like BD SurePath and the BD Onclarity HPV assay is likely fortify the company's foothold in clinical laboratories for testing STI.Share prices of BD inched up 0.5% to close at $194 following the news release.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past month, McKesson has been trading above the broader  . Per the last trading price, the stock has gained 2.6%, higher than the broader market's gain of 2.3%. The company continues to witness strong growth in pharma and biotech backed by solid market fundamentals and planned growth strategy. The raised 2017 guidance is also encouraging.McKesson delivered disappointing results in the recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter saw strong performance by the Distribution Solutions segment. The segment is expected to remain consistent with its performance in fiscal 2018 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. To boost growth, the company recently acquired CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion.Coming to guidance, the Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to witness robust growth on a year-over-year basis. The upside is expected to be driven by market growth and acquisitions. McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share of $7.10-$9.00 for the fiscal ending Mar 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings for the same period are expected in the range of $11.80-$12.50 per diluted share.On the flipside, pricing pressure in the independent retail pharmacy channel is a headwind. McKesson entered fiscal 2018 with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single digits and its first quarter slightly surpassed expectations.McKesson has been witnessing increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes. The company continues to witness a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the United States. However, it expects to overcome the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018.Cutthroat competition in the niche markets, currency headwinds and reimbursement issues remain challenges.The estimate revision trend for McKesson has been unfavorable at the moment. For the current quarter, six analysts moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, magnitude of full-year estimates fell 4.8% to $2.76.A few better-ranked medical stocks in the medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation  , Lantheus Holdings, Inc  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc  .

HSBC, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley have all noted a trading pattern breakdown - a signal to get out soon - according to  . Source: ShutterstockMorgan Stanley's chief strategist Andrew Sheets  \"low macro and micro correlations confirm the idea that we're in a late-cycle environment, and it's no accident that the last time we saw readings this low was 2005-07.\"In this environment, investors need to find the toughest stocks that can withstand a downward shift in the market. I looked for five stocks that all have a 'Strong Buy' rating from the Street's best analysts. These are the analysts with the highest success rate and average return according to leading financial accountability engine  .Following only the top analysts provides a degree of reassurance in volatile times that you can trust the analyst you are following. For example, I checked that the price target from top analysts provided compelling upside for the stock in question. At the same time, I also looked specifically for stocks that have the capability to keep outperforming in a downturn. This can be because of the nature of the industry, say healthcare, or because of the glowing fundamentals of the stock itself.Now let's dig down further into the five toughest stocks to buy to withstand a downturn: (NASDAQ:  ) - the inclusion of this biopharma in a tough stocks list right now may come as something of a surprise.Only a few days ago, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it is placing five trials on partial clinical hold and one trial on full clinical hold in the Celgene Fusion program. The trials are testing  (NYSE:  ) Imfinzi (durvalumab) for the treatment of blood cancers.But even with this setback, CELG remains a 'Strong Buy' stock with over 8% upside potential from the current share price. The stock provides strong growth potential at an inexpensive price. This year alone, Celgene is predicting sales will hit the $13 billion mark, rising to $21 billion over the next three years. It also has the support of an impressive pipeline of oncology products covering over fifty compounds as well as key catalyst ozanimod for multiple sclerosis.Top Oppenheimer analyst  is still bullish on CELG's outlook. He reiterated his buy rating on Sept. 7 with a $175 price target (24% upside). Crucially, his price target does not factor in any projections for the drug trials on hold/partial hold. Instead Cann tells investors:\"Today's announcement has no impact to our outlook. Should these studies demonstrate benefit in later, registrational studies, they would be growth drivers for Celgene in the post 2021 setting. We believe these holds are due to caution on the part of FDA, resulting from recent issues with other checkpoint inhibitors not associated with Celgene, and the Celgene studies will likely resume.\"Yes, Chinese giant  (NYSE:  ) is a consumer stock. And yes, traditionally consumer stocks are hit hard during a downturn.But if there is one tough consumer stock out there, it's Alibaba. Indeed, even when China's economy slowed down during 2016, Alibaba revenues continued to soar. BABA benefits both from the increase in digital shopping, and from selling some of the cheapest products in the market.This model has certainly won the Street's backing. In the last three months, BABA has received an impressive 12 back-to-back buy ratings from top analysts. No sell or hold ratings. These analysts predict that the stock has further upside potential of 8.5%.MKM Partners'  goes one step further. He says BABA can reach $220 as it has the best fundamentals out of all the internet mega caps. His $43 price target increase is a reflection of \"50 percent organic growth in the segment, strong secular trends, dominant market position and [a] 60-percent margin while funding significant investments.\"You may not know it but The Pet Passion index, Motif Investing's tracker of pet-related companies, returned 19% from August 2016 to August 2017.In contrast, the  grew by 8.5% in the same time period. And this trend isn't just for the good times. In previous recessions, pet spending continued to rise even while overall consumer spending fell.One key company to benefit from the influx of money is  (NASDAQ:  ) a veterinary diagnostics company. It has a 'Strong Buy' analyst consensus rating and upside potential of 13% from the current share price. Merrill Lynch's  recently upgraded the stock from hold to buy with a $175 price target. If Idexx is a dog, it would be a 'top dog' says de Bruin who likes IDXX's long-term target of 10% organic revenue growth.Meanwhile, five-star Canaccord Genuity analyst  applauds the stock's \"multi-pronged growth drivers.\" He comments \"We continue to believe that IDXX' positioning is dominant and hardly rivaled, in the backdrop of robust global vet demand that we think lasts for at least another two years.\" Massaro has a $180 price target on the stock (13% upside).Payment processing giant  (NYSE:  ) is one of the strongest payment companies out there. As the world increasingly moves away from cash and towards digital payments, MA stands to reap the rewards.Shares have been rising steadily over the year and they are now trading around record highs of $142. Meanwhile the stock has an impressive 'Strong Buy' analyst consensus rating. In the last three months, 10 top analysts have published buy ratings on the stock with just one hold rating.Encouragingly, the most bullish analyst on the stock is Nomura's  . And Carcache has one of the best track records with his Mastercard ratings. Across his 17 MA ratings, he has a 94% success rate and 30.5% average return. He believes that the stock can soar all the way to $163 - 14.4% upside from the current share price.According to Carcache, Mastercard's $920 million acquisition of London-based VocaLink will double the company's total market opportunity. As well as processing about 90% of all U.K. salaries, investors are also keeping an eye on VocaLink's immediate ACH payments services. Analysts believe the service, scheduled to go live in the U.S. this year, has big global potential. By continuing to gain market share, MA also ensures that it can keep growing even if the payment space slows down.Interestingly, if we flick through the stock's analytics we can see further evidence that the stock has strong market support. For example, hedge fund managers have a 'Very Positive' sentiment on Mastercard with big-name investors flocking to the stock. See, for example, Steve Mandel and Tom Russo who have MA positions worth $1.16 billion and $563 million respectively.Healthcare stocks are always a good pick in a downturn and biopharma  (NASDAQ:  ) has had a phenomenal year.Shares in INCY have gained over $40 in the year, and the stock is now trading at nearly $120. The good news is that the Street predicts that Incyte still has serious growth potential. Top analysts have an average analyst price target on the stock of $150. This is just over 22% from the current share price. We can also see how, in the last three months, six out of seven top analysts have a bullish sentiment on INCY's outlook.Take, for example, five-star BMO Capital analyst  . He reiterated his INCY buy rating on Sept. 11 with a $163 price target (32% upside potential). Somaiya reviewed the results of a trial of Incyte's epacadostat, its selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor, in combination with  (NYSE:  ) Keytruda, to treat advanced melanoma. He says the promising results \"assures its commercial success.\"\"We are adding significantly to the efficacy profile of Keytruda, but we are not significantly adding to the toxicity burden. That seems to be the takeaway,\" an Incyte spokesman said. Keytruda recorded worldwide sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of the year.And it isn't just the Street that is optimistic on INCY. Incyte has the thumbs up from hedge funds, financial bloggers and corporate insiders. For example, in the last five months there have been three insider buy transactions and no insider sales. And if this wasn't enough, the stock also has a Strong Positive news sentiment on the back of the trial data release.Which stocks are the top 25 analysts recommending right now?  .The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" expects fiscal 2018 first-quarter revenues to be affected by the devastating Harvey and Irma hurricanes.

However, taking effects of the hurricanes into account, the company anticipates a drop in first-quarter 2018 revenues from the previously guided range.According to Cardiovascular Systems, more than 15% of the company's revenues are generated from the Houston and Florida.The hurricanes have dented procedure volumes in the greater Houston area and throughout Florida. Moreover, fiscal first quarter revenues are more heavily weighted in September because procedure volumes start to pick up from summer levels. Thus, the company is not confident about meeting the previously guided range for first-quarter revenues.Though management expects the short-term performance to be affected, the long-term prospects are likely to be untarnished.In the majority of the last year, Cardiovascular Systems has been trading above the broader  .

The company is expected to maintain focus on exclusive technology that offers superior outcome and economic value to the U.S. healthcare system. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Strong demand for the company's BioFlo platform continues to drive sales for AngioDynamics. AngioDynamics' expanding product portfolio, international market expansion and cost-saving initiatives represent considerable growth opportunities. The company designs, manufactures and sells a wide range of medical, surgical and diagnostic devices.The exclusive Endexo technology in BioFlo is expected to enhance the company's growth trajectory. In fact, the new BioFlo Midline catheter feature has gained significant traction within a short span of time owing to its easy insertion procedure and ability to effectively draw blood.Apart from BioFlo, AngioDynamics is a leading player in the thrombolytic catheters space (catheter directed thrombolysis) as well. The company boasts unique catheters like Uni-Fuse, SpeedLyser and Pulse Spray under the thrombus portfolio.On the flipside, AngioDynamics has a high debt levels. This is likely to impose certain operating and financial restrictions, impeding the company's core business initiatives. The company ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with $97.5 million in debt.Notably, if the company's operating results or capital resources prove inadequate, it may face substantial liquidity problems and would be forced to dispose of material assets or operations to meet its debt obligations. Additionally, the company might also be required to reduce or delay planned expansion and capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure or refinance its debt or seek additional equity capital.A sluggish capital-spending environment, third-party risks and pricing headwinds due to aggressive competition and regulatory setbacks are also expected to dent top-line growth.The company yielded a return of almost 6.7% over the last year. The current level is significantly below the S&P 500's 3.9% over the same time frame. Furthermore, the current level is lower than the broader  's gain of 8.1%.

In the second quarter of 2017, the company recorded solid contributions from China, India and the Middle East. We are also upbeat about the company's recent opening of a Center of Excellence for electron microscopy in Saudi Arabia.Additionally, Thermo Fisher has a strong cash balance that enables it to adopt attractive share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, Thermo Fisher derives majority of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency.

Following last week's announcement of Vertera Spine buyout, the company is once again in news, courtesy the commercial launch of its LessRay software technology system.Per NuVasive, this LessRay system is based on a propriety software algorithm and hardware components. It particularly works to help address overexposure to radiation in hospital operating rooms (O.R.), mostly in the case of minimally invasive spine surgery (MIS).Per study results provided by the company, spine and orthopedic surgeons receive lifetime occupational radiation limit within the first 10 years of their career. Statistics reveal that cancer rates and contraction of cataracts associated with radiation exposure are nearly double compared with other surgery practices.NuVasive claims that LessRay system's proprietary image enhancement technology improves low-dose, low-radiation fluoroscopy images to derive similar diagnostic capabilities as those of conventional full-dose fluoroscopy. This will accordingly reduce radiation emission and exposure in the O.R. while retaining the high resolution of a full radiation dose shot.NuVasive considers this breakthrough an important milestone in healthcare facilities as it begins to sell capital equipment and brings in technology advancements to the hospital O.R. Apart from curbing radiation exposure, this LessRay system enhances imaging capability to improve spine surgery productivity and eventually, predictability.Taking into consideration the healthy pipeline of interests from customers, NuVasive expects a huge customer adoption rate following the launch of LessRay system.Notably, NuVasive is leaving no stone unturned to capture the rapidly-evolving spine market. During the recently-reported second quarter of 2017, the company's core U.S. spinal hardware business maintained the bullish trend by reporting 3% growth. The upside was driven by a strong consistent adoption of ReLine posterior fixation system within the company's iGA platform. The company also witnessed a steady uptake of its recently launched expandable interbody cages and base TI interfixated within the ALIF procedure.With the latest acquisition of Vertera Spine, NuVasive aims to market and distribute Vetera Spine's FDA-approved COHERE Cervical and COALESCETM Lumbar Interbody fusion devices in the United States.

It has rallied 10% in six months' time, ahead of the S&P 500's 4.8% gain. The stock has a market cap of $882.30 million.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick now.The company's estimate revision trend for the current year has also been positive. In the past 30 days, one estimate has gone upward for Luminex, while none moving downward during the same time period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up to 40 cents from 36 cents over the same time frame.Let's find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Luminex's second quarter witnessed strong top-line performance, solid cash flow and soaring profits. The company's Assay business is likely to be its key growth driver over the long term. Notably, revenues in the quarter increased as high as 19.2% year over year.Further, Luminex reiterated its 2017 annual revenue guidance to the band of $300-$310 million. This depicts year-over-year growth of 11-14%.Following a strong revenue performance in the second quarter, Luminex recently announced plans to collaborate with Sutter Health, in a bid to bolster its molecular diagnostic testing portfolio. This collaboration is anticipated to enhance the company's patient care techniques, especially in cases of Cystic Fibrosis, gastrointestinal illness and respiratory tract infections.Also, late in July, Luminex received the FDA clearance for the ARIES C. difficile Assay. This is a moderate complexity, sample to answer test for rapid detection of C. difficile.However, stiff competition in the Life-sciences industry, stretched valuation and reimbursement issues are challenges for the stock.Other top-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation  , Lantheus Holdings, Inc.  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  .

The award has been conferred on DaVita's CA-based facility, also known as Casa PacifiCA building.Notably, the LEED Gold certification is exclusively granted to buildings situated in sustainable sites with strong water, energy, atmosphere, materials and resource efficiencies. Additionally, these buildings should operate under a superior indoor environment and must show innovation in design and regional priority credits. Undoubtedly, DaVita's Casa PacifiCA building is a solid choice based on the aforementioned criteria.In an initiative to bolster DaVita's 2020 environmental goals, the company's operations are conducted in a healthy environment and DaVita is solely committed to improve health care in the United States without violating the basic environmental norms. In this regard, 75% of Casa PacifiCA's construction waste was diverted from landfills.DaVita has had an unfavorable run on the bourse in the last six months. The stock has lost almost 13.4%, much wider than the broader  's decline of just 4.5%. The current level also substantially underperforms the S&P 500's gain of roughly 4.8%. This deterioration is largely due to the ongoing political conundrum in the U.S. medical world that had initiated since the Presidential elections. High debt levels, adverse effects of healthcare reforms and escalating expenses are other major stock dampeners.The estimate revision trend has been favorable for the company. In the current quarter, two estimates moved north compared with two movements in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the ongoing quarter has inched up 1.1% to 94 cents per share during the same time frame. DaVita carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the full year, six estimates moved upward compared with two downward movements. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year has increased 1.4% to $3.54 per share over the same period.DaVita's environment-friendly operations are likely to enhance the company's sustainable growth in the long haul. In fact, DaVita's Denver-based headquarters were awarded with the LEED Platinum Certification by the USGBC for operations and maintenance efficiencies only last year.Davita's significant growth in recent times was reflected on the back of strong patient services. Last quarter the company saw solid improvement in Kidney care. DaVita also made crucial efforts to control expenses. The company's strength basically lies in enhanced service offerings. A compelling inorganic growth story supported by a strong financial position is the key development catalyst at the moment.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.  , IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  and Cogentix Medical, Inc.  .Notably, Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while IDEXX Laboratories and Cogentix Medical have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This can be performed locally by laboratory partners as well as hospitals globally. Biocartis is an innovative molecular diagnostics company providing next generation diagnostic solutions.According to Genomic Health, the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test evaluates the activity of 21 genes in a patient's breast tumor tissue. This provides customized treatment options based on the biology of the patients' individual disease. The company claims this to be the only proven test to predict chemotherapy benefit. Consequently, this is included in all major cancer guidelines worldwide. Further, the test is considered standard of care for early-stage breast cancer.Biocartis' Idylla platform provides a unique solution that is unparalleled in the localization of complex molecular diagnostics. Based on the advanced features of the Idylla platform, Genomic Health expects local pathology labs to generate Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score results with minimal labor and efficient turnaround time. The company also looks forward to maintaining the high quality and clinical utility that physicians and patients expect from Oncotype DX.This agreement will provide Genomic Health rights to develop and commercialize Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test on the Idylla platform. The development of the Oncotype DX IVD test is expected to initiate in late 2017. Genomic Health is anticipated to pay around $3.3 million to Biocartis in the third quarter of 2017. Rest of the payments will be made to Biocartis after achieving few commercial milestones.Excluding the transaction cost of the partnership, Genomic Health continues to anticipate earning profits in full year 2017. Per the agreement, the company will make royalty payments based on net sales of the IVD tests developed on the Biocartis Idylla platform, post commercialization.In September, Genomic Health announced that new data shows additional evidence of the unmatched value of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Scoretest in predicting outcomes in early-stage breast cancer patients accurately.In July, majority of panelists from the St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference Expert Panel supported that Oncotype DX was the only test providing information that aided physicians in taking the decision to omit chemotherapy in patients with up to three positive nodes. The panel also published updated guidelines endorsing Oncotype DX for guiding chemotherapy treatment decisions in both node-negative and node-positive breast cancer patients.In June, five studies in breast cancer were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (\"ASCO\") Annual Meeting, including new analyses from the tie ups with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results or SEER Registry program. The study focused on outcomes of more than 49,000 women who have received an Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test. One of these analyses examines the risk of breast cancer-specific mortality across the full range of Recurrence Score results and is consistent with previous validation studies.According to a report by GBI Research, the global breast cancer therapeutics market is estimated to reach $17.2 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 7.3%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest agreement is a strategical fit.In the past year, Genomic Health has been trading above the broader  .

The company's impressive results in second-quarter 2017 with both earnings and revenues significantly improving year over year have bolstered market confidence leading to a further rally in share price.We are encouraged by the company's long-term strategy to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to a one focused on bringing home a continuum of care to serve patients better and diversify sources of payment and become less reliant on Medicare.Moreover, the company has been witnessing growth in the personal care segment on synergies from acquisitions. The company recently made a number of strategic acquisitions - the recent one being that of Intercity Home Carein Massachusetts which is slated for close on Oct 1.The home health industry is poised for substantial growth in the long term, driven by the positive demographic trend in the United States. The company is expected to continue to benefit from the aging demographics of the U.S. population and higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment.Notably, the company is on track to fortify its footprint in the market place. Recently, it announced the completion of National Readmission Prevention Collaborative (''NRPC'') certification program by clinical programs team which handles home healthcare programs.Additionally, the company's strong cash balance position bolsters our confidence in the stock.On the flip side, we expect synergies from the Tenet Healthcare acquisition may escalate costs and operating expenses weighing on the company's margins.

This NJ-based company is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company.Over the last six months, Phibro has been trading above the  industry. Currently, the stock has gained 28.5% compared to 9.4% of the broader industry. We are encouraged to note that outside the United States, Phibro's has extended its reach to Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Asia Pacific, Russia and Africa. This we feel will help the company counter competition.The company continues to invest in the Far East Asia where the poultry and dairy industries are expected to grow exponentially. Currently, the company is expanding its dairy business in the markets of Australia, Brazil and Mexico. We believe that despite the turmoil in the economies of Russia, Greece, Brazil and China, Phibro has performed quite well and has the potential to maintain its performance.Meanwhile, Phibro ended the fiscal fourth quarter on a solid note with both net sales and adjusted earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the year-over-year increase in both the counts is encouraging.Further, the company witnessed year-over-year improvement across all segments. We are also encouraged by the expansion in the gross and operating margin in the reported quarter. Moreover, on a full-year basis, adjusted earnings and net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well with year-over-year increases in both. Meanwhile, the company has provided its fiscal 2018 guidance for net sales and adjusted earnings.On the flip side, Phibro operates in highly competitive industries. With respect to its major products, it faces threat from a substantial number of global and regional players. Phibro's competitive position is principally based on product registrations, customer service and support, breadth of product line, product quality, manufacturing technology, facility location, and product prices.Furthermore, withdrawal of approval for Mecadox (carbadox) by the FDA continues is a concern. Additionally, Phibro conducts operations globally, which entails transactions in a variety of currencies.

This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company's price performance. Efficiency or the company's ability to transform its inputs into outputs is an important measure to determine its financial condition.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory is considered to be one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining weak sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4-quarter average of total assets. Like the above two ratios, high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control its operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.In addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 16.Here are four stocks from the 16 that made it through the screen: (Nasdaq:  -  ) is a designer, distributor and retailer of athletic apparel.

The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).It is encouraging to note that IDEXX continues to demonstrate solid global growth on potent international expansion. International revenues in the last-reported second quarter of 2017 grew in high single digits, driven by an 11% organic rise in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues and 12.3% gains in Water business. This indicated continued consumable revenue gains supported by a strong Catalyst instrument customer base and average testing utilization.IDEXX derives the lion's share of revenues from its Companion Animal Group segment (CAG). In the second quarter, CAG organic revenues rose low double digits on a year-over-year basis, supported by CAG Diagnostics recurring organic as well as CAG instrument revenue growth. We believe management's innovation-based global strategy is leading to growth in CAG Diagnostics.Also, IDEXX recently announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technological applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flipside, over the last six months, IDEXX has been trading below the broader  with respect to share price movement.

This $1.1-billion cash transaction will bolster Cooper Companies' CooperSurgical (CSI) business in the contraceptive device market. Share price of Cooper Companies inched up 0.2% to close at $253.39 following the news.However, the acquired business line is exclusively operated in Teva Pharmaceutical's manufacturing facility in Buffalo, NY.Cooper Companies expects the acquisition to prove accretive to earnings per share by 70-75 cents within the first year of the deal. Furthermore, excluding acquisition related costs, the transaction is expected to boost Cooper Companies' gross and operating margin as well.Per management, the U.S. intrauterine device market is worth $1 billion and is expected to multiply in the mid-single digits, with PARAGARD being the only approved non-hormonal intrauterine device in this space.Cooper Companies is well positioned to benefit from the expanding CSI product portfolio. Management believes that long-term growth at CSI will be driven by the fertility segment where the company has gained a strong foothold, courtesy of the Reprogenetics, Genesis and Recombine buyouts. Moreover, these purchases expand the company's international presence by opening up opportunities in the markets of Spain, the U.K., Japan, Peru, South America, the UAE, South Africa, Jordan and Taiwan.In the last reported quarter, CSI revenues jumped 4% at constant currency (cc) to $118.7 million on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal 2017, management trimmed its revenue guidance for the CSI segment. CSI revenues are now projected in the range of $459-$462 million, significantly lower than the previous range of $465-$470 million.Over the past six months, Cooper Companies has gained 30.3%, comparing favorably with the broader industry's addition of 7.6%.

This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company's price performance. Efficiency or the company's ability to transform its inputs into outputs is an important measure to determine its financial condition.Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory is considered to be one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining weak sales, which resulted in excess inventory. This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers. This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4-quarter average of total assets. Like the above two ratios, high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient. This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control its operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.In addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 16.Here are four stocks from the 16 that made it through the screen: is a designer, distributor and retailer of athletic apparel.

(Symbol: IDXX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $159.33, changing hands for $160.23/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 3 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $118.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $185.00. The standard deviation is $36.143.But the whole reason to look at the  IDXX price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with IDXX crossing above that average target price of $159.33/share, investors in IDXX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $159.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Idexx Laboratories, Inc.:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

Improvement in average net Medicare reimbursement rate and an increase in average daily census during the recently-reported second quarter were encouraging.The raised outlook for both Roto-Rooter segment and earnings per share is indicative of the company's anticipated improved operating results in the upcoming quarters, which in turn boosts investors' optimism on the stock.Notably, Chemed's VITAS business had been in trouble over the past few quarters due to certain admission coding changes initiated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). However, management noted the recent admission trends to be positive and that should continue in the coming quarters as well.In terms of Roto-Rooter business, the company continues to display a robust performance on the strength of core plumbing and drain cleaning service segments. It also prompted a solid rise in water restoration. Management increased expectations to achieve Roto-Rooter full-year 2017 revenue growth of 12-13%, much higher than the earlier projected range of 3-4%. Revenue estimates are based on increased job pricing of approximately 2% and continued growth in water restoration services.However, headwinds like reimbursement-related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate pose challenges for Chemed. Also, a tweaked guidance for Medicare Cap billing limitations is a matter of concern.A few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation  , Lantheus Holdings, Inc.  and IDEXX Laboratories  .

Banking on the solid performance in the last quarter, Inogen raised its 2017 revenue and adjusted net income guidance. Moreover, the company narrowed its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance.Inogen projects revenues in the range of $239 million to $243 million, higher than the previous range of $233 million to $239 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 17.8%-19.8%, up from the previous range of 14.9%-17.8%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $48 million-$50 million, compared to $46 million-$50 million estimated earlier. This represents an increase of 10.6% to 15.2% as compared with the year-ago quarter's 6%-15.2%. Inogen expects adjusted net income in the range of $25 million-$27 million, up from the previous band of $22 million-$24 million. Notably, Inogen has a market cap of $1.99 billion. The company's direct-to-customer business model has lent it a leading position in the oxygen therapy market. The direct-to-consumer model gives companies an opportunity to build a unique brand relationship directly with customers. In an initiative to support growth in the direct-to-consumer line of business, the company had announced that it has secured an additional facility in the Cleveland, OH area. Inogen reported a stellar second quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. Solid domestic and international business-to-business sales drove revenues. In fact, the company expects direct-to-consumer sales to be its fastest growing channel, followed by domestic business-to-business sales in the coming quarters, with solid focus on Europe. Inogen develops, manufactures and markets portable oxygen concentrators (POC). The company recently announced the receipt of EC Certificate for the Inogen One G4 platform, which will be available for sale in select international countries. We believe an expanding Long-Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) market, advantages of POCs over traditional delivery model, direct-to-customer business model, underpenetrated international markets and expanding product portfolio are key growth catalysts.

Over the past month, current and next quarter earnings estimates have increased 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively. Moreover, Cooper reported earnings which have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 4.8%.The company's leading position in the market of specialty lenses was also supported by highly exclusive products of Biofinity and Clariti. In fact, its flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to deliver strong sales in the coming quarters. The company has also initiated the process of introducing MyDay lenses in the domestic market. It is already available in Europe and has gained significant traction within a short span of time. Clariti lenses hold significant growth prospects for the company.The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable. A fall in dropout rate of contact lens users and further market penetration, especially in developing nations, is expected with continuous improvisation in the technology. Growth in international markets is something that contact lens manufacturers are banking on. Furthermore, user preferences are shifting from low-feature commodity lenses to expensive single-use and specialty lenses such as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses (silicone hydrogels).We believe that Cooper is well positioned to address this shift in customer preferences based on its expansive product portfolio. The company recently introduced Biofinity Energys' contact lenses, which is targeted at group of users who frequently complain about the discomfort arising from prolonged usage of smartphones, tablets, laptops, in-car displays and other devices. The company is a leader in the high-margin toric lens market. It offers multiple designs of toric lenses across a wide range of parameters, unlike some of its competitors, who offer the same lenses in limited designs. This is expected to further boost the company's top-line growth going forward.On the flip side, macroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. Additionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy might continue to dent discretionary spending.

While the Trump administration is faced with a socio-economic upheaval, investors are apprehensive about its impact on stocks.Historic trends suggest that investor sentiments have always been partially inclined toward fancy brand names in a volatile economic backdrop. As a result, companies with a solid brand value and robust fundamentals generally enjoy a smooth sail even during political turbulence.One such bigwig from the MedTech space is  , which has greatly evolved over the recent years. The company has pursued a slew of mergers and divestments, and has also seen solid growth in its Diabetics business. Among its strategic buyouts, the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals, Tendyne Holdings, and St. Jude Medical are worth mentioningAfter spinning off its proprietary pharmaceutical products division in 2013 to form AbbVie Inc.  , Abbott has gained traction in the Established Pharmaceuticals Division. Since then, revenues have seen a CAGR of 7.6% over the last three years. Over this period, the company has more or less reported strong quarterly numbers, indicating fundamental strength.However, the share price performance of Abbott has been disappointing over the same time frame. The company represents a meager return of just 19.2%, lower than the broader  's gain of 22.3% and the S&P 500's return of 23.3% over the same time frame.Of the main issues plaguing Abbott, foreign exchange is a major headwind. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies have constantly hampered the company's performance in international markets. Abbott currently expects currency exchange to have a negative impact of around 1% on sales in 2017.Apart from this, the business environment continues to be challenging across the globe. Slow growth in the nutrition business in China and economic problems in Venezuela are expected to remain unresolved for some time, dampening the company's top-line growth.While Abbott boasts solid fundamentals, the company's prospects are dull. We note that the company promises long-term earnings growth of just 10.7%, lower than the broader industry's estimated growth rate of 13%. Furthermore, Abbott's revenues have declined 10.7% in the last five years compared to the broader industry's revenue growth of 6.1%.Secondly, Abbott's historical cash-flow growth has been extremely low at -14.3%, comparing unfavorably with the broader industry's positive growth of 5.7%. These unfavorable growth metrics are indicative of the fact that despite a solid brand value, Abbott might not prove to be a lucrative pick for the long haul.The long-term growth parameters are not in favor of Abbott, as it holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) now. So instead of opting for brand values, let's take a look at the following four not-so-fancy MedTech stocks that are expected to gain over the long haul.

Higher sales of the company's molecular products and OraQuick HCV product are the primary growth drivers. The company has also been banking on its flagship Oragene product line.OraSure has had an impressive run over the last three years. The company has returned 161.2%, significantly higher than the broader industry's 22.09% and the S&P 500's 22.4% over the same time frame.: This Zacks Rank #2 company continues to demonstrate solid growth globally with strong international expansion.

Investors and politicians across the world seem to be apprehensive about the global reaction to North Korea's sixth and also its biggest nuclear weapons test this Sunday.With the potential for conflict over North Korea's act in the forefront of everyone's minds, stock markets are on tenterhooks as well. In fact, according to some South Korean officials, North Korea appears to be setting up the test for another intercontinental ballistic missile.Back home, geopolitics and severe hurricanes rocked Wall Street's calm, as markets remained skittish in the aftermath of North Korea's nuclear test and a second potent hurricane - Irma - expected in the United States in as many weeks.Amid such a fickle environment that could rapidly escalate, it was no surprise that investors sought asset security as  flared up and the U.S. Treasuries strengthened.However, we feel that in such a scenario, investors should look beyond gold and government securities. We have created a multi-faceted screen for you that will give investors stability and profit growth potential farther than the next quarter.It is common knowledge that Wall Street is obsessed with the bottom line. But are higher profits necessarily better? Are these really a true indicator of the staying power of a company's earnings?While dollar profits trump all other measures hands down for sheer shock value, these do not relate profits to the size of the company, its sales, resources or shareholder capital. The only profitability measure that reasonably works across industries is the ratio of return generated on the dollars invested in a business.The most popular among these ratios is Return on Equity (\"ROE\"), favored by both Wall Street analysts and investors alike. However, since the ROE measure receives the most attention from the investor community, executives focus heavily on this metric as well. Companies can exploit financial strategies (like increasing debt leverage and stock buybacks funded through built-up cash) to artificially maintain a healthy ROE for a while and conceal weakening operational profitability.So, let's shift our focus to a different bottom-line metric which garners far less attention from executives and investors alike - Return on Invested Capital (\"ROI\").Essentially, ROI shows how optimally management has been directing the capital under its control into profitable investments. It paints a clear picture of how efficiently a company is employing its capital and whether its competitive positioning is allowing it to produce good returns from that capital.Also, we will focus on large caps, which are big, established companies in the stock market, and have a comparatively softer risk profile. By virtue of their dominant market position, global footprint and relatively consistent cash-flow stream, these companies tend to be more reliable investments - which is called for in the current geopolitical environment. Also, ROI is particularly relevant for assessing companies that have a large amount of capital.Nonetheless, it might be quite difficult for investors to single out such companies, as we need companies which have generated strong ROIs over a sufficiently long period of time, in order to determine a robust trend.So, we have created a three-faceted screen to shortlist such companies for you. Only those companies which have generated ROIs in excess of 15% on average over the last five years can get past our screen. Their current ROI (over the trailing 12 months) also needs to be at least 15%.In addition, to ensure that we hone in on stable companies, which have an established history of generating profits, our screen allows only those companies which have a market capitalization north of $10 billion.Needless to say, these companies must have a solid Zacks Rank too. A favorable Zacks Rank shows positive analyst interest and brighter prospects for the company.These stocks have proven their mettle consistently during challenging times and look set to outperform peers effortlessly through efficient usage of assets.

The stock has improved 2.3% compared with the broader  5.4% gain during the period.While adverse foreign exchange continues to pose challenges, we are concerned with the company's recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. It is important to note that last quarter, foreign exchange headwind affected the company's top line by $23 million and adjusted gross margin by 50 basis points. Also, a dull defibrillator sale within core Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) continues to remain a drag for overall growth. The woes of challenging economy and competitive landscape persistently burden the stock. | However, given the company's bullish second-quarter 2017 results and several recent developments, we find quite a few positive factors to rely on. The company is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest more in global markets.Among the recent upsides, worth mentioning is the company's acquisition of Symetis, in a bid to fortify its European structural heart business. We are also encouraged with the company securing multiple product approvals both in domestic and overseas markets. Notably, the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of ICD and CRT-D systems.Additionally, the market holds optimism on the stock, following the company's recent release of an outline on sustained growth strategy, focusing on planned expansion in new markets and consolidating product lines across all business segments.

With the Obamacare saga dominating the headlines, the industry has been grappling with multiple issues. After failing to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump's major \"skinny repeal\" also lost ground.As per a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the abolishment of Obamacare will result in 17 million more of uninsured people in 2018, another 27 million in 2020 and the count is expected to rise to 32 million in 2026. The Medtech sector is expected to witness a decline in customer base after the elimination of Obamacare, indicating weaker demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.However, if Obamacare stays, the dreadful 2.3% medical device tax imposed on the selling price is likely to take away a quarter's profit of the Medtech players. This will also reduce capital-intensive research and development activities in the MedTech space.In addition, the Cadillac tax will make sustainability difficult for small players in the competitive MedTech industry.Tensions escalated as the devastating Hurricane Harvey and Irma impacted the economy. Data from the American Automobile Association, Inc. suggests that the national price of a gallon of gas hit $2.67 on Sep 8, up from $2.35 a month ago.Further, Bank of America estimates the loss of crops worth approximately $1.2 billion in Florida due to Irma, which will in turn lead to higher prices for groceries. Per statistics provided by a Labor Department official of the federal government, initial jobless claims had increased by 62,000, the highest since 2012.

According to them, it has been widely accepted how early detection of prostate cancer can greatly enhance a patient's chances of recovering from the disease.We believe, the company's move is well-timed taking into consideration the frequency rate at which prostate cancer is growing.

Per the modification, the companies have entered the next phase of the agreement earlier than expected.Mazor Robotics is an Israel-based medical device company in the field of robotic surgical guidance systems.Meanwhile, Medtronic will assume the rights to exclusive worldwide distribution of the Mazor X system (Mazor Robotic's spine surgery system) and will make $40-million third tranche investment in Mazor Robotics.The early payment came on the back of the achievement of certain pre-agreed sales and marketing targets in advance. The growing demand for the Mazor X system also acted in favor.Following the third installment, Medtronic's total investment in Mazor Robotics will rise to $71.9 million. The partnership will help the companies get a platform to explore the development of products for the spine market.Medtronic is making consistent efforts to expand its spine business under the Restorative Therapies Group (RTG).

The company has announced to have commercially launched the Brevera breast biopsy system with CorLumina imaging technology in the United States.Per the company, this real-time breast biopsy and verification system enhances workflow and patient experience, streamlining the entire biopsy process. Notably, the Brevera system claims to be world's first and only breast biopsy solution, combining tissue acquisition, real-time imaging, sample verification and advanced post-biopsy handling into one integrated system. Designed for 2D and 3D breast biopsy, this technical method increases biopsy accuracy with real-time imaging, thus helping to perform fast and efficient procedures in a cost saving manner.Per Hologic, this new advancement is a major breakthrough by the radiologists, who were hitherto conducting stereotactic breast biopsy procedures to diagnose breast cancer. This conventional practice is time-consuming as well as uncomfortable for patients. Whereas with the Brevera system, image tissue samples can be obtained right in the procedure room within a few seconds only. Good news is that this highly sophisticated technology will potentially save up to 10 minutes per patient, cutting the procedure time almost by 25%.Hologic also claims the Brevera system's proprietary CorLumina imaging technology to help improve workflow across multiple departments within a health system. It also features PACS integration for advanced image sharing and transfer of patient records.Significantly, within its breast health segment, Hologic has reshaped its R&D strategy toward continuous innovation around its leadership position in 3D mammography. Besides the latest Brevera routine, there is Affirm prone biopsy system.Management is hopeful that Brevera will begin to boost growth in 2017 and add more meaningful contribution in 2018. Also in June, Hologic had announced that the FDA labeled its Genius 3D Mammography exam as better than the standard 2D mammography for routine breast cancer screening of women with dense breasts.While Hologic is pretty confident about the strong adoption of its Brevera breast biopsy system in the market, we look forward to the company's consistent efforts to flourish in the field of women's health. In this regard, it is important to mention about the immense growth opportunities the healthcare market holds at present.Per the data provided by Markets and Markets, the breast imaging market is expected to reach $4.14 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2016.

The United States witnessed a political dilemma after three Republicans voted in favor of the existing Healthcare Act. They probably decided to support the existing Healthcare Act based on data provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). As per the report, with the abolition of Obamacare, another 17 million people will be uninsured in 2018, 27 million more in 2020 and the count is expected to increase to 32 million in 2026.The cancellation or withdrawal of the individual and employer mandate might have made health insurance and contracted health insurance coverage expensive. This will significantly dent demand for healthcare services, impacting the medical device industry as a whole.However, the MedTech industry is looking forward to the abolishment of the major healthcare taxes, including Cadillac tax and the 2.3% MedTech tax. Although the Republicans failed to pass the skinny repeal, it has been able to delay the Cadillac tax until 2026.Thanks to the postponement of the Cadillac tax, the medical device industry is hopeful that the 2.3% medical device tax would be eradicated soon.In such a mixed scenario, we feel investors should place their bets on large cap stocks that delivered positive average earnings surprises in the last reported four quarters and are witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates.We have selected four medical device stocks with the help of the  (hyperlink) to shortlist Medical Device stocks which are poised for impressive returns over the next five years.

Service (40% of total revenues), Custodial (37%) and Interchange (23%) revenues were up 21%, 44% and 21% year over year, respectively.The growth in service revenues was driven by year-over-year increase in average health savings account (HSA) which was offset by a decrease in service revenue per average HSA. The decline was led by the company's strategy of offering lower service fees per HSA for more volume from network partners, particularly with higher balances. HealthEquity stated that the profitability of HSA in this business model increases as balances grow.The growth in Custodial revenues was supported by higher average daily cash AUM. The strong year-over-year growth in Interchange revenues was driven by increased card spending and more favorable interchange terms (higher spend volume).As of Jul 31, 2017, total number of HSA members - for which the company serves as a non-bank custodian - increased 26% year over year to 2.9 million. Total assets under management (AUM) surged 28% year over year to $5.4 billion. | As of Jul 31, 2017, the company had $169.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities without any outstanding debt.

The dollar has been under strong selling pressure this year amid ongoing uncertainty over the economic agenda of Trump and mounting speculation on whether the Fed will implement a third-rate hike this year.Given such volatile economic conditions, investors will feel intimidated with regard to the investment scenario. In fact, increased volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) indicate bearish market prospects. Apart from domestic events, issues like the escalating North Korea-Japan tension and terror attacks in Spain also resulted in markets being subdued.At present the focal point at the Capitol Hill seems to be tax cuts. But we feel it's only a hogwash to unite the GOP under one banner after a divisive summer for the apocalyptic battle for Obamacare repeal. Amid such political conundrum, market watchers will keep a tab on the Medical space. The fraternity worries whether the final 'Trump-care plan' will still include the MedTech tax repeal in its agenda.Meanwhile, the old template of the plan, which promised to eradicate the infamous 2.3% medical device tax and the Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) was not a bad deal. Amid such uproar, the question that emerges is how medical product players stand to gain or lose.While selection of the right stocks can be quite an ardent task, a little care and precision can make the job easy. Given the current lack of clarity, let us concentrate on some powerful long-term tailwinds of the medical device industry including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation.

Their market capitalization all are in multi-billions, testifying to their strong liquidity.The 2017 estimate revision trend is significantly positive and earnings growth expectation is above the S&P 500.

The company is currently on track to achieve the previously announced $17 million in Home Solutions synergies and other incremental annualized cost-reductions of $23-$25 million by 2017-end.On the flip side, BioScrip's 2017 guidance is lackluster with the inclusion of an estimated negative impact of the Cures Act legislation. A large portion of the company's revenues used to come directly from Medicare, state Medicaid programs or other government payers.

We believe that the upside was driven by robust revenue growth. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Revenues increased to $556 million from $515 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552 million. Solid top-line performance was driven by innovative products like Biofinity and daily silicone hydrogel lenses.The Cooper Companies has two business segments - CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI). CVI revenues increased 8% at constant currency (cc) to $437.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenues continue to gain from the company's silicone hydrogel lenses led by solid prospects in the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. Coming to the major catalysts within the CVI segment, robust performance by Toric (31.6% of CVI revenues), Multifocal (10.7% of CVI revenues), Single-use sphere lenses (26.5% of CVI revenues) and Non single-use sphere lenses (31.2%) propelled solid growth.Multifocal revenues rose 7% at cc to $46.8 million, while Toric revenues increased 11% at cc to $138.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Single-use sphere lenses sales climbed 14% at cc to $115.8 million, while sales of non single-use sphere lenses inched up 2% at cc to $136.4 million year over year.Geographically, CVI revenues increased 2% in the Americas, while revenues from the Asia Pacific and EMEA rose 13% year over year at cc. CSI revenues jumped 4% at cc to $118.7 million on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the CSI segment, the fertility category witnessed a 6% rise (at cc) in sales in the reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, totaling $65.5 million. However, the office and surgical products category at the CSI segment inched up 1% at cc to $53.2 million. | Adjusted gross margin in the reported quarter was 65% of revenues as compared with 64% registered in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin improvement was fueled by favorable product mix within the CooperVision segment, improved margins at CooperSurgical segment, and favorable foreign exchange.Adjusted operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 26% in the fiscal third quarter flat on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal 2017, total revenue is expected in the band of $2,129-$2,142 million, up from the previously issued range of 2,110-$2,135 million.Revenues at the CVI segment are estimated between $1,670 and $1,680 million, up from the previously guided range of $1,645 million and $1,665 million, while CSI revenues are projected in the range of $459 - $462 million, a little lower from the previously guided range of $465-$470 million.Meanwhile, adjusted earnings are anticipated in the band of $9.66-$9.76, up from the previously provided range of $9.50-$9.65 per share. The Cooper Companies expects revenues in the range of $552 million to $565 million. CVI revenues are expected between $435 million and $445 million, while CSI revenues are anticipated between $117 million and $120 million. The company expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.60 and $2.70.The Cooper Companies ended third-quarter fiscal 2017 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both lines. The company has always seen impressive results at its CooperVision business segment. The CooperSurgical segment also delivered strong sales in the third quarter, buoyed by robust Toric performance. The company provided strong guidance for fiscal 2017. However, the dampening outlook for the CooperSurgical segment indicates looming concerns. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the contact lens space will continue to increase pricing pressure for the company.We also note that The Cooper Companies has completed the acquisition of a small specialty contact lens company named Procornea earlier this month.

The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, GNC Holdings has been underperforming the broader  . The company has lost 60%, as compared with the 13.1% decline of the broader industry over this period. Weak margins and significant decline in revenues on a year-over-year basis raise concern. Tough competition, changing consumer preferences along with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations continue to pose challenges.Moreover, this Pittsburgh, PA-based company exited the second quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note with revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although earnings exceeded the consensus estimate, the year-over-year decline on both the fronts was dampening. The decline can be attributed to lower sales in the company's U.S. & Canada and manufacturing/wholesale segments.On a positive note, during the second quarter, management witnessed positive response for its New GNC Plan under which the company had started incorporating transformational changes in its operations. Also, management is currently working on product pricing and innovation. Moreover, new consumer enrollment under the myGNC Rewards Program and launch of GNC storefront on Amazon buoy optimism.GNC Holdings is developing products and formulas to address unmet customer needs and is also expanding customer brands like Beyond Raw, Mega Men, Women's Ultra Mega and GNC Probiotics.Also, the company's prospects in the international business and strong cash position are encouraging. Management expects to continue capitalizing on international revenue opportunities through the addition of franchise stores in existing markets, expansion into new high-growth markets and growth of product distribution in both existing and new markets.During the second quarter of 2017, the company's international business drove a 1.3% increase in revenues and 14.3% rise in operating income. Apart from the strong e-commerce business in China, the company witnessed improvement in trends in Mexico, South Korea and Hong Kong.Meanwhile, the nutritional supplements industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions. This apart, GNC Holdings' international competitors include large pharmacy chains, major supermarket chains and other big U.S.-based companies with global operations.Management fears that in the face of stiff competition, the company may fail to function effectively and its attempts to do so may require price reduction, which in turn may hurt margins.A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation  , Lantheus Holdings, Inc.  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  .

This device is designed to correct a common congenital heart defect in pre-term infants. The device is same as the larger sized AMPLATZER Duct Occluder II product. The clinical study will be conducted on 50 patients at up to 10 centers across the United States.According to Abbott, Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a life-threatening vascular pathway or duct in the heart that remains open due to the failure of the fetal duct to close after birth. In some cases, the PDA fails to close spontaneously in premature babies leading to difficulty in breathing and feeding.Pharmaceuticals can be used at times to close the duct but are less effective in pre-term infants. Current treatment options for pre-term infants who are not responsive to pharmaceuticals are limited to surgery. However, surgery is not always possible and leaving the duct open can lead to fatal outcomes for infants. Breaking the conventional treatment, Abbott is developing the AMPLATZER Duct Occluder II Additional Sizes (ADO II AS) device to provide physicians with a nonsurgical treatment option for addressing the PDA defect in newborns and pre-term infants. ADO II AS is already approved for use in Europe.If the study is successful, the U.S. trial results will support Abbott's application for FDA approval for pediatric use in the country.We note that Abbott has been consistently trying to expand its vascular business under the Medical Device segment that is on solid growth trajectory of late. In the last reported second quarter, the Medical Devices business sales spiked 89.2% on a reported basis.Also, the recent developments include the receipt of FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3Left Ventricular Assist System (also known as an LVAD). The HeartMate 3 system enables physicians managing advanced heart failure patients in need of short-term hemodynamic support.Abbott also announced CE Mark and first use of the new Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM). This is the world's first smartphone-compatible ICM which helps physicians identify difficult-to-detect cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF).According to a report by Markets and Markets, the global pediatric interventional cardiology market is estimated to see a CAGR of 9% from 2013 to 2018.

The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).We are eagerly waiting for the closing of VWR's $6.4 billion acquisition by Avantor, a global supplier of ultra-high-purity materials for life sciences and advanced technology industries.Post-closing (expected in the fourth quarter of 2017), the consolidated entity should create a major consumables-focused solutions and services provider to high-growth life sciences and advanced technologies industries. The buyout will build on Avantor's strengths, including its cGMP (current good manufacturing practice) processes, a significant exposure to the emerging markets and VWR's vital position across both Americas as well as Europe.The combined company will therefore be serving a global customer base in all areas of activities from research through production, thus reflecting a unique advantage in a fast-growing marketplace.From shareholders' point of view, this potential merger with Avantor seems a beneficial move at the moment. The consolidation deal has been fixed at $33.25 per share in cash of VWR common stock, representing an enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. The purchase price represents an approximate 17% premium to the unaffected closing stock price as of May 2, 2017, the day before market speculations over a potential sale of VWR started. | Notably, the stock price has already inched closer to Avantor's offer price while investors wait for the merger's closure.

Per management, with around 9.5 million population diagnosed with diabetes, Japan is considered a nation with the highest rate of people suffering with the condition.The company states that the grant of reimbursement will also make FreeStyle Libre system widely available to more than one million Japanese people diagnosed with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and on insulin therapy varying from ages six and above.Also, the reimbursement approval in Japan marks another milestone where Abbott's FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 16 countries, including France and Germany. Notably, FreeStyle Libre system is presently under review by the FDA and awaits approval in the United States.Abbott has been moving steadily toward development in its diabetics segment. In July, the company partnered with Bigfoot Biomedical to solidify its footprint in the rapidly growing diabetes therapeutics market.Moreover, the company recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which was up 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We expect Freestyle Libre to further contribute to Abbott's top line as along with the Canadian development, the French Health Ministry recently approved national reimbursement for the device.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the  for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%.Considering the market potential and Abbott's current developments in the diabetes care segment, the recent national reimbursement grant in Japan will accelerate the top line.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the diabetes market. However, this market is dominated by many well established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) being the most prominent one.

The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Cooper have outperformed the  year to date. The shares of the company have increased 40.7% compared with the industry's gain of 14.0%.Additionally, the company's earnings estimates have moved north in the current year, reflecting analyst optimism. Over the past month, current and next earnings estimates have increased 10.2% and 6%, respectively. Moreover, Cooper reported earnings have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 4.4%.The company's leading position in the markets of specialty lenses was also supported by highly exclusive products of Biofinity and Clariti. In fact, its flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to deliver strong sales in the coming quarters. The company has also initiated the process of introducing MyDay lenses in the domestic market. It is already available in Europe and has gained significant traction within a short span of time. Clariti lenses also hold significant growth prospects for the company.The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable. A fall in dropout rate of contact lens wearers and further market penetration, especially in developing nations, is expected with continuous improvisation in the technology. Growth in international markets is something that contact lens manufacturers are banking on. Furthermore, user preferences are shifting from low-feature commodity lenses to more expensive single-use and specialty lenses, such as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses (silicone hydrogels).We believe that Cooper is well positioned to address this shift in customer preferences based on its expansive product portfolio. The company recently introduced Biofinity Energys' contact lenses, which is targeted at group of users who frequently complain of discomfort arising from prolonged usage of smartphones, tablets, laptops, in-car displays and other devices. The company is a leader in the high-margin toric lens market. It offers multiple designs of toric lenses across a wide range of parameters, unlike some of its competitors, who offer the same lenses in limited designs. This is expected to further boost its top-line growth going forward.On the flip side, macroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. Additionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy might continue to dent discretionary spending.

Notably, Patheon is a leading contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) serving the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. With the closing of the deal, Patheon will be part of Thermo Fisher's Laboratory Products and Services segment. Thermo Fisher's initial tender offer for Patheon expires after closing of the deal at $35.00 per share in cash.Patheon generated approximately $1.9 billion revenues in fiscal 2016.

The company reported a stellar four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 62.1%, with an earnings surprise of 75% in the last reported second quarter of 2017.Let's find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Headquartered in North Billerica, MA, Lantheus Holdings posted solid second-quarter 2017 results with year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues. Earnings per share increased around 75% year over year while revenues improved around 14% globally on the back of approximately 20% growth in DEFINITY and around 6% growth in TechneLite sales, globally.

Adjusted EPS also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. According to the company, the year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by a higher gross profit ratio, reduced interest expense and a lower effective income tax rate.Including one-time items, the company reported EPS of 38 cents, in line with the year-ago quarter.Full-year adjusted earnings came in at $1.51, an increase of 5.6% from year-ago period. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45.In the reported quarter, Phibro's net sales were $194.8 million, up 2.9% year over year.

Also, revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $761.52 million. | Net sales at the Animal Health segment increased 2% to $128.6 million in the reported quarter on the back of volume increases in the nutritional specialty and vaccine product groups within the segment. While nutritional specialty products grew 14%, sales from vaccines increased 8%, principally on volume growth of products for poultry and swine industries.However, sales at Medicated feed additives (MFAs) and Other fell 3% primarily due to volume declines.Domestic net sales of MFAs and Other declined $7.4 million due to reduced volumes of medically important antimicrobials. International net sales increased by $5.2 million, driven by growth in the Asia-Pacific region, which is partially offset by declines in Brazil due to economic conditions.Net sales at the Mineral Nutrition segment increased 5% to $52.8 million on increased volumes and higher average selling prices resulting from underlying raw material commodity price increase.Net sales at the Performance Products segment increased 6% to $13.4 million. This was driven by higher volumes of copper-based products and personal care ingredients and increased average selling prices of copper-based products. However, the increase was partially offset by lower average selling prices of personal care ingredients.Phibro's fiscal fourth-quarter gross profit increased 5.9% year over year to $63.1 million.

Recently, the company announced the receipt of CE Mark for Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead. We are also encouraged by the solid growth trend, continuing in the United States as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies.Moreover, a consistent and gradually stabilizing movement in the global Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market can be observed.

The company has a solid track characterized by consecutive earnings beat in the trailing four quarters.In recent times, Intuitive Surgical reported stellar performance mainly due to the growing adoption of the da Vinci system among physicians and overall growth in global procedures. The da Vinci surgical system enables minimally invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. Performance was also aided by growing volumes, courtesy to general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures.Intuitive Surgical continuously introduces technologies for surgical systems. The company also plans to launch an upgrade - da Vinci X - to its flagship Vinci Xi technology. In this regard, management confirmed the submission of documents for CE Mark approval of Vinci X. Furthermore, the company expects availability of this device in Europe by the end of 2017. In the long haul, extensive expenditure on product pipeline and expansion in international markets like Europe should drive growth for the company.On the flipside, the company expects procedure growth rate to slow down a bit outside the United States in the coming quarters. The long sale and purchase order cycle of the da Vinci system has added to the woes.

The company has also announced that it will provide patient training for this new indication later this year and in 2018.System One has been a flagship platform of NxStage contributing significantly to the company's top line. The latest development in the System One platform is exclusively formulated for both new and existing System One patients to reduce transportation costs, re-hospitalization rates and provide dialysis care on site. In fact, solo home hemodialysis eradicates the need of a care partner during the treatment procedure. Notably, the company got the first and only home nocturnal hemodialysis clearance way back in 2014.Per management, globally, a number of patients failed to opt for home hemodialysis to date due to the absence of a care partner to help them during the process. The latest regulatory go-ahead is likely to lend NxStage a competitive edge and expand its patient base with solid access to the clinical benefits associated with home hemodialysis.The latest regulatory progress closely follows another solid development in NxStage's Dialysis platform. Earlier this month, the company announced that its subsidiary NxStage Kidney Care is partnering Dialyze Direct for supporting the needs of patients who need on-site skilled-nursing facilities (SNF) for dialysis treatment in Ohio. NxStage will now leverage on its System One platform and Dialyze Direct's unique model for treating geriatric SNF patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).Earlier this month, German dialysis provider Fresenius Medical Care (FMS) signed an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of NxStage for $30 a share. The transaction has been valued at $2 billion and is subject to close by 2018, on approval of NxStage stockholders and other customary conditions. We note that NxStage has been gaining prominence in the market of late with products like NxStage PureFlow SL Dialysis Preparation System, Nx2me Connected Health and NxStage System One.Data from Markets And Markets reveal that the global hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis market is expected to reach a worth of $83.89 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 6.0%. NxStage's continuous effort to bolster its Dialysis unit is likely to be benefitted by the bountiful prospects in the niche space. Furthermore, an increased rate of ESRD cases enhances probabilities of NxStage outperformance in the niche space in the near term.Over the past one year, NxStage has added 22.4%, comparing favorably with the S&P 500's 11.9% over the same time frame.

This improvement in average net Medicare reimbursement rate and increase in average daily census during the recently reported second quarter were encouraging. The raised outlook for both Roto-Rooter segment and earnings per share is indicative of the company anticipating improved operating results in the upcoming quarters. This boosts investors' optimism on the stock.Notably, Chemed's VITAS business had been in trouble over the past few quarters due to certain admission coding changes initiated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). However, management noted the recent admission trends to be positive and that should continue in the coming quarters as well. | During second-quarter 2017, VITAS performed well, both financially and operationally, surpassing the company's expectations. The business experienced 2.1% net revenue growth when compared to the prior-year quarter. VITAS also generated admissions growth of 0.81% in the quarter.In terms of Roto- Rooter business, it displayed a robust performance in core plumbing and drain cleaning service segments during second-quarter 2017, as well as prompted a solid rise in water restoration. Management increased expectations to achieve Roto-Rooter full-year 2017 revenue growth of 12-13%, higher than the earlier expected range of 3-4%. Revenue estimates are based on increased job pricing of approximately 2% and continued growth in water restoration services.However, headwinds like reimbursement related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate pose challenges for Chemed.

Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation, constant rise in the price of specialty drugs and an overwhelming regulatory burden that is actually paving the way for manifold prospects for generics.However, Express Scripts recently announced that its biggest customer, the leading health insurer, Anthem Inc.  , is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging its drugs and operational failures. Per management, Anthem refused to participate in further discussions on pricing concessions and probable adjustments for the agreement.

Since growth investors seek capital gains, they tend to remain exposed to high risks.In a bull market, it has been popularly said that a stock keeps scaling new highs until some event works against it. However, the timing of the pullback is hard to gauge.Our latest  has made the task quite simple. It helps us choose stocks that have a solid performance record and might therefore prove to be a great choice for investors.Our Growth Style Score highlights all evaluation metrics and represents them as one score that cautions investors regarding \"growth traps\" and helps them find stocks that have high growth potential.Meanwhile, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) reflects an upward trend in the stock's earnings estimates. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Based on this, we have identified a candidate  , with a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A, which may prove to be a solid growth pick.IDEXX Laboratories has a favorable  of B.

Cash flow can be described as the net cash moving in and out of the company. IDEXX Laboratories proves to be a great growth pick as its current cash flow growth rate stands at 14.5% as compared to 5.2% of the industry.

Sequenom's NIPT and genetic testing capabilities has further added an impetus to LabCorp's extensive women's health test menu.

The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Luminex's second quarter saw strong top-line performance, solid cash flow and soaring profits. The company's Assay business is likely to be its key growth driver over the long term. Luminex reported earnings of 26 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017. Revenues in the quarter increased almost 19.2% year over year.Although the company reiterated its 2017 annual revenue guidance, it has projected third-quarter 2017 revenues in the range of $73 million and $75 million, down from the previously issued band of $74 million to $76 million. Luminex expects revenues at the segment to be impacted by funding challenges related to a multi-year bulk bead contract from a life science customer.The company also witnessed favorable tidings at the regulatory front in the second quarter. In this regard, the recent CE-IVD mark for the ARIES Norovirus Assay, the FDA approval of ARIES C. difficile Assay and the reimbursement approval of VERIGENE assay in Japan are noteworthy. Luminex is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep and is close to submitting the same for FDA review.The company has a broad product portfolio that comprises the advanced xMAP, xTAG and MultiCode technology. Moreover, Luminex has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should help expand the use of its products/technology. In this regard, we note that Luminex had earlier announced the signing of a new supply and distribution agreement with Bio-Techne Corp. (TECH), through 2020. Luminex also entered a similar deal with Affymetrix (AFFX). Under the terms of the agreement, eBioscience, a business division of Affymetrix, will commercialize MAGPIX, Luminex 200 and FLEXMAP 3D multiplexed assay platforms in select countries of the Americas, Asia and Europe.On the flipside, reimbursement landscape and cutthroat competition continue to be major challenges.

However, the figure was relatively narrower than the loss of 9 cents in the year-ago quarter.Total revenue in the fourth quarter increased approximately 18% year over year to $112.1 million and beat our estimate of $111 million. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by solid prospects in the Americas and APAC regions.Accuray also reported its fiscal 2017 results. For the fiscal, total revenue decreased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis to $383.4 million. Service revenues (53.2% of net revenues) totaled $203.8 million, while product revenues (46.8% of net revenues) totaled $179.6 million in the fiscal.Notably, Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), hinting at probabilities of underperformance in the near term. |  Revenues at the segment increased 38% to $60.6 million. System order conversions of backlog to revenue in the Americas and APAC regions buoyed growth in the segment. Solid performances in the CyberKnife, TomoTherapy Systems and Radixact platforms are the key highlights of the segment. Revenues at the segment saw a modest year-over-year increase of 1% to $51.5 million. Per management, lackluster performance at the segment was primarily due to lower installations. In the reported quarter, gross product orders totaled $85.7 million, increasing 5% on a year-over-year basis. At the end of the quarter, product backlog was $452.8 million, approximately 12% higher year over year. Gross order performance was favorably impacted by the company's flagship Radixact System and the CyberKnife System with the InCise Multileaf Collimator. The company's new TomoTherapy product platform, also known as Radixact, continued to contribute to the company's top line. Radixact represented majority of Accuray's TomoTherapy order mix in the reported quarter, up 25% on a sequential basis from the third quarter.APAC and Japan witnessed stellar performances at the Radixact and TomoTherapy platforms. Radixact orders in Japan have been extremely positive to date. Accuray also announced its new precision treatment planning system recently. The system leverages on the company's flagship Radixact and CyberKnife system platforms. The company also plans to build on this technology with Precision 2.0 upgrade by fiscal 2018. This will provide significant improvements in treatment speed and overall throughput of the already existing CyberKnife system. Accuray also announced 510(k) clearance for the new IBMS data management system for TomoTherapy. It is a centralized database that shares and makes data accessible between multiple accurate systems adding flexibility and improving workflow efficiency in the radiation therapy department.Gross margin (as a percentage of net revenues) contracted 80 basis points (bps) in the fourth quarter to 36.4%. This was primarily due to reduced product gross margins. Product gross margins decreased due to unfavorable product and channel mix.Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $40.4 million, almost flat with $40.3 million in the year-ago period.Accuray issued guidance for fiscal 2018.The company projects full-year revenues in the band of $390 million to $400 million. This represents growth in the band of approximately 2% and 4% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, product revenues are expected to increase in the band of 5% to 10% year over year and service revenues are likely to remain flat with fiscal 2017.The company expects a 5% increase in gross orders in fiscal 2018. The product system backlog is expected in the band of $445 million to $460 million.Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2017 is anticipated in the range of $25 million to $30 million, up 23% to 47% year over year.Accuray reported wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to lackluster performance in the service revenue segment. The company issued solid fiscal 2018 guidance. Of the recent developments, orders for the newly unveiled Radixact System, solid revenue performance in APAC and Japanese regulatory approval for Radixact are key positives in our view. However, unfavorable product mix, declining service revenues, sluggish macro economic conditions and pricing headwinds are major concerns. Notably, China and Europe saw sluggish revenues in the fourth quarter. Accuray's significant international presence helps broaden its customer base.

The decision followed complaints of minor irritation and allergic reactions from consumers. However, management expects to reinitiate product shipment by September and expects to begin full supply capacity by the end of the year.The share price of Stryker slipped 1.9% to close at $138.36 following the news release.The recall pertains to a cross-contamination issue in the Oral-care solutions which were manufactured for Sage by a third-party supplier. Notably, these solutions were distributed in markets between July 2015 and August 2017.However, Stryker affirmed that it has closed its business with the third-party supplier. In fact, Sage has resumed production of the oral care solutions.Coming to the temporary hold decision of the cloth-based products, the FDA expressed concerns regarding the ongoing microbiological testing methods for all products under the Sage platform. Now the FDA has instructed Stryker products to be verified using a new 'compendial microbiological method'.

Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG includes both the Surgical Solutions and the Patient Monitoring & Recovery (PMR) divisions. RTG includes the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.Revenues at CVG improved 6% at CER (or up 5% as reported) to $2.65 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales were $1.39 billion with 5% year over year at CER (up 4% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope and continued worldwide customer demand for the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor. This apart, the HeartWare International acquisition drove growth in the Heart Failure division.CSH revenues were up 8% at CER (7% as reported) to $817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe.APV revenues registered 5% growth at CER (up 4% as reported) to $439 million, driven by the continued adoption of the Endurant IIs aortic stent graft and remarkable strength of the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Peripheral was driven by low-double digit growth in both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.49 billion, marking a 3% year-over-year increase at CER (same as reported) on mid-single digit growth in Surgical Solutions and low-single digit growth in PMR.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.81 billion were up 2% year over year at CER (same as reported) on high-single digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low-single digit growth in Spine, thus mitigating a decline in Pain Therapies.

Adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 26.3%. This was owing to a 1.4% decline in research and development expenses (to $548 million) which was offset by a 2.3% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.49 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter were $66 million as compared with $39 million in the year-ago period.Medtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance.

The plan involves identifying and executing strategies to accelerate core revenue growth, favorable product mix, drive operational efficiency, improve revenue collection and increase employee effectiveness.Further, BioScrip had successfully completed the Home Solutions' integration earlier this year. The company expects core revenues as well as continued growth from this acquired asset to prove accretive, going forward.Notably, BioScrip has been recording persistent growth in its core Infusion Services business with strong presence as well as a competitive advantage. The company witnessed a consistent rise in this business, primarily on account of strong organic growth in chronic, nutrition and other therapies.

However, the quarter witnessed lower professional service sales, which fell almost 13.4% year over year. This was primarily because of tough comparisons with the year-earlier quarter and an unimpressive performance by the new software platform in recent quarters.We are particularly upbeat about the solid performance by the company's total software, hardware and related segments. However, growth at the segment was partially offset by lower software license and hardware sales.Among other concerns, a sluggish global economy, intensifying competition and a strict regulatory environment are primary headwinds. Although a recurring revenue stream is a positive for Quality Systems, it mostly comes from lower margin Electronic data interchange (EDI) and Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services.Quality Systems continues to acquire businesses that improve its revenue opportunities and aggravate integration risks.

Added to these functionalities, Summit Cancer Center has the capability to perform stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) while sparing normal tissues and maintaining optimal treatment efficacy.The Radixact System has been designed to deliver image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy, an extremely precise form of radiation therapy. The platform gained Japanese regulatory approval (Shonin approval) in the last quarter and is expected to start formal treatments from the fourth quarter.In this regard, a glimpse at the preliminary fourth-quarter results reveals that Accuray expects approximately $86 million of gross product orders. Solid growth in gross orders is buoyed by the full commercial launch of the Radixact system and continued strong demand for the company's flagship CyberKnife system.Accuray has had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one year.

The company's five-year historical growth rate is also favorable at 19.8% as compared with 18% of the broader  .Also, the company represented a return of almost 9.1%, better than the broader industry's gain of 8.2% over the last year.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick at the moment.The company's estimate revision trend for the current year has also been positive. In the past 60 days, five analysts moved north, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings rose around 3.9% to $3.17 per share over the same time frame.Let's find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one. Recently, IDEXX ended the second quarter of 2017 on a solid note, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The stellar quarterly performance was driven by the company's companion animal business. The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth. Management's unique innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. Moreover, the strong top-line growth in this quarter was driven by considerable contributions from the rest of the business segments.Also, IDEXX recently announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations, demonstrating the bountiful opportunities.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind for the company. Another concern is the company's high reliance on third-party distributors.

McKesson posted disappointing results in first-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The quarter saw strong performance by the Distribution Solutions segment. The segment is expected to keep up its performance in fiscal 2018 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. To boost growth, the company recently acquired CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion.Coming to guidance, the Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to witness robust growth on a year-over-year basis. The upside is expected to be driven by market growth and acquisitions.McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share of $7.10-$9.00 for the fiscal ending Mar 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings for the same period are expected in the range of $11.80-$12.50 per diluted share.On the flipside, pricing pressure in the independent retail pharmacy channel is a headwind. McKesson entered fiscal 2018 with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single digits and its first quarter slightly surpassed expectations.McKesson has been witnessing increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes. The company continues to see a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. However, McKesson expects to overcome the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018.Furthermore, cutthroat competition in the niche markets, currency headwinds and reimbursement issues remain challenges.Over the last three months, McKesson has been trading above the broader industry. The company has gained 5.1%, comparing favorably with the  industry's return of just 4%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500's return of only 4.6% over the same time frame.The estimate revision trend for McKesson has been unfavorable at the moment. For the current quarter, six analysts moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months.

The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).For the majority of the last three months, the company's share price has considerably outperformed the  industry. The stock has rallied 30.5% over the last three months, outshining the industry's return of just 3.6% over the same time frame.Notably, BioTelemetry has a market cap of $1.2 billion. Taking the stable performance of the stock into consideration, we expect BioTelemetry to scale higher in the coming quarters. The company's long-term growth of 28.4% also holds promise in this regard. BioTelemetry exited second quarter on a strong note with earnings exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues meeting the same. Revenues increased 10.3% year over year to $58.1 million, primarily driven by a $1-million increase in Healthcare revenues owing to rising MCOT patients. Notably, this marked the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. The company also registered growth across all segments. We are encouraged to note that the company is putting efforts in product innovation through research and development. However, a decline in gross margin is a matter of concern. In July, BioTelemetry announced the acquisition of LifeWatch AG in a deal valued at about $280 million. With this buyout, BioTelemetry enhanced its position in the wireless medicine space, expanding its product profile and customer base in the cardiac monitoring and diagnostic services space.Management expects the acquisition to yield significant synergies over the next 12-18 months. Both the companies make products which are utilized for remotely monitoring cardiac care patients. The raised full-year 2017 revenue guidance is encouraging. Post the acquisition of LifeWatch, BioTelemetry currently expects full-year 2017 revenue in the range of $285 million to $290 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 revenues is pegged at $286.05 million.The company expects $82 million to $84 million of revenues in the third quarter and $89 million to $92 million in the fourth quarter. The company also expects one-time expense related to the acquisition of approximately $15 million which is further expected to be reflected in third-quarter results. The estimate revision trend for BioTelemetry is favorable at the moment. For the full year, two analysts moved north compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, full-year estimates jumped 22.7% to $1.08 over the same time frame.For the current quarter, one analyst moved north, compared to no movement in the opposite direction in the last two months.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens has outperformed its  with respect to share price movement in the last month. The stock has gained 1.7%, ahead of the industry's 1% rise during the period.Walgreens' shelving of the $17 billion Rite Aid  acquisition deal came as a huge setback to the company's investors. The buyout deal had once promised a strong platform for developing the company's brand presence as well as its overall future business growth. However, delving into the deal's latest details, we believe there is still much to hope for.The new agreement would enable Walgreens to purchase nearly half of the Rite Aid business at a deal value, almost one-third of the original price. More specifically, the acquirer will take over nearly 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and a related inventory from Rite Aid for $5.175 billion in cash. Notably, the latter ran about 4,523 stores across 31 states and the District of Columbia as of Jun 3, 2017.This apart, the contract's financial outcome is pretty attractive. Post the new transaction's initial closing, Walgreens expects it to be modestly accretive to its adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year. Synergies from this new takeover are expected in excess of $400 million, to be entirely realized within three to four years of its initial closing.Per Walgreens, this modified merger contract will also extend its growth strategy and offer additional operational plus financial benefits. It will help the company expand and optimize its retail pharmacy network in the key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. This partial consolidation with Rite Aid will help Walgreens gain a competitive edge.Besides, the company's new strategic pharmacy tie-ups and several recent programs including skin product launch and vaccination are encouraging. Earlier this year, the company partnered with communication service provider WPP to operate and develop multiple marketing and communications channels for its retail and wholesale businesses as well as its health and beauty product brands.Walgreens Boots also inked a multi-year partnership agreement with global express delivery service provider FedEx Corporation. The alliance is aimed at offering convenient access to FedEx drop-off and pickup services at several Walgreens Boots locations across the United States.In the last few years, a slowdown in generic introduction, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering the company's margin significantly. Also, Walgreens Boots faces obstacles like increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to gain a decent market share from other traditional drug store retailers, major mass merchants namely Target and Wal-Mart are on track to expand their pharmacy businesses.Risks from other channels such as supermarkets and mail order operations also pose a threat. In addition, industry conditions remain challenging as insurers slash reimbursement rates and raise prescription co-payments. Plus, currency fluctuations, weak macroeconomic environment and delay of Walgreens Boots' long impending buyout of Rite Aid emerge as other headwinds.Some of the better-ranked medical stocks are Align Technology, Inc.  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  .

The company offered a day this year when customers didn't have to pay for tests run on their SediVue instruments and Ayers noted a substantial increase in usage:SediVue machine. Image source: IDEXX Laboratories.Management raised 2017 revenue guidance by $17.5 million at the midpoint of prior guidance to a range of $1.945 billion to $1.965 billion, but $13 million of that is just coming from updated assumptions related to changes in foreign exchange rates.Earnings per share guidance for the year was also raised, up $0.14 to a range of $3.12 to $3.22, but only $0.04 is coming from increased operating profit. The other $0.10 of the increase comes from a $0.02 benefit from exchange rates and $0.08 from the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation.But there's a good reason for the relatively small increase in operating profit compared to previous guidance: IDEXX is making investments now that it thinks will result in future revenue growth. In addition to expanding its sales force to increase the number of visits to customers, which Ayers noted has paid off with increased sales, IDEXX is also increasing research and development and integrating rVetLink, a veterinarian software company it recently acquired.The R&D investments should start paying off shortly with planned launches for two new products: an SDMA test for the Catalyst machines so veterinarians can do the test in house and not have to send samples to the reference lab, which is due to launch by the end of the year and a SNAP fecal test expected in the middle of 2018.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Fresenius expects the acquisition to prove accretive to earnings within three years from deal closure.Furthermore, the deal is expected to provide annual pretax cost savings of $80 million to $100 million over the next three to five years. Fresenius also expects integration costs of about $150 million over the next three years from the time of announcement.Per management, the takeover will boost revenues at the Care Coordination segment. In this regard, in the last quarter, margins at Care Coordination declined substantially on a year-over-year basis owing to lower profits in vascular services and higher costs in pharmacy services. We believe the latest development will help the company counter the pressure on margins.Per management, the latest development is a significant step to boost the company's grand long-term goal.

Per the agreement, Varian Medical would distribute Bionix's propreitory brachytherapy applicators. Varian will market the Bionix Esophageal Applicator (E-App) and the Anorectal Applicator (AR-1) in North America.Of the above two applicators, E-App is a disposable brachytherapy applicator. It is designed specifically for the treatment of cancers. The E-App features five independently operable balloons that maintain the central position of the source catheter in both straight and curved anatomy. This allows for closer proximity of the target to the source while maintaining distance from healthy tissue.The second applicator, AR-1 is a disposable brachytherapy applicator. It is designed specifically for the treatment of anal and rectal cancers. The dual balloon design of the AR-1 allows exophytic tumors to press closer to the source catheter. This creates the ability to deliver a very high dose to the tumor, while sparing healthy tissue.We note that the global radiotherapy market is expected to reach a worth of $7,544.8 million by 2020, at a CAGR of 6.2%. Taking the bountiful prospects in the global niche space into consideration, the latest development should boost investor's confidence.A promising portfolio combined with robust initiatives has been favoring this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, which has delivered positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 14 quarters. We note that shares of Varian Medical have declined 0.2% over the past three months against the  industry, which grew 0.5% in the same time frame.Varian Medical operates in a technology-driven environment where success depends on innovation and frequent product updates. The company has been successful on the R&D front as evident from year-over-year expansion in its top line. The company has approximately $1 billion revenue opportunity from its various Oncology and Imaging Component products over the next five years.Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe that proton therapy holds significant promise for Varian Medical. This is because ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors and cause lesser side-effects to surrounding tissues. Proton therapy system uses the same interface used by the company in its TrueBeam platform.Finally, the company's strong overseas presence is expected to enable it to leverage this opportunity in emerging markets.

The latest scorecard says that the total earnings for these members increased 11.3% year over year on 6.1% higher revenues. While the earnings beat ratio remains at 74.5%, revenue beat ratio stands at 69.2%. With 214 members yet to release their numbers, the total-second quarter earnings for the index are currently expected to be up 9.2% on 5% higher revenues from the year-ago period. , one of the 16 broader Zacks sectors, is absolutely no exception to this trend improvement. So far, 58.2% of the members from this sector has released the quarterly earnings results with earnings and revenue beats standing at very impressive levels of 84.4% and 68.8%, respectively. With more and more companies lining up for their earnings announcement, the aggregate growth pace of this sector is expected to pick up further.Notably, there are some powerful long-term tailwinds of the medical device industry, including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been a major driving force behind the sector's impressive performance over the past few quarters even amid severe socio-economic and political instabilities.Let's analyse how the following two major Medical - Products companies are placed ahead of their announcement on Aug 1. : We are upbeat about IDEXX' innovation-based global strategy that is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. In June, IDEXX announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians. This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the company's second-quarter performance, whichis scheduled to release before the market opens.Our previous article showed that IDEXX was likely to beat on earnings this quarter. However, estimates changed thereafter and we are not certain of a beat this earnings season.This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult.Based on the Zacks methodology, a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely earnings surprise, while a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.

This is likely to dent results in the fiscal fourth quarter too.ResMed is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 1  .

President Donald Trump's promise to come up with a superior healthcare plan that will fully repeal and replace Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act (ACA), is still hanging in the balance.On Jul 25, the first day of the ongoing debate session, Trump had a taste of success as the latest Republican healthcare bill (with extensive amendment to the original Obamacare) won by a very narrow margin of 51-50. However, investors were not much optimistic about this development.Trump's latest bill primarily promises improved insurance coverage from the existing law with significantly lower American premiums. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation's (JCT) cost estimate released on Jul 19, if the ACA or Obamacare's full-repeal bill is finally signed, the number of uninsured people would increase by 17 million in 2018, from the present uninsured number.This will further intensify to 27 million uninsured in 2020 after the elimination of the ACA's expansion of the eligibility for Medicaid and the elimination of subsidies for insurance purchased through marketplaces established by the ACA. The number of uninsured will then increase to 32 million in 2026.While twists and turns unfold at the Capitol Hill, markets watchers will keep a tab on the influence that each dramatic move will have the spaces closely related. Here, we ponder over medical device stocks that stand to gain or lose on the political gridlock. Supporters of the Republican alternative argue that if the proposed amendment is implemented, more people would be covered as a portion of the cost would be borne by the government. Needless to mention, this may lead to the broadening of customer base for MedTech companies that would have otherwise suffered.Notably, the medical device industry was happy with the original Trump action plan which promised cancellation of major healthcare taxes including the two key taxes of Obamacare - the unpopular Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) and the controversial 2.3% MedTech tax. If the full-repeal plan gets voted out, the fraternity worries whether the final plan will still include the MedTech tax repeal in its agenda.Most of the MedTech majors are lined up to report their earnings results over the next week. But in the present eco-political hullabaloo, we lack visibility whether this corner will be able to continue its bullish run in the second-quarter earnings season. Our latest  also fails to paint any bright picture for the broader Medical space which is expected to register year-over-year earnings growth of a mere 1.1% on revenue growth of 4%. This compares unfavorably with the prior quarter's reported earnings growth of 5.6% on revenue growth of 5.7%.Given the numerous stocks in the medical sector that almost always muddle one's stock-picking ability, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief. One can narrow down the choices by focusing on medical device stocks (a specialized chunk under the medical sector) that have the desirable combination of a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Going by this criterion, we present four medical device stocks that are poised to beat estimates this quarter.

IDEXX achieved strong organic growth in the U.S. and international regions in the last reported first quarter of 2017, driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of the premium instrument installed base. The company expects this bullish trend to continue in the upcoming release as well.IDEXX is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 1. We expect the company to beat earnings estimates as it has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +1.19%.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because IDEXX Laboratoriesis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for IDXX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 85 cents per share for IDXX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for IDXX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.19% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that IDXX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for IDEXX Laboratories, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaries,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

DENTSPLY SIRONA rose only 3.67%, underperforming the Zacks classified  sub-industry's gain of almost 9.16%. The current level compares unfavorably with the S&P 500's return of 3.82% over the same time frame.The estimate revision trend for the stock has been dismal, with 10 estimates moving south in the last two months and no estimate moving north. Notably, the current year estimate for the stock fell 2 cents to $2.83 per share over the same time frame. The company currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Coming back to the news, the renewal agreement would be effective from Sep 1, 2017 through Dec 31, 2020. We feel the agreement is a smart move by DENTSPLY SIRONA as the preexisting distribution agreement did not include the CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system and the Schick line of imaging sensors. By including the aforementioned lines of products, the company would be able to take full advantage of Henry Schein's distribution network in Canada. Henry Schein Canada's existing agreement with DENTSPLY SIRONA was originally initiated in Aug 2005.Headquartered in York, PA, DENTSPLY SIRONA is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables, dental laboratory products, dental specialty products and consumable medical device products.Looking ahead, robust performance by the company's flagship dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic product platforms hold considerable promise over the long haul. However, higher capital expenditure on product development and tough competition are expected to put margins under pressure. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate and integration are also major risks in the near term.A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Inogen Inc.  , IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  and Luminex Corporation  .

Notably, Hologic's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 5.79%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hologic witnessed a lackluster performance at its Diagnostics segment in the last reported quarter on poor Cytology and perinatal sales. Particularly, longer cervical cancer screening guidelines intervals are playing spoilsport here. With the issue still to factor into the company's performance, we expect this segment to continue to perform dull in the upcoming quarter.We are also worried about the fact that Hologic's blood screening divestiture is expected to impede the company's growth momentum in the days ahead. We expect this to get reflected through the company's financial performance in the yet-to-be-reported quarter itself.Hologic had to face several challenges owing to unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been affecting the company's overall performance over the past few quarters. In 2017, foreign exchange headwind is expected to result in reduction of over $20 million.Escalating operating expenses and intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to be concerns for Hologic. For quite some time now, the company witnessed several challenges such as restricted capital spending environment, economic uncertainties in Europe, slower sales cycles and increasing pricing pressure. We expect these problems to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.The company should get significant synergy benefits in the third quarter from the integration of Cynosure, Inc., a medical aesthetics systems and technologies company, which Hologic acquired in Mar 2017. To mention, the U.S. FDA has recently granted an expanded clearance for Cynosure's non-invasive body contouring product, Sculpture, to treat the back and inner and outer thighs.Coming to product launches, in the third quarter, the company received European CE mark for its new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for flu and respiratory testing. Also, the company announced the U.S. FDA approval of itsGenius 3D Mammography exam. These along with several other product launches should also boost the upcoming quarterly results.Overall, for third-quarter fiscal 2017, Hologic expects revenues of $790-$805 million (as compared to the prior guidance of $675-$685 million). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is $798.9 million, within the company's expectations.Adjusted EPS is projected at 48 cents-50 cents (beyond the high end of the previous 48 cents-46 cents range). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter adjusted EPS is pegged at 49 cents, within the company's guidance.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hologic is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Hologic has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 49 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Hologic has a Zacks Rank #4. Note that we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter:Dextera Surgical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Let's take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Our proven model shows that IDEXX is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients. : IDEXX has an  of +1.19% as the Most Accurate estimate is 85 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at 84 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : IDEXX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of IDEXX's Zacks Rank #2 and +1.19% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.IDEXX achieved strong organic growth in the U.S. and international regions in the last reported first quarter of 2017, driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base. The company expects this bullish trend to continue in the upcoming quarters as well.Overall, IDEXX raised its 2017 revenue outlook by $15 million to the range of $1,925--$1,950 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 9.5% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.92 billion, within the guided range. | On the bottom-line front, the company raised its EPS guidance to $2.95--$3.11 per share from the earlier range of $2.85-$3.01, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 21%--27% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $3.05, which is within the guided range.We are upbeat about the company's innovation-based global strategy that is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. In June, IDEXX announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations demonstrating the bountiful opportunities. Further, management's consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the second-quarter performance.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind for the company. Another concern is the company's high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion in the U.S. and internationally, and portfolio expansion.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance. This struggle to gain market share might also prove to be a drag on second-quarter 2017 results.Here are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company  has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Stryker Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #2.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Medidata Solutions will be added to the S&P MidCap 400 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Health Care Technology Sub-Industry Index.With a portfolio of 400 leading companies that have approximately 80% coverage of the available market capitalization, the S&P Index is an important metric for U.S. equities. It is no wonder that the index is considered one of the best single gauges for large-cap U.S. equities. To be included in the index, a stock must have a total market capitalization of $1.4 billion to $5.9 billion. It will therefore act a big boost for investors holding shares of Medidata Solutions.Medidata Solutions has been gaining prominence of late, courtesy of its broad-based product portfolio which includes Medidata Rave, Medidata Coder, Image Management, Risk-Based Monitoring, Medidata CTMS and Medidata Patient Cloud.We are upbeat about the company's solid investment strategy undertaken to improve the R&D activities. Medidata Solutions not only invests organically in product development but has also taken solid initiatives to leverage on M&A activities to accelerate delivery of its innovative technologies. This has created significant shareholder value for the company. Following the recent acquisition of CHITA, Medidata Solutions announced the availability of its regulated content management platform, Medidata RCM.Of the other major developments, the enterprise deal with Teva is worth a mention. Teva selected the Medidata Clinical Cloud to empower the next generation of its Phase 2 and Phase 3 specialty medicine trials.Earlier this year, Medidata Solutions announced the receipt of the 'Clinical Partnership of the Year' award at the second annual Clinical and Research Excellence (CARE) Awards, courtesy of its 'unique technology collaboration' with TESARO.Notably, TESARO has been working closely with Medidata Solutions since 2013, especially on features like the Medidata Balance - a platform that enhances the clinical trial supply management of Medidata Solutions. Medidata Balance is a fully configurable randomization and trial supply management (RTSM) solution that leverages on the company's flagship Medidata Rave platform.Furthermore, Medidata Solutions' solid international foothold is a significant positive. In the last reported quarter, the company saw a solid increase in subscription bookings in the Asia-Pacific market, almost 12 times on a year-over-year basis. In this regard, Korea-based global biopharmaceutical company Medytox, recently announced plans to expand its use of the Medidata Clinical Cloud for domestic and global clinical trials.The EMEA market also saw a strong significant year-over-year growth in bookings in the last quarter. Medidata Solution's decision of opening a data center in EU is also a key positive.Medidata Solutions has had an impressive run on the bourse over the last one year. The company has gained roughly 66.4%, substantially higher than the Zacks categorized  sub-industry's addition of almost 7.6%. Moreover, the current level compares favorably with the S&P 500's return of 16.9% over the same time frame. This, together with a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 21.1%, instills confidence in investors.Furthermore, the estimate revision for the stock has been favorable. The year has seen four estimates move north over the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction. As a result, full-year earnings estimates rose 8% to 81 cents per share over the same time frame.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include Inogen Inc.  , Luminex Corporation  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  .

This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company's price performance. But, it is difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio.We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company's business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.This ratio is used to measure a company's capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or the \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.This is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company's potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio implies that the company is failing to use its assets effectively.Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.In addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) - to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 13.Here are five stocks from the 13 that made it through the screen: manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.

The duo is expected to develop more than 20 generic injectable products that include anti-infectives, oncolytics and cardiovascular medicines. However, the financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Dorizoe is a global contract research and development (R&D) organization that provides services formulation development, analytical development, tech transfer and regulatory filing support services to pharmaceutical companies.Post the deal closure, Baxter will leverage on Dorizoe's R&D expertise to accelerate the launch of generic molecules. The deal will combine Baxter's manufacturing leadership and hospital channel strength with Dorizoe's technical expertise, thereby boosting Baxter's foothold in the niche space. Per management, Baxter can tap into the bountiful opportunities of the global sterile generic injectables market, which has a current worth of $40 billion.The takeover will provide Baxter with a robust portfolio of generic injectables which are approved in the U.S. Meanwhile, Baxter also announced plans to close the acquisition of Claris Injectables by the second half of 2017. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and certain customary closing conditions.A research report by the CPhl Pharma Insights reveals that cutthroat competition from low-cost manufacturing zones like India and China in the generic space has led to the shutdown of certain sterile manufacturing bigwigs in the U.S. We believe the latest initiative by Baxter to expand its footprint in India is a prudent and sustainable move. We are also upbeat about the company's impressive third-quarter results and an encouraging guidance for the rest of the year.Meanwhile, the stock represents a dismal return of just 0.7%, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks categorized  sub-industry's solid gain of almost 4.4% over the last one month. Shares of Baxter followed the unfavorable market trend and inched 0.2% down to close at $57.98 following the news.However, Baxter promises a long-term expected earnings growth rate of almost 12% and an earnings yield of 3.97%, compared to the industry's 1.29%. This indicates chances of recovery in the near term.We note that Baxter sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), courtesy of a solid estimate revision trend with nine estimates moving north in the last two months for the full year. Notably, current year estimates for the stock rose 5% to $2.27 per share over the same time frame.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include Inogen Inc.  , Luminex Corporation  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  . Notably, Inogen and Luminex Laboratories sport a Zacks Rank #1, while IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Inogen has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.50%. Notably, the stock represents an impressive one-year return of 90.2%.Luminex has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.3%. The stock posted a positive earnings surprise of 237.5% in the last reported quarter.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.37%. Additionally, the stock represents an impressive one-year return of 80.5%.At Zacks, we're mostly focused on short-term profit cycles, but the hottest of all technology mega-trends is starting to take hold...By last year, it was already generating $8 billion in global revenues.

The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In the last three months, IDEXX Laboratories has been trading above the Zacks categorized  industry. The company's better-than-expected first-quarter 2017 performance has bolstered market confidence leading to a further rally in the share price.We expect this bullish trend to continue in the days ahead. As per the last share price movement, the stock has gained 15.7% in the period, significantly ahead of the broader industry's gain of 7.6%.We are encouraged to note that IDEXX continues to demonstrate solid global growth on strong international expansion. International revenues in the first quarter of 2017 grew low double digits organically driven by a 17% organic rise in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. This reflected continued consumable revenue gains supported by strong Catalyst instrument customer base and average testing utilization.IDEXX derives the lion's share of its revenues from its Companion Animal Group segment (CAG). In the first quarter, CAG revenues rose double digits on a year-over-year basis, supported by CAG Diagnostics recurring organic as well as CAG instrument revenue growth.Also, we are optimistic about the company's recent inclusion in the NASDAQ-100 Index, the NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index and the NASDAQ-100 Ex Technology Index. It has also been listed under the coveted S&P 500 which proves that the company has been performing consistently well over the past few years.On the flip side, foreign exchange headwinds continue to remain a major dampener for the company's international performance. Moreover, a competitive landscape in the overseas market weighs on IDEXX. Also, over the last three months, a comparative study of the company's forward P/E (F12M basis) multiple reflected that the stock has been quite overvalued as compared to the broader industry.Other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Luminex Corporation  , Inogen, Inc.  and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation  .

Shares have added nearly 3% in the past month, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.IDEXX Laboratories Inc. recorded first-quarter 2017 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.77, up 51% (up 53% at constant exchange rate or CER) year over year on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings was pegged at $0.61 per share.Strong top-line growth in the first quarter drove the upside in earnings.IDEXX's first-quarter 2017 revenues rose 11% year over year (same on organic basis) to $462.0 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $455 million.The year-over-year increase was driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD), and Other.In the first quarter, CAG revenues rose 13% (13.4% organically) year over year to $403.2 million. The Water segment's revenues were up 6.5% from the prior-year quarter (7.3% organically) to $25.0 million. LPD revenues, however, decreased 5% (down 4.6% organically) to $29.3 million. Meanwhile, revenues at the Other segment deteriorated 20% (down 19.9% organically) to $4.4 million.Gross profit increased 13.5% to $258.2 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin expanded 139 basis points (bps) to 55.8% despite a 7.3% rise in cost of revenue to $203.8 million.Sales and marketing expenses increased 9.3% to $87.2 million while general and administrative expenses rose 7.3% to $52.9 million. Research and development expenses increased 4.7% to $25.7 million. Overall, operating margin in the quarter improved 229 bps to 19.9%.IDEXX exited the first quarter of 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $160.4 million, up from $154.9 million at the end of fiscal 2016. As of Mar 31, 2017, net operating cash flow was $31.2 million, compared with $26.9 in the prior year.IDEXX raised its 2017 revenue outlook by $15 million to the range of $1,925--$1,950 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 9.5% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.92 billion, within the guided range.Management also raised its EPS guidance to $2.95--$3.11 per sharefrom the earlier range of $2.85-$3.01, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 21 on a reported basis.Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 5.7% due to these changes. | At this time, IDEXX's stock has an average Growth Score of 'C', though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an 'F'.

Within that group, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Symbol: REGN) and Idexx Laboratories, Inc. (Symbol: IDXX) are two large stocks leading the way, showing a gain of 5.4% and 3.4%, respectively. Among  , one ETF following the sector is the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (Symbol: XLV), which is flat on the day on the day, and up 9.61% year-to-date. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., meanwhile, is up 5.28% year-to-date, and Idexx Laboratories, Inc. is up 43.52% year-to-date. Combined, REGN and IDXX make up approximately 1.6% of the underlying holdings of XLV.The next best performing sector is the Energy sector, losing just 0.1%. Among large Energy stocks, Phillips 66 (Symbol: PSX) and Chevron Corporation (Symbol: CVX) are the most notable, showing a gain of 2.3% and 1.2%, respectively. One ETF closely tracking Energy stocks is the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (  ), which is up 0.4% in midday trading, and down 9.11% on a year-to-date basis.

As you can see, one sector is up on the day, while eight sectors are down.\n  \nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors eyeing a purchase of Idexx Laboratories, Inc. (Symbol: IDXX) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $161.45/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the October put at the $145 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1% return against the $145 commitment, or a 2.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to IDXX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $145 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Idexx Laboratories, Inc. sees its shares fall 10.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $143.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.50 from $145), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.1% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $145 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the October put at the $145 strike for the 2.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Idexx Laboratories, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $161.45) to be 26%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Thursday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 892,436 contracts, with call volume at 892,436, for a put:call ratio of 0.71 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because IDEXX Laboratories is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for IDXX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 63 cents per share for IDXX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for IDXX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 3.28% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that IDXX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see  .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for IDEXX Laboratories, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Most of Zacks' investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

Further, IDEXX's earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past four quarters, the average being 14.68%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.IDEXX achieved strong organic growth in the U.S. and international regions in the last-reported fourth quarter of 2016, driven by significant expansion in the Companion Animal business. The company expects this bullish trend to continue in the upcoming quarters as well. Overall, management expects 8.5-10% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting organic gains of 10-11%. IDEXX also reaffirmed its full-year 2017 organic revenue growth outlook at 9-10.5%. | On the bottom-line front, the company raised its 2017 EPS guidance to $2.85-$3.01 from $2.35-$2.39 supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $2.95, which is within the guided range.IDEXX is one of the leading players in the companion animal health space. The company is currently working on the launch of several products in this space which include updated instrument software of SediVue, PROREAD software and VetConnect PLUS. We expect these launches to boost the top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations such as China and Brazil, demonstrating the bountiful opportunities. Further, management's consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the first-quarter's performance.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind for the company. Another concern is the company's high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance. This struggle to gain market share might also prove to be a drag on the first-quarter 2017 results.Last month, IDEXX joined the prestigious NASDAQ-100 Index following its listing under the S&P 500 category around two months back. This is expected to significantly boost investors' confidence on the stock.Our proven model does not conclusively show that IDEXX is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below. : IDEXX has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 62 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . IDEXX's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Galectin Therapautics, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +13.33% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see Hill-Rom Holdings Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +1.27% and a Zacks Rank #2.Syros Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.85% and a Zacks Rank #2.If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

The FDA clearance was for a new flow cytometer system with a leucocount reagent assay used in residual white blood cell enumeration.In the last three months, the price performance of BD was encouraging. The stock added 8.60%, comparing favorably with the Zacks classified  sub-industry's gain of 5.69%. Also, the stock's performance compares favorably with the S&P 500's return of 3.87% over the same time frame. Added to this, a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 9.94% instills confidence in investors.Despite the bullish price trend, estimate revision for the stock has been quite disappointing. The full year has seen 10 estimates move south over the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction. As a result, the stock dropped a nominal 1% to $9.42 over the same time frame. These mixed sentiments justify the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Coming back to the news, the new flow cytometer system provides a simple solution for identifying and counting rWBCs in leucoreduced blood products. This is also compatible with the company's Leucocount kit and Trucount tubes. We feel the combination of products will appeal to the niche market of blood banks and clinical laboratories for an easy-to-use cell analysis solution to help determine and quantify the presence of residual white blood cells. Also, the fully automated system improves overall lab efficiency and simplifies workflow. Finally, the system offers the performance of a full-function clinical flow cytometer but in a compact design that easily fits on a benchtop or within a hood.Based in Franklin Lakes, NJ, Becton, Dickinson is a medical technology company engaged principally in the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices, instrument systems and reagents.Going forward, BD's focus on product launches is a significant catalyst in our view. Additionally, its expansion plans, especially in the emerging overseas markets and the acquisition-driven strategy hold considerable promise.On the flipside, lower demand for healthcare products, intensifying competition, significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility and higher debt levels pose major headwinds.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Inogen Inc.  , IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  and Fluidigm Corporation  . Notably, Inogen and IDEXX Laboratories sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Fluidigm carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Inogen has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.50%. Notably, the stock registered an impressive one-year return of 70.6%.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.04%. Additionally, the stock returned an impressive 97.5% in the last one year.Fluidigm has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 25%.

In the last three months, the stock increased 20.64%, outperforming the Zacks classified  sub-industry's gain of roughly 4.87%. Moreover, the stock's current return was higher than the S&P 500's return of 3.66% over the same time frame.Despite the bullish price trend, estimates revision for the stock has been quite disappointing. The full year saw two estimates moving south in the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction. As a result, the estimate dropped to a loss of 91 cents per share from a loss of only 67 cents per share over the aforementioned period. These bearish sentiments justify the stock's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).During the first quarter, Mazor Robotics received purchase orders for six Mazor X systems in the U.S. The company also received a purchase order for a Renaissance brain module upgrade in the international market. In the year-ago quarter, the company received purchase orders for five Renaissance systems.Mazor X is a transformative guidance system for simplifying spine surgeries with advanced features and 'sophisticated integrative abilities'. Strong demand for Mazor X systems during the first quarter brought the total number of its orders to 40 since its introduction in the second half of 2016. The company ended the first quarter with an order backlog of 14 Mazor X systems and expects to deliver these systems in 2017. The company is slated to report its financial results for the first quarter ended Mar 31, 2017 in May.We are also hopeful about the encouraging global spine surgery market. A research report by Markets And Markets suggests that the niche markets are estimated to reach $17.27 billion by 2021, multiplying at a CAGR of 5.3%.In fact, the increasing utilization rate of Mazor X is quite compelling for the company.

The stock has till now gained 30.7%, in comparison to the broader industry's 4.9%.The raised EPS guidance for 2017 indicates a bullish trend in the days ahead. Further, the company's consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve.Meanwhile, IDEXX continues to demonstrate solid growth globally buoyed by strong international expansion. The company is currently observing strong growth on the back of companion animal group (CAG) revenues in emerging markets such as China and Brazil.Management also believes that the unprecedented wave of innovation will immensely benefit the company's CAG platform, in the near as well as long term. These innovations include the recently launched Catalyst One, SDMA and SediVue.While IDEXX's share price outperformed the broader market over the last three months, its valuation looks stretched in terms of price-to-earnings ratio (P/E - F12M) when compared with its own industry. The stock currently trades at a P/E ratio of 50.5 compared with 27.7 for the broader industry. In fact, the industry's current P/E has been close to the stock's upper level in the last three months.The company's high dependence on third-party distributors continues to pose threat. Moreover, foreign currency fluctuations are expected to consistently hurt IDEXX's growth.IDEXX competes with several companies in the animal health space. Its companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and in-clinic product providers. Its major competitors in the CAG business in North America are Antech Diagnostics, Abaxis, Inc. and Heska Corporation. Moreover, competitive landscape in the overseas market weighs on IDEXX.

The January-March quarter was quite impressive, courtesy of better economic conditions, bullish earnings forecasts and optimism over the Trump's policies.In the first quarter, the Dow and Nasdaq gained 4.5% and 9.8%, respectively. The S&P 500 recorded an increase of 5.5%, its strongest first-quarter performance since 2013. Backed by Donald Trump's surprise victory, the benchmark indexes were in the green for the quarter. However, U.S.  recorded their worst quarterly loss (of 5.7%) since late 2015 owing to resurgence of exploration and production by U.S. shale payers.This was in sharp contrast to stocks' losses during March. Over the last month, the Dow and S&P 500 declined by 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. In contrast, the Nasdaq recorded a 1.5% increase. The first-quarter rally slowed this month, after the Trump administration took a hit following the failure to secure adequate votes to pass a new health care bill through the House of Representatives.The Trump administration suffered a major setback after the health care bill intended to repeal and replace Obamacare was pulled from the House on Mar 24, once it became clear that there will not be enough votes to pass the bill. The House was initially scheduled to vote on the new law on Mar 23 but the vote was postponed amid concerns regarding the bill failing to garner enough support.The quarterly gains were mainly driven by the strong performance in January and February. In January, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq recorded increases of 0.5%, 1.8% and 4.3%, respectively. This marked the third consecutive monthly gain for the major benchmarks. Forecasts of improved economic growth and bullish corporate earnings helped U.S. stocks log their first monthly gains in five years. (For more details:  )The performance in February were even stronger with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq recording increases of 4.8%, 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively. We believe that the growing optimism about Trump's economic agenda was the main reason for the improvement. In particular, Trump's promise to bring back millions of jobs to the U.S. caught investors' attention. (For more details:  )Despite skepticism about the sustainability of Trump's trade policy, economic data has remained encouraging. We believe that it was the driving force for the recent gains.The ISM Manufacturing Index, which gauges the economic activity in the manufacturing, has risen in all the three months of the concluded quarter. Its services counterpart also displayed improvement. Though retail sales have displayed a similar trend, its last increase of 0.1% was relatively muted.The U.S. economy registered growth of 2.1% in fourth-quarter 2016. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-third of the economic activity, was revised upward. In fact, consumer spending grew 3.5% in the quarter. Moreover, corporate profits increased, indicating economy strength in early 2017.Employers added almost half a million jobs in the first two months of 2017. As many as 235,000 new jobs were created in February. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in February from 4.8% in January. Also, wages for American workers increased 0.2% in February to $26.09 an hour. (For more details:  )Selecting lucrative stocks in view of the impressive developments is not an easy task.

These mixed sentiments justify the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Coming back to the news, we feel the acquisition of Caesarea Medical's expands BD's infusion portfolio to include ambulatory, home and specialty acute care infusion pumps. This is because Caesarea Medical designs, manufactures and markets a range of infusion and syringe pumps as well as related accessories and disposable administration sets for both homecare and hospital settings. Its infusion pumps holds a leading position in markets for specialty applications such as IV and epidural anesthesia and pain management, hospital and home nutrition.Based in Franklin Lakes, NJ, Becton, Dickinson is a medical technology company engaged principally in the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices, instrument systems and reagents.Going forward, BD's focus on product launches is a significant catalyst in our view.

We note that the company addresses both tier 1 and mid-tier markets with its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products.Separately, Varian recently won a competitive bid to provide advanced radiotherapy technology and the Eclipse treatment planning system to six major hospitals in Shanghai.We are particularly upbeat about Varian's recent takeover of the Medical Imaging business of PerkinElmer. Considering the bountiful opportunities for diagnostic imaging in the global space, this development is a significant positive for long-term growth.On the flipside, increasing local competition is a primary headwind.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We believe that Cerner has solid growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) suite of solutions. In fact, the segment has been a strong contributor in 2016 with RevWorks services posting a solid performance. In fact, for the full year, the segment witnessed 19% revenue growth and record level of bookings.The next biggest driver of growth for Cerner is its Population Health (PH) Management platform. Notably, the company clinched a high number of large contracts for the PH platform in the last reported quarter.Cerner offers exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company had won contracts in the U.K. as well as the Middle East. Furthermore, Cerner constantly pursues complementary business acquisitions that enable it to expand its solutions, device offerings and services.On the flipside, Cerner operates in the HCIT space which is intensely competitive and fast evolving, subjecting it to rapid technological changes. Bigwigs like Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Epic Systems, GE Healthcare Technologies, McKesson Corp, Quality Systems and others pose competitive threat to Cerner in the niche area.Cerner's share price movement has been quite impressive in the past three months. The company gained 24.9%, higher than the Zacks categorized Medical information-systems sub-industry's return of 17.9%.On the flip side, the estimate revision trend for the current fiscal remains unfavorable with 11 estimates moving south over the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction. The company's current estimates slipped 3.3% over the past two months.Notably, over the last four trailing quarters, the stock posted a negative earnings surprise of almost 0.5%.

Lately, however, the market has lost a bit of that mojo, and profits are harder to come by. Source: For instance: Despite a nearly 6% gain for the index overall as of this writing, only about 20 stocks in the  are up more than 25% since Jan. 1 and only a single constituent of the index is up more than 40%.Those stocks are still sitting on great gains in three months' time, don't get me wrong. But at this time in 2016, we saw four stocks sitting on 40% gains or greater - that, despite a roughly 1% gain for the S&P 500 from Jan. 1, 2016 to March 31, 2016.So which stocks are the ones that actually have put up those outsized gains in 2017? The list is all over the place, with a mix of homebuilders, biotech stocks and even a utility thrown in there.Take a look at the top performers of Q1: Semiconductors 31.2% (NASDAQ:  ) has a market cap of about $18 billion, and is one of the few smaller-sized semiconductor companies that still exist in this age of acquisitions within the sector.But even if a deal isn't forthcoming immediately, regular double-digit revenue growth and continued earnings expansion show Skyworks is still a well-run company with something offer.As such, investors have been eager to buy into this growing chipmaker with hopes of another leg up if an acquisition materializes with a nice buyout premium on top of current share prices. Veterinary equipment and supplies 31.8% (NASDAQ:  ) may sound like a conventional pharma company at first glance, but it's actually an impressive niche play based on its focus on pet products and animal treatments.Anyone who has a pet knows firsthand that surgery or intensive veterinary procedures can be quite costly \u2026 but they also would likely agree that pets are like family and worth the expense.In addition to diagnostic tools for vets, Idexx also serves livestock and poultry farmers to protect the health of their herds and flocks. The growth story is good, with revenue set to climb another 8% this year to almost $2 billion - but profits are even more impressive, with earnings set to grow 20%.Without a lot of good growth options out there, IDXX is attracting investors for good reason in 2017. Semiconductors 31.8% (NASDAQ:  ) designs and manufactures semiconductors, mainly in the arena of flash memory systems.Though it's a serious player with a market cap of about $32 billion, as we've seen in recent years with big-time acquisitions such as the $47 billion acquisition of  (NASDAQ:  ) by  (NASDAQ:  ), it is more than digestible via by a larger company looking to consolidate power in the sector.Micron's flash memory operations are attractive in and of themselves in addition to operations that can be streamlined with economies of scale, and investors are clearly expecting more buyouts within the sector - and a nice pop for Micron when it becomes an inevitable target. Casinos 32.4%Casino operator  (NASDAQ:  ) used to trade for almost $250 a share in 2014, back when its Asia operations were booming. But as recently as January, it traded for less than $90 a share thanks in part to growth troubles overseas and the big debts taken on by Wynn to finance growth.But now, Wynn revenue is bouncing back in a big way after some impressive earnings and sales growth; This year, revenue should jump 23% year-over-year and earnings should jump 26%. The company's Wynn Palace resort just opened in the newer, upscale Cotai region of Macau and could fuel even further upside.Sure, WYNN may not get to where it was a few years ago \u2026 but the momentum is clearly higher in 2017. Media 32.8% (NASDAQ:  ) is the media titan behind cable networks including MTV, Comedy Central and Spike, as well as the Paramount Studios movie division. The company has struggled mightily over the past couple of years, and VIAB stock has been more than halved amid management woes that resulted in Sumner Redstone announcing in late 2016 that he would step down from the board of directors.Now, VIAB isn't just in recovery mode - it's surging through the first three months of 2017, led by optimism about new CEO Bob Bakish, who was installed this past November. And in February, Bakish revealed a turnaround plan that includes pushing more resources toward - and better integrating Paramount with - the aforementioned cable networks.Viacom also has been getting a push from general bullishness in media stocks driven by Donald Trump's presidential election victory. Biotechnology 33.3%Biotech player  (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the top performers in the S&P 500 so far this year thanks to a steady march higher in the wake of some very strong earnings performances lately.In 2016, EPS soared to 54 cents from just 3 cents in 2015 thanks in large part to the success of its Jakafi medication that treats blood disorders. Drug sales continue to impress in 2017, too, leading to chatter about a possible takeover by a larger pharmaceutical player.But even if that deal doesn't materialize, investors are still eager to own INCY stock because of its impressive earnings and revenue expansion in recent quarters. Genetics 33.3% (NASDAQ:  ) is a genetic analysis company that is increasing demand as more doctors and drug companies are using DNA and gene therapies in their normal course of operation.The company is a great mix of both a reliable business in the near term, with about $2.65 billion in revenue projected this year, and future growth thanks to the popularity of genetic sequencing and its big investments in continued innovation within the field. The margins are fantastic, too, with one of its most recent products, the NovaSeq 6000, being listed at a price of $985,000!Eventually, technological disruption and competition will drive down pricing over time. But for now, investors are cashing in nicely on ILMN stock. Video Games 38.1%Software company  (NASDAQ:  ) has seen very strong performance lately as it continues to prove that it is the go-to video game studio in a digital world where the distribution rules have changed. Games like  and  boast loyal followings, and new titles like  are growing in popularity and providing an influx of new customers.But it's not just the players that matter, but also the methodology ATVI uses to fuel in-game purchases - transactions that totaled a mind-blowing  last quarter.While much is uncertain about the future of entertainment in a digital age, one thing is clear: Activision Blizzard has strong titles and a strong business model to get gamers to spend money. That has cheered investors and lifted the stock dramatically lately. Biotechnology 48.4% (NASDAQ:  ), like most other pharma and biotech stocks, received a huge bid related to the fate of a single drug.In this case, VRTX shot into this list with a massive bump in the last few days of the quarter. On March 29, the company received positive results from a late-stage trial of its cystic-fibrosis drug, a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor. The treatment was successfully tested in a 24-week study, and Vertex will now try to seek regulatory approval in both the U.S. and the European Union.Interestingly, Vertex's treatment is something of a \"replacement\" for its own current cystic-fibrosis drug, Orkambi, which the company already markets, but has struggled to sell well thanks to various side effects. Utilities 52.6%Utility stock  (NYSE:  ) isn't exactly one of the names you'd expect to see on top of the S&P. After all, utilities are highly regulated and geographically limited, so they don't experience a lot of growth in normal times.However, NRG ran into some hard times and a long stretch of unprofitability that caused shares to plummet from almost $40 a share at their peak in 2014 to a 52-week low under $10 recently.But as is the way of Wall Street, activist investors at Hedge fund  and private equity firm  took big stakes and teamed up to push for \"numerous opportunities to significantly increase shareholder value.\" That means looking for assets to sell or even a deal for the whole company, and other investors looking to get in on that potential windfall have bid up shares dramatically as a result.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eading provider of dialysis products and services,  , announced the acquisition of 70% equity interest in Kunming Wuhua Health Hospital in China.

The estimates for 2018 have also gone down by 5% to $4.40 per share.The year 2016 was challenging for the company as it invested in new businesses for diversification. The investments made by the company might affect its quarter-over-quarter performance, before starting to bear fruit.Lesser number of births across the country has been decelerating the growth of one of the company's core businesses, neonatology.Mednax's bottom-line growth has also been hit by a spike in its interest expenses by almost 160% in 2014 as well as in 2015 and by 173% in 2016. This has led to a faster increase in expenses than revenue growth. It is to be noted that the company's operating expenses have grown more than revenues since 2011.

Per management, adjusted operating expenses are expected between 15% and 18% of net revenues for 2017.

Intuitive Surgical reported stellar fourth-quarter 2016 results, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts.

System sales increased 2.3% to $235.9 million buoyed by higher revenues from operating lease activities.

IDEXX has gained 26.61% over the past three months compared with 7.15% of the broader industry. The raised EPS (earnings per share) guidance for 2017 indicates a bullish trend going forward.

International instrument placement performance continues to be very strong including initial instruments placements of SediVue in the U.K. and Australia.Management believes that an unprecedented wave of innovations, which IDEXX already boasts and plans to bring to the market on a larger scale, will immensely benefit the company. These innovations include the recently launched Catalyst One, SDMA and SediVue. The company's strong revenue growth outlook is supported by expectations for 10.5-11.5% organic growth in CAG.However, on the flip side, IDEXX's valuation looks a bit stretched at this moment in terms of price-to-earnings ratio (P/E - F12M) when compared with its own industry.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["anvers, MA-based  , a leading medical product developer, recently announced that a new study has been published in Circulation Research (a biweekly medical journal).

Meanwhile, Republicans have proposed a new draft legislation - The American Healthcare Act (AHA) - to replace Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA).The Republicans' draft legislation, if enacted, will lead to a massive decline in the number of insured people. However, on the brighter side, this alternative paves way for radical changes like eliminating the 'devastating' 2.3% medical devices taxes, which were once mandated under Obamacare. To put it briefly, medical taxes were levied on 'gross sales' and not on profits of medical device companies.Overall, Trump's Obamacare replacement proposal is disappointing to a certain degree. According to Business Insider, several statistical reports estimate that around 6-10 million Americans will lose insurance coverage under the new healthcare act. Furthermore, recently the U.S. Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation have projected that around 24 million people will be uninsured by 2026, if the new act, i.e. AHA is signed into law.As the major insurance coverage expansion of Obamacare fades, the healthcare expenses of low-to-middle-class Americans will tend to shoot up as an immediate and direct effect. Thus, it would be difficult for the uninsured-customer base to opt for the expensive cutting-edge products and technology, denting the demand for unmet health care services. Undoubtedly, this poses a major threat in the demand cycles of cutting edge healthcare products.To substantiate this, the latest data from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services suggests that the latest national health expenditure growth has decelerated from 5.8% in 2015 to 4.8% in 2016, thanks to the sentiments fuelled by consumer apprehensions \"What if Obamacare goes away?\"One of the greatest boons of abolishing Obamacare will be the eradication of medical device taxes. Such high taxes forced companies to lay off employees, limit research and development activities and reduce capital investment. Furthermore, AdvaMed, a leading American medical device trade association, had referred the medical device tax as a 'significant drag on medical innovation'. Notably, small device companies suffered the most.Amid such worries, a repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to resume an aggressive pace of hiring and investment among the 9,000 U.S.-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor confidence on the stocks.The mixed sentiment prevailing in the medical device community has compelled the investment world to act bearish. Per Trump, the democrats had designed a \"lousy healthcare\" model. But how his complete renovation with a new set of streamlined rules will benefit the sector overall, is still unclear.We believe stocks with strong fundamentals that also have a significant share of their business overseas may well brace themselves in this conundrum.

The Water segment's revenues grew 8.8% organically to $27.9 million, primarily boosted by double-digit gains in international markets.Third-quarter LPD revenues, however, decreased 2.5% organically to $29.8 million as strong growth in China and Brazil was offset by lower levels of testing related to European bovine disease eradication programs and reduced health herd screening in Asia.

That was the largest gain in four months and was considerably higher than the expected 197,000 new jobs. While that was a bright spot, hourly wages rose a less than impressive 0.1% to $26 an hour -- but the past 12 months have still seen wages rising faster than since the recovery from the recession.In other news, here are a handful of companies that made big headlines or big moves last week in the markets.Image source: Getty Images.The headlines in regard to  's(NASDAQ: AMZN) fourth quarter were, in my opinion, a complete eye-roller. Amazon's revenue during the fourth quarter increased a hefty 22% to $43.7 billion, compared with last year's $35.7 billion. But neither the headlines nor the market paid any attention to the strong 22% gain, focusing instead on the fact that Amazon missed consensus analysts' estimates of $44.7 billion.The market also shrugged off the fact that Amazon's operating income jumped 13% to $1.3 billion and that its net income soared 55% up to $749 million. Moreover, earnings per share checked in with a 54% jump from the prior year's fourth quarter up to $1.54 per share.It's easy to imagine the frustration from long-term investors who watched the market send Amazon shares lower simply because the company didn't meet the expectations of analysts who don't run the business. But this is the world we live in, and the markets we trade in.At least one analyst had a positive outlook. Robert Drbul of Guggenheim put a price target of $950 on Amazon and had this to say on CNBC's  : \"We think from the forecast and the future, we still have 20-plus-percent growth in '17 and '18 and even higher growth in the AWS piece of it,\" referring to Amazon Web Services.Just about any company in the market would love the have the \"problems\" Amazon is having at this point, because growing revenue 22% from a base of $35.7 billion is staggering. Despite the \"miss,\" and a slightly lower share price, Amazon is not a company to bet against.Shares of  (NASDAQ: IDXX) , a company that primarily develops, manufactures, and distributes diagnostic products and equipment for pets and livestock, had a great week, with shares soaring roughly 16%. The driving forces behind the surge were stronger-than-anticipated fourth-quarter earnings and 2017 earnings guidance that increased by eight pennies, to between $2.85 and $3.01 per share.Starting from the top, revenue during the quarter moved 11% higher to $443 million, compared with the prior year, thanks to the company's tests for companion animals, which increased 13%. That showing topped consensus estimates of $435 million. Management also posted 3,167 premium instrument placements, good for 15% growth year over year.On the bottom line, IDEXX's earnings per share checked in at $0.58 during the fourth quarter, a 21% gain over the prior year and a 33% increase on a constant currency basis. That was also a significant beat, as analysts were expecting earnings per share of only $0.51 during the fourth quarter. Full-year EPS came in at $2.44, a 19% jump over the prior year, and a 25% jump on a constant currency basis.It was a strong fourth quarter that put the finishing touches on an excellent year, and one look at this next graph should excite investors -- because such a lead in R&D suggests that more strong quarters and top-of-the-line products are on the way.Image source: IDEXX Laboratories' Raymond James presentation.It's no secret that a majority of clothing retailers have really struggled in recent months and years. Some have had a hard time adapting to changing consumer preferences, while others have been crushed by their inability to compete online.  (NYSE: RL) could be the next victim, as shares fell 13% last week and have shed half their value over the past three years.The surprise last week stunned analysts: Less than two years after taking the reins at Ralph Lauren, CEO Stefan Larsson announced that he will depart. The unexpected move is reportedly the result of a rift between Larsson and the company's founder, who didn't agree on business strategy going forward. analyst Ike Boruchow had this to say, according to  : \"While RL certainly isn't a 'one man show,' we expect investors likely have questions around the reality of the turnaround without the leader who developed it. This is especially true considering Larsson was perceived to be one of the top retail leaders in the industry and a key confidence builder for investors given the difficult turnaround RL has ahead of them.\"All of that drama aside, Ralph Lauren reported that sales were down 12% during its fiscal third quarter, compared with the prior year. Earnings fell a staggering 37% on a reported basis, though that figure came down to 18% when adjusting for restructuring and other costs.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

The test can detect abnormalities as early as 10 weeks during a pregnancy.A glimpse of the company's price trend reveals that the stock has had an unimpressive run on the bourse year to date. OPKO Health registered a negative return of almost 16.34% versus the 7.12% approximate positive return of the Zacks categorized  sub-industry.Along with the bearish price trend, estimate revision for the stock has been dismal.

As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year currently stands at a loss of 14 cents. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Coming back to the news, the newly launched prenatal test is christened ClariTest. It was developed in an in-house lab based in New Jersey. The test, as per the company, registered one of the lowest failure rates among similar screening tools in the market. It also reduces the need for more invasive testing methods which carry risks like pregnancy loss.According to management, with prenatal testing emerging as a rapidly evolving area of medicine, such new product launches will augment the company's revenue stream. Moreover, per the research firm Research and Markets, the global prenatal testing market is growing at a CAGR of 28.85% from 2016 to 2022 and is estimated to grow over $7.2 billion by 2022. Thus we believe that the company is moving in the right direction to extract higher profits from its testing business. Additionally, OPKO Health's long-term growth fundamentals are strong.

Revenues increased 11% on both a reported and organic basis, driven by 12% reported and organic growth in global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues.Region-wise, IDEXX witnessed a 12.2% (both on reported and organic basis) rise in U.S. revenues to $267.7 million in the reported quarter.In the international market, the company's sales increased 8.8% year over year to $175.2 million (up 10.8% on an organic basis).IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD), and Other.In the fourth quarter, revenues improved 12.9% (up 14% organically) to $379.5 million. The Water segment's revenues inched up 0.8% (up 3% organically) to $24.3 million. LPD revenues, however, decreased 1.2% (down 1% organically) to $32.9 million. Meanwhile, revenues at the Other segment grew 0.9% to $6.1 million.Gross profit increased 10.5% to $240.6 million in the reported quarter.

Research and development expenses declined a slight 0.3% to $25.4 million.

Full-year net operating cash flow came in at $334.5 million, compared with $216.3 million a year ago.IDEXX has reaffirmed its full-year 2017 organic revenue growth outlook at 9%-10.5% and raised its EPS guidance to $2.85-$3.01 from the earlier range of $2.35-$2.39 supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The raised EPS guidance reflects 7 cents per share of sustained improvement from higher than expected 2016 operating profits, as well as from higher estimated EPS benefits related to the implementation of the new accounting standard for the tax benefit of employee share-based compensation, which offset impacts from updated foreign exchange estimates.IDEXX posted impressive results with earnings and revenues comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. Solid organic revenue growth buoys optimism. The company's raised EPS guidance for 2017 also buoys optimism.During the reported quarter, the company attained an important milestone by entering into the S&P 500 category. Per management, the fourth quarter and full-year outperformance is on account of its innovative programs to improve the standard of care for pets and to drive growth of veterinary services. In 2016, the company placed a record number of premium chemistry instruments, premium hematology instruments and 1,575 IDEXX SediVueDx instruments, the industry's first-and-only in-house urine sediment analyzer.However, foreign currency fluctuations are expected to continue to hurt the company's operating results, although lower than the extent expected earlier.IDEXX currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NASDAQ: IDXX) was up almost 14% at 3:33 p.m. EST after announcing better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and raising its 2017 earnings guidance.Revenue during the quarter increased 11% year over year on the back of the company's tests for companion animals, which grew 13%. The number of instruments sold increased 15% year over year, while the growing installed base helped drive a 17% jump in sales of the consumables used in the instruments. Revenue from laboratory tests performed by IDEXX -- rather than in the veterinarian's office -- increased 12% year over year. The only downside to the segment was for IDEXX's rapid assay products, which only grew 6% year over year.Tests for livestock, poultry, and dairy were down 1%, but fortunately this group makes up an ever-shrinking amount of IDEXX's revenue. The water-testing segment grew 1%, but it's even smaller.The increased sales help IDEXX increase operating margins, allowing earnings to grow faster than revenue. In the fourth quarter, earnings per share increased 21% year over year to $0.58. For the year, that put earnings at $2.44 per share, substantially higher than the guidance of $2.35 to $2.39 per share announced at the end of the third quarter.Management maintained its previously announced revenue guidance of $1.91 billion to $1.935 billion, but increased its guidance for earnings per share because of new accounting standards. The company is now looking for 2017 earnings per share in the $2.85 to $3.01 range, a 17% to 23% increase over last year's earnings.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(You can see  ). We have highlighted some of the key details from the just-released announcement below: The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 51 cents per share. IDEXX's reported fourth-quarter earnings per share came in at 58 cents, an increase of 21% year-over-year. On a constant currency adjusted basis, this figure improved 33% year over year after accounting for an adverse 6 cents per share impact related to net changes in foreign exchange.Full year reported fourth-quarter earnings per share came in at $2.44, an increase of 19% year-over-year. On a constant currency adjusted basis, this figure improved 25% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year EPS is pegged at $2.37. |  IDEXX posted revenues of $442.9 million, which has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $436 million by 1.5%.Full year revenues came in at $1.77 billion which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of full-year 2016 revenue. : Among its four business segments, IDEXXdelivered fourth-quarter revenues of $379.5 million (up 13%) in CAG, $24.3 million (up 1%) in Water, $ 32.9million (down 1%) Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD)and $1.76 billion (up 0.9%) in Other. : Management seemed upbeat about its graduation in the category of S&P 500. The company's fourth quarter and full year performance displayed the power of innovation to improve the standard of care for pets and drive the growth of veterinary services.

Further, IDEXX's earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past four quarters, the average beat being 13.52%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.In the third quarter of 2016, despite strong growth in China and Brazil, IDEXX's Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) segment saw a slight decline in organic revenues on account of low levels of testing related to European bovine disease eradication programs and reduced health herd screening in Asia. This unfavorable scenario is expected to linger in the quarters ahead, impacting the fourth quarter's LPD performance. | Moreover, foreign currency fluctuations are expected to hurt IDEXX's growth in the future. In the guidance issued earlier, management had assumed that the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar will impact 2016 revenues by less than 1%. Further, the company estimated that these foreign exchange rate changes will dent 2016 earnings by 20 cents.We note that the company's high reliance on third-party distributors is a major dampener. Also, the purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, stiff competition is a major concern. Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance. This struggle to gain market share might also prove to be a drag on results.On the brighter side, investors are positive about the company recent addition to the coveted S&P 500 benchmark. IDEXX is also currently leading the Companion Animal Group (CAG) market. The company boasts advanced innovation including the recently launched Catalyst One, SDMA and SediVue. Management efforts to strengthen in the CAG market are expected to boost results going ahead.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been raking in considerable revenues in the companion animal market of emerging nations such as China and Brazil, demonstrating the substantial long-term potential. Further, management's consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the yet-to-be-reported quarter's performance.For the fourth quarter of 2016, one estimate moved south with no movement in the opposite direction in the past one month. However, the magnitude of the estimate revision trend is indicating a stable picture with earnings estimates remaining stable at 51 cents over the last same time frame. The company's fundamental concerns justifies the inconclusive estimate revision trend.Our quantitative model doesn't point to an earnings beat. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. IDEXX has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.79. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

This developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services, primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets is currently part of the S&P MidCap 400 index.Notably, IDEXX will be replacing St. Jude Medical, Inc. on the S&P 500 index as the latter is set to be acquired by Abbott Labs  , a leading healthcare provider worldwide. IDEXX will be added to the S&P 500 Global Industry Classification Standard Health Care Equipment Sub-Industry index.With a portfolio of 500 leading companies, that have approximately 80% coverage of the available market capitalization, the S&P 500 is an important metric for the U.S. equities. It is no wonder that the index is considered to be 'the best single gauge for large-cap U.S. equities'. It is therefore a big boost for the investors holding shares of IDEXX.IDEXX has been an important player in the Companion Animal Group market. Management believes that an unprecedented wave of innovations, which IDEXX already boasts and plans to bring to the market on a larger scale, will immensely benefit the company. These innovations include the recently launched Catalyst One, SDMA and SediVue.This apart, IDEXX continues to demonstrate solid growth globally with strong international expansion. It continues to observe strong growth in the companion animal revenues in emerging markets such as China and Brazil, demonstrating the substantial long-term growth potential. Given the company's consistent efforts to expand this commercial capability, we expect it to witness similar benefits in the upcoming quarters as well.Further, the company's trend of consistent share buybacks reflects its strong free cash flow reserve. The strategy of disciplined share count reduction has created considerable long-term value for current stockholders. Considering the healthy cash balance, IDEXX's buyback activity represents encouraging prospects for the stakeholders.In this regard we note that IDEXX significantly outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry with respect to share price movement, over the past one year. Although the company posted a mixed third quarter with revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate, solid organic revenue growth buoys optimism. The company's raised earnings per share guidance for 2016 also indicates a bullish trend, going forward. Per the last share price movement, IDEXX surged 63.2% over the past one year compared with 1.24% gain of the broader industry.IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(Symbol: IDXX) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $121.20/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the July put at the $100 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.05. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2% return against the $100 commitment, or a 4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to IDXX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $100 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Idexx Laboratories, Inc. sees its shares decline 17.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $97.95 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.05 from $100), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $100 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the July put at the $100 strike for the 4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Idexx Laboratories, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $121.20) to be 25%.

Year to date, the company represented a gain of 17.78%, while the S&P 500 rose 11.00%.Notably, an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 16.67% indicates the stock's solid potential for further price appreciation in the near future. However, the current year estimate trend for the stock is dismal, with one estimate going down in the past two months and no upward revision. Neogen's current year estimates have inched down to $1.12 over the past two months.Coming back to the deal, the acquisition strengthens Neogen's biosecurity business which was initiated in 2003 with the acquisition of rodenticides, cleaners and disinfectants from ConAgra.Rogama provides pest control products to Brazil's agronomic, professional and retail markets. The company is also a major supplier to public health agencies, including a long-term partnership with the Pan American Health Organization. Its annual revenues were approximately $8 million.The acquisition will strengthen Neogen's rodenticide business and fortify its footprint overseas.

Unfortunately, with that territory often come more highly valued and potentially overvalued stocks. With that in mind, here are three phenomenal companies that should be on smart investors' shopping lists in case a stock market dip provides a buying opportunity.Image source: Getty Images. (NASDAQ: IDXX) doesn't operate in the sexiest markets and thus consistently flies under the radar of most investors. The company develops, manufactures, and distributes products and services for small-animal veterinary; livestock, poultry, and dairy health; and water testing.One of the most impressive metrics from IDEXX Labs is its sustainable recurring revenue. In 2010, 81% of total IDEXX revenue was recurring, and that's only increased in the following years, reaching 87% in 2015. The company's heavy spending on research and development helps fuel innovation, which has helped generate strong return on invested capital -- and has sent its stock price soaring.There are a couple of factors that should continue fueling IDEXX's business moving forward. First, according to the company, between 1980 and 2015, veterinary services spending has outpaced total personal consumption spending, with a compound annual growth rate of 8.9% over that time period, while the CAGR for total personal consumption was 5.7%.Image source: IDEXX investor day presentation.If IDEXX's recent U.S. pet owner survey is any indication, this is a trend that looks set to continue: 61% of millennials (19 to 35 years old) responded that they are willing to make financial trade-offs -- going out for food or entertainment less -- in order to pay for pets' products and services.That compares favorably to the 50% of baby boomers (52 to 70 years old) who responded similarly. T he survey also showed that more consumers buy toys for their pets now than a decade ago, and more pets sleep in their owners' beds. These may sound like trivial questions, but the answers show that the bond between human and pet is growing stronger, which bodes well for IDEXX as 85% of last year's revenue came from its companion animal group (CAG) business.The above figures merely scratch the surface of a boring but promising company. It has multiple avenues for growth, including international business expansion as well as cross-selling products and services. Case in point: The company's new SediVue veterinary instrument, a faster, more consistent and accurate urine analyzer, which is doing well in North America and is launching abroad by year-end, should boost revenue in the years ahead. In fact, in part thanks to SediVue, IDEXX's premium diagnostic instrument placements grew 18% during the third quarter, which helped drive organic revenue 15% higher. data by  .One thing to love about Mobileye is that while it depends on a highly competitive and cyclical automotive industry, its business doesn't require substantial capital investments in equipment or tooling like a traditional auto parts supplier does. Because of that, the company was able to produce a spectacular gross margin of 75% in 2015 with EBITDA margin at 52% and an adjusted return on invested capital above 40%.There's no question that driverless vehicles can save time, fuel, and, most important, lives. For those reasons, driverless vehicles will become a reality, and if Mobileye can continue to innovate systems and technology to make them better, it stands to hugely reward shareholders down the road.Image source: Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. (NYSE: RBA) dominates as the world's largest auctioneer of industrial and agricultural equipment. It's the in-person, and now online, version of  for massive industrial equipment and trucks. The company generates almost all of its revenue from unreserved auctions in which it charges commission to sellers and a fee to buyers, which generally combine to be 11%-12% of the equipment's final sale price, according to Morningstar -- not a bad day's work.2016 was a busy year for the company, as its stock price jumped roughly 40% and it sold $4.3 billion of equipment, a new annual record, with a 2% increase in gross auction proceeds compared to the prior year. Of that, $2.1 billion of equipment was sold to online buyers, which accounts for about 49% of total sales. Online sales have been a focus of RBA, as it was the next logical step to increasing its number of buyers globally through multiple channels, and they help attract even more global sellers -- a virtuous cycle and network effect, if you will.Despite RBA already being the market leader, the growth potential through stealing customers from competitors due to its network effect, or simply through the best acquisition options, is massive thanks to the fragmented nature of the auction industry. RBA's $4.3 billion in sales this year pales in comparison to the total estimated global equipment market size of $360 billion, according to RBA's September investor presentation.Ritchie Bros. is well positioned to accelerate its online strategy with the acquisition of IronPlanet, an online marketplace for used heavy equipment, and continues to return value to shareholders with consistently increasing dividends and reduced share count. It's also positioned atop a highly fragmented industry where it can pick cream-of-the-crop acquisitions to best increase value for the company and shareholders. In other words, it's in quite a good spot for investors if its December price dip continues.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["enver, CO-based  , a leading provider of dialysis services announced that HealthCare Partners Nevada, a unit within its medical group, has acquired WellHealth Quality Care, Nevada's 'first and only' commercial accountable care network.

Notably, the current year estimate for the stock edged up by a penny to $3.76 per share over the past month.According to DaVita, the consolidated company would exclusively focus on the quality of care and cost efficiencies of the already existing value-based health care model in the U.S. It is to be noted here that WellHealth is a Nevada-based private medical organization having a wide network covering various specialties (including anesthesiology and an OB-GYN network). | Per management, the latest development strengthens DaVita's goal of building 'the leading independent medical group in America'. In this regard, DaVita recently announced a joint venture with Inspira Health Network to expand dialysis services at the Bridgeton, Millville and Vineland centers of South Jersey.Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers has been DaVita's preferred business strategy so far.

Additionally, the stock promises an earnings yield of 3.68% compared with the industry's yield of 1.31%.Going forward, we believe that the focus of the company on acquiring new clients will help WebMD Health gain market traction, which will lead to increased business. It has been a story of constant achievements for the company which provides advertising and sponsorship solutions to targeted demographics and licenses private portal services to employers and health plans.Based in New York, NY, WebMD Health is a leading provider of health information services, serving consumers, physicians, healthcare professionals, employers, and health plans through public and private online portals, mobile platforms and health-focused publications.We believe the company is well positioned to capitalize on growth and major changes that are currently driving the healthcare industry. We also believe that the recent changes in Capitol Hill would make the company's core areas of expertise i.e. the online audience of healthcare consumers and physicians in the U.S. health information market space more geared toward growth.However, the company's top line is heavily dependent on the advertising and sponsorship budgets of brands at pharmaceutical manufacturers. This we believe is a major overhang on the company.

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Wal-Mart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. All right. David Kretzmann, you're up first. What are you looking at this week? : I'm looking at National Beverage, ticker FIZZ. This is the beverage company behind soft drink brands like Shasta and Faygo, little offbeat brands. Then, they're also rapidly growing in the sparkling water category with its LaCroix brands. The sales are up 14% and net income up 60% in the latest quarter. Company has really bizarre press releases, so the CEO Nick Caporella, in the latest press release, he says \"The company is in the cockpit of innovation with a yoke in our hands.\" That's National Beverage. : I'm speechless. Steve wants everybody to know that he's a hobby pilot. Doesn't he? : I guess. : Steve, question about National Beverage? : What is the difference between Crush and Fanta? : Man, I have no ... That's over my pay grade, Steve. You have to go somewhere else. : One teaspoon of sugar. That LaCroix water thing, this was on my radar a year or so ago. It's baffling to me because I grew up in northern Minnesota and that was the spring water before everybody was drinking spring water, we have it at the cabin and it was just what you got at the Piggly Wiggly with your Old Dutch potato chips. Suddenly, everyone tells me this is popular. Yeah, it's like finding out that your high school is the favorite high school of the United States or something. : Seth Jayson, what are you looking at this week? : Geez, almost everything in the RV business it looks like. We have Thor Industries reported recently that their sales were, well, they were up huge, but they had just purchased Jayco. They're still growing trailer and RV sales in the neighborhood of somewhere in the low 20% range, high teens and they're getting huge bookings and a lot of this was lower priced small RVs so the Martins are changing a little bit. On the other hand, people seem to be buying a ton of RVs and I think they're going to keep buying a ton of RVs for the next couple few years. : The ticker? : Thor Industries is THO. : Steve? Where does recurring revenue come from with an RV company? : Recurring revenue is harder to come by for somebody who makes the RVs themselves. If you want recurring revenue in the RV industry, you need to look at  , which makes aftermarket parts as well as original equipment parts. : Simon Erickson, what are you looking at? : Chris, I'm going with Idexx Laboratories, ticker is IDXX. They are the world's largest manufacturer of tests and services for the veterinarian market. Needless to say, I think this is the top dog in the space ... Awww ... They control nearly 40% market share -- sorry about that everyone -- in the companion animal market. Because they've got these established relationships with the vets already, about 87% of revenue is recurring in nature. Really like to see that for a business. : Steve? : Who really pays for this? Is it the consumer? Is it the vet? Who's paying for this stuff? : Largely the consumer right now, Steve, but we are starting to see veterinary insurance picking up as a trend in recent years. : Steve, you got a stock you like? : I want to go RVing with Seth Jayson. : I want a video of your adventure. : That would be a great trip. : Road trip. Road trip. : Steve, let's ditch the kids and do this. : All right. That's going to do it for this week's addition of Motley Fool Money. Thanks for listening.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eadquartered in Deerfield, IL,  , a global medical technology company, announced a new oral health project in collaboration with Americares, a health-focused relief and development organization.

All these are likely to mar prospects for Cerner going ahead.Coming to the HCIT space, of late the niche market has been gaining prominence, courtesy of latest technologies like EMR (Electronic Medical Record) and Electronic Health Record (EHR).Cerner, a major player in this space, has been facing cut-throat competition from reputed names such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Epic Systems, GE Healthcare Technologies, McKesson Corp, Quality Systems among others. This has impacted the company's pricing and margins to a great extent. Stringent hospital budgets exert further pressure on pricing.As a result, Cerner's projected sales growth is now pegged at 8.65%, much lower than the industry average of 18.5%.However, we are upbeat about Cerner's Revenue Cycle management and Population Health platforms. The platforms posted strong results in the quarter, courtesy of solid sales, inclusion in new EHR deals and solid contribution from RevWorks services (revenue management services).Additionally, a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 14.7% instills some confidence among investors.Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space include HMS Holdings Corp.  , Medidata Solutions Inc.  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  .

The Boston Globe is an American daily newspaper based in Boston, MA.The Boston Globe's \"Top Places to Work\" list focuses on identifying the most progressive companies in Massachusetts. It is based on more than 70,000 employee opinions on direction, execution, connection, management, work, pay, and benefits. athenahealth is ranked #23 within the largest-sized companies category. The company was included in the list owing to its focus on creating a positive work environment to attract and retain employees through a combination of employee satisfaction, working conditions, and company culture.We believe that an impressive product portfolio and a growing physician base continue to serve as the key positives for athenahealth. On the other hand, lack of enterprise-sized deals, winding up of government-funded stimulus and increasing competition pose as major headwinds.The unique business model of athenahealth makes it a strong provider of Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services to small physician practices. The Software as a Service (SaaS) based approach allows for a lower-cost and more flexible delivery mechanism that is expected to help athenahealth win deals.In our opinion, athenahealth will continue to benefit from its extensive athenaCollector client base. Its EHR product is a key player in the ambulatory billing market. The company's updated knowledge base gives its customers real time information that no other competitor has replicated exactly. In addition, the Epocrates acquisition is likely to enhance athenahealth's user network.On the macro level, the HITECH Act, which has authorized the EHR Incentive program or the Meaningful Use program, presents significant opportunities for EHR vendors like athenahealth. | However, as the government-sponsored EHR program winds down over the next few years, it will pose a significant problem for athenahealth. The company also lacks adequate alignment with hospitals, which prevents it from getting enterprise-sized deals.We feel athenahealth's long-term goal of 30% top-line growth is challenging, given the consolidation trend among small physician practices.Currently, athenahealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" announced that it has commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 2 million shares of its common stock.

However, revenues lagged the guided range and also deteriorated on a year-over-year basis.Human Health and Environmental revenues declined massively on a year-over-year basis in the just-reported quarter, due to softer capital equipment end-markets. Additionally, lower-than-estimated sales in the U.S. and Europe caused a drag on Environmental sales.The decline in sales at the Medical Imaging segment raises concern. PerkinElmer faced significant headwinds in the radiochemical and capital-intensive businesses as well.Additionally, management's decision to eliminate certain slower growth segments from the priority list has marred the short-term prospects for PerkinElmer.We believe a sluggish European macro-economic environment and restrained spending and challenges in Japan are also likely to hurt the top line in the near term.Nevertheless, with an enhanced focus on product innovation and expansion into emerging markets like China, PerkinElmer holds considerable promise for the coming quarters.Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space include Cogentix Medical, Inc.  , CryoLife Inc.  and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  .

(Symbol: IDXX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $112.50, changing hands for $113.09/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 4 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $98.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $125.00.

The Software as a Service (SaaS) based approach allows for a lower-cost and more flexible delivery mechanism that is expected to help athenahealth win deals.In our opinion, athenahealth will continue to benefit from its extensive athenaCollector client base. Its EHR product is a key player in the ambulatory billing market. The company's updated knowledge base gives its customers real time information that no other competitor has exactly replicated. In addition, the Epocrates acquisition is likely to enhance athenahealth's user network.On the macro level, the HITECH Act, which has authorized the EHR Incentive program or the Meaningful Use program, presents significant opportunities for EHR vendors like athenahealth.However, as the government-sponsored EHR program winds down over the next few years, it will pose a significant problem for athenahealth.

(Symbol: IDXX) saw new options become available this week, for the November 18th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IDXX options chain for the new November 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $108.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $112.73/share today.Because the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of IDXX stock at the current price level of $112.73/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $115.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.38% if the stock gets called away at the November 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IDXX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing IDXX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $115.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Idexx Laboratories is already the market share-leading maker of pet diagnostic products and sales are growing thanks to owners who are increasingly willing to make sacrifices to pay for healthcare for their pets. Do these tailwinds make Idexx Laboratories worth owning in portfolios?In this clip from The Motley Fool's  podcast, analyst Kristine Harjes and contributor Todd Campbell take a closer look at this promising pet stock and weigh in with their thoughts on whether this is a good time to buy.A full transcript follows the video.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . One more company to add to your watch list is called IDEXX Laboratories. These guys are in the market of animal-health testing and analytics. They mostly do diagnostics within their companion-animal group segment. They also do some tests for livestock and water quality and dairy animals, poultry, that kind of segment. But really, what they do is provide in-house analyzers and diagnostic equipment to these vets, so they can analyze what's going on with your pet. In particular, the in-house segment of that is really intriguing, because if a vet can deliver the results right back to you immediately, that's really sticky. And they do have customer retention of 96% to 99%.It's a win-win-win. It's a win for the vet, because it's greater customer satisfaction, it keeps people coming back, it's a quicker turnover for them. It's a win for the customer, because they can get the answers they're looking for quicker. And, it's a win for IDEXX as well. Again, we're talking about a company that does a fair amount of revenue. This is a company with $1.7 billion in trailing-12-month sales. That's great. It's a profitable company, which is also great for investors to know. Investors may also want to know that this isn't necessarily a cheap stock; this isn't one that's been running under the radar that they can buy on sale. I think the forward P/E ratio for this stock is around 40, so you might want to throw this one on a watch list to see whether or not it pulls back.But I think if you're talking long-term, and you're saying, \"If we understand, as humans, when we go in, we want immediate feedback on what's wrong with us, and we assume pet care is going to be similar -- when we go to the vet, we're going to want to know what's wrong with our cats or dogs as soon as possible\" -- I think that's a really good opportunity for this company to grow over time. Management of the company has said they expect to grow sales 10% annually from here, and their earnings should grow faster than that as they leverage those additional sales. So, this is a fast-growing company. But like you mentioned, it's not exactly a cheap one. They're up 53% year to date. If you got in in January, congratulations -- that's a fantastic return over the last eight months or so. Even just this month, a great second-quarter report pushed this stock up another 13%. Whether or not it's a good time to get in now... you know as well as I do that you never want to try to time the market like that. But this is definitely a company that, for me, I would put it on a watch list and wait for the price to go down a little bit. I agree. I think that makes sense. You want to invest in what you know, but you don't want to blindly invest. The reality is, stocks do go up, and they do go down. A lot of this is going to have to do with your time horizon. I think, overall, the demand for caring for pets globally is on the rise, and that's going to provide natural tailwinds that make all these companies interesting. Exactly. It's the same thing that you see in the human-health market. This is kind of similar. I guess that's why we're talking about it on the  show. This is an industry that is relatively immune to recession, much like you see in human healthcare. It doesn't matter if times are good or bad economically. If you need to take care of a person or a pet that you view as a member of the family, you're going to spend that money.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the SPDR S&P MIDCAP 400 ETF (Symbol: MDY) where we have detected an approximate $82.9 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.5% decrease week over week (from 60,333,476 to 60,033,476).

Investing for the long haul can smooth out the risks of buying individual stocks, which may tumble or stay depressed for ages before taking off.The following three health-focused companies possess attractive long-range prospects: Each should be able to expand its sales and profits at rates well above the market average for years. (Read  to learn about seven more picks outside the health sector.)Investing for the next decade doesn't mean you can buy these stocks then forget about them. You'll need to follow them closely and may have to sell if cracks emerge in the business. Still, if these health companies can keep building on their recent successes, they have a good shot at delivering superb returns over the long run.The business: Celgene makes the cancer-fighting drug Revlimid and other biotech medicines.What will drive growth: Boosted by Revlimid--a drug that modifies the body's immune system to fight cancer--Celgene aims to hit $21 billion in sales in 2020, up from an estimated $11.1 billion in 2016. Initially approved in 2006 as a second-line defense against multiple myeloma, a common type of blood cancer, the drug won approval in 2015 for patients newly diagnosed with the disease, expanding its sales and market potential. Revlimid has also been approved for other uses, and Celgene is now testing it to combat some types of lymphoma and leukemia. Other products in Celgene's lineup include medicines to treat advanced breast cancer and psoriasis. In addition, Celgene expects results in the next few years from more than a dozen late-stage drug trials--a pipeline of potentially new and expanded-use products that looks \"underappreciated,\" says Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The stock: Celgene's P/E has tumbled from 59 times earnings in 2014 to 17 times estimated year-ahead profits. The stock also slid, down 13% in the past year, due to concerns about unsustainably high drug prices and disappointing results in some of Celgene's clinical trials. Still, the shares now look cheap relative to expected earnings growth, estimated at 23% in 2017 and 24% in 2018.See Also: Symbol: Share price: $76.45Market capitalization: $52.8 billion52-week high/low: $61.60 - $82.64Estimated 2016 earnings per share: $3.56Estimated 2017 earnings per share: $3.90Price-earnings ratio: 21Dividend yield: 0.8%The business: Danaher owns 29 businesses, primarily involved in life sciences, dental care, and medical diagnostics.What will drive growth: A perpetual dealmaker, Danaher has bought and sold more than 400 companies since 1984. It now aims to focus on fast-growing products in health care and life sciences. The firm recently spun off a big chunk of its industrial businesses into a separately traded company, Fortive (  ), and announced plans to buy medical diagnostics company Cepheid for $4 billion. That follows up on a 2015 deal to buy medical toolmaker Pall for $13.8 billion. The risk with Danaher is that it could overpay for growth. But its freewheeling ways have paid off: Over the past 15 years through September 14, Danaher's shares returned 14.3% annualized, more than double the 6.7% annualized gain of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index (both figures include dividends).The stock: Analysts see sales climbing 4% to 5% annually over the next two years, hitting $18.3 billion in 2018. Profits should climb faster, though, as Danaher shaves costs and improves the bottom line at companies it buys. Wall Street expects earnings to climb at a 10% annual pace over the next two years.See Also: Symbol: Share price: $108.57Market capitalization: $9.7 billion52-week high/low: $115.06 - $63.08Estimated 2016 earnings per share: $2.36Estimated 2017 earnings per share: $2.68Price-earnings ratio: 41Dividend yield: noneThe business: Idexx sells animal-health diagnostic tools and veterinary hospital instruments. The firm also runs diagnostic labs and tests municipal water systems for contaminants.What will drive growth: A leader in \"dog'nostics,\" Idexx is benefiting from robust spending on veterinary care, which is climbing at about 9% per year in the U.S. With a broadening menu of disposable tests and diagnostic equipment, the firm expects to boost revenues by more than 10% a year and sees profits expanding at a 15% to 20% annualized rate over the next few years. Idexx is also seeking more sales abroad, expanding its livestock diagnostics business in Europe and acquiring a distributor in Brazil.The stock: On a P/E basis, Idexx is one of the most expensive stocks on our list, trading at 41 times estimated year-ahead profits. Credit Suisse, which rates Idexx a \"buy,\" sees the shares climbing only to $122 over the next year. But stick with the stock for the long haul, Credit Suisse advises. Idexx is building a \"comprehensive, innovative product line\" that should fuel double-digit percentage sales growth for years.See Also: The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n basketball, when a player hits a few shots in a row, he is said to have a \"hot hand.\" In finance parlance, we call it \"momentum.\"Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks (i.e. stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times) to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift.At the core, momentum investing works on the principle of \"Buy High, Sell Higher.\"Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. There's a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit, and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum works. For instance, we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses, and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long, hoping that they will regain their original prices. On the other hand, investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they tend to go with the herd and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral issues open up a huge opportunity for momentum players to make profits. So, it's a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Also, unlike other investment styles, momentum premium has stood the test of time, remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s. This is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums (like size and value) become known to public, the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes.Obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child's play. Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over long periods of time and across markets, and we have devised a strategy that will help investors get in on these trades and make handsome gains.We have created a screen that will help you to take advantage of both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which would reflect profit-taking in the stock.

Companies like  (NYSE: ZTS) ,  (NASDAQ: WOOF) , and  (NASDAQ: IDXX) have enjoyed sales and profit growth, while small up-and-comers like  (NASDAQ: PETX) are building entire businesses around pet medicine. Can tailwinds supporting pet profits continue rewarding investors?In this episode of The Motley Fool's  podcast, analyst Kristine Harjes is joined by contributor Todd Campbell to discuss whether pet stocks will remain portfolio-worthy.A full transcript follows the video.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . Welcome to  , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's August 31st, 2016, and I'm your  show host, Kristine Harjes. On the phone is Motley Fool healthcare contributor Todd Campbell. Thanks for joining me today, Todd. Glad to be here, Kristine. Today is the show that you've all been waiting for. We're finally doing our episode on investing in pet healthcare. We've been building up to today's episode for a while, ever since we got a request earlier this month from Jenny Gustavson in  . Jenny noted that she was trying to take the Foolish advice of investing in what you know. And what she knows is she's been spending a lot of money taking care of her elderly dogs.Anyone that owns a pet knows it can be awfully expensive. Todd, do you have pets? I do. Where do I start? I have a dog. I have two cats. I even have a bearded dragon. A bearded dragon? Yeah, my 14-year-old. That's pretty awesome. Are they expensive to take care of? (laughs) Absolutely. I'm sure the grooming on that beard couldn't be cheap. Yeah, pet care, veterinary care -- anyone who has animals knows, especially as they get older, they require just a little bit more care than ever before. Yeah, and this is something that a lot of U.S. households are going through. Everybody that I know, it seems like, owns a pet. Maybe that's just because I don't and I'm jealous. But this is a market that's very, very large and very prevalent throughout the country. It's absolutely huge, and to hammer that point home, I thought it might be fun to play a little game with you and our listeners. Okay! Lay it on me. Great. I was thinking we could do a little over/under, where I say a particular category, and I say, \"What do you think? Are there more of these or less of these?\" And, of course, listeners can play along at home. Okay, sounds good. I'll give the listeners a second before I give my answer. Fantastic. Let's start off with dogs. Do you think there are more or less than 50 million dogs in the United States? 50 million dogs in the U.S....I'm going to go with over. You would be correct. There are 73 million dogs in the United States. 73 million! That's 73 times larger than the state that I live in, population-wise. That's insane. And there's another 43 million dogs in Western Europe, so if you include Western Europe and the United States, you get 116 million dogs. Let's go to the next one. Do you think there are more or less than 1 billion chickens? 1 billion chickens...that's tough. I'm going to go with less on that. There are 19 billion chickens -- No! -- in the world. Yeah, I read that and I was a little shocked as well. That's crazy! You have to think, most of their life spans aren't really that long, so that's a lot of chickens being born every single year. That's a lot of chickens, absolutely. Do you want to do one more? Yeah, let's do one more. Are there more or less than 500 million cats on the planet? 500 million...that's tough. I feel like there are a lot of cats that aren't household pet cats. And do we take tigers into consideration? Or are we just talking -- Small cats. OK. What was the number again? Small cats: This includes wild cats, like feral cats. 500 million? Yes. More or less? I'm going to go with less again. 600 million cats worldwide. Wow. That's a lot of cats. We're talking about billions of pets: tons of animals globally that are receiving care, either because they're going to be used for livestock to feed the world's population, or because they're animals that have become a member of our family. When you start thinking about the size of this addressable market, it probably shouldn't be too surprising to find out that we're spending tens of billions of dollars a year on pet care alone. Clearly you've looked into the numbers behind this. Do you happen to know how much Americans spent last year on their pets? The American Pet Products Association -- we'll do one more over/under, how's that? OK. This is cheating, though, because I know the answer. OK, we'll do it for our listeners. Do you think Americans spent more or less than $50 billion on their pets last year? This is me pausing, giving our listeners some time to think about it. You know the answer, so I'll just dive right in. We spent $60.6 billion last year on our pets, according to the American Pet Products Association. We did, and that's a rising number: That's up 4% year over year. There's an estimated $62.75 billion on the way for 2016; that's another 4.5% climb. Meanwhile, there are polls out there saying that 9 in 10 people say their pets are part of their family, so it's understandable why this market is growing so rapidly. People want to take care of their pets, in good times and bad. Yeah. You look at some of the other numbers and studies that have been out there, showing how this has changed over time. If you look at seniors -- they own a lot of pets, as well -- their views on pets are different than, say, millennials. Millennials are buying more toys, providing more pet care, are willing to make more sacrifices than any other age group. That suggests that the tailwinds toward spending on pets in the future are pretty strong. I do wonder with that whether there is something to be said for a pet being your first pet ever, or if maybe you've had five dogs before -- if that influences it a little bit, and skews those numbers about millennials versus people that are in older generations. It might...it'll be interesting to see how that plays out over time. You could also argue that millennials haven't seen some of the economic hardship that the seniors have, depending on their age. That's a good point, too. With all of this overviewing, I think it's pretty clear that pet spending is a big spending force. How can an investor take advantage of this? What companies are in the space? Well, the big kahuna that investors need to focus on, or at least spend a little time getting familiar with, is a company called Zoetis. The symbol on that stock is ZTS. This was formerly the animal-health products division of  ; it got spun off by Pfizer back in 2013, when Pfizer was downsizing, after it lost patent protection on its multibillion-dollar cholesterol drug Lipitor.Zoetis is a very intriguing company. It's the biggest player out there. It's a pure play on animal health. They operate both companion-animal businesses and livestock businesses. Right, we haven't really touched on livestock business very much, but that's a pretty big part of a lot of these companies, in addition to what you would imagine when you think of pet healthcare, with your medicines and vaccines and vet trips. Right, you want to keep your livestock healthy. If you're a farmer and you have cattle, you want to make sure that they're healthy when they make it to market. So, you have vaccinations and other things that you do to make sure these animals are healthy. Exactly. One other part of the Zoetis story that I think is worth mentioning is that there's some involvement with a famous billionaire named Bill Ackman; he runs Pershing Square Capital Management. Their latest 13F revealed that they actually dumped a ton of their stakes in Zoetis: They now own 55% less of it than they did at the end of the first quarter. This has something to do with them having an activist campaign, trying to get the company to cut costs.And as always, when we talk about billionaires, you should not follow them blindly. What do you think, Todd? Is this an instance where you might want to follow Ackman? Do you find the stock interesting? I think you have to take it with a very big grain of salt. Anyone who's listened to our program in the past knows that Ackman has a big stake in a company called  (NYSE: VRX) . Valeant's shares have been hit pretty hard. It wouldn't shock me if some of the sale in Zoetis, which is up 56% since February 2013, some of that is profit-taking to free up some cash. I think investors are much better served, when it comes to looking at the pet category, to ignore the machinations of the billionaires who may be trafficking in and out of these stocks, and just simply look at the long-term potential for sales and earnings. Right. With that, I will reiterate -- this is your biggest pure play. It can be kind of hard to find pure-play stocks in animal health. The norm is that it's a small subsection of another bigger company -- of  ,  ,  -- all have relatively small parts of their business devoted to animal health. But with Zoetis being spun off from Pfizer, it stands alone as: \"I want to invest in this trend, and this is a way that you could do so.\" And that gives it a lot of advantages over these other companies. Think about this: All of the efforts for Zoetis are focused solely on driving sales growth and profit growth in the animal-health business. It doesn't have to compete with other pharmaceuticals, like if you're talking about Merck, for research dollars. So, there can be a lot of advantages associated with buying a company like Zoetis, rather than trying to say, \"OK, I'm going to buy Merck & Co. because it's the second-biggest maker of animal-health products.\" It's a much smaller piece of Merck's puzzle.You look at Zoetis' competitive advantage, they say they're 45% bigger than the next-biggest. So, it's a massive company. They expect they're going to do about -- I think it's $4.8 billion in sales this year -- they think they can grow that to $5 billion-plus next year. It's a profitable company, it makes some money. Investors should probably bank on somewhere around single-digit top-line growth from here, like 3% to 6%, and maybe better than that on the bottom line. Maybe earnings are going to grow closer to double digits because of some cost savings, into being able to leverage greater sales against fixed costs. Right. We've talked about Zoetis, the big guy in pure-play animal health, and we've mentioned some of the other large pharmaceutical companies that have their hands in this market. There are also a ton of other smaller companies that are also pure plays, but on a much smaller scale than Zoetis.One of them that I thought we should talk about was Aratana: The ticker there is PETX. They're up 56% year to date, and have been incredibly volatile along the way. Last September, they lost 50% of their value due to poor trial results. This mirrored something you might see in a human-health company. They were testing two different drugs for dogs with B-cell lymphoma. The trial came out with negative news; the stock shed a bunch of value. It goes to show, the risks tied to a lot of early-stage biotechs in human health are kind of similar to the ones here in animal health. Yeah. And as we get wealthier as a nation, and start spending more and more on our pets, you're probably going to see an increasing trend toward our willingness to spend money on life-extending therapies, something we maybe didn't do 20 years ago.Aratana is an interesting company. It's a pure-play developer of next-generation therapies for animals. But where Zoetis is the tried-and-true proven leader, this is a very unproven, new, young, clinical-stage company, and a tiny one at that. It only has a $321 million market cap. A lot of the value in this is going to be: \"Can they develop these drugs for things like lymphoma, or some of these other drugs they've been working on, and get those to market and turn those into top sellers that allow them to turn a profit?\" And they do have a few drugs that are approved and on the market. They have Entyce, which is an appetite stimulant for dogs. They have a drug called Galliprant, which is licensed to the Eli Lilly animal-health segment, which is called Elanco. They also have two drugs called Blontress and Tactress, which are lymphoma treatments for dogs.But product sales in the second quarter only totalled $230,000, which is really not much at all. This is out of total revenue for the company of about $21.1 million. The vast majority of that -- actually, more than that net income number -- came from revenue from Elanco and that partnership. Yeah. This is definitely a company that you have to do some digging on. Don't just look at the top-line number and say, \"They did $30 million in revenue in the second quarter.\" That's not true. They received a big licensing payment from Elanco in the second quarter, and that swelled their top-line and bottom-line number. Really, it's too early to know whether or not these are going to be big sellers for this company, and whether or not this is going to translate into meaningful and consistent sales and profit going forward. Another part of this pet health market would be your veterinary operators. The name to know here is VCA -- ticker, appropriately enough, WOOF. They, like I said, are a veterinary clinic operator. They have 682 animal hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, which is the vast majority of their revenue, about 79%. They also operate a vet diagnostic lab, which is 16% of the revenue. What do you think about them, Todd? This is an interesting story. You're able to invest in the vets...maybe it's a hedge against your own pet spending. If you have to bring in your dog or pet for care, maybe it feels a little less painful when you're at the checkout counter, knowing that you have some shares in the veterinary clinic. Yeah, some part of this bill will go into your pocket. Right. Let's do an over/under one more time. Do you think there are more or less than 30,000 pet hospitals in the United States? 30,000 pet hospitals...I think that sounds really high. I'm going to go less. It is less: 26,000. But that just goes to show how much opportunity for growth could exist for WOOF. If you think about it, they have only less than 700 hospitals, yet there are 26,000 out there. A lot of the growth, historically, for this company has come from acquiring existing hospitals and rolling them in, and using the best practices they've learned over time to make them more profitable. Right. This is something they've been doing consistently. They just acquired a company called CAPNA in the second quarter. That was another 56 hospitals, and I'd say it looks like they're going to continue to expand their network, too. Yeah, they added about $200 million in annual revenue via acquisitions in the first half of the year. That represented a lot of the top-line growth. If you're just looking at numbers, you're going to say, \"Wow, sales were up that much?\" You have to remember that some of that came from acquisitions.That being said, you're still getting solid mid-single-digit same-store sales growth at the existing hospitals that have been around at least one year. This is a growing market. It's probably not a barn-burner market, but it's definitely one that's intriguing, that investors might want to consider. Exactly. One more company to add to your watch list is called IDEXX Laboratories. These guys are in the market of animal-health testing and analytics. They mostly do diagnostics within their companion-animal group segment. They also do some tests for livestock and water quality and dairy animals, poultry, that kind of segment. But really, what they do is provide in-house analyzers and diagnostic equipment to these vets, so they can analyze what's going on with your pet. In particular, the in-house segment of that is really intriguing, because if a vet can deliver the results right back to you immediately, that's really sticky. And they do have customer retention of 96% to 99%.It's a win-win-win. It's a win for the vet, because it's greater customer satisfaction, it keeps people coming back, it's a quicker turnover for them. It's a win for the customer, because they can get the answers they're looking for quicker. And, it's a win for IDEXX as well. Again, we're talking about a company that does a fair amount of revenue. This is a company with $1.7 billion in trailing 12-month sales. That's great. It's a profitable company, which is also great for investors to know. Investors may also want to know that this isn't necessarily a cheap stock; this isn't one that's been running under the radar that they can buy on sale. I think the forward P/E ratio for this stock is around 40, so you might want to throw this one on a watch list to see whether or not it pulls back.But I think if you're talking long-term, and you're saying, \"If we understand, as humans, when we go in, we want immediate feedback on what's wrong with us, and we assume pet care is going to be similar -- when we go to the vet, we're going to want to know what's wrong with our cats or dogs as soon as possible\" -- I think that's a really good opportunity for this company to grow over time. Management of the company has said they expect to grow sales 10% annually from here, and their earnings should grow faster than that as they leverage those additional sales. So, this is a fast-growing company. But like you mentioned, it's not exactly a cheap one. They're up 53% year to date. If you got in in January, congratulations -- that's a fantastic return over the last eight months or so. Even just this month, a great second-quarter report pushed this stock up another 13%. Whether or not it's a good time to get in now...you know as well as I do that you never want to try to time the market like that. But this is definitely a company that, for me, I would put it on a watch list and wait for the price to go down a little bit. I agree. I think that makes sense. You want to invest in what you know, but you don't want to blindly invest. The reality is, stocks do go up, and they do go down. A lot of this is going to have to do with your time horizon. I think, overall, the demand for caring for pets globally is on the rise, and that's going to provide natural tailwinds that make all these companies interesting. Exactly. It's the same thing that you see in the human-health market. This is kind of similar. I guess that's why we're talking about it on the  show. This is an industry that is relatively immune to recession, much like you see in human healthcare. It doesn't matter if times are good or bad economically: If you need to take care of a person or a pet that you view as a member of the family, you're going to spend that money.Meanwhile, you still have drugs going through the FDA, so you still have that risk and everything associated with that. Interesting thing I found when I was doing my research -- we talk about PDUFA dates all the time, as in the date when a drug is going to get approved. The animal equivalent of that is the Animal Drug User Fee Act, which is the ADUFA. I thought that was kind of interesting.There are a lot of similarities between these markets. How are they different? If you're looking at the pet healthcare market, what do you need to keep in mind if you're used to the human side of things? Probably the biggest difference between the two is the fact that you really don't have a lot of third-party payer issues in the pet side, at least not yet. You're seeing more and more insurance companies offering pet insurance; I actually have pet insurance on my animals. But for the most part, those are reimbursement-type scenarios. You don't have, for example, the veterinary hospital waiting for the insurance company to pay it. Instead, you're paying the insurance company, and then getting reimbursed by the insurance company for that. That's probably a good thing for these vets and these hospitals -- they get the money immediately. Absolutely, and there's less of an ability for the insurance company, maybe, to go to each individual veterinarian and say, \"No, I'm only going to pay you $X for this service.\" One other thing I'll point out as a difference between investing in human medicine and animal medicine is the seasonal fluctuation that's present here. Demand for vet services is actually higher during the warmer months. It make sense, if you think about it. Pets are spending more time outdoors when it's nice out, so they're more likely to be injured, they're more susceptible to disease and parasites. It's something to keep in mind if you're looking at quarter-over-quarter trends.Here's one more: generics. This was interesting to me. They don't exist as prevalently in pet medicine, whereas this is something that's all over the landscape of human medicine. But it's just not as common to see generic versions of pet drugs. Right. There's not as much price competition. As consumers, we don't like that. But for a burgeoning or growing industry, as investors, maybe we have a slightly different view on that. Exactly. Thank you so much for your thoughts today, Todd.To close out today's show: If you guys have been listening to  over the past few weeks, you know that I've been calling for submissions to call and leave a voice mail and tell us either a story about your pet, and maybe some crazy reason you had to take it in to the vet, or just give a tip for saving money. So, we'd like to put a couple of these voice mails that we received from listeners. Hi, Fools! This is Louis Wilson. I'm calling  specifically on how to save money on pet healthcare. The tip I'm going to give you is for new pet owners, specifically if you're getting a pet that hasn't received their shots. Shots can be a lot of the expense up front of owning a pet, at least from a medical perspective.I recommend that you go to these mobile clinics. You can find them, they'll be setting up -- at least in Orange County where I'm from -- will have Walgreens or CVS host clinics once a month. That is, again, put on by the county. If you're a new pet owner, I recommend you do a quick Google search on the mobile clinics that do shots for pets. Thank you. Hey,  ! This is Brian Feroldi; I'm from North Kingstown, Rhode Island. I've got a funny dog story and a tip for you. We had a chocolate lab a few years back that was really into eating random things, and one time she got ahold of one of my wife's sewing needles. We saw her put it in her mouth, immediately ran over to try and get it out, in which case, she immediately swallowed it -- so we had to take her in for emergency surgery, which cost us $600. That was not fun. Unfortunately, she still had a habit of swallowing random things, which one time included a chewed-up piece of a dish towel.But, we did hear from our vet that if they do swallow things that are soft and/or poisonous, there is a trick to get it out of them cheaply and easily. That is, you take an old syringe, you fill it up with hydrogen peroxide, and then you force-feed it down their throat. When you do that, the dog will immediately vomit everything up that's in their stomach. We had to do that two times on our dog. It's an unpleasant experience, but it saved us two trips to the vet again. So, anyone that has a dog that likes to eat things they shouldn't, I would suggest keeping an old syringe and some hydrogen peroxide around the house.Thank you,  ! Have a great day. Bye! There you have it, life hacks from pet owners Louis Wilson and Brian Feroldi. Thank you to everyone who called in.As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks that they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

Headquartered in Carlsbad, CA, Alphatec is a publicly traded medical device company that provides spinal fusion technologies and spinal devices.Following the announcement, shares of Globus Medical rallied 2.1% to close at $23.97. However, a thorough analysis of the current market trends reveal that the sentiments are not impressive for Globus Medical as it represents a modest one-year return of 2.5%, much lower than the S&P 500's 13.4% over the same time frame. However, we believe that the recent development will to-some-extent help the company overcome the current unfavorable situation.Post the closing of Alphatec buyout for $80 million in cash, Globus Medical has gained complete control over Alphatec's international operations and distributor sales channel.

Varian management expects the buyout to improve its presence in the Polish market. Currently, more than 80 Varian medical linear accelerators are installed in the country's radiotherapy departments.Of late, Varian has expanded in countries like Australia, Turkey and China along with others. The company is also expanding presence in Africa and the Middle East, which reflects its awareness about the growth opportunities in the regions. Moreover, the company is focusing on improving its hold in Latin America.Varian's strong overseas presence is expected to help the company cash in on the opportunities in emerging markets. Notably, the company recorded healthy gross order growth in emerging markets like Iran, Russia, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Libya in the recently concluded third quarter of fiscal 2016. In Africa, Varian won gross orders worth $25 million.We believe that Varian's oncology business growth prospects are impressive in these countries due to the strong demand for its products.

According to management, \"The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals.\" As part of the company's strategy of expansion through acquisitions, this buyout will enable Thermo Fisher to access FEI's industry-leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study, which in turn facilitates life-science research.Following the deal's closure, Thermo Fisher plans to integrate the FEI business within its Analytical Instruments segment. We view this FEI deal, following the completion of the $1.3 billion Affymetrix takeover in April, to be yet another milestone achievement for Thermo Fisher in terms of expanding its diverse global business.FEI's Cryo-EM technology is a groundbreaking microscopy solution that complements Thermo Fisher's mass spectrometry systems used to identify and characterize proteins. With the growing adoption of electron microscopy in high-resolution analysis of protein structure, we expect the FEI buyout to aid Thermo Fisher in driving Analytical Instruments revenues, particularly in the biopharma market.Moreover, FEI's unique 3D nano-characterization and nano-prototyping imaging technologies are expected to enhance Thermo Fisher's capabilities in the materials science space. On account of having ownership of these technologies, FEI enjoys a strong presence in the semiconductor market. Meanwhile, the acquisition will create new growth opportunities for Thermo Fisher's customers in the life sciences space.Over the past few quarters, growth in Thermo Fisher's Analytical Instruments segment continues to remain sluggish with low single-digit growth. However, with the FEI inclusion, it's expected that growth will accelerate in the near term.In terms of the financial benefits from the FEI deal, management expects to witness immediate accretion to the company's earnings. In particular, FEI's industry-leading services business, spread across more than 20 countries, drives high-margin, recurring revenues. The Services segment represents approximately 25% of total FEI sales ($930 million in 2015). No doubt, the addition of this services business will benefit Thermo Fisher's services capabilities as well.Moreover, the FEI deal is expected to be accretive to Thermo Fisher's adjusted EPS by 30 cents in the first full year after closing. Thermo Fisher also expects to realize total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal's close, with approximately $55 million of cost synergies and roughly $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies.We note that, as part of its strategy to effectively deploy capital, Thermo Fisher has undertaken several acquisitions in the recent past. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to deploy capital worth $17 billion during 2017-2019, of which 70% will be for mergers and acquisitions bringing business expansion.So far, apart from boosting revenues, the numerous acquisitions made by Thermo Fisher have benefitted its operating margin, as well as resulted in tax synergies.

The company is also advising veterinarians to prescribe more of their brands.Although we are encouraged by PetMed's efforts to revitalize the top line, barring the last three quarters, new order sales have been persistently sluggish over the last few quarters, impacted by a reduction in advertising. Although the company is optimistic about the latest increase, the sustainability of this growth remains a concern.Besides, after two quarters of significant increase, reorder sales faced a setback in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Reorder sales were down 0.7% year over year to $59.2 million. Meanwhile, the company continues to be stressed in the competitive and fragmented pet medications market.Medical stocks such as IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  , Masimo Corporation  and Natus Medical Inc.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), are expected to do well over the short term.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

Notably, the agency took this step to prevent any further transmission of this deadly virus through blood supply, across the nation.Following this recommendation, the FDA has granted special approval to  's  Procleix Zika test and Roche Holding AG's  Cobas Zika assay to conduct the country-wide blood supply screening for Zika virus. Consequently, Hologic's shares gained 1% to close at $38.80 on Friday, displaying investors' optimism with regard to this news.The Zika infection had not become a worldwide threat until the last year, as this virus predominantly affected the tropical countries. However, the virus' outbreak in May 2015 in Brazil and thereafter its rapid proliferation across the globe, forced the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare Zika virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in Feb 2016.Following this, the FDA's initial guidance was issued in the same month, which recommended screening of blood supply for Zika virus only for individuals who had travelled recently to the contaminated areas, or had come in contact with someone potentially exposed to the virus or had a confirmed Zika infection. However, the entire scenario has changed over the past few weeks.Per recent reports from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 471 new confirmed cases were reported from Florida, 601 from New York, 152 from California, 125 from Texas and 91 from New Jersey. These numbers evidently point to the rapid spread of the virus across the nation and thus to prevent any more proliferation of the disease, which in turn may even result in an epidemic, the FDA introduced the new guidelines to screen the entire country's blood supply.The blood screening will start with immediate effect for Florida and Puerto Rico, from where the maximum numbers of cases with Zika virus have been reported. In 11 states, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, South Carolina and Texas, the guidelines must be implemented within four weeks. For the rest of the U.S., the FDA plans to enforce the guidelines within 12 weeks of the announcement.In late Jun 2016, Hologic's Procleix assay, developed as part of the company's long-standing partnership with Grifols, won the FDA's Investigational New Drug (IND) study protocol to detect the presence of Zika virus in donated blood. Unquestionably, the recent FDA recommendation allowing Hologic's Procleix assay to be one of the two tests to be used in the nationwide screening will boost its test revenue growth.Per investment bank, Piper Jaffray, the revised guidance could result in a revenue benefit of $13-$25 million for Hologic and 2-5 cents of annual earnings per share. Under a national screening program and possible FDA approval of Hologic's assay, the revenue benefit could rise up to about $39 million. On the other hand, investment bank Evercore ISI suggested that the total revenue benefit of the revised guidelines to Hologic could be about $15 million, with lower profitability until the test wins the FDA nod.In this context it is worth noticing that, despite the market availability of other diagnostic tests for identification of Zika virus like Quest Diagnostics, Inc.'s  Euroimmun Anti-Zika Virus Elisa and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) test and a few others, FDA chose Hologic's Procelix to be one among the two for the nationwide screening. As a result, we anticipate Hologic to gain a competitive leverage over others in the multibillion dollar molecular diagnostics market. However, Roche's Cobas Zika test being the other assay approved in this recommendation might offer some level of rivalry for Hologic in this space.Currently, Hologic and Quest Diagnostics carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Roche Holdings retains a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

Interestingly, this news comes as a boon for molecular diagnostic providers like  that offer Genius 3D mammography - one of the leading tests in the digital mammography space.Notably, breast cancer is a treatable yet malicious medical condition that is very common among women globally. In the U.S., breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women and affects almost 2,300 new women every year.As it is for most types of cancer, accurate detection of the disease at an early stage can increase the chances of survival in breast cancer patients and so far 2D mammogram has been the traditional diagnostic test advised for breast cancer screening.However, in recent clinical trials concerning 3D mammography exam, otherwise known as breast tomosynthesis, has demonstrated its superiority in detecting more invasive breast cancer at a much earlier stage and resulted in reduced recalls, when compared to traditional 2D exams. In this context, we note that Hologic's Genius 3D mammogram is the only clinically proven test to detect cancer 15 months earlier than traditional 2D screenings.Unfortunately, despite rapid adoption of the 3D technology among physicians, a lack of interest among insurance providers to offer coverage for this exam has been observed in the U.S. Though the country's national payers Medicare and Medicaid already cover this test for insured women aged 40 and above.Hologic has been fighting for a long time to win the private payors' contract for its Genius 3D mammogram, which benefitted an estimated 10 million U.S. women in 2015 and has the potential to help even more, if it wins the coverage. The company even launched a billboard advertising campaign to pressure insurance companies to cover the full cost of routine screening with 3Dtechnology(according to Hartford).The recently released NCCN guidelines recommending breast tomosynthesis, seems to reflect that Hologic's efforts have not gone in vain. Per management, since mostinsurers reference NCCN guidelines in their coverage policies, Hologic's 3D technology is now expected to get the attention of most insurers.A classic example of that is the aforementioned coverage initiated by the nation's renowned insurance provider Cigna, following which all women over 40 years and high-risk women starting at age 25 will get a reimbursement. We may expect other payers like Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Anthem to follow suit; which in turn will benefit 3D mammogram providers like Hologic.Management expects this to encourage more number of women to opt for Hologic's 3D mammogram as they no longer would have to incur an out-of-pocket expense; which in turn will fetch higher profits for the company.Nevertheless it is crucial to mention that in a fiercely competitive medical device space, where everyday a new device comes to the market; the NCCN guidelines and the subsequent coverage initiated by Cigna, will also benefit other peer companies of Hologic, like Siemens and Fujifilm which also manufactures similar kind of 3D mammograms.Currently, Hologic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 11 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by four cents. Notably, the company posted an average positive surprise of 27.14% over the last four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Veeva expects total revenues in the range of $125.5-$127 million for the second-quarter fiscal 2017. Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating income is expected between $30 million and $30.5 million. Non-GAAP earnings are likely to be 13 cents per share.For the second quarter, management anticipates calculated billings of roughly $110 million which represents about 14% growth on a year-over-year basis. | Extended use of multi-channel Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application by customers continues to be a key growth catalyst for the company. We believe product suites like Veeva Vault will help win customers for Veeva.The newly launched Veeva Vault QMS expands the product's presence into 10 new markets. The addition of QMS doubles the company's growth opportunities in the quality management market.Additionally Veeva's regulatory application suite - Veeva Vault Registrations and Veeva Vault SubmissionsArchive continues to gain solid traction, which is a key catalyst.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Veeva is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. : Veeva has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 7 cents. : Veeva carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:IDEXX Laboratories  , with an Earnings ESP of +5.3% and a Zacks Rank #1.Lannett Company  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.43% and a Zacks Rank #1.Quidel Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +133.33% and a Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Abaxis' first-quarter fiscal 2017 results disappointed us, with the company squarely missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, Abaxis faced a challenging year-over-year comparison in sales of veterinary rotors in the Asia Pacific region.Abaxis faces fierce competition in both the Medical and Veterinary markets, wherein the company competes against firms that have substantially greater resources. The company competes primarily with commercial clinical laboratories, hospital clinical laboratories and manufacturers of bench top multi-test blood analyzers and other testing systems that health care providers can use on-site. Such severe competition may strain Abaxis' top line in the future.Abaxis mostly depends on distributors to sell its products as well as on sole distributor arrangements in a number of countries. For instance, Abbott has the exclusive right to sell and distribute Abaxis' Piccolo Xpress chemistry analyzer and associated consumables in the professionally attended U.S. human healthcare market.As a result, Abaxis no longer has control over the marketing and sale of its primary medical products in most of the U.S. medical markets and is wholly dependent upon the efforts and priorities of Abbott in promoting and creating demand for the same. Failure to successfully develop and maintain relationships with these distributors could thus adversely affect the company's business.On a brighter note, Abaxis continues to remain a strong player in the veterinary market, with solid sales from its veterinary business, which accounted for 82.7% of its total revenue in the first quarter and also witnessed a double-digit growth.Moreover, Abaxis' Piccolo system continued to excel in the market.

Adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent a share by a stellar 53 cents. Revenues although missed our estimate, surged 10.2% year over year to $125 million. This was mainly driven by a remarkable performance by the network solutions business. Moreover, the company's expanding customer base continues to remain as a key growth catalyst.Following such a solid performance, for the third quarter of 2016, over the last seven days, three out of six analysts covering the stocks have made upward estimate revision versus no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revisions has also remained significant in this period. The quarter's earnings estimate shot up a huge 150% to 35 cents per share. | Additionally for full-year 2016, two out of five analysts covering the stocks, raised their estimates (with no downward revision) over the last seven days.

The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Edwards Lifesciences continued with its trend of delivering better-than-expected operating results in the first half of 2016. This is evident from the strong second-quarter results that the company reported late last month, which squarely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Geographically Edwards Lifesciences excelled in both the U.S. as well as overseas, particularly in its transcatheter heart valve (THV) product segment. While in the domestic front, this segment's growth was widespread, in the international market consistent therapy adoption was witnessed in Europe along with strong contributions from Japan.Among the emerging nations, the company made notable progress in Japan and has recently launched its tricuspid surgical valve repair product in this country. Since then, the company has been observing strong demand for this therapy. We believe this in turn will allow Edwards to constantly deliver a solid heart valve performance in the emerging market of Japan.With respect to pipeline development, post acquisition of CardiAQ Valve Technologies, in the early generation CardiAQ Edwards platform, Edwards is currently in the process of implementing several enhancements, including new delivery systems and utilizing Edwards' advanced tissue technology. Management plans to incorporate these improvements as part of its CE Mark trial called Relief, which will investigate both Edwards and CardiAQ's mitral valves.Management expects to begin treating patients under this trial soon. Early U.S. feasibility studies with both of these technologies are currently underway.We are also encouraged to note the upward revision in the company's 2016 guidance.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations continue to affect Edwards Lifesciences' operations. Evidently foreign exchange headwinds impacted Edwards Lifesciences' gross margin by 100 basis points in the second quarter.Although Edwards Lifesciences has signed foreign exchange hedging contracts to partially mitigate the adverse impact of currency exchange, management continued to witness reduced benefits from these contracts, which in turn affects the gross margin figure.

Additionally, the company's lowered revenue guidance for fiscal 2017 was disappointing.Currency continues to be a major obstacle to STERIS' growth for quite some time. During the fiscal first quarter, currency fluctuations affected STERIS' revenues by 40 basis points.Moreover, the current macroeconomic turmoil in countries of the Middle East, owing to fluctuating  , affected STERIS' top line in the first quarter. Similar macroeconomic challenges were also witnessed across Latin America, Venezuela and Brazil.With governments and insurance companies consistently trying to contain the rising cost of healthcare, pricing pressure has become a major headwind for healthcare providers like STERIS. Adding to woes is rapid customer consolidation, weak cost reduction initiatives on the company's part as well as a competitive landscape, which looms large.On the bright side, Synergy Health - the company STERIS acquired last year, was one of the primary contributors to the strong double-digit revenue growth observed by the combined company. Going ahead, management expects Synergy to contribute between $640-$650 million or a low-single-digit growth in fiscal 2017.STERIS has always been in sync with its strategy of acquisitions for growth. In Jul 2016, the company bought Medisafe Holdings, which is an U.K.-based manufacturer of washer disinfector equipment and also markets related consumables and services.

Notably, the sector also reported earnings growth of 5% on a  of 9.2% on a year over year basis.We particularly note the stellar year-over-year revenue growth that reflects robust performance by the sector, especially the medical devices stocks.The highly resilient Medical device industry is expected to continue to drive investor returns, primarily based on positive demographic trends.In fact, historical trends for the sector has been impressive too, as an analysis by the S&P Global deciphers that U.S. health care costs in the commercial market grew 6.5% in 2015, a 50% higher rate of improvement than that recorded in the prior year.Moreover, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) projection, total U.S. healthcare spending is expected to grow 5.8% on an average annually through 2025, courtesy of faster projected economic growth and an aging population.We believe that higher spending bodes particularly well for the sector, especially for the medical devices providers.We have picked five stocks that have rallied on the improvement in the medical device space.

This system has been recognized as the first clinical laparoscopic procedure in the U.S. recently. Next month, a chain of surgical trials will be performed in leading institutions in the U.S.Percuvance Percutaneous Surgical system is used to execute laparoscopic procedures. It comprises reusable handles and seven disposable 5mm interchangeable tool tips which include graspers, scissors, dissector, electrocautery tools, and a Weck Hem-o-lok Polymer Ligation Clip Applier. The system helps in percutaneous insertion without the insertion trocar.With nearly 3 million laparoscopic procedures performed each year in the U.S., we expect Teleflex to gain considerable market traction with the recent launch. | In this regard, we note that traditional laparoscopy is associated with the insertion of trocars, which becomes painful for patients while percutaneous laparoscopy is devoid of trocars which assures less trauma for patients. On the contrary, the percutaneous laparoscopy, promoted by Teleflex helps overcome complications in the surgery. The procedure is much less invasive compared to the traditional one.The latest system can be used in both common and advanced general laparoscopic procedures like cholecystectomy, upper gastrointestinal, gastric, bariatric, colorectal and hernia. According to the company, the latest offering is more versatile and allows even less invasive procedures than its first-generation 5 mm device.Notably, the first generation Percuvance system was launched in Mar 2015 and has already been used by 150 surgeons in the U.S. and EMEA region.Management is confident that the Percuvance System will turn out to be the new standard of care in laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, it is expanding its sales force to promote the device among surgeon.

Revenues from peripheral vascular product business rose to $19.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 149.6% (or up 149.3% at CER) year over year.While neuro sales were driven by strong growth in the ischemic stroke market, sales of Penumbra System which includes ACE, ACE64 and the latest ACE68 also contributed to the growth. Besides, in nuero access and neuro embolization, Penumbra was benefitted from separate competitor recalls and in the quarter. | Penumbra's gross margin was 63.7% in the reported quarter, reflecting a 6706 basis points (bps) contraction year over year, on account of a 25% drag in gross profit.

Both the increases were primarily driven by a rise in headcount and related compensation expense.Loss from operations came in at $0.67 million, a huge slash from the operating income of $24.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Penumbra exited second-quarter 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of $13.9 million compared with $17.6 million at the end of the first quarter.Penumbra has raised its total revenue outlook for 2016 to a new range of $250-$255 million, a significant increase from the earlier band of $230-$235 million. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $237 million, far below the expected range.Penumbra's second-quarter 2016 performance was strong, with the company reporting impressive top-and-the-bottom-line results both beating expectations. In the quarter under review, the company witnessed strong growth across all its geographies and product line. However, escalating costs and expenses put pressure on margin.Penumbra is an active player in the fast-growing interventional therapies space. In fact, the company's products primarily cater to the unmet clinical needs across two major markets, viz. neuro and peripheral vascular.The gradually increasing demand for treatment options in the heart diseases market reflects the high-growth potential in this niche. Attractive growth opportunities exist for Penumbra in the ischemic stroke market as well as in the more established markets like hemorrhagic stroke and peripheral vascular.

The top line however missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $644 million. The year-over-year upside observed in the top line can be attributed to growth in all four segments of STERIS.Revenue growth declined 40 basis points (bps) owing to foreign currency fluctuations.

Additionally it improved partly due to the acquisition of GEPCO and partially because of the mid-teens growth in organic consumable revenues. Moreover, 20% service revenue growth and 43% capital equipment revenue growth also contributed to the improvement in the segment.Adjusted gross margin contracted 370 bps year over year to 38.2% in the reported quarter, mainly due to additional costs related to the Synergy Health acquisition, which outweighed the favorable effects of currency translations, the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax as well as improvement from pricing and productivity.STERIS witnessed a 19.8% year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to $151.9 million. Research and development expenses rose 4.8% to $14.4 million.

On a pro forma constant currency basis, revenue growth was 2.3%, which exhibited stand-alone Welch Allyn and Hill-Rom revenue in both the third quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015.

Adjusted gross margin grew 340 bps to 48.1%, driven by improvement in the organic Hill-Rom business and the addition of Welch Allyn.Adjusted operating margin improved 350 bps to 11% owing to higher gross margin and SG&A leverage. On the other hand, selling and administrative expenses increased 39.5% to $209.9 million, while research and development expenses rose 44.2% to $33.6 million.Hill-Rom updated its fiscal 2016 revenue guidance. The company now expects revenue to be approximately $2.65 billion, compared with the earlier guidance range of $2.64-$2.67 billion; reflecting 2% to 3% pro forma constant currency growth and negative currency impact of approximately 2% at current rates.

The company's outcome on a year-over-year basis was also impressive. On the profitability front, Hill-Rom delivered the highest level of gross margin this year. Geographically, the company posted strong growth in both Asia-Pacific and the U.S.We also remain impressed with the company's increased bottom-line guidance for fiscal 2016, while the revenue guidance for the same was not that encouraging.Hill-Rom's consistently poor performance in the International front keeps us on the sidelines, as the company has failed to overcome the challenges prevailing in the Middle East and Latin America.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked medical stocks worth a look are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  , Masimo Corporation  and Natus Medical Inc.  .

The company estimates adjusted earnings per share at 25-27 cents on total revenue of $168-$170 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS of 43 cents and revenues of $193.9 million exceeds the company's guided range.Myriad ended fiscal 2016 on a disappointing note, with its fourth-quarter numbers missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. The revenue decline in Hereditary cancer testing revenue, which came in below management's expectations, remained the major dampener in the fourth quarter, on the top line front. The declining gross margin figures played further spoilsport.On a brighter note, Myriad made considerable progress in its recently released product line. Particularly, strong growth was observed in both Prolaris and Vectra DA testing revenues. Further, the company completed two significant acquisitions of late, including Sividon Diagnostics and Assurex Health.

The loss reported was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 20 cents by 25%.Per management, the year-over-year improvement in the loss figure was primarily driven by a decline in operating expenses on account of the company's cost realignment actions, including a reduction in force of about 8% on Mar 31, 2016.In fiscal 2016, the company's loss per share was $1.72, narrower than the previous fiscal's loss by 65.4%. The loss was, however, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.77 by 2.8%.Cardiovascular Systems delivered better-than-expected revenues of $48.5 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, almost flat year over year, but comfortably ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $46 million.Per management, the strong top-line performance exhibited the company's efforts to stabilize and support its field sales representatives.During the reported quarter, Cardiovascular sold over 14,500 devices and added 48 new peripheral accounts and 62 coronary accounts. Coronary device revenues improved 20% to $11.4 million, while peripheral device revenues declined 5% to $37.1 million. Other product revenues declined 27.3% year over year to $4 million due to the termination of an agreement to distribute Asahi guide wires on Jun 30, 2015. Customer reorder revenues were strong at 98% of total revenue, comparing favorably with the fourth quarter of the last fiscal (96%).In fiscal 2016, the company generated revenues of $178.2 million, down 1.9% year over year. The top-line figure, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $176 million. | Gross margin in the reported quarter was 79.7%, up 210 basis points (bps) year over year, primarily on account of unit cost reductions.Meanwhile, selling and administrative (SG&A) expenses dropped 1.9% to $37.6 million, while research and development (R&D) expenses dropped 24.2% to $6 million. The resultant adjusted operating expenses dropped 5.8% to $43.6 million; mainly exhibiting management's cost realignment initiatives.

The company expects revenues in the range of $48-$49.5 million. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2017 revenues stands at $49 million, almost in line with the upper end of the company's guidance.Moreover, the company expects gross margin of 80% in the fiscal first quarter.The company expects to incur a net loss in the range of $5.8-$6.7 million or loss per share of 18-21 cents, assuming 32.8 million average shares outstanding. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is at a loss of 20 cents.Cardiovascular Systems ended fiscal 2016 on a promising note. While the company's fiscal fourth-quarter loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line also comfortably surpassed the mark. Besides, the company's lower operating expense was the vital factor that drove the year-over-year improvement in the loss figure. Strong revenue performance also contributed to the improved loss outcome.Moreover, in the fiscal fourth quarter, Cardiovascular Systems delivered two important milestones, including submission of Shonin application in Japan for approval of its second-generation coronary device and reaching a settlement with the Department of Justice. Going ahead, the company is expected to deliver positive cash flow and profitability in the near future. However, declining SG&A and R&D expenses might be indicative of the reduced efforts on the company's part to improve sales performance at its fullest, which is a concern.Cardiovascular Systems currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

While other sectors of the economy are experiencing slower growth, IDEXX's core market -- companion animal diagnostics -- is growing nicely, and the company's 2015 shift to a direct sales model continues to generate impressive sales increases. Let's take a look at the details behind a good quarter of execution.IDEXX Laboratories has good long term prospects thanks to spending trends on companion animals. Image source: Getty Images.Starting with the headline numbers:A good set of results, and management felt suitably confident enough to raise full-year guidance:It's an impressive increase in guidance. Moreover, the updated EPS guidance (using midpoints) represents a 10.3% increase from what management expected at the start of the fiscal year. The large difference between the updated and original guidance is understandable when you consider the uncertainty created by the shift to the direct sales model and the launch of the SediVue urine analyzer. Fortunately, both actions are working out as planned.CAG generated more than 87% of IDEXX's income from operations in the second-quarter -- CAG represents the key growth opportunity for the company. Within CAG, diagnostics recurring revenue generates around 85% of revenue, and, since IDEXX needs instrument placements in order to help generate future consumables and services revenue, it's useful to keep an eye on how instrument sales are progressing.A quick look at CAG year on year revenue growth shows the acceleration in growth rate of capital instrument sales in the quarter. Moreover, diagnostics recurring revenue continues to grow at a double-digit rate.Data source: IDEXX Laboratories presentations.On the , CFO Brian McKeon talked of \"outstanding growth in premium instrument placements\" aided by the launch of SediVue. He went on to disclose \" Globally, we've placed 1,334 Catalysts, 934 premium hematology analyzers, and 467 SediVues. Strong North America results were supported by accelerated competitive placement levels. We placed 502 Catalysts in North America in Q2 with 300, or 60%, at competitive or greenfield accounts.\"SediVue. Image source: Idexx Laboratories.For reference, IDEXX generated around 61% of its revenue from the U.S. in the second-quarter, so the strong increase in placements bodes well for future growth.The ground work for future growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth is being laid out by selling more instrument placements, and in this regard investors have cause for optimism. CEO Jon Ayers outlined how just this year IDEXX's diagnostic professionals had made more than 124 thousand visits toveterinary practices -- representing an average of five visits to every practice. In other words, the shift to the direct sales model is creating more awareness of IDEXX's products.He went on to disclose that the U.S. commercial team had produced \" greater than 50% growth in premium instrument orders over the second quarter of last year,\" citing strong growth with the Catalyst chemistry system and the SediVue analyzer launch. SediVue will be launched in some countries in the fourth-quarter of 2016 with \"the bulk of the international launches to take place in 2017,\" according to Ayers.The shift to the direct sales model in the U.S. is working, and instrument placement growth is strong, suggesting that recurring revenue will grow strongly in the future. Meanwhile, international sales of Catalyst are growing strongly and the wide-scale launch of SediVue in international markets could boost revenue in 2017. There is always uncertainty around product launches and operational realignments (direct sales model) but so far in 2016 IDEXX has exceeded expectations.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Strong top-line growth and better-than-expected operating margins in the second quarter as well as consistent share repurchases drove the upside in EPS.IDEXX's second-quarter revenues improved 12.9% year over year to $466.6 million and steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $446 million. Organic revenue growth was 13%, ahead of the company's expectation driven by strong performance by the Companion Animal Group (CAG) and Water segments.Region-wise, in the reported quarter, IDEXX witnessed a 12% improvement in the U.S. amounting to revenues of $286 million (up 12% on an organic basis) supported by strong growth in premium instrument placements, including benefits from the launch of SediVue that contributed about 3% to overall US growth. US CAG recurring diagnostic revenues grew 10% organically, supported by continued double-digit revenue growth in the company's lab business.In the international market, the company's sales increased 17% year over year to $181 million (up 14% on an organic basis). CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue growth was 17% in international markets, reflecting increased consumable revenue growth supported by high levels of instrument placements.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the second quarter, revenues improved 13.8% to $400.2 million, up 13% organically at CAG , driven by 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues and 35% organic revenue growth in CAG Diagnostics instruments.

Research and development expenses increased 4.5% to $25.4 million.Operating margin in the quarter expanded 174 bps to 33.9%. Excluding currency impacts, operating margin was up 230 bps to 22.3% reflecting volume leverage and controlled operating expense growth, including benefits from the shifting of some investments to the second half of 2016.IDEXX exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $141.1 million compared with $133 million at the end of the previous quarter. Year-to-date net operating cash flow came in at $134.1 million, compared with $65.5 million a year ago. During the reported quarter, the company bought back 269,000 shares for $23 million.Encouraged by its strong start to 2016 and expected favorable foreign exchange rates, IDEXX raised its full-year 2016 outlook. Management currently expects revenues of $1.76-$1.78 billion for 2016, reflecting organic revenue growth of approximately 10-11.5% (reported 9.5-11%) against the previous top-line guidance of $1.73-$1.75 billion, reflecting normalized organic revenue growth of approximately 9-10% (reported 8-9%).

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $2.20 for full-year 2016.IDEXX has continued in 2016 on a promising note. After a solid start, the company registered square beat in its second quarter 2016 too with respect to the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the company's trend of consistent share buybacks for the past few quarters reflects its strong free cash flow reserve as well as management's success in optimizing IDEXX's capital structure. The company's raised its guidance for 2016 which also buoys optimism.Strong instrument placements, global lab momentum reflecting the company's leverage of expanded commercial capability as well as strong test menu expansion remained some of the key highlights for IDEXX's business at the start of 2016.

Revenue was up 13% year over year, driven by sales of IDEXX Laboratories' tests for companion animals. Installations of the machines that run those tests also had a nice year-over-year increase, up 31%, thanks in part to the launch of IDEXX Laboratories' new SediVue Dx, a urine sediment point-of-care analyzer.Earnings per share were up 23% year over year. The bottom line grew faster than revenue, thanks to increased operating margins and a benefit from the federal research-and-development tax credit that wasn't available in the year-ago quarter. With a strong start to the year, management increased 2016 revenue guidance by $25 million, so IDEXX Laboratories now expects revenue to be 9.5% to 11% higher than last year.Earnings per share guidance for 2016 was also increased to a range of $2.32 to $2.39 per share, based on the aforementioned higher revenue and expanding operating margin.

However these positive effects were marginally neutralized by the lower Nano and CALID volume observed in the second quarter.Selling, general & administrative expenses increased 2.4% to $100.9 million, while research and development expenses fell 1.9% to $36.8 million. Adjusted operating income dropped 6.8% year over year to $40 million. However, the adjusted operating margin remained flat at 10.8% in the quarter.Bruker exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $420.4 million compared with $420.5 million at the end of first quarter of 2016. At the end of the second quarter, net cash flow from operating activities was $18.1 million, compared with $1.5 million of net cash outflow recorded in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted free cash flow was $8.9 million in the quarter, compared with free cash outflow worth $9.2 in the prior-year quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by increased working capital.During the reported quarter, Bruker repurchased 1.2 million shares for $34.5 million. At the end of the second quarter, the company was left with approximately $42.4 million of the remaining authorization to buy back shares, as part of the initial $225 million share back program.For full-year 2016, Bruker updated its guidance. Management currently expects its reported revenue in 2016 to be approximately flat compared to the prior year, including an organic decline of 2% and acquisition related growth of 2%. The company also expects to its adjusted operating margin to increase by approximately 75-100 bps year over year. Earlier, the company projected organic revenue growth of approximately 3% as well as adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 bps, year over year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 revenues stands at $1.66 billion.However, on the bottom-line front, Bruker maintains adjusted EPS projection in the range of 97 cents-$1.02 for 2016. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 EPS stands at $1.01, within the company's guidance.Bruker ended second quarter of 2016 on a disappointing note. While the company's earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the mark. Although year over year growth was observed in the bottom line figure of the reported quarter, but that was merely fuelled by lower share count and not by any strong operating results on the company's part. Further, revenues suffered a high-single-digit decline which buoys further pessimism.On a brighter note, the company exhibited solid cash balance position on the back of improved free cash flow compared to the prior-year period. Further, a comparatively better performance delivered by Bruker's BioSpin group, optics and semiconductor metrology businesses as well as a margin recovery observed in the Bruker Nano-surfaces business, encourages us. Evidently the cost-reduction action previously adopted by the company in its Nano-surfaces business played its role suitably. However, a reduction observed in management's revenue guidance for the company's 2016 results, again deflates this optimism.Bruker currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Idexx had been a wonderful stock for us over the past 13 years, compounding at better than a 17% rate from the time of our original purchases in 2003 through June 30. This compares to a 7.4% compound for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Idexx has a terrific market position in veterinary diagnostics and a very capable CEO in Jon Ayers. But the market fully realizes IdexxAAAs strengths. It is according Idexx a price-to- earnings ratio of more than 40x the 2016 consensus earnings per share estimate of $ 2.21. The company has grown earnings per share at an 11% rate for the past five years and should grow a bit below that rate in 2016.

Dogs, cats, rabbits, birds of prey, potbellied pigs: all welcome there.The hospital offers high-profile proof of a thriving pet-health industry, or what analysts call the \"companion animal\" business. Nearly two-thirds of U.S. households own a pet. But that percentage is constantly rising. So is the amount that the U.S. population is expected to spend on its pets -- a cool $63 billion this year, according to the American Pet Products Association. Adoptions are up nationwide. The number of animals euthanized is down, and analyst surveys indicate that most veterinarians expect their practices to keep growing.As demand rises, the pet industry has expanded to meet needs: Drugmakers  (  ) and  (  ), high-quality pet food maker  (  ), diagnostics provider  (  ) and pet health insurer  (  ). The new products and services are there, and pet owners, heeding their veterinarians' advice, have been willing to spend.\"I don't think it's that they didn't want to take care of [pets] in the past,\" Stifel analyst Jonathan Block said. \"I think just advancements in medicine and surgeries have allowed people to take better care of them.\"The expansion has been led by a generation of baby boomers who have become empty-nesters and seek out pets for company. Many younger adults have also put off marriage, opting for the \"cats, not kids\" approach to family. And dog parks have become increasingly popular safe zones in which pets and a broad range of owners can mingle.\"Several decades ago, it was pets in the backyard. Then it was pets in the house, and then sitting beside you at the dinner table, and then sleeping in your bedroom,\" Credit Suisse analyst Erin Wilson said. \"It's that progression that has increased overall willingness of pet owners to maintain their pets.\"The combination of pet ownership and finance has resulted in some peculiar turns of phrase in earnings announcements. \"Reptile is sort of in an upswing,\" pet-supplies seller  (CENT) noted last month, and the company is experiencing a \"premiumization in dog and cat.\" Blue Buffalo, meanwhile, has been helped by \"new innovation in our wet foods treats and meat rolls.\" Pet insurer Trupanion last month remarked that \"total enrolled pets (including pets from our other business segment) was 307,298 at quarter-end, up 25% over the prior year period.\"Language notwithstanding, the reports all point to an industry that held up well, comparatively, even during the recession. While the recession urged many human health-care consumers to delay their own health care -- and shoppers to downgrade their family's food purchases -- sales of higher-end pet food and services proved much more durable.\"The trade-down in pet care was still much lower than you were seeing in areas like the grocery store,\" Gabelli & Co. analyst Kevin Kedra said. \"You were much more likely to get the store brand cornflakes and mac-and-cheese than you were to get store-brand dog or cat food.\"Stocks within the companion-animal industry are all over the map this year. Zoetis and Abaxis are down for the year. Thinly-traded Central Garden & Pet is up 65% since Dec. 31.Several group leaders are also up for the year, have held above their 50-day lines and maintain strong Composite Ratings from IBD. VCA, which runs a network consisting of hundreds of animal hospitals and dozens of diagnostic labs, has led the charge.The vast majority of U.S. veterinary practices, estimated to be at least 25,000, aren't corporate owned. Thus, VCA's acquisition opportunities remain numerous, and its size facilitates the process.\"It's much easier for an independent practitioner to sell to VCA than to cobble together a group of vets to buy out the practice,\" Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang wrote in a research report.VCA also stands to gain from opportunities in higher-margin services, she said, like dermatology, dentistry and ophthalmology.\"Five years ago, a dog undergoing ACL surgery would certainly not be the norm,\" Block said.To enhance that trend, VCA has put more effort into training vets to be more tech-savvy and business-savvy, Wilson said. The aim: keep them abreast of more advanced -- and more expensive -- forms of treatment. VCA also attends to smaller details, like sending out text reminders for appointments, which can reduce the number of cancellations.Wellness programs -- which customers can pay into over a longer period of time in exchange for checkups, tests and other services -- help reduce sticker shock. New lab tests can produce results within minutes, and roughly half of diagnostic testing is done in-house, as opposed to a decade ago when most of those tests were sent to labs. Even when an outside lab needs to take care of something, couriers for VCA or Idexx pick up samples twice a day, Block said.Analysts say that Idexx, VCA's primary competitor on reference-lab resources, has developed the more-innovative equipment. One such new test, SDMA, is designed to provide early detection of kidney disease -- a leading killer of both dogs and cats.Idexx offers the Catalyst One, a breadmaker-size device that can process samples and generate results in as little as eight minutes. The Catalyst is geared toward smaller, less-busy hospitals, and can help draw them into more advanced in-house diagnostic testing, Wilson said.Idexx also offers IT programs that bring together test data from reference labs and vet clinics, making it easier for practices to analyze results.Analysts say the companion business remains largely cash-based and is isolated from issues that complicate human health care -- regulations, generic drugs and the tug of war between insurers, drugmakers, hospitals and customers. Its growth has also outpaced that of the human health-care industry.On the drugmaker side of the pet health business, some of that growth has been helped by companies like Zoetis, a spinoff of  (PFE), and Abaxis. Among the potential blockbusters are Zoetis' Apoquel. The oral drug treats a type of allergic dermatitis in dogs and could bring in up to $300 million a year in sales.Zoetis has also introduced Simparica, a chewable flea and tick drug for dogs. Merck has a similar product, Bravecto.  's (SNY) veterinary unit Merial offers the chewable NexGard treatment, and also manufactures the topical flea medication Frontline. Chewable drugs avoid the mess -- and toxicity - of external meds applied to a dog's back, and bypass the challenge of administering tablets.Companies that make drugs for animals also benefit from an easier, far less expensive Food & Drug Administration approval process. Zoetis largely sells directly to veterinarians, who then sell the drugs to pet owners. Smaller rivals often use distributors like  (HSIC), VCA's primary distributor, or MWI Veterinary Supply, which distributor  (ABC) bought last year in attempt to tap into the market.\"We have drugs that were studied in animals and that's how we got them into human trials, and now we're bringing them back to the animals,\" Kedra said.Acquisitions have helped elsewhere. Central Garden & Pet agreed in December to buy the pet bedding business of National Consumer Outdoors. In July, it also bought up nearly all of IMS Trading, which makes Cadet brand dog treats. Those purchases came on the cheap, and might have been the reason why the company raised recent sales and earnings forecasts, GARP Research analyst Bill Baker wrote in a May research note.Central's Nylabone is known for its dog bones and other chewables. Nylabone also makes Nubz dog snacks, which GARP sees giving Greenies, a treat loved by dogs and cats alike made by Tennessee-based Nutro, a run for their money. In addition, Central produces so-called insect-growth regulator compounds, which interrupt the life cycle of a pest and which GARP says local governments could potentially use to combat the spread of the Zika virus.Even \"Finding Dory,\" the sequel to the movie \"Finding Nemo,\" could help lift sales in the company's large aquatics business.\"The original movie stimulated aquarium sales so much that the industry has been reeling ever since enthusiasm waned,\" GARP analyst Bill Baker wrote in a May research note.Within pet insurance, Block said, Trupanion offers plans that pay 90% of a pet's medical invoice, as opposed to plans with less flexible, fee-based schedules that alienated veterinarians in years past.\"The reason why pet insurance has flopped in North America for many, many years is that it was fee-based,\" Block said. \"And what that means is, literally, there's a fee schedule, and the insurer looks up ACL surgery and they're gonna pay $1,100 dollars whether that ACL surgery took place in midtown Manhattan or Omaha, Nebraska. And that's a problem.\"Trupanion is also introducing some direct-pay plans. In those plans, the company directly pays the veterinarian the 90% they agree to cover, doing away with the standard reimbursement process in which the pet owner shells out the full amount to the clinic and then waits for the insurer to repay their due portion.Looking ahead, if the economy teeters into a recession, pet spending could fall. According to Morningstar, Idexx makes a lot of money internationally, so the strong dollar could weigh on its results. As VCA grows, it risks coming across as a corporate-acquisition machine indifferent to locals, the investment firm also noted.The pet insurance market, however, is between 1% to 2% penetrated, analysts say, which gives Zoetis or VCA more sway over prices. Malpractice lawsuits are rare, and costs related to bad debt are lower than those found in hospitals for humans, Morningstar said.\"You don't have worries about what Hillary Clinton is going to do on drug pricing and Medicare,\" Kedra said. \"That doesn't matter on the pet side.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Techies often quip that the internet is made of cats.And whether you love or hate the proliferation of cat videos traveling around social media, they reflect an important underlying trend: Americans take videos of cats partly because they have more of them.In times of robust consumer spending -- like now -- people are more willing to adopt pets and commit to the long-term care of those animals. That includes their health care, which unlike most human health care, is paid out of pocket by the patient's doting family.This has worked to the benefit of  (  ), America's leading chain of animal hospitals. The company benefits from the amusing ticker symbol of \"WOOF,\" but the interest in the sector is serious.\"Big money is flowing into defensive areas such as food, beverage, tobacco and utility stocks,\" ETF manager Matthew Tuttle of Tuttle Tactical Management said in an email. \"Pet-care stocks fit that mold and have caught a strong bid recently as consumers now consider pets as part of their family. Even if the economy slows down, or enters a recession, consumers will continue to spend on their pets.\"To be fair, the big recession of 2007-09 was deep enough to hit the veterinary business, including VCA. But over the last 20 years, spending on pets has grown an average of 7% per year, according to Morningstar.And since the third quarter of 2011, VCA's profit and sales growth has been almost continuous, driven by unceasing increases in pet ownership.\"According to Pethealth, Inc., a leading provider of management software to animal welfare organizations in North America, year-over-year growth in pet adoptions across 1,226 animal shelters rose 5.5% in December, with average growth of 6.0% over the trailing three-month period,\" Credit Suisse analyst Erin Wilson wrote in her Feb. 3 initiation report on VCA. \"Pet euthanasia, inversely correlated to pet demand, dropped 15% in December, consistent with recent monthly trends, which was a positive for overall pet ownership.\"These trends continued in the first quarter, according to VCA Chief Executive Robert Antin, noting that growth went beyond just hospitals.\"The numbers that I see are contradictory on the new pets, but I don't think there's any question, there's a lot more pets that are out there,\" Antin said on the conference call discussing first-quarter results with analysts on April 27.\"We have a great vantage point through Camp Bow Wow,\" Antin went on to say. \"The most disposable (spending) level that you have is doggy day care, and it's rising at around 10% same-store growth.\"Camp Bow Wow, with around 120 sites, is one of several non-hospital services that VCA offers that currently provide about 20% of revenue. The most significant is Antech Diagnostics, its chain of 60 reference laboratories -- that is, labs performing specialty tests referred to it by hospitals and clinics. VCA and  (  ) hold a virtual duopoly in this market, and it is considered a lucrative trade.\"We find the hefty lab operating margins -- often north of 40% -- extremely appealing and far better than  ' (  ) human diagnostic operating margins of 15%,\" wrote Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang in an April 27 report.The margins also are higher than those of VCA's hospital business -- so even though Antech provides 18% of revenue, it provides 42% of operating profit. Still, the company has continued to enlarge its hospital network because it sees the industry as ripe for consolidation.[ibdchart symbol=\"woof\" type=\"daily\" size=\"threequarter\" position=\"rightchart\" ]VCA, North America's largest free-standing chain -- privately held rival Banfield has around 900 locations, but mostly inside PetSmart retail stores -- owns 762 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. But that's out of some 26,000 total hospitals north of the Rio Grande, according to Credit Suisse.Some of these are smaller chains, which VCA sees as acquisition targets. Most recently, on May 3 it acquired an 80% interest in Companion Animal Practices, North America, a Las Vegas-based chain of 56 animal hospitals.But it also likes to buy up single-site practices, provided that they have annual revenue of at least $1.2 million and employ at least two full-time veterinarians. To that end, it has a permanent \"Selling Your Hospital\" section on its website that says it can complete a transaction in 60 to 120 days.VCA also has been willing to buy to fill out its reference lab business. Last year it acquired the reference lab business of  (  ) for $21 million, helping build out its moat against competitors.\"It would be difficult for a startup to replicate VCA's reference lab infrastructure,\" analyst Wang wrote in her report. \"Labs compete on the basis of high levels of service, access to veterinary specialists for consultations, accuracy, and timeliness. (VCA) has established a sizable footprint in the most densely populated metropolitan areas where both density of pet ownership and relatively high household income support VCA's efficient lab operations.\"All this buyout activity leads Phil Davis, CEO of PSW Investments, to call VCA a \"roll-up play.\" However, in recent quarters it has also shown some organic growth. In the first quarter, same-store sales grew 7.6% at outlets on the hospital side that were open for more than a year, while internal growth in the lab business was 9.1%.Overall, VCA's earnings in the quarter rose 32% over the year-earlier quarter to 66 cents a share, while revenue climbed 13% to $563 million. That beat Wall Street's expectations, which had fallen after it issued a weak fourth-quarter report and guidance in January, and broke the stock out of a nine-month consolidation. On June 9, shares touched an all-time high of 66.26.Shares were down a little more than 1% on Friday but staked out new gains on Monday and hit an all-time high intraday of 66.98. The same happened on Tuesday, as shares hit a new intraday high of 67.78 before settling back to 67.35, a new closing high. With an overall Composite Rating of 97, VCA is No. 22 on the  list of leading growth stocks.It can be tough to forecast the growth of an acquisition-loving company, but analysts expect earnings to grow 21% this year to $2.87 a share, representing a slight deceleration from last year's 26% increase. Revenue is forecast to rise 16% to $2.47 billion, the highest growth rate since 2007.Analyst Wilson estimated on May 3 that the single-digit organic growth should continue, though not quite as robustly as in the first quarter. She forecasts 3% to 5% full-year growth on the hospital side and 6% to 8% growth on the lab side.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n Jul 1, we issued an updated research report on Delaware, NJ-based  - a manufacturer and distributor of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets.

With more than 60% of the reports already out, we are optimistic of this improving trend to continue through the season. Nevertheless, growth is still unlikely and the analysts are, by now, quite certain this will be the fifth straight quarter of an earnings decline for the S&P 500 index.As per our latest  report, around 317 S&P 500 members (73.5% of the index's total market capitalization) have released their results, and the scorecard shows 3.3% year-over-year decline in the index' Q2 earnings on 0.9% lower revenues. Medical, one of the 16 broader Zacks sectors, has however exhibited a promising performance so far. Earnings growth rate stood at 5.4% year over year on account of a 1.2% rise in revenues. For the remaining the season, earnings are expected to grow 3.4%, driven by impressive top-line growth expectation of 7.7% in this sector.Medical Instrument, a specialized sub-sector within the broader Medical sector, is showing a lot of potential as of now. This is impressive given the severe economic instability, fierce competition, and increasing cost related hazards leading to regulatory complexities. The success of the medical instrument industry comes on the back of successful execution of some top strategic priorities, which include R&D and product development; strategic M&A and alliances and a focus on emerging market expansion.Needless to say that factors like the recent exemption of the Medical Device Excise tax for the next two years has also come in as a much-needed breather for these Medical instrument stocks. We believe this exemption, albeit temporary, has boosted the positive sentiment in the medical device investment world, as most analysts believe it to be sufficient for companies to address pressing issues such as a lack of opportunity for R&D, innovation, pipeline development, and to make investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products.Let's take a look at the Medical Instruments stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Aug 2:Headquartered in Delaware NJ, IDEXX is a developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry along with water testing and dairy markets. IDEXX's robust worldwide commercial capabilities and best-in-class products, which include the next-generation chemistry analyzer - Catalyst One, are the key growth drivers over the near term.IDEXX is scheduled to report second-quarter 2016 numbers on Aug 2.

That is because both the Most Accurate estimate stands higher at 63 cents per share as compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate which remains at 62 cents. We note that while a favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise, a bullish Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of the ESP. We also observe that IDEXX' trailing 12-month earnings surprise is 6.33%. | San Diego, CA-based DexCom is a medical device company focused on the design, development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM). The large and growing diabetes market, strong product portfolio, innovative product pipeline, collaborative agreements with several companies and focus on international markets are key catalysts for Dexcom.Dexcom is scheduled to report second-quarter 2016 numbers on Aug 2. However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Dexcom is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because Dexcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a negative Earnings ESP of 36.36%.

In a moderately growing economy, the stock stands out for its growth prospects. Let's look at the highlights from the veterinary health specialist's recent first quarter to see what's going on. The headline figures:IDEXX had a good quarter, and the better-than-expected operational performance plusless unfavorable exchange rates gave management cause to raise full-year guidance. It's useful to break out organic guidance and constant currency adjusted revenue growth, in order to better attribute where the increase in guidance is coming from:The hike in organic revenue expectations is obviously a testimony to better operational execution --more on that in a moment, but less unfavorable exchange rates also played a big part. For example, $27 million of the $40 million increase in revenue guidance is purely due to the updated foreign exchange outlook.Whichever way you cut it, IDEXX had a good quarter. IDEXX generated 84% of its gross profit from its companion animal group (CAG) segment in the first quarter. Wven though the water (quality testing solutions) and livestock, poultry, and dairy (LPD) segments produced organic revenue growth of 11.2% and 3.5%, respectively, the CAG is the key to IDEXX's growth prospects.Indeed, the company went into the quarter focusing on generating CAG instrument placements in the U.S. and duly delivered by generating 18% growth in premium instrument placements. While instrument sales aren't the key to current revenue or profits, they are the spur for future growth in CAG diagnostics' recurring revenue growth.A break out of CAG revenue in the quarter shows the importance of recurring revenue, and in turn, the need to generate instrument placements.IMAGE SOURCE: IDEXX LABORATORIES PRESENTATIONS. Listening in on the , it's clear management believes IDEXX has significant growth opportunities ahead. Moreover, its success in recent quarters is a vindication of management's decision to shift to a direct sales model in 2014.CEO Jonathan Ayers discussed the benefits of the move:In short, the direct sales model shift appears to be working and accelerating growth for IDEXX. Investors will be hoping for more of the same in future from IDEXX. The company needs to continue generating productivity improvements out of its direct sales force, and in doing so, grow its placement sales.

On a constant currency basis, this figure improved 14% year over year; after accounting for an adverse 5 cent per share impact related to net changes in foreign exchange. The quarter's EPS was up 4.1% year over year on a reported basis.Moreover, the federal research and development tax credit boosted the company's first-quarter 2016 EPS growth by 2%. Strong top-line growth and better-than-expected operating margins in the first quarter as well as consistent share repurchases drove the upside in EPS.IDEXX's first-quarter revenues improved 9.2% year over year to $417.6 million and steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $405 million. Organic revenue growth was 11% driven by strong performance by the Companion Animal Group (CAG) and Water segments. Favorable foreign currency exchange benefitted first-quarter revenue growth by $5 million.Region-wise, in the reported quarter, IDEXX witnessed a 10% improvement in the U.S. amounting to revenues of $258.9 million (up 9.7% on an organic basis). In the international market, the company's sales increased 7.8% year over year to $158.6 million (up 12.1% on an organic basis). CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue growth was 13% in international markets, reflecting increased consumable revenue growth supported by high levels of instrument placements as well as improved lab revenue gains.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the first quarter, revenues improved 11.2% to $357.6 million organically at CAG , driven by 11% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, 16% organic revenue growth in CAG Diagnostics instruments, and 14% organic revenue growth in customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems. Favorable U.S. weather conditions also supported strong CAG growth. CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue gains reflected 15% organic growth in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services, driven by high teen organic revenue growth in the U.S. and 12% organic revenue growth in IDEXX VetLab consumables.The Water segment's revenues grew 11.2% organically to $23.6 million, primarily boosted by worldwide increases in core coliform and E.coli products, as well as benefits from the launch of IDEXX's recent Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS product, the extra day from the leap year, and favorable weather conditions.First-quarter LPD revenues increased 3.5% organically to $30.9 million. Solid growth in new products worldwide, strong growth in China porcine and poultry products and higher livestock services revenues in Australia primarily drove growth at this segment. However, this was partially offset by lower bovine revenues in Europe. Meanwhile, revenues in the 'Other' segment were up 10.8% organically to $5.5 million.Gross profit increased 6% to $227.5 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin contracted 190 basis points (bps) to 54.5% due to unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates (including the lapping of prior year hedge gains), higher manufacturing costs, and mix impacts from strong instrument sales; partially offset by benefits from moderate price gains. Sales and marketing expenses increased 6.2% to $79.8 million while general and administrative expenses rose 15.7% to $49.3 million. Research and development expenses dropped 1.5% to $24.6 million.Operating margin in the quarter contracted 130 bps to 17.7%. However, this was better than management's expectations, thanks to volume leverage and timing of operating expenses, which moderated cost growth in the first quarter.IDEXX exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $133 million compared with $129 million at the end of the previous quarter. The quarter's net operating cash flow was $23.2 million, compared with operating cash outflow of $14.6 million a year ago.During the reported quarter, the company bought back 700,000 shares for $50 million. Notably, the company achieved debt leverage ratios within its long-term target range during the first quarter. The company is left with 6.1 million shares under its current repurchase authorization.Encouraged by its strong start to 2016 and expected favorable foreign exchange rates, IDEXX raised its full-year 2016 outlook. Management currently expects revenues of $1.73-$1.75 billion for 2016, reflecting organic revenue growth of approximately 9-10% (reported 8-9%) against the previous top-line guidance of $1.69-$1.71 billion, reflecting normalized organic revenue growth of approximately 8-9% (reported 6-7%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.70 billion for the year.EPS is currently projected in the band of $2.18-$2.25, reflecting annualized growth of 3-7% (adjusted); 13-17% (constant currency adjusted) and 6-10% (reported); against the previous guidance of $2.10-$2.17, reflecting annualized growth of 0-3% (adjusted); 12-15% (constant currency adjusted) and 2-6% (reported). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $2.14 for full-year 2016.IDEXX started off 2016 on a strong note; with its first-quarter results squarely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the company's trend of consistent share buybacks for the past few quarters reflects its strong free cash flow reserve as well as management's success in optimizing IDEXX's capital structure. The company's raised its guidance for 2016 which also buoys optimism.Strong instrument placements, global lab momentum reflecting the company's leverage of expanded commercial capability as well as strong test menu expansion remained some of the key highlights for IDEXX's business at the start of 2016. However, foreign currency fluctuations are expected to consistently hurt IDEXX's operating results, although lower than the extent as expected before through all the remaining quarters of 2016.IDEXX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

On a reported basis, first-quarter EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 showed a 5.2% improvement year over year.Revenues for the reported quarter amounted to $4.29 billion, up 9.4% year over year, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.12 billion. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 10%. While acquisitions increased revenues by 1%, currency translation reduced revenues by 2%.Thermo Fisher currently operates in four business segments viz. Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Services.Impressively, Thermo Fisher delivered positive year-over-year growth in each of its business segments during the first quarter. Revenues from the Life Sciences Solutions Segment improved 11% year over year to $1.13 billion, while Analytical Instruments Segment sales grew 4% to $759 million. Revenues from the Laboratory Products and Services Segment improved 14% to $1.72 billion, while the Specialty Diagnostics Segment recorded 9% revenue growth to $855 million.Gross margin of 47.9% during the first quarter was down 132 basis points (bps) year over year on account of a 12.4% increase in cost of revenues. Adjusted operating margin contracted 91 bps to 20.7% on a 8.2% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses and a 6.5% increase in research and development expenses.The company exited the first quarter of 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of $826.8 million compared with $452 million at the end of full year 2015. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $289.1 million compared with the year-ago figure of $80 million.Thermo Fisher has raised its full year 2016 financial guidance, reflecting the inclusion of Affymetrix (acquisition closed on Mar 31 2016) for nine months, a less adverse foreign exchange environment, additional stock buybacks completed in the first quarter and stronger operational performance. Adjusted EPS is currently expected in the range of $8.05 to $8.19, indicating 9% to 11% growth year over year (earlier guidance was $7.80 to $7.96; growth of 6% to 8%). Besides, the company expects to deliver revenues in the range of $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion (earlier $17.36 billion to $17.56 billion) in 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at earnings of $7.94 per share and revenues of $17.58 billion, below the company's expectation.Thermo Fisher has started the year on a promising note, delivering better-than-expected first-quarter 2016 outcome that squarely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We are looking forward to the integration of Affimetrix, the recently completed mega acquisition by Thermo Fisher, which is expected to boost its offering in the fast-growing flow cytometry market through an advanced antibody portfolio. Moreover, in genetic analysis, Affymetrix's technologies should perfectly complement Thermo Fisher's products in targeted clinical and applied markets.We are also upbeat about the significant product launches by the company in the quarter including the Integrion HPIC system in applied markets. The company also deployed $1 billion of capital for share buybacks in the reported quarter.

However, severe foreign currency headwind hampered IDEXX's overall performance in the quarter.However, IDEXX continues to demonstrate solid growth worldwide. Overall normalized CAG organic revenue growth was 12% in the international markets, including the benefits of the company's recent acquisitions. This was driven by continued strong gains in consumable sales across major regions, including Europe, which were owing to record levels of new instrument placements.In 2015, the company witnessed strong international placements of catalysts and premium hematology analyzers. Alongside, chemistry and hematology instruments, including VetTest placements, were also strong in international markets, demonstrating significant benefits for investments in expanded global commercial capability.Currently, IDEXX is on track to accelerate CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue growth in the coming quarters. This is because the company continues to be productive in its all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. and its momentum overseas.Moreover, supported by a strong cash position, the company remains focused on delivering incremental returns to investors, thereby leveraging its earnings power.On the flip side, foreign exchange impacts related to the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar will continue to impact IDEXX's financial performance even in 2016.

That said, every company needs to deliver on its objectives in order to keep investors happy, and IDEXX certainly did that in its fourth-quarter results on Friday. Whichever way you look at it, IDEXX had a strong quarter. Normalized organic revenue growth of 11% in the fourth quarter was slightly above management's expectations. Quarterly reported revenue increased 14% year over year with the key Companion Animal Group, or CAG, segment recording normalized organic revenue growth of 13%.The earnings picture is somewhat complicated by foreign currency movements, an impairment charge in 2015, and previous years' expenses. All told, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter at constant currency came in 9% ahead of the prior year period. Full-year 2015 adjusted EPS of $2.11 increased 14% year over year when adjusted for currency.Here's a quick look at income from operations from the three reporting segments to show their relative importance:DATA SOURCE: IDEXX LABORATORIES INC. PRESENTATIONS.As you can see in the table below, revenue growth in each segment was significantly affected by currency movements. Nonetheless, Water (quality testing solutions) and CAG reported strong increases in organic revenue. Water benefited from the launch of a new product (the Quanti-Tray sealer) and what CFO Brian McKeown called \" worldwide increases in core product sales.\"\n  \n *ALSO INCLUDES A POSITIVE 0.8% CONTRIBUTION FROM AN ACQUISITION.Turning to the CAG segment, McKeown outlined strong instrument placement growth in the fourth quarter: \"Global premium instrument placements increased 35% in Q4 supported by 61% growth in Catalyst placements. Global instrument revenue of $29 million was up 28% organically year-on-year in Q4.\" He continued, \"For the full year we placed 4,944 Catalysts and 3,744 premium hematology analyzers globally representing growth of 59% and 17%, respectively, well ahead of our goals.\"In addition, CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue -- comprising IDEXX's consumables, services, and rapid assay products in the CAG segment -- generated 23.9% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Putting this into context, the recurring revenue represented 84.5% of total CAG revenue in 2015. Management made some tweaks to full-year 2016 guidance, but they didn't amount to any significant changes.Key points:Again, the impact of currency can be seen in the EPS guidance. On a reported level, EPS is forecast to increase just 2% to 6% in 2016, while on a constant currency adjusted basis, it represents a 12% to 15% increase. Heading into 2016, IDEXX will come up against some strong comparables from 2015. The expectation of 8.5% to 9.5% full-year growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue assumes an improvement in the second half. Management's focus in the U.S. \"will be on placements at new and competitive counts,\" according to McKeown on the earnings call, with the company targeting \"solid gains in CAG instrument revenues as well.\"The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Impressively, Walgreens Boots' earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 15.22%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Within just a year of the strategic combination of the legacy Walgreens Co. and Boots Alliance, Walgreens Boots has emerged as a new global leader in the pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing retail space. So far, the legacy Walgreens' partnership with Alliance Boots has yielded positive results, with combined synergies totalling $799 million in fiscal 2015, significantly higher than the company's target of at least $650 million.Currently, management is focused on improving its operational performance across all segments, reinvesting in the stores of the Retail Pharmacy USA division to enhance the customer experience, expanding retail margins as well as restructuring of the cost base. As Walgreens Boots strides on the synergy track, the company continues to expect to exceed the combined synergy goal of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2016. The plan focuses on improving core performance in the near term as well.Moreover, in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, Walgreens Boots had implemented a new restructuring initiative for cost reduction and enhancement of operational efficiencies. This initiative resulted in an increment of $500 million to the projected cost savings initiative worth $1 billion previously adopted by the legacy Walgreens.To execute this program, management has decided to shut down 200 stores across the U.S. by 2017, of which 75 have been closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, in line with the company's target closure of 70-80 stores.Further, the company currently expects to earn adjusted EPS in the $4.25-$4.55 range for fiscal 2016, narrower than the earlier guided range of $4.25-$4.60. The narrower projection reflects the impact of suspending the company's share buyback program, in a bid to apply these funds toward the consideration for the Rite Aid transaction.Analysts are also optimistic about the company's impending acquisition of retail pharmacy chain - Rite Aid, expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2016. Impressively encouraging integration synergy expected from this deal, has so far motivated the market sentiment in a significant way.On the flip side, Walgreens Boots continues to face tough challenges from other retail giants and/or from the government's relentless drive to manage healthcare costs. Moreover, the company's biggest business in the U.K. - Boots has been facing a challenging retail environment particularly in the supermarket sector and management does not foresee much opportunity for new store openings therein.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Walgreens Boots is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Walgreens Boots has an ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 97 cents. Walgreens Boots has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Curis, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Fate Therapeutics, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +3.85% and a Zacks Rank #2.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +6.82% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Impressively, Walgreens Boots' earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 15.22%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Within just a year of the strategic combination of the legacy Walgreens Co. and Boots Alliance, Walgreens Boots has emerged as a new global leader in the pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing retail space. So far, the legacy Walgreens' partnership with Alliance Boots has yielded positive results, with combined synergies totalling $799 million in fiscal 2015, significantly higher than the company's target of at least $650 million.Currently, management is focused on improving its operational performance across all segments, reinvesting in the stores of the Retail Pharmacy USA division to enhance the customer experience, expanding retail margins as well as restructuring of the cost base. As Walgreens Boots strides on the synergy track, the company continues to expect to exceed the combined synergy goal of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2016. The plan focuses on improving core performance in the near term as well.Moreover, in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, Walgreens Boots had implemented a new restructuring initiative for cost reduction and enhancement of operational efficiencies. This initiative resulted in an increment of $500 million to the projected cost savings initiative worth $1 billion previously adopted by the legacy Walgreens.To execute this program, management has decided to shut down 200 stores across the U.S. by 2017, of which 75 have been closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, in line with the company's target closure of 70-80 stores.Further, the company currently expects to earn adjusted EPS in the $4.25-$4.55 range for fiscal 2016, narrower than the earlier guided range of $4.25-$4.60. The narrower projection reflects the impact of suspending the company's share buyback program, in a bid to apply these funds toward the consideration for the Rite Aid transaction.Analysts are also optimistic about the company's impending acquisition of retail pharmacy chain - Rite Aid, expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2016. Impressively encouraging integration synergy expected from this deal, has so far motivated the market sentiment in a significant way.On the flip side, Walgreens Boots continues to face tough challenges from other retail giants and/or from the government's relentless drive to manage healthcare costs. Moreover, the company's biggest business in the U.K. - Boots has been facing a challenging retail environment particularly in the supermarket sector and management does not foresee much opportunity for new store openings therein.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Walgreens Boots is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Walgreens Boots has an ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 97 cents. Walgreens Boots has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Curis, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Fate Therapeutics, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +3.85% and a Zacks Rank #2.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +6.82% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Source: Idexx Laboratories. reported solid third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The look forward, though, wasn't nearly as pleasant for the animal diagnostic testing company.\n  \n Jonathan Ayers, Idexx's chairman and CEO, explained why the revenue guidance was reduced, \"This outlook reflects moderated market growth trends in Europe and recent macroeconomic impacts, including effects from foreign currency erosion, limiting emerging-market gains.\" For the adjusted earnings-per-share revision, Ayers blamed \"additional headwinds from recent foreign currency changes in emerging markets and a higher effective tax rate, affected by updated estimates for regional profit mix including foreign currency impacts.\" Taxes, currency changes, and macroeconomic issues -- things out of Idexx's control -- are a pretty good excuse for lowered guidance.In addition to tests that are run by veterinarians, Idexx runs a reference laboratory where samples can be sent for testing, which is growing quite nicely and taking market share. \"I believe the 13% organic growth in the third quarter is indicative of the cumulative success that we're having in the reference lab modality,\" Ayers said. \"I think that's higher than the market growth. And if your growth is higher than the market growth for lab modality, then by definition you're gaining share.\" .That's of course true only if the growth is coming from volume, not price increases, which CFO Brian McKeon confirmed was the case. Management didn't say which company was losing market share, but  isn't growing nearly as fast. VCA reported that laboratory revenue increased 9.1% in the third quarter, but some of that was because of an acquisition. On a same-store basis, VCA's laboratory revenue increased only 6%. Despite the strong third quarter, the outlook for the rest of this year and 2016 isn't nearly as strong. Management guided for next year's normalized organic revenue growth in the 8% to 9% range. And the bottom line will look even worse, with the stronger dollar and higher taxes expected to have a drag on earnings. Management guided for adjusted earnings per share to grow only 1% to 5% next year.While it's hard to get excited about the tepid growth, the items reducing the growth are mostly one-time troubles that are out of the company's hands. If Idexx continues to perform well, placing instruments and taking market share from competitors, 2017 growth will look a lot better.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because IDEXX Laboratoriesis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for IDXX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 47 cents per share for IDXX, compared to a Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for IDXX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 6.82% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that IDXX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead forIDEXX Laboratories, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Though the company's top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter, it increased year over year primarily on strong performance from its Companion Animal Group (CAG) segment.IDEXX continues to demonstrate solid growth worldwide. The company enjoys strong international expansion with Catalyst placements playing a major role. During the second quarter, IDEXX continued the global rollout of Catalyst One with launches in Australia and Brazil. The company currently has plans to complete the Catalyst One launches in Asia (excluding Japan) and the rest of Latin America by the third quarter of 2015.Also, continued expansion of global instrument base and high customer adoption rate supports the projection of 15.5%-16.5% normalized organic growth in global CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in 2015, including about 5% benefit from U.S. margin capture.Currently, IDEXX is on track to accelerate CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue growth in the coming quarters. This is because the company continues to be productive in its all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. and its momentum overseas. Management believes that an unprecedented wave of innovations, which IDEXX already boasts and plans to bring to the market on a larger scale, will immensely benefit it in both the near and long term.Moreover, supported by a strong cash position, the company remains focused on delivering incremental returns to investors, thereby leveraging its earnings power.However, foreign currency fluctuations significantly hampered the overall performance of IDEXX. During the second quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates impacted total revenue by approximately $25.6 million, primarily due to the strong U.S. dollar. This also reduced the company's operating profit by $6.7 million and earnings per share by 5 cents during the quarter.Currently, IDEXX estimates that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will reduce its 2015 revenues by $86 million, operating profit by $17.9 million and EPS by 13 cents - lower than that estimated by the company earlier.Also, high dependence on third-party distributors and intense competition continue to pose threats.

Adjusted EPS also improved from the year-ago quarter by the same margin. The quarter's adjustment include 6 cents negative impact related to non-cash impairment charge for capitalized software associated with changes in the company's customer information management business strategy in the reported quarter.On a reported basis, EPS came in at 48 cents, down 7.7% year over year.IDEXX's revenues improved 5.9% year over year to $406.4 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $407 million. Foreign exchange adversely affected revenue growth by 6%. Normalized organic revenue growth was 12%, partly driven by strong growth in the Companion Animal Group (CAG) segment, including 11% normalized organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues.Region-wise, IDEXX experienced an 11.9% improvement in the U.S. amounting to revenues of $252.1 million. In the international market, the company's sales declined 2.5% year over year to $154.3 million. Despite that, the company registered 13% growth at constant exchange rate or CER driven by strong CAG growth, including the benefits of recent acquisitions. Normalized CAG organic revenue growth was 14% in international markets, reflecting continued strong gains across major regions.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the third quarter, the company's organic revenues improved 13.2% to $344.1 million in CAG, driven by continued strong growth in reference lab and instrument consumable sales as well as improved growth in rapid assay. The Water segment's revenues grew 6.7% organically to $25.9 million. Organic growth was primarily boosted by solid existing and new business growth across major regions.Third-quarter LPD revenues increased 5.5% organically to $30.4 million. Gains in bovine, poultry and swine testing in Europe and emerging markets, including benefits from new dairy pregnancy testing products contributed to the growth.Revenues in the 'Other' segment declined 19.7% to $5.9 million.Gross profit increased 5.1% to $224.3 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin contracted 44 basis points (bps) to 56.3% due to business mix impacts from very strong instrument sales, which offset benefits from lower product costs.Sales and marketing expenses were up 3.5% at $73.1 million while general and administrative expenses increased 1.1% to $46.2 million. Research and development expenses inched up 0.1% to $24.9 million.Operating margin in the quarter expanded 89 bps to 19.7%.IDEXX exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $141.2 million, compared with $163.2 million at the end of second-quarter 2015. The company also reported total long-term debt of $599.6 million as of Sep 30, 2015, compared to $598.9 million as of Jun 30, 2015.

The company is left with 98.1 million shares under its current repurchase authorization.In view of the ongoing foreign exchange headwind, IDEXX has updated its full-year 2015 outlook. Management currently expects revenues of $1.59-$1.60 billion in 2015 (earlier $1.60-$1.62 billion), reflecting normalized organic revenue growth of approximately 11% (12-13%). Adjusted EPS is expected in the band of $2.04-$2.07 (lower than the earlier guided $2.07-$2.12), reflecting annualized growth of 2-4% (4-6%).We believe IDEXX's robust worldwide commercial capabilities and best-in-class products, which include the next-generation chemistry analyzer - Catalyst One, are the key growth drivers over the near term.However, foreign currency fluctuations are expected to consistently hamper IDEXX's revenue growth, operating profits and EPS growth, through the remaining quarters of 2015.Currently, IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

This means that the company's aim of becoming a \"community pharmacy\" is  .Moreover, despite ballooning government deficits that threaten any business relying on public expenditures in the long term, I'm willing to bet on the idea that healthcare expenditure -- public or private -- is likely going to be the least resistant to cutbacks.However, it isn't just about demographics.

Idexx claims to be \"the global leader in diagnostics and information technology solutions for animal health and water and milk quality.\" However, it's real growth prospects lie in its Companion Animal Group, responsible for more than 80% of revenue.The long-term story here is one of demographics and cultural changes leading to increased expenditures on companion animals.

Furthermore, as you can see in the chart below, spending on pets actually grew during the last recession -- indicating that it's a recession-proof industry.Source: American Pet Products Association.Idexx's management said that it sees U.S. Veterinary and Pet spending increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.5% from 2014-2020 when discussing a \"long-term double digit organic growth opportunity.\" The industrial supply industry is characterized by a vast number of small players holding a microscopic share of the marketplace. For example, as  , according to  , the top 50 companies only make up 30% of the U.S. marketplace. In a sense, it's not surprising because small supply companies are often set up to serve local industrial companies, often with their own specific niche.MSC Industrial's growth opportunity is via consolidating the industry through scaling up in order to service national customers. The company is doing this, but as I've  , it's suffering some near-term margin erosion in the process. In addition, its prospects will always be largely tied to fortunes in the U.S. industrial sector. However, if you believe in the idea of a U.S. industrial renaissance, then MSC Industrial is well positioned to grow.Cognex Corporation specializes in machine vision solutions that help companies monitor and manage automated processes. The automotive industry is known for being an early adopter of manufacturing technology and, as such, constitutes Cognex's core marketplace.Cognex's management has been busy expanding its total addressable market through expansion into other industry verticals, such as food, logistics, and consumer electronics. The growth opportunity comes from other industries and emerging market manufacturers starting to adopt its technology in order to improve the efficiency of their automated manufacturing.However, no growth company expands without some teething problems, and the recent results were disappointing. In short, management failed to sign deals they were  . No matter; if you believe in the long-term story, then Cognex has plenty of time to grow. Taking a balanced view, Walgreen offers the benefits of scale and globalization, but it also carries some political risk. MSC Industrial is suffering some near-term margin decline, and you need to believe in the long-term future of U.S. manufacturing in order to confidently buy the stock.Cognex is attractive, but don't buy it if you can't tolerate volatility. And finally, Idexx operates in competitive markets, and there is no guarantee its diagnostics solutions will retain their market position.With that said, all four companies look well placed within their industries, and are worth a good look for long-term investors.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

However, foreign exchange adversely affected EPS growth by 5 cents.IDEXX's revenues improved 5.6% year over year to $413.3 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $415 million. Foreign exchange adversely affected revenue growth by 7%. Normalized organic revenue growth was 11% partly driven by incremental margin capture associated with the company's move to an all-direct sales model for US CAG Diagnostics.Region-wise, IDEXX experienced a 12.8% improvement in the U.S. amounting to revenues of $254.2 million. In the international market, the company's sales declined 3.4% year over year to $159.1 million, on account of over 11% normalized organic growth. Normalized CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 13% in international markets, reflecting continued strong gains across major regions.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the second quarter, the company's revenues improved 9.2% to $351.6 million in CAG, driven by constant strong gains in reference laboratory diagnostics, consulting services and instrument consumables. The segment's normalized organic revenues increased 13%, primarily due to a 19% gain in IDEXX VetLab consumables and 12% growth in reference lab and consulting services.The Water segment's revenues grew 2.3% to $25.1 million, up 8% organically. Organic growth was primarily driven by worldwide increases in IDEXX's core coliform and E.coli products and the launch of its new Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS product.Second-quarter LPD revenues dropped 14.1% to $32.1 million, down 1% organically. Lower livestock services revenue in Australia outweighed the solid gains in Europe, North America and China, thereby resulting in the revenue decline.Revenues in the 'Other' segment declined 25.6% to $4.6 million.Gross profit increased 6.5% to $232.8 million in the reported quarter. Consequently, gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) to 56.3% driven by lower product and royalty costs as well as net favorable margin impacts from foreign exchange reflecting benefits from hedge gains.Sales and marketing expenses spiked 10.6% to $75.2 million while general and administrative expenses increased 7.3% to $44.9 million. Research and development expenses, however, dropped 4.4% to $24.3 million.Operating margin remained almost flat at 21.4%, reflecting higher operating expenses in the quarter.IDEXX exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $163.2 million, compared with $182.2 million at the end of first quarter 2015. The company also reported total long-term debt of $598.9 million as of Jun 30, 2015, up from $500 million as of Mar 31, 2015. As of Jun 30, 2015, net operating cash inflow was $65.5 million, compared to net operating cash outflow of $14.6 million, as of Mar 31, 2015.During the reported quarter, the company bought back 1,417,000 shares for $92 million. The company is left with 9,332,194 shares under its repurchase authorization.IDEXX has reaffirmed its full-year 2015 outlook. Management continues to expect revenues of $1.60-$1.62 billion in 2015, reflecting normalized organic revenue growth of 12-13%. IDEXX also continues to expect its adjusted EPS in the band of $2.07-$2.12, reflecting annualized growth of 4-6%.We believe IDEXX's robust worldwide commercial capabilities and best-in-class products which include the next-generation chemistry analyzer - Catalyst One are the key growth drivers going forward.However, foreign currency fluctuations are expected to consistently hamper IDEXX's revenue growth, operating profits and EPS growth, in the remaining quarters of 2015.Currently, IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked medical instrument stocks are LDR Holding Corp.  , Mazor Robotics Ltd.  and Avinger, Inc.  .

Laboratory lab testing and consulting services increased 12%. The new kidney function test, SDMA, which is being included in all panels, and a new fecal antigen test should help drive lab testing in the future.Organic revenue for tests on livestock, poultry, and dairy was down 1%, but the segment only makes up 7.8% of revenue, so it's not a major impediment to growth. IDEXX blamed lower livestock services revenue in Australia for the decline, but noted that China is on the upswing.The only other downside came from IDEXX's rapid assay products, which increased just 3% as new competition continued to cut into the company's share of the market. It is hoping new head-to-head comparisons that show IDEXX's tests are more sensitive at detecting infectious diseases than its competitors' will help the product line start growing again. The recent switch from a distributor model to in-house sales people may end up helping IDEXX reaccelerate sales of the rapid assay products because it'll be easier to get its message across to veterinarians with an in-house salesforce.A slightly better operating margin and a lower number of shares outstanding helped IDEXX grow earnings per share faster than revenue growth. Second-quarter earnings per share were up 9% year over year to $0.60 per share. If it weren't for the changes in currencies, IDEXX estimates that earnings-per-share growth would have grown 18%. Despite the solid quarter, IDEXX maintained its guidance with 2015 adjusted earnings per share expected to be 4% to 6% higher than 2014. After lowering guidance last quarter, management may be acting conservatively to keep from sending investors on a seesaw.Getting its rapid assay tests growing at a decent pace will help the company exceed guidance in the second half of the year, but IDEXX also has a nice foundation of machines that run other tests, which will drive future consumable sales regardless of whether the rapid assay tests reaccelerate or not.The Motley Fool's mission is to help the world invest, better.

Third quarter revenue didn't look that bad with an increase of 6% year over year that was adversely affected by six percentage points due to the stronger dollar.There was a 12% year-over-year increase in normalized organic revenue growth, which removes the currency changes, revenue from business acquisitions, and impact of inventory changes due to the switch from distributors to direct selling. While it's a lot of things to subtract out, normalized organic revenue growth is the best measure of the company's growth because it subtracts out all the things the company doesn't have control over.After the second quarter, IDEXX Laboratories said to expect 2015 normalized organic revenue growth of 12% to 13%, so the third quarter's 12% growth fell in line with the guidance, albeit at the low end.Unfortunately, IDEXX Laboratories doesn't think it'll be able to stay at that level in the fourth quarter. The new 2015 guidance is for approximately 11% normalized organic revenue growth. The company blamed \"moderated market growth trends in Europe and recent macroeconomic impacts, including effects from foreign currency erosion, constraining targeted emerging market gains\" for the lower expectations.Earnings guidance was also adjusted downwards. IDEXX Laboratories now expects 2015 adjusted earnings per share to increase 2% to 4% year over year, compared to a previous guidance of 4% to 6% year-over-year growth. The adjusted earnings per share include foreign exchange rate changes, although it's a moderate effect because the company has currency hedges in place. Earnings are also be effected by higher taxes, including the Federal R&D tax credit that hasn't been renewed.IDEXX's competitor  is up 19% today, though it doesn't seem to be due to IDEXX's issues, but rather the strength of Abaxis' own earnings after the bell last night. Abaxis' veterinary sales were up 11% year over year and its medical market, which doesn't compete with IDEXX, grew even more. Abaxis' veterinary sales are mostly in North America, so it doesn't have the same issues as IDEXX. Management released guidance for 2016, and it doesn't look any prettier. Normalized organic revenue growth is expected to be in the 8% to 9% range. Unfortunately the aforementioned hedges that helped prop up the bottom line will have expired, and adjusted earnings per share is only expected to grow 1% to 5%.A lot of IDEXX's issues are one-time items -- the dollar can't strengthen forever -- so there's no sense in long-term investors worrying about them. The slowdown in Europe is a little more troublesome, but as long as it's a macro issue that's out of IDEXX's hands -- as opposed to losing market share -- the company will be just fine. When Europeans feel they have more to spend on their pets, the veterinarians will be all set to run IDEXX's diagnostics.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Forty-seven percent of American households own at least one dog. In addition to the horde of canines, an estimated 95.6 million felines have human owners (although who owns who is highly debatable with cats).Money follows love. As a nation, we're expected to shell out a record  billion on our beloved furry companions this year. That's more than double what America spent a mere decade ago.With other countries following the trend, companion animal spending is at an all-time high. Meanwhile, improving standards of living in emerging markets are driving up demand for meat protein. To meet the demand, the world's livestock sector is growing at an unprecedented rate, according to the These two trends are behind the powerful gains of animal health companies such as  (NYSE: ZTS), which was spun out of  (NYSE: PFE) two years ago. In the past year, Zoetis has  its Big Pharma Daddy, both in stock price and earnings gains.Ready for the kicker? The potential of the animal health space often flies under the radar. Analysts tend to ignore these stocks, despite how minimal generic condition for animal meds gives the industry significant pricing power compared to human pharma. There are also no single payers around (such as government agencies or PBMS) to squash price increases, which can knock a gaping hole in a human health company's profitability almost overnight.There's clear opportunity in the animal health space for investors not afraid to take a bite. Here are two stocks with solid growth prospects over the long term. The first also has a potential catalyst that could lead to big gains this year. (NYSE: ZTS) is the largest global animal health company by revenue, and pays a small dividend of about 0.7%.Scale is a big deal in the animal health, since it allows for higher margins and stronger growth. Zoetis' size and broad portfolio of drugs helps supports its own sales force, so it can bypass distributors.Zoetis also has a potentially huge catalyst ahead. Last November, high-profile activist investor Bill Ackman acquired a $2 billion stake in Zoetis and started to work with management. Ackman's stake is roughly 10% of the company, and he now has one director on the board.Ackman, at the very least, should be able to accelerate efficiencies at Zoetis. But the big question is whether he will engineer another deal, as is his tendency. You may recall Ackman's involvement in the highly-publicized  of  by  . While Ackman didn't get the deal he wanted with Allergan, the company was bought at a premium after he acquired a 10% stake. Some estimate he made about  on the deal, and Allergan's small shareholders emerged as winners as well.Ackman has long been allied with  , which has been mentioned as a potential buyer for Zoetis, as well as  , and  . None, however, have marched up to the plate yet. Still  since Zoetis has been fully independent from Pfizer for less than two years, rules governing the tax benefits of such separations could delay bids until sometime this year.Of course, trying to ride Ackman's coattails is highly risky, as Motley Fool contributor Alexander MacLennan  recently. In addition, Zoetis' stock already had a pop when Ackman bought in. Investors should understand the risk -- there is no guarantee of any buyout bid ever coming.Long story short, Zoetis isn't a buy based on Ackman's involvement. But in my opinion, the company looks attractive on its own for long-term investors. Ackman's involvement suggests he sees the company as substantially undervalued, something he got right with Allergan.One risk for Zoetis is worth noting. The FDA recently issued guidelines for the use of antibiotics in livestock. Since the guidelines are voluntary, they won't significantly affect Zoetis sales. That situation could change, however, if they become more restrictive. What Ackman may be seeing is how the pet market and surging demand for animal protein is driving an impressive earnings track record for Zoetis. The company beat estimates in three of the last four quarters (average surprise 3.45%), including the last one. California-based  (NASDAQ: WOOF) reported fabulous earnings last quarter. Revenue jumped 11% to almost $500 million from a year ago, and net income rose 12%. The core of WOOF is its animal hospital business, which provides 78% of the revenue. The company also boasts a nationwide clinical laboratory system, and is a leader in the highly lucrative field of animal diagnostic imaging.The animal hospital side of WOOF has the fastest growth, but it is typically a relatively low margin business. The diagnostic testing and device market has much higher operating margins. In fact, these margins hover around 40%, far higher than those of human laboratories such as  , for instance, which run around 15%. But WOOF also has competitors in this space, including  and  .WOOF has a lower profit margin at 7.38%, than Zoetis' 12.46%, reflecting its lower pricing power. But the company also seems more attractively valued, with stats from  showing a lower P/E and P/S of 32 and 2.2, respectively, compared to Zoetis' 41.6 and 5.1.Vet medicine and labs are a traditionally fragmented space, but WOOF is aggressively increasing its size through strategic acquisitions. In April, the company bought  for $21 million, adding to its purchase of MediMedia  and  in previous years.The growing footprint (or should I saw paw-print) has paid off for WOOF, and same-hospital volume is up as well. The company's quarterly same-hospital volume grew every quarter for the past year, with the volume growing almost 2% last quarter. Unlike human health, animal health operates on a cash-and-carry basis, meaning bad debt expense is kept below 1% of sales, much better than the 4-5% historically seen in human hospitals -- and just one more reason to keep a close watch on these stocks. Consistent growth, strong balance sheets, an ever-expanding market -- come to think of it, there's so much to love here, maybe it's even time to take a bite.The Motley Fool's mission is to help the world invest, better.

Normalized organic revenue growth was 11.4% driven by solid growth across the company's business segments.Region-wise, IDEXX experienced a 13.4% year-over-year improvement in the U.S. amounting to revenues of $235.4 million. In the international market, the company's sales declined 3.6% year over year to $147.1 million, on account of 9% normalized organic growth. Normalized CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 11% in international markets, reflecting continued strong gains across major regions.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments, viz. CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the first quarter, the company reported revenues of $324.5 million in CAG, up 8.6% year over year, driven by constant strong gains in instrument consumable and reference lab sales. However, the segment's revenues increased 13% organically, primarily due to a 14% improvement in IDEXX's normalized CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth, a 22% gain in IDEXX VetLab consumables and 12% growth in reference lab and consulting services.The Water segment reported revenues of $21.7 million, up 1.3% from the year-earlier quarter and up 6% organically. Organic growth was primarily driven by higher worldwide volume including strong customer acquisitions in North America. The year-over-year improvement reflected continued new business inroads across major regions.First-quarter LPD revenues grossed $31.3 million, reflecting a decline of 8.6% year over year and organic growth of 3%. Organic revenue growth in this segment was driven by strong global dairy and poultry product volume. However, an expected moderate decline in bovine testing volume partially neutralized this growth.Revenues in the 'Other' segment declined 14.8% year over year to $5 million.Gross profit increased 6.7% to $215.5 million in the first quarter of 2015. Consequently, gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) to 56.4% from the year-ago quarter. According to management, lower production costs benefited the company's gross margin in the reported quarter.Sales and marketing expenses spiked 10.7% to $75.1 million while general and administrative expenses increased 3.7% to $42.6 million. Research and development expenses also scaled up 8.2% year over year to $25 million. Accordingly, operating margin contracted 40 bps to 19% in the reported quarter.IDEXX exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $182.2 million, compared with $322.5 million at year-end 2014. The company also reported total long-term debt of $500 million as of Mar 31, 2015. As of Mar 31, 2015, net operating cash outflow was $14.6 million, compared to net operating cash inflow of $33.5 million.During the quarter under review, the company bought back approximately 859,000 shares for $134 million.IDEXX has revised its fiscal 2015 outlook, reflecting a significant continuity in the strengthening of the US dollar over the last three months.Management now expects revenues of $1.60-$1.62 billion in 2015, to reflect an additional $15 million of currency headwind at current rates. Further, the company has trimmed its earlier provided normalized organic revenue growth guidance by 1.5% to 12-13%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1.65 billion, which lies above the company-provided guidance.The company has also reduced its EPS guidance for 2015. IDEXX now expects adjusted EPS in the band of $4.14-$4.24, down from the earlier guided $4.33-$4.43. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 EPS is pegged at $4.38, which exceeds the projected range.IDEXX delivered disappointing first-quarter 2015 financial results with both its top and bottom line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's reduced guidance also raises caution. However, according to management, global expansion of IDEXX's commercial capability was observed driven by strong instrument placements across the U.S. as well as international markets. This resulted in consistent expansion of its CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues worldwide.Nevertheless, we are impressed that despite facing significant foreign exchange headwinds, the company was able to deliver positive top-line growth on a year-over-year basis coupled with solid growth in instrument placements in both the U.S. and international markets.Currently, IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per the report, the company generated $382 million in revenue for the three-month period, and diluted earnings per share of $0.98. Compared to the same period a year ago, revenues increased by 6% and earnings by 10%.Despite this strong growth, the company actually missed consensus for revenue by $13 million or 3.2%. Earning per share, though, came right in-line with the Street's estimate. : This slight revenue miss probably isn't the main catalyst behind today's fall. By contrast, what's worrying investors appears to be the company's updated 2015 outlook, calling for revenues to come in 6% lower than previously anticipated.Although management still believes revenue can grow organically by 12% to 13% in 2015, the negative impact of a strong dollar on exchange rates is reportedly hurting the company's sales in international markets.So, are investors overreacting to this revised annual guidance? Unfortunately, I don't think so. IDEXX shares have gained over 30% in the past year, and are now trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31 as a result -- far above the sector average.While a strong dollar has hurt nearly every multinational healthcare company of late, IDEXX is particularly susceptible to this issue because of its lofty valuation. Put simply, this company needs every bit of growth it can muster to bridge its substantial valuation gap. And that's why it's probably best to wait for a pullback before jumping into this growth stock.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

The stock was fell 17% today following the earnings report.The culprits in the first quarter were IDEXX's rapid assay products, which test for infectious diseases such as heartworm. Specifically, a couple first-generation rapid assay products face new competition, which dragged year-over-year growth for the segment as a whole down to just 1.3%. Because the tests are so old -- some were launched in the 1990's -- there's little differentiation between products. It's a double whammy for IDEXX because it has lost some customers to the competition, and to retain other customers the company has had to lower prices. Management thinks the situation is going to get worse before it gets better -- if it ever does -- and has adjusted future quarters' guidance to reflect that.Snap 4Dx Plus TestSource: IDEXX Laboratories.Fortunately, newer rapid-assay products, such as the Snap 4Dx Plus Test that tests for six different diseases, are still selling well because the products' benefits are clearer when compared to IDEXX's rivals' products. The affected tests only make up about $50 million of annual sales, which is about 3%, so the competition isn't a major drain on the company.IDEXX's digital imaging systems revenue also grew slower than expected, with the segment that also includes customer information management posting just a 5.7% year-over-year increase. The company said the slower growth was partially due to delayed contracts that will push the revenue into later quarters.The stronger dollar also cut into sales by 5.9%, pushing overall year-over-year revenue growth to just 6.2% in the first quarter. Earnings per share grew faster at 10%, to $0.98, thanks to currency hedges that offset some of the lower revenue.The dollar has actually strengthened further since IDEXX gave 2015 guidance in January. Add in the rapid assay product troubles, and management lowered its EPS guidance to between $4.14 and $4.24, down sharply from previous guidance of between $4.33 and $4.43. While the short-term issues are slowing growth -- the new adjusted EPS guidance is only up 4% to 6% from 2014 -- IDEXX looks healthy over the longer term.The company's bread and butter comes from consumables run on its machines. To secure those sales in the future, IDEXX must sell more instruments, which it is still doing quite nicely. Placements of its Catalyst instruments increased 35% year over year in the quarter, and premium hematology instrument placements increased 13%. The new Catalyst One machine is selling well in Europe, where total instrument placements doubled in the second quarter. IDEXX still has to roll out the machine in many Asia-Pacific countries, including Australia, in the second and third quarters, which should sustain the instrument placement growth.In the reference laboratory where it runs tests for veterinarians, IDEXX is rolling out a couple new tests -- SDMA and fecal antigen. The SDMA test, which can catch kidney disease earlier than existing tests, will be included in the standard panel at no additional charge, which management believes will drive veterinarians to switch to IDEXX. For those who don't want a full panel, there will be some added revenue from orders for the SDMA test individually.

(Symbol: IDXX) saw new options begin trading this week, for the May 15th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IDXX options chain for the new May 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of 15 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $150.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $149.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $162.87/share today.Because the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 78%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of IDXX stock at the current price level of $162.87/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $165.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 2.44% if the stock gets called away at the May 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IDXX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing IDXX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $165.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $165.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

While the company's bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate its top line missed the same. The revenue, however, improved year over year on robust worldwide organic revenue growth in its Companion Animal Group (\"CAG\") segment. The fourth-quarter results were also supported by strong growth in reference lab sales.We are also encouraged by the company's international performance during the fourth quarter. For 2015, IDEXX expects international catalysts placement growth of 20-25% supported by the international launch of Catalyst One as well as premium Hematology placement growth of 10%.Also, continued expansion of global instrument base and high customer adoption rate supports the projection of 15.5-16.5% normalized organic growth in global CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in 2015, and about 5% benefit from U.S. margin capture.The company is committed toward delivering incremental returns to investors, leveraging on its earnings strength. Instrument placements also remain strong. Moreover, bolstered by a strong cash position, the company remains focused on delivering incremental returns to investors, thereby leveraging earnings power.However, the quarter's results were offset by a $25 million reduction in U.S. channel inventory owing to the company's adoption of a fully-direct CAG Diagnostics sales strategy in the country and unfavorable foreign exchange. Furthermore, dependence on third party distributors remains an overhang. Additionally, intense competition and currency fluctuations warrant caution.IDEXX Laboratories, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is witnessing indistinct estimate revisions over the last 60 days.

Earnings also breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15 cents. The year-over-year improvement came on the back of a favorable impact in tax rate including a $6.50 per share benefit from the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit.However, without taking into consideration the one-time items, reported EPS for the fourth quarter came in at 54 cents, down 34% from the prior-year period's equivalent of 82 cents. Full year 2014 adjusted EPS came in at $3.99, up 14.7% year over year, despite a 3% negative impact related to changes in net foreign exchange rates.IDEXX reported revenues of $351.9 million in the fourth quarter, down 1% year over year and way short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $363 million. The quarter's result was affected by $25 million of net impact related to reductions in U.S. channel inventories. Full year 2014, total revenue reached $1.49 billion, up 7.9% year over year.Region-wise, IDEXX experienced a 4.7% year-over-year decline in the U.S. amounting to revenues of $190.7 million. In the international market, the company's sales rose 4.7% year over year to $161.2 million, on account of 12% normalized organic growth. Normalized CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 14% in international markets, reflecting continued strong gains across regions.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments, viz. CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the fourth quarter, the company reported revenues of $287.8 million in CAG, down 1.9% year over year. However, it increased 9% organically, primarily due to an 11.5% improvement in IDEXX' normalized CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth, a 15% gain in IDEXX VetLab consumables and 13% growth in reference lab and consulting services.The Water segment reported revenues of $23.1 million, up 6.5% year over year and up 10% organically. Organic growth was primarily driven by new business gains across the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America. IDEXX expects mid to high single-digit revenue growth for Water in 2015 supported by expanded commercial capability.Fourth-quarter LPD revenues grossed $33.7 million, registering an increase of 3.9% year over year and organic growth of 10%. The better-than-expected results came on the back of stronger global volumes of bovine products as well as solid gains across dairy, swine and poultry diagnostics. The company still expects reduction in BSE and other bovine testing related to the success of eradication programs in Europe. These impacts will be offset by global growth in new products including worldwide growth in dairy pregnancy testing and swine testing in Asia and Eastern Europe.Revenues in the 'Other' segment increased 13.8% year over year to $7.4 million.Gross profit declined 3.4% to $182.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Consequently, gross margin contracted 153 basis points (bps) compared to the year-ago quarter equivalent to reach 51.8%. Sales and marketing expenses spiked 15.8% to $77.2 million while general and administrative expenses increased 18.6% to $45.3 million. Research and development expenses also scaled up 10.5% year over year to $24.9 million.

As of the same date, net operating cash flow was $235.8 million, up 4.1% year over year.During the quarter under review, the company bought back approximately 1.1 million shares for $149 million.IDEXX has adjusted its fiscal 2015 outlook (initiated in Oct 2014 during the third quarter ), reflecting a significant continuity in the strengthening of the US dollar as seen over the last three months.Management now expects 13.5% to 14.5% organic revenue growth in the current fiscal, up from the previous guidance of 13% to 14% normalized organic revenue growth. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues remains at $1.69 billion. Conversely, the company has reduced its EPS guidance for 2015. The company expects adjusted EPS in the band of $4.33-$4.43 for 2015, down from the earlier guided $4.38-$4.48. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 EPS is pegged at $4.43, which coincides with the upper end of the projected range.IDEXX posted a mixed fourth-quarter 2014 registering a bottom-line beat and a top-line miss. Although the quarter witnessed consistent, strong normalized organic revenue growth, this was offset by a $25 million reduction in U.S. channel inventory related to the company's transition to a fully-direct CAG Diagnostics sales strategy in the country and foreign exchange impacts from a stronger U.S. dollar, resulting in a 1% reported revenue decline.However, we are impressed with the record levels of premium instrument placements in the quarter and the continued strength in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in both domestic and international operations.Currently, IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 6.32%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Covidien is likely to beat earnings this season as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is at 2.91%. This is a very meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Covidien carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks #1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 and 5) should never be considered going into the earnings announcement.The combination of Covidien's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and ESP of 2.91% makes us confident of an earnings beat this season.We believe that Covidien's expanding product pipeline, strategic initiatives along with expansion into emerging markets are expected to lead to a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.

It cost Pulizzi around $500 for the exam, various tests and medication.But Pulizzi isn't squawking.\"I'll go without going out to dinner to make sure my pet has the proper health care,\" he told IBD. \"This is my priority. It's like having a child.\"Judging by the performance of high-ratedIdexx Laboratories (  ), Pulizzi has plenty of company. Idexx manufactures and develops diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. Around 80% of its revenue comes from its Companion Animal Group, the division that provides diagnostic products and services to vet practices, says Raymond James analyst Nicholas Jansen.Its Livestock, Poultry and Dairy segment provides diagnostic and health-monitoring products for those markets.The company's vast lineup includes in-clinic diagnostic solutions comprised of both its VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry and hematology analyzers as well as associated proprietary consumable products -- tests and supplies.The chemistry analyzers, which include products such as the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One, are used by vets to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine.Another offering is VetConnect PLUS, a cloud-based technology that lets vets access and analyze patient data from Idexx's diagnostic modalities.Around 40% of its revenue comes from outside the U.S.Idexx delivered good news to investors Wednesday when it pre-announced some results for the fourth quarter, which it reports Jan. 30.The company said it saw record total placements of over 2,000 premium chemistry and hematology analyzers globally in the fourth quarter. In America, it saw a 9% increase vs. a year earlier in placements of Catalyst analyzers and an 18% rise in premium hematology analyzers. It also saw a record in total U.S. premium instrument quarterly placements.International placements of premium analyzers grew 27%.\"Our fourth-quarter results capped a year of excellent progress, reflected in full-year Catalyst placement gains of 29%, including growth of 20% in the U.S. and 40% in international,\" said CEO Jonathan Ayers in a press release.The company also raised its guidance for full-year 2014 organic revenue (excluding the impact from the distribution change on channel inventories related to a transition to an all-direct product distribution model in the U.S. for its Companion Animal Group diagnostics) to a range of 9.5% to 10% from its prior guidance of a 9.5% gain.Wednesday's upbeat report comes in the wake of a move from a hybrid to an all-direct product distribution model in America for Companion Animal Group diagnostic products, all elements of which became fully operational in the fourth quarter. The move was announced last July.Going direct means Idexx has dropped its U.S. distributors, which it used in the past, and is selling the group's diagnostic products directly through its own sales force.Under the direct approach, Idexx takes orders, ships product, invoices and receives payment, and recognizes revenue for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the U.S.That aligns with its direct model for instruments, reference lab service and other Companion Animal Group products, Ayers adds.The change will allow a \"significant expansion in our direct sales coverage and capacity, including an estimated 40% increase in the veterinary diagnostic consultant field sales role and a 60% in customer field call frequency,\" Ayers said.Cutting out the distributors also means Idexx can keep the margin it had been paying them, Jansen says.\"There was some controversy over whether there would be a mixed performance during the transition or if Idexx would lose a little share to competitors,\" he said.Wednesday's announcement allayed some of those concerns: \"The distribution changes appear to be having very little impact on the company's business momentum, which seems to de-risk the primary concern on IDEXX shares,\" wrote Jansen in a research note following the announcement. \"While we acknowledge that (the) currency headwind will only get bigger, given recent exchange rate volatility, we believe underlying fundamentals are strengthening.\"Also on Wednesday, the company reinforced its guidance for 13% to 14% organic revenue growth in 2015. The 2015 outlook \"reflects expectations for organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 10.5% excluding the benefit of margin capture associated with the U.S. all-direct sales and product distribution strategy,\" the company said in a statement.Idexx stock hit a new high Wednesday and closed up 2.9%. It gave back a little over 1% Thursday.The company has been enjoying a nice run. Earnings have grown by double digits in all but one of the past 15 quarters. But analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fourth-quarter earnings to slip 1% to 81 cents a share.\"Reported EPS is not going to be a relevant metric for the fourth quarter as the company is impacted by the transition (to the direct model), which weighs on reported margins,\" said Jansen. \"This normalizes in 1Q, and everything should be back to normal.\"Analysts expect full-year 2014 earnings to rise 10% to $3.82 a share, and a 16% lift in 2015.Jansen says Idexx's primary strength is its innovation, which is fueled by its R&D spending.Its R&D spending represents about 80% of all the industry's diagnostic product R&D, he says.Another strength, he adds, is the fact that Idexx offers a complete solution of diagnostic products and services, which they can bundle.Idexx has a \"razor/razor blade\" model, says Jansen. It not only sells the diagnostic equipment, but it also develops and sells the tests -- or consumables -- that the equipment analyzes.\"Once you placed the system (with a vet or an animal hospital), you have a highly recurring revenue stream,\" said Jansen.The overall landscape for its business has been improving post-Great Recession, says Jansen.\"Now, with unemployment down and consumer confidence (up), that translates into more spending on people's pets,\" said Jansen. \"And diagnostics is a faster growth area within pet spending.\"Idexx is part of IBD's Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group, which is a strong performer, ranking No. 6 of the 197 groups tracked. Idexx gets a 97 score out of a possible 99 in IBD's Composite Rating, a metric that factors in things such as earnings growth and stock gains.The group also includesSteris (  ) andCantel Medical (  ), both of which have a Composite Rating of 98.Intuitive Surgical (  ) is the group's largest firm by market cap and has a Composite Rating of 91.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["aine-based animal health solutions provider  (  ) has unveiled a new kidney test - SDMA - at the North American Veterinary Conference in Orlando, FL from Jan 17-21. The test reflects an attempt to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment procedures of kidney disease in cats and dogs.Per management, the SDMA test is a new renal biomarker that can detect the outset of kidney disease in cats and dogs, months or even years before traditional procedures can spot the same, thereby giving veterinarians more time to prescribe appropriate treatment options.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) refers to a progressive illness which can lead to permanent loss of kidney function over time and can even lead to death. Unfortunately, current diagnostic methods including standard chemical tests mostly fail to identify CKD until 75% of the kidney function has already been damaged.As a result, these traditional tests allow limited treatment options for veterinarians, thus often leading to drastic health deterioration among animals affected by CKD.According to management, third party peer-reviewed studies have validated the fact that this highly cost-effective yet comparatively speedy SDMA test of IDEXX has the ability to identify CKD by the time only 40% kidney function in the animals are lost on an average, and in some cases even earlier.Such early detection helps veterinarians to offer effective treatment in time. Proper medication can ensure better longevity for the affected pet.Management expects to begin trials for this test in North America by the end of the ongoing quarter, and eventually roll out the test as part of the standard chemistry panel in the North American market this summer. A launch in IDEXX's global reference lab network will extend into 2016.Per management, the new SDMA test will not generate any material incremental revenue for IDEXX in 2015. However, IDEXX believes that the test will soon become a standard of care for pets suffering from CKD. This will subsequently raise IDEXX's recurring diagnostic revenues in the upcoming years.Currently, IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked medical instrument stocks include Inogen, Inc. (  ), Synergetics USA, Inc. (  ) and ABIOMED, Inc. (  ).

(Symbol: IDXX) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Iron Mountain Inc (Symbol: IRM), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Idexx Laboratories, Inc. (Symbol: IDXX), the market cap is now $7.97B, versus Iron Mountain Inc (Symbol: IRM) at $7.89B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of IDXX vs. IRM (Note that we have found 3 splits in the  ):Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, IDXX is up about 1%, while IRM is up about 1% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hares of  (  ), one of the leading providers of animal healthcare solutions, climbed 2.2% to eventually close at $159.49 on Friday, following the company's announcement of record instrument placements in the fourth quarter of 2014.Moreover, in this announcement management raised IDEXX's outlook for full year 2014 and 2015, which also positively influenced the share price movement. The company is slated to release its comprehensive financial results for full year 2014 and its 2015 outlook on Jan 30.Per this declaration, IDEXX attained record total placements of its premium chemistry and hematology analyzers in the fourth quarter, which amounted to more than 2000 analyzers across the world. This included installation of 460 Catalysts and 488 premium hematology analyzers in the U.S., reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 9% and 18%, respectively.Notably, IDEXX also experienced year-over-year growth of 27% in the number of premium analyzers placed internationally in the fourth quarter. Moreover, in the U.S., IDEXX ended the year 2014 with record installations of premium instruments.As per IDEXX's management, the company witnessed a year of outstanding progress in 2014, as is evident from the 29% growth observed in full year global Catalyst placements that included growth of 20% in the U.S. and 40% in the overseas.In an attempt to expand its market reach for the Catalyst chemical analyzer, IDEXX plans to launch the novel Catalyst One analyzer in Europe in Jan 2015 and in Latin America and Asia Pacific in the second quarter of 2015.It is worth mentioning that Catalyst One holds the potential to expand the company's point-of-care chemistry market while also extending its customer base in the international markets.Reflecting continued strength in its business, IDEXX raised its guidance for organic revenue growth from 9.5% to 10% for 2014, excluding one-time impacts from U.S. channel inventory reductions associated with the transition to the all-direct CAG diagnostics sales strategy in the US. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.50 billion for 2015.IDEXX also reaffirmed its guidance of 13% to 14% normalized organic revenue growth for 2015. The 2015 outlook reflects expectations for normalized organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 10.5% excluding the benefit of margin capture associated with the US all-direct sales and product distribution strategy.

U.S.-based precision guided therapy tool provider  (  ) recently entered into a definitive merger agreement with the Netherlands-based electronics major Royal Philips (  ), in an effort to create a prominent position in the  for image-guided therapy.Per the deal, Philips will acquire Volcano for $18.00 per share (or a total equity purchase price of $1 billion). The total transaction value will stand at $1.2 billion through a combination of cash on hand and the issuance of debt.Volcano, which has unanimously approved the deal, expects the transaction to be completed in the first quarter of 2015. The acquisition is expected to create a strategic and financial fit that will provide more productive sales operations leading to higher growth and operating leverage. It is also estimated to enhance commercialization opportunities in new, adjacent segments.Overall, the transaction is expected to remain accretive to Philips' earnings per share by 2017. Philips also targets an EBITA margin of around 20% for its image-guided therapy business group by 2017.While image-guided treatments of the heart and blood vessels are gaining popularity by the day, there is an increasing trend to use advanced catheters that can produce ultrasound images of the interior of blood vessels (intravascular ultrasound or IVUS) or perform blood flow measurements (fractional flow reserve or FFR). Accordingly, while Philips has a rich portfolio of interventional imaging equipment, navigation tools, services and a sizeable global customer base, Volcano with its leading position in both IVUS imaging and FFR measurements is expected to augur well with Philips' business in this niche market.Management at Philips expects Volcano's advanced product portfolio to be highly complementary to its live image-guidance solution offerings. The combined entity is expected to accelerate the revenue growth for image-guided therapy business to a high single-digit rate by 2017.Apart from this huge  opportunity for image-guided therapies, the impending acquisition of Volcano will help Philips to gain economies of scale, lowering cost and delivering innovative diagnostics and therapies in the coronary and peripheral markets. Moreover, the combined entity will be able to further globalize the IVUS and FFR product offerings and tread into newer product areas in a better way.Volcano currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This next-generation NovaSure system includes a smaller diameter ablation device along with an advanced interactive touchscreen radiofrequency controller. Hologic expects full market release of the same in Dec 2014 globally.Hologic's NovaSure is a minimally invasive endometrial ablation system designed to treat abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). According to Hologic, unlike other endometrial ablation treatment techniques, this procedure can be personalized as per patient requirement with a scientific endpoint. Moreover, there is no possibility of side-effects and treatment delays as no hormonal pre-treatment is needed. For the past 10 years, the NovaSure ablation profile has proven itself superior to other endometrial ablation modalities.Hologic's management is encouraged by the positive growth achieved at the company's GYN surgical segment over the last two consecutive quarters. This marked a recovery from the negative outcome that had been persisting over several quarters prior to that. The improvement was primarily driven by strong double-digit growth in Hologic's global MyoSure franchise as well as single-digit growth of NovaSure in the international market.Notably, although the company experienced a decline in its domestic NovaSure sales, a gradual slowdown was observed in the decrement. Globally, Hologic's MyoSure system gained strong market adoption with rise in unit sales worldwide.To date, Hologic has performed more than 2 million NovaSure endometrial ablation treatment procedures. This marks an important milestone for Hologic's GYN Surgical segment that is expected to reinforce confidence among investors looking forward to invest in this particular company.Currently, Hologic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Earnings per share of $1.05 were up 25% year over year, also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.3%. Revenues of $383.5 million increased 13.4% and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $372 million.The year-over-year growth on both fronts is indicative of the company's consistent growth via organic means. We are, at the same time, encouraged by the company's global performance during the third quarter. Backed by a strong and consistent Companion Animal Group (CAG) show in the quarter, the company raised its fiscal 2015 revenue outlook.Among its future plans, IDEXX is currently focusing on the Catalyst Dx test to facilitate the global rollout of Catalyst One in 2015. This, in turn, is expected to result in market expansion for the company and garner higher profitability.

In making the transition, its old distributors had to draw down their inventory, which reduced IDEXX's revenue by $25 million. Adding those lost sales back in and adjusting for foreign exchange rate changes, normalized organic revenue growth -- which excludes revenue from acquisitions made in the last year -- increased 9% year over year in the fourth quarter.The move to an in-house sales force not only affected the top line growth, but also added $9.8 million in costs to set up the new system, which obviously had a negative effect on earnings. Adding back in the lost profit on the inventory drawdown and the cost to set up the new sales strategy, IDEXX made $0.95 per share in the fourth quarter, up 16% year over year.It's hard to complain about double-digit earnings growth, even if it requires a little math to get there.Catalyst One AnalyzerSource: IDEXX LaboratoriesThe aforementioned 9% normalized organic revenue growth is especially impressive since the company's new Catalyst One machine is substantially cheaper than the older model. Despite a 19% year-over-year increase in Catalyst machine placements and 23% year-over-year growth in premium hematology instrument placements, fourth quarter sales of instruments declined 9% organically. Lower average prices for certain instruments sold internationally and sales with deferred revenue also contributed to the lower revenue from instrument sales.Sales of consumables that run on all the machines IDEXX has placed in veterinarians' offices over the years more than made up for the decline in sales of the machines, with sales of IDEXX VetLab consumables up 15% year over year during the quarter. A 13% year-over-year growth in revenue from its reference lab and consulting services also helped increase the top-line growth.This year, IDEXX is looking for even better organic revenue growth with guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. About 3.5 percentage points of that growth will come from the difference in the higher prices it'll get for products sold directly to consumers instead of the discounted price that distributors got.Even backing out the increased selling price as a one-time gain, 10% to 11% revenue growth isn't too shabby. Calling on more customers with its expanded sales force should help IDEXX achieve its goal. IDEXX has found that customers that got at least one visit from a sales rep grew 13% faster than those that didn't receive a visit.New tests available for reference lab customers, including one for chronic kidney disease and another fecal test for worms, should help boost reference lab revenue as well.On the bottom line, IDEXX is looking for adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 9% to 11% this year.

For 2015, one estimate moved south over the same time frame, leading to around 5% decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $1.28 per share.Third-quarter earnings of 21 cents a share declined 8.7% year over year, primarily hurt by unfavorable foreign exchange movements during the quarter. Earnings also missed the company's guided range of 24-26 cents as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents.Revenues grew 4% year over year to $58 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $59 million. Strength in the company's Extremity implant business was partly offset by weak Knee implant revenues owing to sluggish knee implant sales in Europe and the U.S.Exactech also slashed its 2014 earnings and revenue guidance. The company now expects annual earnings in the range of $1.14-$1.16 per share, lower than the earlier projection of $1.19-$1.23.

The stock of the animal health-test provider soared to a 52-week and all-time high.Organic revenue in the third quarter increased 13% year over year. If you subtract an increase in distributor inventory, organic revenue  increased 11%.Adjusted earnings per share jumped a whopping 25%. Most of the discrepancy from the year-over-year increase in revenue comes from the company's share buyback. During the quarter, the company repurchased nearly 2.2 million shares, bringing the year-to-date decrease to 7% of shares that were outstanding at the beginning of the year.IDEXX Laboratories saw normalized organic growth of nearly 10% in the U.S., which outpaced the growth of the veterinary industry, where visits increased just 0.8%, and veterinarian revenue grew 4.9%. International sales, which are approaching half of total sales, were even better, with a 14% increase in organic growth.Source: IDEXX Laboratories.Instrument sales were down 5%, but that's only because Idexx is selling more lower-priced analyzers, and the increase in international price-sensitive markets. If you look at the instrument placements, they increased 32% for both IDEXX's Catalyst systems and for its hematology instruments. That's good news for future growth of disposables used in the machines. The company's Catalyst One is set to launch next month, and should further drive instrument placements given its low price and extensive test capabilities.After the strong third quarter, IDEXX now sees its 2014 revenue about 9.5% higher than last year, and earnings per share will grow by 12% to 14%. Both of those numbers add back the expected decreases in revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter as IDEXX Laboratories switches from selling its U.S. products through distributors to selling directly to veterinarians. The drawdown of distributor inventories will cut into sales in the fourth quarter, but it's a one-time cost that should result in long-term gains.Next year, IDEXX Laboratories is looking for even more growth, with organic revenue expected to grow 13% to 14%, including the increase in revenue that distributors used to pocket -- the difference between wholesale price distributors paid and retail prices they sold the products at.The new model will result in additional expenses associated with selling directly to customers, but the switch appears to be a net benefit to IDEXX Laboratories. The company expects $50 million to $55 million in additional revenue associated with the switch, which will result in between $5 million and $8 million of incremental operating profit benefit.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents or 3.8%. The earnings improvement was a result of robust revenue growth coupled with strong cash flows in the business and the company's firm capital structure, as can be observed in the quarter's outcome.However, this positive earnings news failed to impress investors. Consequently, IDEXX Laboratories' share price declined 2.7% yesterday, to eventually close at $129.40 yesterday.IDEXX reported revenues of $390.1 million in the second quarter, increasing 10.6% year over year. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $386 million. The year-over-year improvement was led by solid worldwide growth in Companion Animal Group's recurring diagnostic revenues as well as better-than-expected performance in Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD).Region-wise, IDEXX experienced solid 9.7% year-over-year growth in the U.S and 11.9% growth in the international market.IDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments, viz. Companion Animal Group (CAG); Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the second quarter, the company reported revenues of $326.7 million in CAG, up 10.4% year over year. The segment's top line increased 12% organically primarily due to a 13% growth in IDEXX VetLab consumables and an 11% rise in reference lab services. Furthermore, a 34% year-over-year increase in Catalyst instrument placement to nearly 800 and a 13% improvement in hematology placements also boosted growth in this segment.The Water segment reported revenues of $24.5 million, up 9.4% year over year and up 7% organically. Organic growth was primarily driven by increased sales of E. coli testing products on account of new customer acquisitions, and higher sales volumes in North America and the Asia-Pacific region.Second-quarter LPD revenues grossed $32.7 million, registering an increase of 15.8% year over year and organic growth of 6%. Organic revenue growth in this segment was primarily driven by increased sales in China along with higher number of testing in New Zealand related to Livestock exports. Further, in this segment, IDEXX continued to benefit from the slower-than-expected ramp down in bovine programs in Western EuropeRevenues in the 'Other' segment grew 1.8% year over year to $6.2 million.Gross profit increased 10.5% to $218.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. However, gross margin remained almost flat at 56% compared to the year-ago quarter equivalent. This flat margin was an outcome of gains in price which was offset by the absence of prior-year foreign exchange hedging gains and higher freight and distribution costs.Sales and marketing expenses spiked 17.5% to $68 million while general and administrative expenses increased 7.7% to $41.8 million. Research and development expenses also scaled up 14.7% year over year to $25.4 million. Operating margin contracted roughly 100 basis points to 21.3% in the reported quarter.IDEXX exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $305 million, up from $279.1 million at year-end 2013. For the first half of 2014, net operating cash flow was $115.3 million, up 12.5% year over year. The company also reported total long-term debt of $150 million (net of current portion) as of June 30, 2014.During the quarter under review, the company bought back approximately 975,000 shares at an average price of $129.77 a share.Bolstered by a strong second quarter, IDEXX has revised its fiscal 2014 guidance. Revenues are now expected in the range of $1.51 billion to $1.52 billion, representing annualized growth of 10.0% to 10.5% and 9.0% to 9.5% organically. This marks an improvement from the earlier guided range of organic growth of 8% to 9%. Adjusting for the deferred revenue impacts of Catalyst One introductory offer in 2014, the company expects organic revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 9.0%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 billion for 2014 revenue lies below the company's guidance range.IDEXX has raised the lower end of its EPS guidance for 2014. The company now expects adjusted EPS in the range of $3.79 to $3.86 (previous guidance was $3.76-$3.86). Adjusted EPS growth is projected in the range of 11% to 14%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.86 is pegged at the higher end of the company guided EPS range.Management has also provided a baseline preliminary outlook for 2015 and expects 9% to 10% organic revenue growth in the next year.We are encouraged with IDEXX's solid second-quarter 2014 results which comfortably beat both the top and bottom line estimates. Moreover, the company experienced strong revenue growth in each of its segments and across geographical regions. IDEXX's new sales force structure has delivered an impressive performance in the reported quarter, with increased number of Catalyst placements in both North America and the international market. In addition, management observed robust double digit placement gains in the international market, particularly in Europe and the emerging markets of Asia Pacific.Management expects gains from SNAP Pro launch will propel consistent growth in rapid assay's contribution to recurring diagnostics revenues. In addition, IDEXX is expanding its sales coverage to geographies previously covered only through telephonic sales. To serve this purpose, the company has added 25 more field service representatives to its existing force of 48 and increased insight sales and order taking representatives from 24 to 68. This, in turn, should result in market expansion for the company and garner higher profitability.Currently, IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The decline is attributable to lower revenues in the Instruments and Accessories, and Systems segments.

The increase was attributable to higher commissions associated with higher revenues and costs associated with new product launches.Adjusted operating income dipped 31.4% to $153.9 million while adjusted operating margin declined 840 bps to 30.4% from the prior year quarter.Revenues from  slid nearly 1.0% to $261.9 million in the quarter from $264.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease is attributed to lower instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with lower system unit sales and timing of customer orders, partially offset by higher (roughly 9%) da Vinci procedure volumes. Higher procedure volume was driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and international urologic procedures.Revenues from  plunged 33.4% to $143.7 million compared with $215.9 million in the second quarter of 2013. The drastic fall is attributable to lower system sales in the U.S. and international markets.Intuitive Surgical shipped 96 systems (including 50 units of the recently launched da Vinci Xi system) during the quarter, compared with 143 in the same quarter last year.In the U.S., Intuitive Surgical sold 61 systems in the 2014-second quarter compared with 90 systems in the second quarter of 2013. Outside the U.S., the company has shipped 35 systems in the quarter, compared with 53 in the second quarter of 2013.Revenues from  rose 8.7% to $106.6 million compared with $98.1 million in the second quarter of 2013. The improvement reflected growth in the installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems.Intuitive Surgical had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2,043.3 million as of Jun 30, 2014, down 25.8% from $2,753.9 million as of Dec 31, 2013. Inventories scaled up 12.7% to $202.4 million as of Jun 30, 2014 from $179.6 million as of Dec 31, 2013.During the quarter, Intuitive Surgical repurchased 2.5 million shares under the Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program for $1.0 billion.Previously, Intuitive Surgical estimated procedure growth of 2 to 8% for the full year 2014 over approximately 523,000 procedures performed in 2013. The company now expects higher procedure growth between 5 and 8% for the year.Intuitive Surgical expects operating expenses to continue to ramp in the second half of the year due to international expansion, particularly in Japan and Europe, and new product launches. The company expects operating expenses to grow between 10 and 13% over 2013.Intuitive Surgical continues to be affected by stiff hospital capital spending environment. The company's robotic surgical systems came under fire in the past due to several incidents that raised doubts about the robotic surgical technology.However, Intuitive Surgical is optimistic about its new da Vinci Xi Surgical System, which has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and received the CE Mark in Europe.The company had revealed that the new and improved robotic system has longer instrument shafts enabling greater reach for surgery.

Gross orders rose significantly to $57.5 million from only $1.3 million a year ago while net orders also rose substantially to $57.4 million from just $1.4 million in the prior-year quarter, all driven by booking of a major order for a ProBeam proton therapy system at the National Taiwan University in Taipei.Just before the earnings release, VAR revealed that it has received the 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Calypso soft tissue Beacon transponder.

The figure remained well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 and surpassed the year-ago adjusted EPS number by a formidable 30%. On a reported basis, second-quarter EPS of 69 cents showed a year-over-year decline of 9.2% largely due to higher acquisition-related charges in 2014.Revenues increased 33% year over year to $4.32 billion during the quarter. The increase was owing to 5% organic growth, 27% increase in revenues due to acquisition and 1% due to currency translation.With the acquisition of Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher currently operates in four business segments viz. Life Sciences Solutions Segment, Analytical Instruments Segment, Specialty Diagnostics Segment, and Laboratory Products and Services Segment.The four aforementioned segments recorded second-quarter revenues of $1.10 billion (508% annualized growth), $793 million (up 4.0%), $855 million (up 8%) and $1.70 billion (up 7%), respectively. The stupendous growth in the Life Sciences Solutions Segment was due to the inclusion of the Life Technologies acquisition for the entire quarter.Gross margin of 45.4% during the second quarter was up 154 basis points (bps) year over year. In addition, Thermo Fisher witnessed a 48.1% increase in adjusted operating income to $923.6 million. Adjusted operating margin came in at 21.4%, an expansion of huge 210 bps year over year.The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment of $605.9 million compared with $5.83 billion at the end of 2013. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $991.8 million versus the year-ago figure of $778.4 million.Taking into consideration a solid first-half performance in 2014, increased synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and the impending divestiture of the Cole-Parmer business, Thermo Fisher updated its fiscal 2014 guidance.The company now expects to report adjusted EPS for the year in the range of $6.85 to $6.97 (implying annualized growth of 26% to 29%), an increase from the earlier announced range of $6.80 to $6.95 (25% to 28%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.89 remains within the guidance range.On the other hand, the company narrowed its 2014 revenue expectation to the range of $16.86 to $16.98 billion (annualized growth of 29% to 30% from 2013) from the earlier range of $16.84 to $17.00 billion (same).With a full quarter of operation post the Life Technologies acquisition, Thermo Fisher posted a better-than-expected second-quarter 2014 with adjusted earnings per share ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top-and-bottom-line results also sailed past the year-ago numbers.According to the company, the takeover has led to the emergence of an unrivaled market leader serving research, Specialty Diagnostics and applied markets. As per management at Thermo Fisher, the acquisition supports its three-pronged growth strategy of technological innovation, a unique customer value proposition and expansion in emerging markets.Thermo Fisher expects this acquisition to help expand its commercial infrastructure and global presence. The company is currently working on the growth opportunities in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. Given the huge potential in the region and the high growth rate in China, Thermo Fisher is likely to exceed its goal of garnering 25% revenues from the high-growth Asia-Pacific region and emerging markets by 2016.We take a note that earlier this month Thermo Fisher had inked a definitive agreement with private equity firm GTCR, LLC whereby the latter has agreed to buy the Cole-Parmer channel business of Thermo Fisher for a deal value of $480 million. Thermo Fisher expects the deal, which is likely to be closed in the third quarter, to have immaterial impact on the company's 2014 EPS. This sellout decision is consistent with Thermo Fisher's strategy to focus on its core segment.Thermo Fisher currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

EPS of $1.05 was up 25% year over year, also beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.3%. Revenues of $383.5 million increased 13.4% and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $372 million. The year-over-year improvement was led by robust worldwide organic revenue growth of CAG. Backed by a strong and consistent CAG performance, the company raised its fiscal 2015 revenue outlook. Strategic international expansion is another upside. Based on a strong cash position, the company also remains committed to delivering incremental returns to investors, thereby leveraging earnings power. However, dependence on third party distributors remains an overhang. Further, intense competition and currency fluctuations warrant caution. Thus, we reiterate IDEXX at Neutral.Headquartered in Delaware NJ, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX) is a developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. The company also sells a series of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market.Year 2013 onward, IDEXX operates through the three primary segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which it refers to as the Companion Animal Group water quality products (\"Water\") and diagnostic tests for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food.Companion Animal Group (CAG): This segment provides veterinarians with diagnostic capabilities and information management solutions that enhance the health and well-being of pets. The complementary nature of these products and services provides a unique competitive advantage known as the IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage, providing vets with tools and services necessary to offer advanced veterinary medical care. In addition, through its Customer Information Management and Digital Imaging Systems sub segment, the company provides practice management systems, including hardware, software and services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling (including for boarding and grooming), client communication, billing and inventory management.Water: Through this segment, IDEXX provides innovative testing solutions for easy, rapid and accurate detection and quantification of various microbiological parameters in water, helping to ensure water safety for people around the world.Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD): Within this segment, IDEXX provides diagnostic tests and related instrumentation required to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve bovine reproductive efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food. These products are purchased by government and private laboratories that provide testing services to cattle, swine and poultry veterinarians, producers and processors.In the third quarter of 2013, IDEXX acquired a Brazilian distributor of some of the company's Livestock, Poultry and Dairy products. Through this acquisition, the company acquired the right to distribute the food safety product line which provides microbial monitoring and drug residue tests for bovine, poultry and swine producers, meat exporters and pharmaceutical companies.Other: The company's OPTI Medical operating segment has been combined and presented with the remaining pharmaceutical product line and the out-licensing arrangements in an Other' category, primarily because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.Source: CompanyWant the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Adjusted earnings of 37 cents per share increased 7.9% from the year-ago level and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. The adjusted number also steered ahead of the company's guidance range of 32\u221234 cents.On a reported basis, the company recorded net loss of 6 cents per share, much narrower than a loss of 19 cents per share reported in the prior-year quarter.Revenues were $625.0 million in the quarter up 2.0% year over year (year-ago revenues included $10.6 million from Lifecodes, which the company sold in March 2013). The top line also exceeded both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $610 million and the company's guidance range of $605\u2212$615 million.In the quarter, Hologic's key products, especially 3D mammography and Aptima HPV, gained momentum. In the diagnostics business, the Japanese Red Cross (JRC) selected Hologic's new collaboration partner, Grifols to screen the country's 5.3 million annual blood donations. According to Hologic, this represents a strong win and validation of Hologic's Panther system.Further, in breast health, strong global sales were encouraging during the quarter. The company also received positive news on the reimbursement front. In early March, the AMA CPT Editorial Panel announced that the application for breast tomosynthesis was accepted for three Category I CPT codes for both screening and diagnostic mammograms.Although one quarter's performance does not establish a trend, Hologic continues to believe the near-term growth opportunities will potentially offset the ongoing headwinds.The  (46.5% of total revenue) was down 1.9% year over year on a reported basis and 4.0% year over year on an adjusted basis to $296.5 million in the quarter. The divestiture of the Lifecodes business in March last year accounted primarily for the downside. In addition, interval expansion and globally lower average selling prices (ASP) led to a decline in ThinPrep pap test sales in the U.S. However, this decline was partially offset by decent performance from the molecular product line with majority of revenues coming from Aptima products sales and blood screening revenues. (38.2%) improved 8.5% year over year to $238.7 million. Growth was driven by increasing sales shift to 3D Dimensions systems from 2D Selenia and 2D Dimensions systems; a 9.1% increase in service revenues from the company's increasing installed base of digital mammography systems along with growth in C-View system sales and biopsy device sales growth, specifically the Eviva product line rise in biopsy device sales. However, an overall sales decline of 2D systems as customers continued to shift to 3D, weighed on the growth partially.The  business (11.5%) recorded revenues of $72.0 million, down 2.2% from the comparable prior-year period. The downfall was on account of lower NovaSure system sales, despite growth in MyoSure system.Revenues from  (3.8%) moved up 4.7% year over year to $23.5 million. Increase in revenues from new Horizon bone densitometry system was partially offset by lower sales of bone densitometry systems.Hologic's adjusted gross margin was 61.7% in the reported quarter, up 373 basis points (bps) year over year. The margin expansion was on account of higher-than-expected revenues and a favorable revenue mix from blood screening, domestic 3-D mammography and service.In the reported quarter, adjusted operating expenses amounted to $190.7 million, down 5.8% year over year. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin was 31.2%, up 627 bps year over year.Hologic exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $490.4 million compared with $829.4 million at the end of fiscal 2013. Total long-term debt as on Mar 29, 2014 was $4.27 billion, down 11.0% year over year.The company provided its business outlook for third-quarter fiscal 2014 and updated the full year guidance. For the said quarter, the company expects revenues of $615\u2212$625 million (representing decline of 2% to flat salesyear-over-year) resulting in adjusted earnings of 33\u221234 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and EPS of $621 million and 34 cents respectively, fall within the predicted range.For the full year, the company increased its expectation to report adjusted revenues of $2,460\u2212$2,490 million (from the previous projection of $2425 million to $2475 million), representing a 1\u22122% decline over the last year (against 1\u22123% decline estimated earlier). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,480 million is in line with the revised guidance. The company also upgraded its adjusted EPS guidance to the range of $1.37\u2212$1.40 from the earlier range of $1.34-$1.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 falls in line with the new guidance.Hologic's performance in the fiscal second-quarter surpassed expectations on both earnings and revenue front. Although the company is plagued by challenges like decline in revenues from the core segment and ongoing shift to the 3D tomosynthesis technology, management seems strategically prepared to get over these challenges. The major goal of management is to sustain top- and bottom-line organic growth going ahead. The strategy lies in accelerating the performance of the major growth drivers of the company, i.e. Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical, and establishing a strong foothold globally. The raised fiscal guidance also reinstills our faith in the company.Currently, Hologic carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Fiscal 2014 net sales grossed $233.4 million, up 2.4% from the year-ago period.During the quarter under review, PetMed acquired 107,000 new customers, down from 125,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Roughly 80% of all orders were generated from its website (versus 79% in the prior-year quarter). Average order size increased to $77.00 in the quarter from $75.00 in the year-ago period.Gross margin expanded 24 basis points (bps) year over year to 35.9% due to cost reduction in certain brands. General and administrative expenses declined 5.5% (to $4.9 million) with a 1.8% drop in advertising expenses (to $5.3 million). This led to a 5.2% reduction in operating expenses (without depreciation), which amounted to $10.2 million. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin expanded 31 bps to 15.0%.PetMed exited the fiscal with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $33.8 million compared with $33.6 million at the end of fiscal 2013.PetMed reported an ordinary performance in the fourth quarter with better-than-expected earnings and a revenue miss. Declining new order sales due to an increase in customer acquisition cost remains a grave matter of concern. Although margins improved this quarter, the company expects no improvement in margin trend in the coming year.However, we are encouraged by the company's cost reduction initiatives. Moreover, PetMed is currently trying to implement several strategies to revive its top line. These strategies include focusing on advertising efficiency to improve new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items like generics, while also expanding its product offerings.The company currently offers a wide range of products catering to dogs, cats and horses, and is working on upgrading its existing portfolio.

With this, the robotic surgical systems maker's earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a wide margin of 67 cents.Net earnings ebbed 44.8% to $104.3 million from $188.9 million in the 2013-first quarter. The adjusted figures excluded the impact of deferral of revenues related to a customer trade-out program for their recently purchased da Vinci Si Surgical Systems with the company's recently announced da Vinci Xi Surgical System as well as product liability litigation charges.The fall in earnings is attributable to lower System sales due to lower procedure volumes, changing hospital capital-spending priorities associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the anticipation of a new system affecting the healthcare capital-spending decisions.As projected by the company, revenues in the quarter dipped 24.0% to $464.7 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $512 million. The decline is attributable to the $26 million deferral related to a customer trade-out program as discussed above.

The result also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.On a reported basis, net loss in the third quarter was almost $11 million or 4 cents per share, worse than the net income of $23.6 million or 9 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues were $626.1 million in the quarter, up 33.2% year over year. Despite solid growth, the top line was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $629 million. However, revenues were within the company's guidance range of $625\u2212$630 million. On a proforma basis (including Gen-Probe revenues in the prior-year quarter), revenues were 2% higher year over year.Revenue growth was led by inclusion of Gen-Probe revenues, higher sales of MyoSure and record high placement of 3D Dimensions tomosynthesis systems and higher service revenues on the back of wider installed base of digital mammography systems. However, growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of legacy products, mainly ThinPrep, NovaSure, 2D Selenia and 2D Dimensions mammography systems and discontinuation of Adiana permanent contraception system in fiscal 2012.Subsequent to the Gen-Probe deal, Diagnostics became the largest segment at Hologic (contributing 47.5% in the second quarter). The core segment recorded robust growth of 87.4% year over year to $297.4 million in the reported quarter. The upside was primarily led by the inclusion of the Gen-Probe portfolio, somewhat offset by lower ThinPrep sales and weaker contributions from legacy products.The company's other segments \u2212 Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health \u2212 recorded respective sales of $230 million (up 8.8% year over year), $75.8 million (down 2.4%) and $22.9 million (up 2.2%).The upside at the Breast Health segment was driven by a 7.2% increase in service revenues from the company's increasing installed base of digital mammography systems, along with a 9.7% rise in product revenues. The growth in product revenues was a major positive after lower revenues in the last quarter.Until the second quarter, the decline in mammography product revenues reflected the ongoing mix shift to the latest tomosynthesis systems from the company's 2D Selenia and 2D Dimensions product lines. In the reported quarter, the company witnessed record sales of 3D Dimensions system, driving product revenue growth. Sale of Hologic's offering for breast biopsy - Eviva also improved from the year-ago quarter.The GYN Surgical business recorded decline on account of discontinuation of Adiana system, and slower NovaSure system sales despite higher sales of MyoSure systems. After adjusting for the discontinuation of Adiana, GYN Surgical revenues improved 1% in the quarter. On the other hand, revenues from Skeletal Health increased due to higher sales of densitometry systems and mini C-arm systems.Hologic exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $964.4 million, higher than $566.1 million at the end of fiscal 2012. The company's long-term debt of about $5,004.6 million at the end of the quarter was almost in line with the debt of $5,035.6 million at the end of the prior fiscal.Hologic provided its guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. For the said quarter, the company expects revenues of $615\u2212$620 million (representing annualized growth of 2%\u22124%) resulting in adjusted earnings of 36\u221237 cents per share. The revenue guidance is way below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $653 million whereas, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents tallies with the high end of the company's forecast.Hologic updated its fiscal 2013 revenue guidance. The company expects to report adjusted revenues of $2,505\u2212$2,515 million compared with the earlier outlook of $2,530\u2212$2,550 million. The updated guidance represents 24%\u221225% growth. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,542 million lies outside the guidance range. The company also lowered its adjusted EPS guidance to $1.46\u2212$1.47 against the earlier guidance of $1.54\u2212$1.56. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 lies outside the guidance range.Notwithstanding the EPS result that edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Hologic reported a dull quarter with disappointing outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. In fact, the company's expectations for fourth-quarter top-line reflect revenue decline on a proforma basis. The lower revision of guidance for fiscal 2013 was another downside. As a result, the stock sank 3.69% in after-hours trading on the day of the results.In our opinion, the third-quarter results reflect that Hologic is still plagued by several challenges - primarily lower sales of legacy products, ongoing shift to 3D tomosynthesis technology and tough capital spending environment among others.

The board of directors has authorized a buyback of $779 million in addition to the existing $721 million pending from earlier programs. This brings the total value of the buyback program to $1.5 billion.

As per the terms of the deal, ISRG will buyback $500 million of its common stock from Goldman, most of which will be repurchased within 2 weeks and the rest by Oct 29, 2013.Management plans to fund the program through cash and investments. The company exited the last reported quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of about $3 billion (up 15.1% year over year).The share repurchase program will likely boost Intuitive's earnings. However, we believe serious fundamental issues along with a weak near-term outlook will remain concerns for ISRG.Intuitive reported disappointing second-quarter results with earnings of $3.90 missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.70%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 declined 12% to $15.78 over the last 30 days.Revenues, too, substantially lagged the mark by $17 million. Lower sales of the flagship da Vinci product is the prime matter of concern. Sales of the da Vinci product in the second quarter decreased to 90 in the U.S. from 124 in the year-ago period.The weak performance compelled the company to lower its guidance for 2013. Due to soft capital sales of the da Vinci system, the company lowered its revenue expectation to flat to 7% for 2013. Previously, ISRG had provided its sales growth guidance in the range of 16% to 19% for the year.We believe that the company's products will experience severe headwinds due to the stiff capital spending environment and sluggish benign gynecologic procedures in the U.S. Moreover, a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adds to the woes.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Following the authorization, the test will be commercially available across the U.S. This comes as major positive news after the molecular diagnostic company reported dismal second-quarter results.Cepheid's Xpert MTB/RIF test is designed for use on the company's GeneXpert Systems and can be used for rapid molecular detection of  complex (MTB-complex) DNA. Further, the test can also identify rifampin-resistance associated mutations of the  gene in specimens where MTB-complex DNA is ascertained.This will enable clinicians to recognize multidrug-resistant TB. Patients suffering from multidrug-resistant TB required intensive care and prolonged therapy. Unlike other standard laboratory methods, the test results will be available rapidly, thereby, improving timeliness and standards of patient care. Considering that clinicians will have access to results in about 2 hours, the Xpert MTB/RIF test should improve patient outcomes.According to the company, the Xpert MTB/RIF is the most innovative TB test to reach the market to date. Despite its cutting edge technology, the test can be easily carried out across multiple shifts in laboratories.Despite the steady decline in TB rates in the U.S. compared with early 1900s when the disease was the leading cause of death in the country, brisk and accurate diagnosis of the disease remains a challenge. Last year, 9,951 new incidences of TB were reported in the U.S.Since 1953, the prevalence of TB in the U.S. is at a minimum level. However, the communicability and general symptoms of the disease ensure the need for rapid detection. Furthermore, certain groups and foreign-born individuals are disproportionately affected by the disease in the U.S. The potentially fatal multidrug-resistant TB can also spread during travel. Thus, increasing awareness and brisk detection of the multidrug-resistant TB is vital to eliminate TB in the U.S.The overseas market remains largely underpenetrated. According to World Health Organization estimates, about 8.7 new incidence of TB were reported in 2011 across the globe. As TB still remains a major cause of death in many countries, the potential market for the Xpert MTB/RIF test appears to be highly underpenetrated. The Xpert MTB/RIF test is already available in outside the U.S. and in High Burden Developing Countries (HBDC).Despite the gloomy outlook for 2013, Cepheid's pipeline is encouraging. Strong demand for its innovative tests should support growth going forward.

In our opinion, these headwinds dwarf the company's consistent strong results and avid expectations for fiscal 2014. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).On Jun 5, Cyberonics reported solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2013 results. Fourth-quarter EPS rose 21.1% to 46 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Revenues shot up 19% to $68.3 million, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64 million. Fiscal 2013 adjusted EPS and revenues of $1.74 and $254 million, respectively, also sailed past the year-ago mark, Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the company guidance.In light of the strong growth trend over the last few quarters, impressive overseas growth and solid demand for its VNS Therapy in an underpenetrated epilepsy market, Cyberonics issued an avid outlook for fiscal 2014. While we derive comfort from the advantages of VNS therapy and the strong untapped potential of the epilepsy market, we are wary about competitive pressures from larger players in the neuromodulation space.We are also wary about lower-than-expected contributions from the high focus Japanese market, where Cyberonics continues to witness a sluggish sales market. Moreover, the ongoing margin pressure remains an overhang, as gross margin and operating margin posted downside of 153 basis points (bps) and 130 bps, respectively. To add to Cyberonics' woes, gross margin is expected to decline 200 bps in fiscal 2014, ruling out any near-term improvement.Meanwhile, the stand taken by CMS failed to soothe fears regarding another unsuccessful attempt at gaining national reimbursement coverage for the depression indication. Cyberonics also faces pricing pressure due to overall global macroeconomic uncertainty.While we remain on the sidelines for Cyberonics, other stocks such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are likely to do well.

This will be used for the characteristic examination of potential atypical femur fractures (AFF).The company's SE Femur Exam will be offered on the soon to be commercialized product line of bone densitometers - Horizon DXA platform. The use of this new assessment option should improve clinical outcomes for potential AFF patients with quick and convenient diagnosis.With the approval of SE Femur Exam, Hologic will serve a widely untapped market as AFF has been reported rarely in patients. However, the fracture is reported to cause extreme distress in affected patients. According to a study published in the ANZ Journal of Surgery, patients with AFF are prone to complications followed by deteriorated health and function after the fracture. These patients also brace lengthy in-patient hospitalization.The commercialization of the SE Femur Exam should strengthen Hologic's Skeletal Health franchise. Despite a strong portfolio, the business contributed 4% to revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We believe that lucrative product approvals should bolster revenues from the Skeletal Health segment.Over the past few quarters, Hologic witnessed several challenges in the form of economic uncertainties in Europe, slower sales cycles and increasing pricing pressure.

Adjustments exclude deferred sales related to the TomoTherapy products and services. Reported revenues for the quarter were $77.8 million.Adjusted revenues from products were $33.2 million (down 48%) in the quarter, mainly due to manufacturing and supply-related issues, which also led to a decline in net product orders. Adjusted revenues from services were $44.6 million, (up 16.1% year-over-year), reflecting positive trends from the TomoTherapy business.Accuray shipped 14 and installed 17 new CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems during the quarter, taking the aggregate global installed base to 677 units. The company added new system orders worth $17.9 million in the quarter, leading to a total system backlog of $279.0 million (up 7.9% year over year). However, backlog decreased 5% sequentially, reflecting a marked slowdown mainly due to shipment delays and a lack of sales force execution.Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 36.7% versus 39.6% in the year-ago quarter, due to a change in sales mix. Adjusted product and services gross margins were 50.0% and 26.9%, respectively, in the quarter. Service gross margin more than doubled year over year following the acquisition of TomoTherapy. The company expects service gross margin to improve but it is likely to demonstrate quarterly fluctuations, going forward.On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were $48.1 million compared with $43.8 million a year ago, mainly due to the restructuring activities. On an adjusted basis, selling and marketing along with general and administrative expenses were 40.0% of sales versus 25.5% in the year-ago quarter, driven by new product launches. On an adjusted basis, Research and Development (R&D) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 22.0% from 17.2% in the year-ago period.Accuray exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of roughly $97.4 million, down 35.9% year over year. Long-term debt was $81.6 million in the quarter, up 5.3%.Management cited manufacturing and supply-related issues along with a lack of marketing focus and sales force transitional problems as the reasons behind the disappointing fiscal second-quarter results.In an effort to remediate the shortfall, the company announced a restructuring initiative for its operations. Management will setup a cost structure that will enhance marketing capabilities and overall business processes to boost sales. Accuray will also cut workforce by 13%, mostly in the U.S.Based on these restructuring efforts, Accuray expects to incur a non-recurring charge of $3-$4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Further, the company anticipates adjusted operating expenses to be $38.0 million per quarter through the fourth quarter of 2013.The positive impact from the restructuring will likely begin from the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and the company is hopeful that it will manage to save roughly $40 million of operating expenses in the year compared with fiscal 2012.The Calif.-based company also provided an outlook for fiscal 2013. Revenues, on an adjusted basis, are expected in the range of $320-$330 million. The fiscal 2013 Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues and losses are $324 million and 94 cents per share, respectively.Although management is optimistic regarding adoption of the company's latest technology unveiled at the ASTRO meeting, Accuray needs to aggressively remediate its structural issues for these offerings to fully contribute to total sales. Moreover, Accuray remains susceptible to the weak U.S. and European markets, reimbursement uncertainties and faces stiff challenges from competitive product offerings.Currently, the company carries a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell).

The result was also significantly better than the year-ago net earnings of 96 cents and the company's previously announced guidance of net earnings in the range of 98 cents to $1.02 per share for the reported quarter.Net earnings improved 3.7% year over year to $112.8 million in the third fiscal quarter.In the third quarter, revenues increased 3% year over year to $726.2 million, well short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $753 million. It also missed Varian's expectations of 7% sales growth in the quarter.Order backlog rose 4% year over year to $ 2,752.8 million at the end of the reported quarter. Net orders grew 5.4% year over year to $726.5 million.Revenues from Oncology Systems increased 3% year over year to $561.3 million in the third quarter. Net orders for the core segment rose 4% (up 6% at constant exchange rate or CER) to $582 million, as 8% order growth outside North America (up 12% at CER) was partly offset by a 1% downfall in North American orders.Overseas sales (contributed 57% to net orders for this segment) were primarily driven by a 21% jump (up 22% at CER) in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). The double-digit growth in net orders was attributed to strong demand from high focus Asian countries like China and Japan, where orders rose over 20%. The company also did well in North Africa, Turkey, Poland and UK. However, Varian faced currency headwinds in the Asian market. On the other hand, the decline in North American market was due to a tough capital spending environment due to looming concerns regarding healthcare reforms and reimbursement scenario.Revenues for X-Ray Products segment in the quarter came in at $135.3 million, up 7% year over year. Net orders for the products inched up 2% to $122.7 million. Despite double-digit growth for flat panel business, this segment was adversely affected by the reduction in inventory levels for its X-ray tube by Japanese customers.Revenues from the Other category decreased about 8% from the comparable year-ago quarter to $29.6 million in the reported quarter. Net orders for the category increased almost three-folds to $21.8 million.Gross margin in the quarter was 42.8%, down 80 basis points (bps) year over year. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 2.7% from the year-ago quarter to $102.4 million. Research and development expenditure increased 9.2% year over year to $53.4 million. Operating margin contracted 50 bps at 21.3%.Varian exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $825 million compared with $754.3 million at the end of fiscal 2012. Long-term debt (including current maturities) was nil compared with $6.3 million at the end of fiscal 2012.The company generated operating cash flow of $198 million, a record high for Varian. It repurchased shares worth $95 million during the quarter.Following the third quarter, Varian revised its expectations for fiscal 2013. Moving ahead, the company envisages revenues to grow by about 5% for fiscal 2013 compared with the prior outlook of 8% sales growth.Net earnings for fiscal 2013 was lowered to the band of $4.00-$4.04 per share compared with the earlier guidance of $4.09-$4.14. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.10 lies above the guided range. Per management, the guidance revision reflects the sharp downfall in the yen and uncertainty related to the realization of revenues from the proton therapy project in Maryland.Apart from the upbeat earnings that edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Varian reported an otherwise disappointing quarter. While sales growth lagged the company's expectations and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, it also lowered its outlook for the ongoing fiscal. The revised guidance also trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Margin contraction was also an area of concern. As a result, the stock tanked over 5% in after-hours trading.Varian's Oncology Systems franchise continued to struggle in the North American market on account of uncertainty emanating from health care reform and anticipated changes in reimbursement. Until the overall scenario stabilizes, we prefer to avoid the stock as Varian carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Other medical stocks such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are likely to do well. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ccording to  , these are the largest insider sells during the past week.

Per the deal, effective January 2013, MWI Vet, as a business partner of Abaxis, will be able to store, market and promote the entire veterinary product line of Abaxis in the U.S.We note that Abaxis' veterinary instruments cater to a substantial part of the clinical diagnostic requirements of veterinarians and the research marketplace. As per recent data, one third of the North American veterinarians practice working with Abaxis instruments for routine wellness testing and annual check-ups.We believe that this is a large market with a high potential for growth. An increase in the number of households with pets, enhanced human-animal bonding, aging pet population, more focus on animal health or preventive care, and advancements in pharmaceuticals and diagnostic testing drive increased spending, which in turn is favorable for the company.Abaxis is performing well in its veterinary division with an expanded product line and a growing direct sales force. The company also intends to introduce more rapid assay of products, which would boost the veterinary revenue. In the previous month, the company launched its new Kidney Profile Plus panel for the treatment of critical and chronic renal diseases in animals, especially in canine, feline and equine species.Alongside, Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories' (\"AVRL\") performance in the third full quarter of operations complemented growth of the company's veterinary segment. Abaxis is optimistic about its consistent performance in the veterinary market and expects to maintain this growth momentum in the upcoming quarters.On the other hand, in a highly fragmented animal health products distribution market, MWI Vet is currently focused on preserving long-term customer relationships as well as building new ones. In August 2012, the company revised its distribution relationship with  (  ), per which MWI Vet, as a business partner of IDEXX, will also be able to distribute other competitive diagnostic products.Other than that, MWI Vet's long term distribution agreements include a 13-year contract with Banfield, the largest private veterinary practice in the U.S. The company also maintains a strong relationship with Feeders' Advantage, a buying group comprising several large cattle feeders in the U.S.We believe that despite the veterinary market being highly competitive, strong bonding between vendors like Abaxis and distributors like MWI Vet will enable both the companies to achieve robust growth. The companies believe this new venture to significantly add synergies to their individual businesses. According to Abaxis, the new strategic partnership with MWI Vet will enable it to further penetrate the western U.S. animal health market, where the company has limited distribution. Currently, Abaxis and MWI Vet carry a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term 'Hold' rating). Over the long term, we are Neutral on both the companies.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["e recently reiterated our Neutral recommendation on  (  ) with a target price of $116.00.Economic uncertainty in the U.S. and UK has affected both the companion animal and production animal markets with tightening credit. Moreover, volatile prices of milk, grain, corn and feeder cattle along with changes in weather patterns affect demand in the production animal market. Moreover, we are concerned about the vendor dependency of the company.Business of MWI Vet is fully based on its relationship with vendors. The company's ability to sustain gross profit momentum is largely based on obtaining favorable terms and access to new and existing products from its vendors. As a result, any adverse change in vendor rebates could negatively impact MWI Vet's business.Despite all these adversities, MWI Vet posted yet another strong quarter and provided its outlook for fiscal 2013. The company's fourth quarter 2012 earnings per share (EPS) came in at 99 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents and increasing 23.8% year over year. Revenue in the reported quarter increased 30.9% to $551 million, ahead of the estimate of $537 million.Revenues over the last 12 years have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.9%. Organic revenues, attributable to existing customers, represented approximately 59% of the domestic revenue growth during the reported quarter, while new customers accounted for the rest. Solid double-digit growth in both the companion animal and the production animal markets contributed to a robust 14% year-over-year increase in organic growth in this region.On the other hand, organic revenue growth in UK during the quarter was 21% year over year, the highest in UK since the Centaur acquisition in 2010.As a result of such a positive quarter with respect to organic growth, the company provided an encouraging fiscal 2013 revenue guidance of $2.285-$2.335 billion representing annualized growth of 10.1%\u221212.5%. The company also expects EPS in the range of $4.66-$4.80 with annualized growth of 10.2\u221213.5% in 2013.The company has adopted several key initiatives to boost sales. This includes investment in technology and distribution center infrastructure in the U.S. and UK. Moreover, MWI Vet is emphasizing on new sales regions and plans sales force expansion to increase market penetration. In fiscal 2012, the company added 90 new sales representatives, (50 among them as a result of the acquisition of Micro Beef) and increased the number of its field sales representatives to 316 (from 224 in the year-ago period) in the U.S.Moreover, MWI Vet is looking to preserve the long-term customer relationships as well as build new ones. During the quarter, the company formed a revised distribution relationship with  (  )  a manufacturer of veterinary diagnostic products. Both the companies entered into a non-exclusive distribution agreement, per which MWI Vet, as a business partner of IDEXX, will also be able to distribute other competitive diagnostic products.However, MWI Vet operates in a highly competitive veterinary distribution services market, with players like  (  ) and Lextron Animal Health. Presently, MWI Vet retains a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to report earnings prior to market open on 07/20/2012.

Following the acquisition, the privately-owned Macleod business will be a part of Neogen's animal safety group.Macleod, an animal health company, is the original manufacturer of Uniprim, the popular antibiotic drug for horses. The antibiotic is widely distributed across the U.S. Macleod's exclusive distribution agreement with Bio-Agri Mix has made it possible for Uniprim to be easily available in Canada. The change in ownership will not affect Macleod's current employees as Neogen plans to retain staff and continue to operate from the Fort Collins facility.The acquisition is in line with Neogen's strategy of acquiring allied businesses and developing key alliances. Uniprim will enhance Neogen's portfolio of professional equine products. It also presents a significant commercial opportunity and is expected to garner incremental revenues for animal safety segment. Revenues from the animal safety segment (43.7% of total revenues) increased 5% year over year to $23.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.Neogen has been assiduously expanding its animal safety segment through acquisitions. The company acquired GeneSeek in 2010 to add depth and dynamism to its animal safety segment. In 2012, Neogen acquired Igenity animal genomics business from Merial Limited.Macleod's revenues for the last twelve months were roughly $4 million. Neogen witnessed year-over-year revenue growth of 8.8% to $49.7 million in the most recent quarter. Excluding contributions from the Igenity animal genomics business, the company's revenues edged up 8.1% year over year.Neogen is a provider of food and animal safety products. The company's acquisition strategy, sales and marketing capabilities for specific markets and international operations continue to boost its top-line. However, competition from  (  ) in certain niche areas remains a headwind.Neogen currently has a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ), a manufacturer of point-of-care blood analysis systems for medical and veterinary markets, recently launched its new Kidney Profile Plus panel for the treatment of critical and chronic renal disease in animals, especially in canine, feline and equine species. This VetScan Kidney Profile Plus (KPP) Rotor will be exclusively used on the company's VetScan VS2 Chemistry instrument that performs 25 different tests configured in 10 unique panels.According to Abaxis, enriched with all necessary critical chemistry analytes, this KPP rotor is perfectly fit to diagnose and monitor kidney disease in animals. The company also claims that this product, together with other VetScan point-of-care instruments for hematology and blood gas analysis will make a complete and cost-effective package and add to the huge menu of Abaxis panels for the VetScan Chemistry Instrument.We note that Abaxis' veterinary instruments fulfill a substantial part of the clinical diagnostic requirements of veterinarians and the research marketplace. As per recent data, one third of the North American veterinarians practice working with Abaxis instruments for routine wellness testing and annual check-ups.We believe that this is a large market with an attractive growth profile, as increased spending is driven by the rising number of households with pets, enhanced human-animal bonding, aging pet population, more focus on animal health or preventive care, and advancements in pharmaceuticals and diagnostic testing. Abaxis is performing well in its veterinary division with an expanded product line and a growing direct sales force. The company also intends to introduce more rapid assay of products, which would boost the veterinary revenue.Abaxis remains a strong player in the veterinary market which accounted for 78% of its total revenues in fiscal 2012. Revenues from this segment recorded robust growth of 17% during the last reported quarter. Alongside, Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories' (AVRL) performance in the third full quarter of operations complemented growth of the company's veterinary segment. Abaxis is optimistic about its consistent performance in the veterinary market and expects maintain this growth momentum in the upcoming quarters.However, we remain apprehensive based on Abaxis' dependence on distributors to sell its products and increased legal expenses. Besides, the presence of many big players like  (  ) and  (  ) has made the human and veterinary diagnostic market highly competitive. Currently, Abaxis carries a Zacks #5 Rank (short-term 'Strong Sell' rating).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ), a worldwide distributor of animal health products to veterinarians, has formed a revised distribution relationship with  (  ), a manufacturer of veterinary diagnostic products. Both companies entered into a non-exclusive distribution agreement, per which MWI Vet, as a business partner of IDEXX, will also be able to distribute other competitive diagnostic products.With this modified agreement, MWI Vet will remain a value-added distributor of IDEXX and will be eligible for a reduced discount from the list price at which IDEXX sells its products. Execution of the new terms, which is expected by January 1, 2013, is subject to the review and clearance of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ('FTC'). MWI Vet believes that the modification of IDEXX's terms will aid its future growth, although the financial impact was not disclosed.This issue came into the forefront in 2010 when IDEXX received a request letter and subsequent subpoenas from the FTC regarding investigation of its U.S. distributor strategy. FTC started an investigation to check whether IDEXX violated the FTC Act by engaging in unfair methods of competition. As per the initial agreement with IDEXX, contrary to our original report, MWI Vet was never barred from distributing competing products of IDEXX.The U.S. market for animal health products distribution is highly fragmented with numerous national, regional and local distributors. MWI Vet is currently focused on preserving long-term customer relationships as well as building new ones.Other than the agreement with IDEXX, MWI Vet's long term distribution agreements include a 13-year contract with Banfield, the largest private veterinary practice in the U.S. The company also maintains a strong relationship with Feeders' Advantage, a buying group comprising several large cattle feeders in the U.S.MWI Vet primarily sources the vast majority of its products from several vendors. Although vendors have relationships with multiple distributors, the company has successfully maintained long-term relationships with many of them including the likes of  (  ), Merial and Vedco. We believe that in spite of the veterinary market being highly competitive, strong bonding with both vendors and customers has enabled the company to achieve robust growth.However, the company faces stiff competition from key player like  (  ) among others. Currently, MWI Vet retains a short-term Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).

Given its stretched valuation, we expect a limited upside potential for the stock at present and hence we revert back to Neutral with a target price of $40.00.The veterinary market is a major contributor to the company's top-line growth. Abaxis reported strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 (up 17% year over year) based on strength in this market. Alongside, the company's new full-service laboratory testing facility, Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories (AVRL), is complimenting the growth of the company's veterinary segment. AVRL, in its third full quarter of operations, generated revenue of $860,000 (up 83% sequentially).Moreover, the company witnessed a consistent increase in Piccolo placement. During the reported quarter, total revenue from the medical market increased 18% year over supported by 48% increase in Piccolo placement. The company is also working on getting large-scale business for Piccolo. With various core marketing programs being undertaken, Abaxis expects placement rates to increase further.We also note that the company is taking initiatives to expand in the international medical market. The recent contract with a leading international biotechnology company to deliver 300 Piccolo Xpress instruments is a big step in this regard.However, we remain apprehensive about Abaxis' dependence on distributors. Abaxis has had issues with its international distributors in the past, which made it difficult to establish a steady distribution network overseas. Thus, the failure to successfully develop and maintain relationships with these distributors could adversely affect the company's business.We are also concerned about the bottom-line pressure faced by Abaxis. In the reported quarter, the company incurred legal expense of $850,000primarily related to a patent infringement case against  (  ) with respect to Cepheid's Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(\"MRSA\") product, on which Cepheid has ceased paying license royalties. The situation could further deteriorate for Abaxis if these issues are not resolved in the near future.Notably, in 2005, Abaxis and Cepheid entered into a royalty license agreement for certain patents related to lyophilization technology under which Cepheid introduced a manufacturing process outside the scope of Abaxis patents.Besides, the presence of many big players like  (  ) and  (  ) that have greater resources has made the human and veterinary diagnostic market highly competitive.Last week Alere reported its second quarter 2012 adjusted EPS of 42 cents, trailing the corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents. Net revenues came in at $700.5 million in the reported quarter, up 23.5% year over year, easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $654 million. Idexx Laboratories announced its second quarter 2012 results on July 20, 2012. The company reported a 10% year over year increase in EPS to 91 cents on revenues of $335.6 million (up 6% year over year).Abaxis on the other handreported an EPS of just 13 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents or 23.5% (although the 30% increase from last year was encouraging).Revenues during the quarter increased 17% year over year to $42.0 million, and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40 million. The growth was based on higher sales in both North America (up 12% to $33.2 million) and in the international market (up 41% to $8.8 million).The company has not provided any outlook for the upcoming period. However, the Zacks Consensus revenue and EPS estimates for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 remain at $45 million and 19 cents, respectively.Abaxis currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ), a worldwide distributor of animal health products to veterinarians, has formed a revised distribution relationship with  ,  (  ), a manufacturer of veterinary diagnostic products.

The year-over-year growth was fueled by higher sales in both North America (up 6% to $31.8 million) and in the international market (up 2.8% to $6.0 million). Total consumable sales climbed 9% year over year to $2.3 million, while instrumental sales decreased by an aggregate of $210,000 or 2% year over year.Veterinary market revenues witnessed an upside of 8% in the reported quarter to $28.5 million. Abaxis is executing well in its veterinary division with an expanded product line and a growing direct sales force. We expect the company's VetScan VS2 blood chemistry analyzer to continue to capture market share in the veterinary market. Additionally, its i-STAT product line should assist Abaxis to drive new VetScan VS2 sales as well.Alongside, the company's new full-service laboratory testing facility, Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories (AVRL) is expected to compliment the company's veterinary sector's growth going ahead. AVRL currently completed its first 90 days of nationwide operations. In this period, it received over 5,000 requisitions averaging over 100 per day. Abaxis is optimistic regarding its consistent performance in the veterinary market and expects to maintain this growth momentum in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, the company witnessed a consistent increase in Piccolo placement. During the reported quarter, total revenue from the medical market remained flat year over year at $8.1 million, as uncertainty regarding the future direction of healthcare continued to depress the market for capital equipment within the physician office. Notwithstanding this the US medical team sold 133 Piccolos (excluding the government) in the reported quarter, up 14% year over year and recorded a 46% increase sequentially.This was primarily due to an increase in the sales volume of Piccolo chemistry analyzers to a distributor resulting from higher sales to end users. The company is also on the lookout for a large potential customer, interested in Piccolo for its in-store clinics. With various core-marketing programs being undertaken, Abaxis expects placement rates to increase further.However, higher expenses remain the primary challenge for Abaxis. As a result, gross margin was down by roughly 106 basis points (bps), primarily due to higher manufacturing costs of Piccolo chemistry analyzers and higher costs of VetScan chemistry analyzers and hematology instruments. Gross margin was also negatively affected by the launch of AVRL and the loss of $317,000 in royalty income along with continued strong sales growth of lower margin OEM products.We also remain apprehensive based on Abaxis' dependency on distributors to sell its products and its increased legal expenses.

Moreover, volatile commodity prices of milk, grain, corn and feeder cattle and changes in weather patterns affect demand in the production animal market. Moreover, we are also concerned about the vendor dependency of the company.Business of MWI Vet is fully based on its relationship with vendors. The company's ability to sustain gross profit momentum is largely based on obtaining favorable terms and access to new and existing products from its vendors. As a result, any adverse change in vendor rebates could negatively impact MWI Vet's business.Despite all these adversities, MWI Vet posted yet another strong quarter and augmented its outlook for fiscal 2012. The company's third quarter 2012 earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.15, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 and increasing 26.4% year over year. The company reported a robust 35% increase in revenues to $554.7 million and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $514 million.The company also raised its revenue and EPS guidance to $2.05-$2.07 billion (earlier guidance was $2.0-$2.03 billion) and $4.14-$4.20 ($3.96-$4.06) respectively. This represented annualized sales growth of 31\u221232% (earlier expectation was 28\u221229%) on EPS growth of 22\u221224% (16\u221219%).Revenues over the last 11 years have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21%. Organic revenues, attributable to existing customers, represented approximately 68% of the domestic revenue growth during the reported quarter, while new customers accounted for the rest. Solid double-digit growth in both the companion animal and the production animal markets contributed to a robust 19% year-over-year increase in organic growth in this region.The company has adopted several key initiatives to boost sales. This includes investment in technology and distribution center infrastructure in the U.S. and U.K. The company is to set up new distribution centers soon. Moreover, during the quarter, MWI Vet started emphasizing on five new sales regions. It plans to expand sales force to increase market penetration by gaining new customers.At the end of June 2012, the company increased its field sales representatives to 308 (from 224 in the year-ago period) with 170 telesales representatives (unchanged) in the U.S. In addition, MWI Vet has been trying to focus on value-added services, including the e-commerce platform, pharmacy fulfillment programs for both production and companion animal products. We believe that these key strategies hold immense potential for the company's future growth.Moreover, MWI Vet is looking to preserve long-term customer relationships as well as build new ones.

Both companies entered into a non-exclusive distribution agreement, per which MWI Vet, as a business partner of IDEXX, will also be able to distribute other competitive diagnostic products.MWI Vet expects to continue the growth momentum on the back of suitable acquisitions, sales force expansion, improvement in operating expense structure and investment in personnel, technology and distribution centers.
