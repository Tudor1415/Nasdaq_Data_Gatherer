James recently called on cable and satellite companies to slash their customers' bills to reflect the fact that COVID-19 has eliminated virtually all live TV sporting events. James has a point, because there's a fair bit of money involved here: As tech industry competitors have played pied piper to fans of movies and TV shows, the legacy pay-TV (cable and satellite) business has become . Sports account for a huge chunk of the typical customer's pay-TV bill, and right now that money is being paid by subscribers in return for almost nothing at all.But this is a complicated issue. Will there be refunds? If so, how will they work? This is about more than just sports leagues and fans -- it's also about pay-TV companies like  ,  , and  , as well as sports networks like 's  ESPN, Comcast's NBC Sports Network, and 's   FS1, as well as regional networks owned by these companies and others.Image source: Getty Images.Pay-TV services lose content from time to time for various reasons. Events get canceled, shows go off the air, and carriage disputes can lead to whole networks going dark. What makes the current situation such a big deal are two things: First, the scale of this crisis means that virtually all major sporting events are being lost at once (sports fans got a live NFL draft broadcast, but they're missing MLB, NBA, and NHL games). Second, sports broadcast rights are really, really expensive.Subscription video on demand (SVOD) services like Netflix and its entertainment- and  peers are the most popular sort of streaming service in the cord-cutting era, and such services don't have live sports (or live anything, for that matter). What's more, sports fans tend to watch sporting events live, which means that sports are fairly \"DVR-proof\" and very appealing to advertisers. As a result, sports have become critical to pay-TV networks.\u00a0As of 2017, ESPN was getting around $7 out of a typical customer's cable bill (and that was just the one network -- ESPN 2 and the rest of the gang accounted for another couple of bucks).ESPN's rates went up from their 2011 levels to meet that 2017 measurement, and the rising prices reflect the growing importance of sports to the networks. But while high prices are certainly good for ESPN, the value of sports also means that networks like ESPN and FS1 are turning around and paying sports leagues big bucks for the broadcast rights that help drive their own high prices. Those broadcast rights are pricey and getting pricier. League TV deals \u00a0(one deal, between MLB and Fox, is already done and matches the predicted trend). And this is happening despite the fact that the leagues in question are currently not playing any games.This is the part of the equation where at least a little wiggle room can be found. Networks are not expecting full refunds, and they'll be paying sports organizations whether or not the games take place. But they likely won't pay the full amount. For example, the cancellation of March Madness led to some complicated financial fallout and made the fine print of   and Turner Sports' huge contract with the NCAA newly relevant (Turner Sports is owned by AT&T's WarnerMedia). Even putting aside any potential changes in the contract that the parties may yet agree to, the contract as written reportedly includes some details that would save CBS and Turner Sports at least a little. Still, the companies appear to be on the hook for the bulk of the roughly $800 million that the contract costs each year.So the leagues get paid by the networks, whether there are sports or not. The networks get paid by the pay-TV companies. And the pay-TV companies tend to pass on this expense to their subscribers. The average ESPN price of around $7 per month reflects a portion of a bill that the pay-TV company's end user is paying. And getting bundles without sports is typically tough for subscribers to do -- the non-sports fans among cable and satellite customers are helping to subsidize the things the sports fans watch.Now that sports are all but off the air, it's not just non-sports fans who are wondering why sports channels are so darn pricey.James' call for pay-TV providers to reimburse customers makes some sense. Pay-TV customers are paying top dollar for sports content that they simply aren't receiving. But we're a few steps away from any refunds to end users. The very pay-TV providers that James is calling upon for refunds are, as of this writing, not enjoying any unusual income from the sports situation. They're still charging the usual prices, but they're saving relatively little on affiliate fees.If cable and satellite companies offer rebates to customers without getting rebates from sports networks, they will of course lose money. On the other hand, if cable and satellite companies facilitate a chain reaction of refunds from sports networks to customers, they'll make customers happy at sports networks' expense. It's easy to see why Altice USA CEO Dexter Goei would say that he and Altice are \"in complete agreement with the New York AG.\" (Goel made the comments on .) Saying that Altice is in discussions with sports networks regarding possible rebates on affiliate fees, Goei expressed optimism that some sort of rebate would be coming down the pike.\u00a0 executive Erin McPherson has echoed that sentiment. \"We don't want to charge our customers for content they aren't watching and receiving,\" .But what about the sports networks? Like the pay-TV providers, they aren't necessarily pocketing much extra money thanks to this crisis. While some things may have changed (incentive-based payments, for example, would be unreachable without broadcasts), the sports networks are still paying the leagues for broadcast rights to sporting events that don't exist. So the sports networks, too, have to seek relief in order to give it. Comcast -- which is both a pay-TV provider and the owner of NBC Sports, which has sports broadcast contracts with (among other entities) the NHL -- is reportedly working on deals to get relief on its very real payments for non-existent sports. Other networks are, too.But these discussions will presumably hinge not only on what the leagues are able or willing to offer, but also on when, if, and how the sports leagues will return. If sports are back soon, this problem will shrink fast. If months and months more are lost, then the problem -- and the negotiations -- will only grow stickier.Altice's Goei, along with others, is confident that Altice will be able to hammer out a deal that delivers some amount of relief to customers. But consumers shouldn't hold their breath for a big bailout. There are a few degrees of separation between end users and the leagues that were supposed to be providing these live TV sporting events. And the leagues have financial concerns of their own -- TV money goes to players and other employees, after all. (Some reports suggest that the financial situations of teams and leagues as pretty dire, but some experts are quick to point out that team owners have a long-standing history of painting misleading pictures of their finances in the context of labor disputes and government subsidies -- both of which are in play during this crisis.) The complex situation seems likely to result in some kind of rebate to customers, but it would be pretty surprising if the process somehow led to a refund or rebate worth anything near the amount that legacy pay-TV customers pay each month for sports content.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Consider that competitor 's advertising revenue only increased 2% in its most recent quarter, even after accounting for the impact from lost sporting events. By contrast, Fox saw incredible growth.There are two big reasons for Fox's strong quarter. First, Fox News was already incredibly popular among viewers. But in Q3, its viewership among adults age 25 to 54 nearly doubled. That's a desirable target demographic, and advertisers spent their money on Fox, where the eyeballs were.\u00a0Second, 40% of Fox's ad revenue comes from live sports. Companies like ViacomCBS were hurt because sporting events were canceled. But the bulk of Fox's sports revenue comes from the NFL and college football, two sports that haven't started yet.

To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FOXA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $28.21/share today.\n\nBecause the $26.50 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.19% return on the cash commitment, or 1.38% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fox Corp, and highlighting in green where the $26.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $28.50 strike price has a current bid of 15 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FOXA stock at the current price level of $28.21/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $28.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 1.56% if the stock gets called away at the July 31st expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FOXA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fox Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FOXA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $28.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $28.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.53% boost of extra return to the investor, or 3.88% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 143%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 121%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $28.21) to be 44%.

It appears that in the 30% broad market rally from March lows, investors are still looking for undervalued stock ideas.Shares finished 4% higher on the day, and have now recovered 41% from lows hit last month.Image source: Getty Images.Fox Corporation generates revenue through advertising and affiliate fees across its cable programs and television networks.\u00a0The problem is that Fox's audience is increasingly cutting the cord, opting for on-demand streaming video instead. It still has valuable content, like live sports, but some of that content is in question because of COVID-19. That may make it hard to attract advertisers, a near-term risk that Maral acknowledges.However, Maral likes Fox's strong balance sheet and free-cash-flow generation. Given what he sees, he slapped the stock with an outperform rating and gave it a price target of $31 per share. At the time, Fox traded around $26, implying 19% upside. That would imply that Fox is a  at these prices.Regarding the balance sheet, Fox is in a better position than some. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, it had around $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, and around $8 billion in noncurrent liabilities. Subsequent to Q2, the company made moves such as acquiring streaming platform Tubi and offering $600 million in senior notes, meaning these numbers are slightly different now. I'm not sure I'd necessarily call the balance sheet \"strong,\" but Fox is certainly very liquid in this time of economic uncertainty.Additionally, Fox is a profitable business. While Maral likes free cash flow, I prefer to look at net earnings by generally accepted accounting principles (). Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2020, Fox has earned $827 million. Some of that was from investment gains, but even subtracting those one-time items, it was profitable. Those earnings mean Fox trades below 10 times trailing earnings, which does indeed look cheap.In the end, one analyst opinion doesn't make or break a long-term investing thesis. Investors need to assess Fox's plan to stay relevant as consumer demand shifts toward streaming (the Tubi acquisition is relevant).

Why not work together?Give the news a closer, second look though, and one may start to wonder exactly why -- or even how -- a credit reporting bureau is working with a media giant, providing sensitive information that should arguably be kept confidential. Besides, how would TransUnion even know about your viewing or shopping preferences?There's the rub. This is a partnership that should gnaw at consumers. It should also concern regulators and lawmakers. Even media names may want to think twice before plugging into the same idea. Fortunately, it's not a prospective moral hazard that rival television name   even has to consider. It's already figured out how to gather and utilize consumer data for its TV platforms.Image source: Getty Images.The press release was posted in mid-April, though likely lost in a sea of coronavirus-related headlines. The two companies co-announced:The partnership enables Tubi to deliver curated content and viewer experiences by establishing a more enriched view of individuals and households. This unique picture of the connected consumer is created by combining Tubi's deep understanding of content viewing behaviors with TransUnion's robust data assets, rooted in their cross-verified consumer database. As a result, advertisers can more seamlessly bridge the gap between individual and household, and deliver a more personalized ad experience alongside the content.Translation: If you're watching Tubi video content, TransUnion is telling Fox other details about your life, including information about your family.It's only half as alarming as it may seem to be on the surface. Advertisers can already make some pretty reasonable assumptions about you just based on the programs you're watching, and you can bet that streaming platforms like  are  to your Amazon.com purchase history. Your internet service provider pretty much knows every website you visit too. But, all of those are more or less expected. Consumers have given up on even trying to remain entirely anonymous.Bringing a credit bureau into the mix, however, is a new and uncomfortable spin on an old idea. What information is stored in a \"cross-verified consumer database?\" Incomes? Credit scores? Job history? Social security numbers? Perhaps more important, what measures are being taken to ensure security of personal information when it's being passed to and from Fox?While Comcast has always worked to give its advertisers the best and most meaningful data possible, it's stepped up the development of its capabilities of late to create a unified offering called  that allows advertisers to most effectively purchase air time.As the name suggests, the One Platform \"gives marketers the power to reach all audiences everywhere they are across the full NBCUniversal ecosystem, and enables every impression to be data-informed.\"That \"data-informed\" detail is the key. While Comcast doesn't say exactly what its NBCUniversal unit knows about viewers, presumably it's information decidedly useful to advertisers. One Platform is a data gathering and measurement tool as well, however, with the February revelation of the platform explaining \"NBCUniversal will be expanding CFlight cross-platform impression measurement to include OTT co-viewing, out-of-home measurement (OOH) as well as short-form video.\"OTT means over-the-top television, and in this instance primarily refers to the company's upcoming streaming service called Peacock slated for full commercial launch in July. That's an important detail too. One Platform lets advertisers run campaigns that utilize all of NBCUniversal's  vehicles, and measure the collective response.Perhaps most important of all, Comcast didn't have to tap a credit bureau to give its advertisers valuable information about its customers. Comcast already has enough of what it needs, and it doesn't need to take a chance on a partnership that's questionable at best and risky at worst.Curiously, privacy hawks haven't made much of a fuss about TransUnion's agreement with Fox's Tubi, although it's possible they've also been hampered by fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak. It's also possible that neither Tubi nor Fox are high enough in profile to draw the attention of potential critics.This is still no small matter though. Should the partnership find its way into the spotlight -- or worse, somehow cause a data breach -- don't be surprised to see public pushback. Not wanting to cause any more ire, Comcast is well-positioned to win any displaced advertising dollars.  are kind of funny about doing business with companies that fail to protect their personal data.In a much broader sense, however, the TransUnion/Tubi agreement underscores just how important consumer data will be as we move into the streaming era. It also illustrates just how difficult it is to gather and analyze that data. In this regard, there's nothing else out there quite like One Platform.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As part of the agreement, Amazon will also receive the exclusive rights to broadcast one game per season, starting with a Saturday night game in the second half of the 2020 season.That broadcast could be pivotal in the NFL's decisions regarding its upcoming contract renewals with  ,  , 's  NBC, and 's  ESPN. It could also determine how the NFL handles distribution of its all-inclusive Sunday Ticket package, which currently belongs to 's  DIRECTV.A successful NFL broadcast from Amazon could open the door for the retail giant or other tech companies to win exclusive sports rights to the world's biggest sports leagues. Amazon has been moving closer to that goal for years.Image source: Getty Images.The NFL's contracts with broadcasters are set to expire in the next couple years. ESPN's contract for Monday Night Football expires after the 2021 season, and the deals with Fox, CBS, and NBC all expire the season after that. DIRECTV's deal for Sunday Ticket expires after 2022 as well.The contracts combine to generate the NFL about $6.5 billion in revenue per year. That makes Amazon's $65 million per year that it pays to rebroadcast 11 games seem like a drop in the bucket. (However, the new deal ups the price an undisclosed amount.)Amazon has some very deep pockets, though. It ended 2019 with over $36 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Its free cash flow for the year topped $25 billion. The other  companies interested in sports rights also have strong balance sheets and cash flows. If the NFL opens the door to exclusive rights for those bidders, they might be able to steal them away from broadcasters.Amazon has found it profitable to pay $65 million for the simulcast rights to Thursday Night Football for the last two years, and it's paying even more for the next three seasons. It's invested heavily in its broadcasts beyond obtaining the rights as well, hiring its own announcer team, offering fans additional insights and statistics, and promoting the games through various channels outside of its own platforms.\u00a0There are two parts of the equation for Amazon. The first part is straightforward: It generates ad revenue from broadcasting the games. For its Thursday Night simulcasts it gets about two minutes of commercial time per hour -- the same as local affiliate networks broadcasting the games from CBS or Fox. It's reasonable to assume Amazon will control nearly all of the ad inventory during its exclusive broadcast.The other part of the equation is how many Prime members Amazon signs up. While Amazon also offers the broadcast through Twitch without a subscription, most consumers are more familiar with Prime. Still, though it's unlikely the games convince consumers to sign up in the first place -- you can just watch the game on your TV for free -- it could be a deciding factor in keeping the subscription due to its convenience.Fox, CBS, Disney, and NBC aren't going to give up their NFL contracts very easily. Even as the price is likely to climb yet again with this round of renewals, the NFL is one of the most valuable pieces of content for any media company.\u00a0Live sports accounted for 89 of the 100 most-watched broadcasts in 2018, with NFL games accounting for 61 of those broadcasts, according to . That makes NFL games particularly attractive to advertisers looking to reach a broad audience. Moreover, it makes networks like ESPN or even the broadcast networks NBC, CBS, and Fox that much more important to the cable bundle, increasing the affiliate fees they can charge distributors.DIRECTV may change its tune on the Sunday Ticket package. Its original negotiations with the NFL took place when it was still an independent company. Even then, the Sunday Ticket contract was likely a loss leader to get consumers to sign up for expensive pay-TV service. But now, DIRECTV's subscriber base is much smaller, and AT&T is shifting its focus to AT&T TV. It may be willing to pass on Sunday Ticket, and it could fall into the hands of a  instead.But in the end, the biggest winner of a successful exclusive Amazon broadcast this season may be the NFL, as it could gain significant leverage in its negotiations with broadcasters by inviting more rights bidders to the party.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

That compares with Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 99 cents in adjusted EPS, which had dropped from $1.40 as recently as February. Revenue came in at $6.7 billion, a hair above analysts\u2019 consensus.\n                    https://asset.barrons.com/dynamic-insets/charts/cdc_07138541d6197671bf29ebb2.json\n                Canceled sports events, including the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, hit the company\u2019s advertising revenues in the first quarter, which fell 19% from the same quarter last year. Businesses looking to save cash during the coronavirus crisis have also been pulling back on their advertising spending, ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish said on the  Thursday morning. For many companies, it isn\u2019t worth buying ads for stores, restaurants, or dealerships that are closed due to stay-at-home orders. Bakish warned that would continue in 2020, but that political advertising would increase as the November election approaches. It was also a difficult year-over-year comparison for ViacomCBS, as the year-ago quarter included advertising revenues from CBS\u2019 broadcast of Super Bowl LIII, which moved to Fox (FOXA) this year. Excluding the Super Bowl and March Madness events, ViacomCBS says its advertising sales rose 2% from a year earlier.\u201cViacomCBS is leveraged to bundled basic cable networks, and has significant exposure to advertising,\u201d wrote Cowen analyst Doug Creutz on Thursday. \u201cViacom has incremental exposure through its Paramount film and TV studio, but we see the impacts there as being relatively minor compared to our expectation for significant pressure on advertising revenue.\u201dCreutz rates ViacomCBS shares the equivalent of Hold, with a $17 price target.ViacomCBS\u2019 affiliate fee revenue\u2014which distributors like cable or satellite companies pay to include channels in their bundles\u2014ticked up 1% from a year ago. That was driven by a 20% jump in revenue from the company\u2019s TV Entertainment segment, which includes the CBS broadcast channels. Affiliate fees at ViacomCBS\u2019 Cable Networks unit\u2014the former Viacom channels like MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central\u2014fell 6% as more TV subscribers cut the cord. In a weak economy with high unemployment later this year, ViacomCBS may see those cancellations increase.ViacomCBS also said on Thursday that it had signed a new deal with Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) YouTube TV live-TV streaming service to eventually include 14 additional ViacomCBS cable networks in the bundle. In the lead-up to the merger last year, Bakish emphasized the combined company\u2019s ability to leverage its larger portfolio to get distributors to carry more of their channels and pay higher fees.BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, VH1, and other former Viacom channels will join CBS and CBS Sports on YouTube TV starting this summer. It remains to be seen whether customers will be happy to accept more channels and a higher monthly subscription fee that YouTube passes along to them.\u201cThis sets YouTubeTV up with a justification for their next price increase, whenever it comes, which it still needs if it ever wants to be profitable,\u201d wrote Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger on Thursday. \u201cThis brings ViacomCBS closer to an equivalent distribution footprint as its peers, although it is still less represented on or absent from some important services.\u2026 We certainly expect this unexpected news to reset the stock at a new, higher level, but from there it still faces the same fierce structural headwinds on viewership and subscribers as everybody else.\u201dGrowing market share and revenue from linear TV bundles is a near-term positive for ViacomCBS, but the long-term cord-cutting trend isn\u2019t going away. Juenger rates the stock at the equivalent of Sell, with a $10 price target.ViacomCBS\u2019 streaming segment did get a boost from viewers being stuck at home. Revenues jumped 51% from a year ago, to $471 million. Subscribers to its paid offerings, which include CBS All Access and Showtime, reached 13.5 million, while the ad-supported Pluto TV hit 24 million monthly active users. Both were up at least 50% year over year.Paramount Pictures film studio had a solid first quarter, driven by a 18% increase in licensing revenues. Sonic the Hedgehog, which was the main theatrical release in the first quarter, brought in $307 million at the box office. The film studio also produces content for third parties like Netflix (NFLX). Paramount had planned to release a romantic comedy called The Lovebird in April, but sold it to Netflix instead due to theater closings during the coronavirus outbreak.ViacomCBS won\u2019t release any movies in the second quarter and has pushed planned debuts to later this year.

Those are the company's (respectively) cable TV equivalent, a combination of live and on-demand television that costs $55 per month, and a skinny cable bundle that sells for $15 per month. The basic version of AT&T TV Now no longer includes HBO, but for an extra $10 per month, customers can add it on.There's an  in the works too. No word yet on how it will be priced, though it could be free and/or bundled with AT&T TV.Oh yeah -- AT&T Unlimited Elite wireless users get free access to HBO, which again, presumably qualifies them for free HBO Max.That was an admittedly tedious (and somewhat exhausting) exercise. But, that's the point. AT&T may be confusing  with its \"throw spaghetti on the wall and see what sticks\" approach to streaming. It's hardly the only prospective misstep AT&T is taking with its television business, however. Pricing itself may also be problematic.The free access to AT&T Watch TV or any one of HBO's derivatives isn't actually free. Someone, somehow is paying for it. The company likely offered Charter wholesale-like pricing, and AT&T Unlimited Elite wireless customers are paying $50 per month for access to wireless and video services that cost money to support. The company may well reach its goal of , but that doesn't necessarily translate into 50 million subscribers' worth of additional revenue.Perhaps worse, when the word \"free\" becomes part of the equation, it can cheapen the perceived value of the service to those who might otherwise be willing to pay a premium.To that end, the price of HBO Max itself is another potential tripwire. One streaming service has to be the most expensive one, but AT&T is launching HBO Max after rivals have already established themselves.  is the market leader, with a lower starting price point.   has seen a great early start with Disney+, which . Subscribers can use Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu combined for only $12.99 per month. In the meantime, entirely free, ad-supported streaming services like Tubi and Pluto TV are catching on quick. Tubi said in February -- before millions of people were trapped at home by COVID-19 and     -- it had already garnered 25 million regular viewers.Sure, AT&T has the option of bundling HBO/WarnerMedia content and AT&T's telecom offerings in a variety of ways. Just as a reminder though, the whole point of the DirecTV acquisition was to cross-sell and co-promote the company's different services. It hasn't helped. AT&T has been steadily losing DirecTV customers since 2016, and it's been bleeding streaming customers since 2018 despite the promotion of package deals. Consumers .Data source: .

Boiled down to their simplest form, pricing and packaging.AT&T's decision-makers continue to struggle with both, however, seemingly telling TV watchers what they should want and what they should be willing to pay rather than responding to what TV watchers have demonstrated they want and will pay.HBO Max may well end up being the highest quality on-demand service in the world. If consumers can't perceive that value in the midst of what's become a very crowded and competitive arena though, that quality is going to be irrelevant. Offering television choices in a confusing labyrinth of ways only further frustrates prospective customers.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's embracing the very thing working against each.Yes, that's streaming video. The company announced last year it would launch a relatively robust stand-alone option in 2020. We've learned since then it's going to be called Peacock, but more than that, we've learned there's going to be a completely free, ad-supported version of the service that can draw on Universal's and NBC's deep library of content.

Other, more expensive tiers will offer more and newer content.It's not Peacock's mere existence that makes Comcast so compelling heading into (and then out of) the coronavirus firestorm, though.

The outlook may underestimate just how much interest there is in such a well-supported service when it's appositely free, however.

Reacting to the COVID-19 crisis, pro sports leagues in the United States (and across the world) . But there's a spot of good news for the sports industry this month: Prices for sports broadcast rights are expected to rise in the coming years.Sports broadcast rights have been on the rise for some time now, but continuing that trajectory against such historic headwinds is remarkable. That sports would continue to grow in value even as they disappear from TV during the COVID-19 crisis is a reminder of just how important sports are to pay-TV bundles. It's also something that could have consequences for the pay-TV and streaming industries.Image source: Getty ImagesSports broadcast rights have always been valuable, but things really began to take off for pro sports leagues as new technologies arrived to change the ways in which viewers consume TV. The DVR, pioneered by companies like\u00a0\u00a0, allowed consumers to time-shift content viewing and, more importantly, fast-forward through commercials. DVRs allow viewers to turn live TV into on-demand content. On-demand content is also, of course, available from subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services like  . The arrival of the streaming revolution allowed viewers to swap commercial-filled live TV for on-demand, commercial-free content. (Some SVOD services, like 's  Hulu, have commercials of their own, but that doesn't do much good for the legacy pay-TV companies that are losing ground to SVOD competitors.)On these shifting sands, sports were quickly identified as a spot of firm ground for pay-TV companies and their advertisers. Unlike most other forms of TV content, sports are closely tied to the live viewing experience. Most sports fans don't \"DVR\" their sports for later; they watch them live if they watch them at all. On top of that, sports have long been tougher to get through streaming services. Some leagues have their own services (like baseball's MLB.TV or basketball's NBA League Pass, for example), but prices tend to be high, and regional blackouts abound. By and large, sports are things that are hard to stream, easy to find on legacy pay-TV, and preferably consumed live on channels like Disney's ESPN,\u00a0's   FS1, and\u00a0's  NBCSN.This unique cocktail so much so that some have speculated that sports rights are a \"bubble\" due to pop. If there was ever a time for popping, now is that time.Right now, sports aren't on TV. The NBA and NHL have suspended their seasons. MLB's season never started. The NFL is in its off-season, but even it didn't escape COVID-19-related issues: The NFL draft, usually a big event with a live audience, became a virtual event. That event, at least, made it to TV on Disney's ABC and ESPN, but it is one of a very few live sports-related programs still making it to broadcast.The industry seems to view the current problems as temporary and surmountable. Broadcast rights fees are likely to keep going up, sometimes by quite a bit, according to an analysis by MoffettNathanson.New rights deals are on the way. The NHL's new contract will begin in 2021, and new deals on MLB and NFL broadcasts will start in 2022. These deals should be worth significantly more to sports leagues annually than are the deals being replaced, according to MoffettNathanson's analysis. An already announced deal between MLB and\u00a0Fox, good through the 2028 season and reportedly worth more than $5 billion, appears to match the trend that MoffettNathanson predicts.Percent increase in annual average valueNote: All percentages and values are projected except for MLB's deal with Fox. Source: MoffettNathanson There's a common-sense aspect to this: Assuming that this crisis ends in something resembling business-as-usual, one might reasonably assume that sports will remain valuable to pay-TV providers for all of the reasons that they were before. But there are other dimensions to this, too.Sports will surely be back, but will fans? Sports leagues try to avoid lockouts and strikes not just because of the huge immediate losses, but also because the perception within the industry is that fans who are denied their sports for a significant period of time may be less likely to return. These fears haven't always been borne out in pasts strikes and lockouts. For instance, attendance actually rose in some markets in the 2005-06 NHL season that followed the infamous 2004-05 lockout. Still, a popular perception persists that the 2004-05 lockout did lasting harm to the league. Will a lost season across the board do harm to sports as a whole?There are other reasons to keep an eye on sports broadcast rights growth, whether we think it's a \"bubble\" or not. For one thing, sports prices have the potential to actually accelerate the very cord-cutting that sports are supposedly helping pay-TV companies combat.Image source: Getty ImagesFee increases of the sort predicted by MoffettNathanson could be high enough to push up prices of the channels that buy them and, in turn, the cost of pay-TV bundles. Sports fans are important customers in the pay-TV space, but by embracing these sports fans too much, pay-TV companies may be pushing non-sports fans out the door toward 's SVOD competition. A customer who wants to watch movies and sitcoms instead of sports might reasonably ask why they are being asked to subsidize sports fans' passions by paying for a bundle that includes sports channels, which often cost pay-TV carriers double or triple what other channels do. The problem is illustrated by Philo, a private company that offers a streaming live TV \"skinny bundle\" with no sports (or news) and manages to offer a nearly 60-channel bundle of brand-name networks like AMC and Comedy Central for a mere $20 per month.\u00a0For reference, one analysis found that ESPN costs customers an average of $18.55 per month\u00a0.And while Philo is the main sports-free option, it's not the only \"skinny bundle.\" There are plenty of non-cable and satellite live TV options for those who  like sports, too.\u00a0's  Sling TV, 's   YouTube TV, and others still threaten pay TV, regardless of how much fans love sports. Of course, these services still have to find a way to get channels like ESPN and FS1 into their bundles while those networks grow more expensive.A more intriguing streaming threat may come from direct-to-consumer options. Sports leagues themselves are getting better at streaming. Recent years have seen league-streaming services like MLB.TV and NBA League Pass unveil single-team bundles with lower prices -- a better fit for casual fans of specific teams and for budget-minded consumers who might not have liked the eye-popping prices that full-season, full-league packages often command. Meanwhile, MLB's streaming-rights situation looks very different now than it did a year ago.  There may soon come a day when Bronx fans can watch the Yankees on  , which would be bad news for legacy pay-TV companies. And it's worth remembering that the biggest sports network of all, Disney's ESPN, has long threatened to go direct-to-consumer -- .Sports rights may be valuable, but they are also complicated. When sports cost more, so do channels, and so, most likely, does pay TV. Rising prices that push up bundle prices could push even more non-sports fans away from pay TV, which will only make legacy pay TV still more reliant on live sports and, therefore, more vulnerable to threats like streaming-sports alternatives and problems with the sports business as a whole. There aren't many better options for companies in the pay-TV business, though, so there's every reason to expect new high-priced sports deals to go through as predicted, even as dangers loom.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The civil penalty also resolves FCC investigations into whether the company met its obligations to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith and its failure to identify the sponsor of content, the FCC said.The FCC said Sinclair, the second-largest television station operator, has agreed to \"abide by a strict compliance plan.\" The penalty is twice the prior record for a broadcaster.\"Sinclair\u2019s conduct during its attempt to merge with Tribune was completely unacceptable,\" said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. \"Today\u2019s penalty, along with the failure of the Sinclair/Tribune transaction, should serve as a cautionary tale to other licensees seeking commission approval of a transaction in the future.\"Pai rejected suggestions the FCC revoke Sinclair\u2019s licenses.Tribune terminated the sale of 42 TV stations in 33 markets to Sinclair, which owns or operates 191 stations, in August 2018.

Last week, the entertainment company -- which became a stand-alone entity a year ago after 's   of most of 21st Century Fox -- announced its\u00a0$440 million purchase of commercial-supported\u00a0video streamer Tubi.That deal takes the last of the major independent ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) companies off the table; at this point, each of the major networks and studios has an ad-supported or ad-subsidized streaming service in its portfolio.Now, let the games begin as they vie for dominance.Image source: Getty Images.Ad-supported streaming has been around almost as long as streaming itself has, although mostly as an afterthought until January 2019. That's when  , noting the success of Tubi and 's  ad-supported channel IMBDtv, announced it was planning its own ad-supported offering that would be a lot like classic broadcast television. The planned service would , and make it completely free for viewers willing to tolerate a few more of those ads than paying subscribers will see. It will even stream the same video content cable customers enjoy, although not quite in real-time.Just a few days later,    -- when it was still just Viacom -- announced its acquisition of ad-supported video-streamer Pluto TV.\u00a0That same day, Disney-owned Hulu lowered the monthly price of its ad-subsidized subscription. Last month, ViacomCBS revealed it would be  of its CBS All Access. Later in February, Comcast acquired Xumo, which offers free and subscription-based video entertainment.It doesn't take a detective to spot the trend. Media companies want a piece of this growing niche, and they'll buy or build their way into it. Most are doing both.For all the positioning that companies have been doing just since the beginning of last year, even more lies ahead. Comcast's Peacock, which will lean heavily on the properties of NBC and Universal, won't launch until July. Xumo and Tubi are both established AVOD operations, but both are new additions to parent companies that didn't build them, and Xumo will eventually have to compete with its homegrown rival, Peacock. Fox, meanwhile is at the beginning of its AVOD learning curve with Tubi, and ViacomCBS  about when its ad-supported service might debut or what it will look like when it does.All of these entities, however, are moving fast, and most may ultimately be positioning themselves to keep Peacock in check, fearing it could become the powerhouse within the ad-supported arena.That concern would be well justified.Describing Peacock as a first-of-its-kind service isn't hyperbole. Until now, networks and studios have had an interest in making their content relatively exclusive to one video venue. Disney, for instance, moved several of its  and Marvel films from previous partner Netflix to its new Disney+ streaming service.Networks and studios aren't as hesitant to double-dip with their video content now though, particularly when they own all the mediums through which it's available. Comcast doesn't just own NBC and Universal. It's also a major cable provider, and it will soon be a streaming powerhouse able to offering tons of network and studio content. That makes Peacock a potent prospect, even more so considering that consumers who are starting to feel subscription-fee fatigue will be able to get it free.That subscription-fee fatigue is real, too. Most U.S. households say they aren't willing to spend more than $40 per month on streaming subscriptions, and more than one-third of U.S. households say they . They are, however, remarkably open to watching a few commercials in exchange for free on-demand video. A recent poll taken by The Trade Desk and YouGov indicated more than half of all TV watchers were  in exchange for lower priced (or free) streaming video. The same survey also indicated that people would prefer those ads to be targeted so that they are relevant to them.Like any close race, the most exciting moments come at the end, and this year should be the beginning of the final lap in the race among streaming names to establish AVOD supremacy. At stake is their shares of a revenue pool that Digital TV Research estimates will be worth $20 billion by 2024 in North America alone and $56 billion on a global basis.Given that, look for the major players to pull out all the stops in 2020 to attract viewers and secure the widest foothold in the market they can manage. Competitive pricing and compelling content will be their weapons of choice, although bundling is likely to be a favored tactic too.The odds-on favorite to win the race is still Comcast though, if only because it's so close to launching Peacock, and is so far ahead in the  that commercial-buying companies will want in order to make airing their ads on these platforms worth their while.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are living through extraordinary times. Since we last all spoke together, who would have imagined our lives could have all been turned so upside down.The impact of COVID-19 has impacted our economy, our businesses, our colleagues and ourselves. We owe deep gratitude to the nurses, doctors, police, teachers, aged care workers, volunteers and countless other front-line workers for their incredible and brave sacrifices. At Fox, we thank every one of them. Their work humbles ours.We have spent these last few months protecting the health of our employees; providing essential news, information and entertainment to our communities; all while bolstering the strength of our company in order to best tackle the challenges ahead. At the outset, let me say that, if there is anything you take away from my remarks today, it should be that Fox is in a strong position to deal with the impact of this pandemic. Our strength was clearly demonstrated in the quarter, which was only partially impacted by the pandemic and is illustrative of the outstanding results Fox delivers in unaffected cycles. The strength of Fox has also been on display in the weeks since the end of the quarter as we navigate these unprecedented times to continue to provide our services to communities across the country.Starting with a review of our third quarter, you will have seen that we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving revenue and EBITDA growth of 25% and 20%, respectively, adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 22%, and generating over $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue growth was multipronged. It feels like a lifetime ago, but as a reminder, the quarter began with our record-breaking broadcast of Super Bowl 54, where we generated around $600 million of gross revenue across the company. But the strength in the quarter extended well beyond the Super Bowl.Local advertising at the FOX Television stations grew by over 20% as Super Bowl revenues were supplemented with over $35 million of gross political ad revenues in the quarter. At FOX News, advertising revenues grew by 15%, led by a 45% increase in digital ad revenues. And we had another strong affiliate quarter with total company affiliate revenues growing by 10%, despite a touch over 5% reduction in pay-TV subscribers. Steve will cover the details of our financial results shortly.Operationally, the quarter saw FOX News and FOX Business deliver their largest audiences in each network's history with FOX News ratings up approximately 40% year on year. The success of FOX News Media's brands extended beyond their linear properties. FOX News Digital achieved its highest quarter ever across all KPIs, including over 11 billion digital page views. Companywide digital reach grew 42%, while digital engagement nearly doubled year on year.Elsewhere on screens, the quarter brought us another successful season of The Masked Singer and the No. 1 new broadcast reality series, the family friendly hit, Lego Masters, two shows that we hope will shape the Fox Network lineup for years to come. While still early days, our strategy to leverage the cross-promotional power of our platform to support shows we have an ownership interest in is showing encouraging results. Bless The Harts was the No.1 new comedy and adds another leg to our Sunday Animation Block, while Prodigal Son was the second highest-rated new scripted drama on television. Locally, the FOX television stations continued the expansion of their news coverage, adding an additional five hours per week across Atlanta and Los Angeles. The stations' unified programming strategy drove ratings growth in essentially every day part, including daytime and late news. Corporately, during the past quarter, we completed important transactions to support the ongoing growth and momentum of FOX.Among them were the closing of our agreement with Nexstar, in which we expanded our local market footprint through the acquisition of key stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, and the transfer of our Charlotte stations to them; the early renewal of our distribution agreement with one of our largest partners, Comcast, and our full portfolio of channels; and the announcement and subsequent closing of our acquisition of Tubi, which immediately expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides our advertisers with even more opportunities to reach audiences at great scale. Coupled with combined power of Fox's existing networks, Tubi provides a substantial base from which we will drive long-term growth in the direct-to-consumer market. As an example of the scale, in April, Tubi generated total viewing time of over 200 million hours, which is up more than 150% versus prior year. This was also the first full quarter reflecting the results of Credible, our digital loan marketplace business.And while we are only just at the beginning of exploring the marketing synergies between Fox and Credible, the business has had a great quarter, doubling its closed loan volume and revenue year on year. Overall, the financial and operating results through the first nine months of the year confirms just how sturdy our business is and demonstrates the power and importance of our live sports, news and event programming to our partners and our audiences. Of course, our achievements have been rightly overshadowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and by the challenges it has presented to all of the company's stakeholders, including our colleagues, the communities we serve, our business partners and our shareholders. We   understand our responsibility to each stakeholder and are mindful of them in the balanced actions we are taking to address the crisis.As I mentioned earlier, our main priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our more than 8,000 colleagues. We continue to follow federal, state and local guidelines when it comes to our workforce in our locations across the U.S. Those whose job functions allow it have been working remotely since mid-March. And we have over 70% of our employees offsite at the moment.We are grateful to those essential employees whose jobs require them to work onsite for their commitment and for their resolve. We have taken actions to protect and ensure the well-being of these employees, particularly for those that are out in the community informing the country of every aspect of the pandemic at a national and local level. While taking steps to keep our colleagues safe, we also continue to provide our viewers with the information they seek to better understand this pandemic on a national and local basis. In this spirit, we swiftly launched coronavirusnow.com, a free-to-use website featuring the latest news about the pandemic.Drawing on our news-gathering and digital capabilities across the country, bolstered by third-party content from government and health organizations, such as the Center for Disease Control, we've created the site to provide our employees, viewers and communities with reliable up-to-date information about this public health issue. Over 1.3 million Americans have accessed these specific resources. It's a wonderful example of the breadth of Fox coming together to provide a public service to our audiences at a critical time and in a new and distinctive way. Further, working with our distribution partners to ensure that all Americans could receive the latest national and local news regarding coronavirus, we offered free access to the FOX News channel and FOX Television stations starting in mid-March and continuing for over a month.We are doing impactful work across our platforms to inform our viewers and to give back to our audiences. Fox raised over $13 million for Feeding America and the First Responders Children's Foundation, through our broadcast of Fox Presents the iHeart Living Room Concert for America, which paid tribute to the brave medical professionals and local heroes who are working on so many aspects of the pandemic. In early April, Fox News and Facebook cohosted a coronavirus town hall, featuring medical and business experts, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Fox News and Facebook jointly donated $1 million to Feeding America's COVID-19 Response fund.In partnership with NASCAR and with the NFL, FOX Sports donated to Feed The Children, the American Red Cross and Feeding America. FOX Sports and FOX News talent have taped special public service announcements, encouraging viewers to stay home and to seek the latest guidance from the CDC. To-date, we have broadcast nearly 30,000 COVID-19 PSAs. Our FOX Television stations have spearheaded charitable initiatives to assist their local communities from benefiting food banks and presenting on-air school lessons for students with limited access to technology.And an initiative I am particularly proud of is the preparation and delivery of 2,000 meals a day for the disabled community in Los Angeles by our Fox Studios foodservice staff. This gives us the dual benefit of keeping our amazing staff in work while providing much needed support to the people of LA. We'll continue with many of these and other initiatives where we can be helpful. And I've asked each of our 8,000-plus employees to look for ways they can contribute to their community while working from home.At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on the evolving impact of the crisis on our business, adjusting the way we operate in the near term, communicating with our partners and evaluating our longer-term models to ensure that we maintain the strength of Fox for the future. Clearly, we are not immune to the impact of COVID-19, and we acknowledge the continuing pandemic will influence our future financial results. The uncertain nature of the situation, however, makes it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, particularly over the near to medium term. So what has been the impact on our business to-date? At a macro level, sports events have been deferred and the production of certain entertainment content slated for the fall has been suspended.However, our activities around news have grown and intensified. Our local and national news ratings have been strong with FOX News ending the third quarter with its largest audience in history. We have seen this momentum accelerate into the current quarter with audience levels rising further, most notably in the younger student demos. This quarter so far has seen the network's adults 25 to 54 audience nearly double from prior-year levels.This growth has not gone unnoticed by advertisers with new business coming to FOX News from clients looking to reach these younger demos or to transition dormant sports dollars to news or to present different marketing messages in light of the virus, thereby mitigating most of the pullback in the categories that you would expect, such as auto, entertainment and retail. Categories that have moved spending into FOX News to reach our expanded and engaged audiences include insurance, fast-service restaurants, telecom, streaming and tech. Where the impact of the pandemic is most apparent in our business is at our local stations across the country, where, despite viewership gains for our local news programming, fiscal fourth-quarter advertising revenues are pacing down around 50% from year-ago levels. The local auto, local retail, local travel, and local entertainment categories are leading this decline for us and the rest of the local TV market.We'll only see the pattern of how these categories will return after states and municipalities open back up for business. On our last , I indicated that all signs pointed to a robust political ad cycle for our local markets. As a result of the contraction of the field of presidential candidates and the postponement of many state primaries due to the pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in the active political advertising spend that we saw in the third quarter. However, traditionally, the political campaign significantly ramped up spending in our first fiscal quarter, and we expect, with election day still six months away, that this category will intensify again as we approach November.Turning to sports, which accounts for over 40% of our total annual advertising revenue. Very little of this revenue has been affected so far by the shutdowns. Our sports revenue is concentrated in the fall when baseball's postseason and the college and NFL football seasons are most active. We're in close contact with all of our sports partners and know that they are being thoughtful around their scheduling decisions by prioritizing the health and safety of all of the personnel associated with their sport, their fans and their production partners like us.We'll look to them for their conclusions around when they will commence play. Whenever they are ready to start, we'll be ready to produce and to broadcast. Like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hiked and the roar of engines starting again. On the entertainment side, COVID-19 has caused the temporary cessation of nearly all program production in the industry.Regardless, Fox will enter the next broadcast year with a great deal of stability. This is partially because animation production has been less affected than live action, and we expect to return in the fall with all new seasons of The Simpsons, Bless The Harts, Bob's Burgers and Family Guy. Also slated for the fall, we have already completed new seasons of our Gordon Ramsey franchises, Hell's Kitchen, and MasterChef Junior, and have all new series finished and ready to go to air, including the psychological thriller NeXt and the Southern gothic soap opera, Filthy Rich. At this time, should the conditions allow for it, we are planning for production in early August of Season 4 of The Masked Singer, which will target for a fall debut.We have also begun preparing new seasons of 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star, Prodigal Son and Lego Masters for mid-season launch dates. Given the uncertainty that our advertisers are facing in their own businesses, along with the potential variability in our programming schedule, you'll have noted the cancellation of our advertising Upfront, which would otherwise have taken place next Monday. Although we will not be hosting this traditional event this year, we remain in constant dialogue with our advertising partners to ensure that we provide them with the flexibility needed to navigate these unprecedented times. Fox executives have been front and center with our clients, hosting video conferences to speak about the marketplace and the impact on their businesses.While the flexibility that we provide our partners will certainly be reflected in reduced advertising revenues in the current quarter, it is our priority to preserve these long-term relationships and do what we can to ensure the health and sustainability of their businesses and brands. Finally, as for distribution, we are pleased with increased viewing that we're delivering for our partners' video offerings and for our FOX-affiliated stations across the country. As it relates to pay-TV subscribers, it's unclear so far of the impact of COVID-19 will materially alter recent trends. We know that a few major distributors have publicly expressed a bearish outlook for their video subs.And there will no doubt be recessionary economic pressures across a significant number of pay-TV households in the near term. These factors alone would likely exacerbate the recent trends in subscriber declines. But we also know from Nielsen Ratings that more people are consuming TV right now, particularly in the news category. And we know there is strong pent-up demand for live and event programming that is the cornerstone of our portfolio brands, beginning, for example, with the return of NASCAR in just 11 days.While the bias would have to lean toward near-term pressure on subscriber levels, how all of these factors interact and get reflected in subscriber numbers will become more clear as the year progresses. I'll wrap up my comments where I started. Fox is in a strong position to weather this turmoil. Our outsized exposure to news, a genre that should be less impacted than others, and the timing of the sports that we broadcast has curbed the immediate impact on us so far.We entered this crisis in a position of financial strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid. Our steadfastly conservative financial management and our strong free cash flow profile underpin the company's balance sheet, even with the uncertainty around the shape and pace of the economic recovery in the United States. As we emerge, Fox's focused collection of brands skewed heavily toward live and event programming will be even more in demand by advertisers and audiences alike. I am confident that we'll come out of this crisis as a stronger, more efficient and more agile company positioned for the future toward our continued goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value.And now I'll turn the call over to Steve. -- Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third-quarter results before going on to discuss current trading conditions. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The company reported total revenues of $3.44 billion, up 25% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments.Total company advertising revenues increased 44%, led by the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, while total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. We achieved double-digit affiliate revenue growth despite the rate of net subscriber declines of just over 5%. Quarterly EBITDA was $920 million, and notwithstanding the comparison to carve out financials in the prior-year period, still represented growth of 20% led by increases of the television and cable network programming segment partially offset by the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment. The increase in these expenses reflects the full costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year versus the presentation of carve-out financial statement in the prior-year quarter.From a bottom-line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $78 million or $0.13 a share was lower than the $529 million or $0.85 per share in the prior-year quarter. This decline was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. Most notably, the book loss incurred following the sale of our stake in Roku in March. From an economic perspective, the Roku sale, which equated to 9 times our initial investment, delivered a posttax gain relative to initial cash investment of approximately $300 million and strategically allowed us to convert a minority shareholding into the full ownership of leading AVOD player Tubi.Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.93 was up significantly, compared to last year's $0.76 per share, reflecting the growth in EBITDA, partially offset by higher net interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, primarily reflects interest on the stand-alone debt structure of Fox versus the carve-out presentation in the prior-year quarter. So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable EBITDA of $792 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 6%. As expected, we saw growth in cable affiliate revenues accelerate to 4% as the impact of new distribution agreements and higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers. This growth also reflects the launch of FOX News and Fox Business on Sling late last year.Cable advertising revenues increased 10%, led by results at FOX News Media, including the impact of higher ratings and continued strength in our digital sales, partially offset by high pre-emptions associated with breaking news coverage. Segment advertising growth was also impacted by fewer live NASCAR events at Fox Sports 1 due to the postponement of early season races as a result of COVID-19. Other cable revenues grew by $18 million, driven by contractual sports sublicensing revenues primarily associated with college basketball content in the quarter. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses.Fox News Media costs were up in the quarter due to coverage of the presidential primaries and continued digital investment in FOX Nation, which were partially offset in the segment by lower programming rights amortization of Fox Sports 1 from fewer live NASCAR events. The quarter also included one-time costs at FOX Sports and FOX News Media related to the production of shoulder programming leading up to the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. The Television segment reported EBITDA of $224 million, an increase of $125 million over the prior-year quarter on revenue growth of 41%. The revenue growth was led by a 56% increase in television advertising revenues, including the impact across our network and stations from Super Bowl Sunday.Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the impact of one less NFL divisional playoff game compared to the prior year, advertising revenues would have been up 1% primarily due to strong CPM growth for FOX Network and higher political advertising revenues at the Fox Television Stations. These were partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 on our local stations during the closing weeks of the quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 22% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. EBITDA at our Television segment increased $125 million over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses.The increase in expenses was driven by programming rights amortization and production and costs associated with the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, partially offset by the impact of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game and prior-year programming writedowns. Similar to our second quarter, we continued to make investments in programming, which included our first year of WWE content, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in coproduction arrangements with third-party studios. Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $96 million, which reflects the full quarter of stand-alone cost as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We still expect the net EBITDA loss in our other segment to be in the mid- to high $300 million range for the full fiscal year.Turning now to cash flow. As expected, our free cash flow generation in the quarter of more than $1.5 billion was strong, supported by the collection of advertising revenues from our fall programming and the fact that our sports rights payments were concentrated in prior quarters. As a reminder, we calculate free cash flow as net cash used in operating activity plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, in March, we closed on the previously announced Nexstar Television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million.We also generated net proceeds of approximately $340 million from the sale of our stake in Roku, which was earmarked from the acquisition of Tubi for approximately $445 million in net cash consideration at closing last month. During the quarter, we purchased 3.9 million Class A and 2.9 million Class B shares for $173 million. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased $600 million, representing nearly 3% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. Given the current uncertain economic conditions, we have not bought back shares since the onset of the crisis.From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. Since then, out of an abundance of caution, we took the opportunity to add to our already strong liquidity position by raising $1.2 billion of five-year and 10-year notes in April, which was significantly oversubscribed. The weighted average cost of this new issuance was approximately 3.3%, thereby making it attractive from a cost perspective to essentially prefund our $750 million maturity due in January '22. So with the combined benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity for almost two years, we face the challenges of COVID-19 from a position of financial strength.As Lachlan mentioned, while we are very proud of the operational and the financial results that we have achieved, we're acutely aware of the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges it presents to all of our businesses and all of our stakeholders. We note that there are a number of moving variables, among them the outlook for the gradual reopening of the economy, the timing in the return of sporting events and the evolution of the upfront advertising cycle that make it difficult to forecast our business beyond the very short term. As such, our commentary today will focus only on our fiscal fourth quarter and only on advertising revenues, which is where we are seeing the most significant impact to our business. The most immediate impact has been on advertising revenue at our local television stations, where inventory is sold essentially on a spot basis and many of our advertising partners operate in sectors most displaced by COVID-19.If pacing continues at current levels, we would expect our local advertising to be down by approximately 50% as against prior year. Meanwhile, our News and Entertainment businesses are expected to be more insulated in the immediate term. News is being supported by strong ratings, the growth of its digital properties, the category mix of its core advertisers, along with the new advertising clients it is attracting that help partially offset decline from the legacy advertising base. At Entertainment, we are already substantially through the broadcast season with our advertising revenues well supported by inventory that was sold during last year's upfront and, until recently, a strong scatter market.So before we get to our Sports business, the collective Q4 impact of weaker advertising demand at our local TV stations, national news and Entertainment businesses is anticipated to be around $200 million to $240 million or 25% to 30% compared to prior year. Across these businesses, we do not anticipate COVID-19 having a meaningful impact on Q4 costs. Now turning to our Sports business, where uncertainty around schedule makes it impossible to forecast top-line impact. However, it is worth pointing out that we typically amortize the associated rights fees and production expenses on our P&L when the games or events actually air on our networks.So from a bottom line perspective, advertising revenues from events being postponed is often offset by the P&L expense benefit of not having the rights cost. Although these uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our businesses, as Lachlan mentioned in his our financial results to illustrate, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well-positioned as possible to take advantage of opportunities during the recovery. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Joe. -- Thank you, Steve. And now we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community.[Operator instructions] It looks like our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you. So my multipart, one question. I've always said you're a super nimble company, very entrepreneurial.And out of all of this, maybe there's some opportunity. I'm just wondering if you're thinking about longer-term changes in your business where you can find more efficiencies. And then more immediately, what can you say in terms of sports? Well, I mean, WWE is still on. Can you talk about what the ratings have been and what the advertising has been? I'm just wondering sports without fans, does it change the demand in advertising? NFL is supposed to announce their schedule tomorrow.Do you think that will impact the advertising demand? Thank you. -- Hey. Thanks, Jessica. Let me answer both of those questions. Thank you.There were two questions, I think. There are variations of one, but I'll answer them both, and I appreciate them both. So in terms of efficiencies, I think what we have -- because we are in such a strong position, we haven't looked at how we drive efficiencies in terms of a specific COVID-19 impact. Our employees are fully engaged in running each of their businesses.Our businesses are all fully operational. And as you know, when we separated from Disney, we went through a process at that time of really creating what we felt was a very efficient platform from which to go forward. Having said that, we've looked at how we produce sports, how we produce news, how we operate as a team, many of our corporate functions. And we've learned the lessons from telecommuting, working in more flexible and more innovative ways.And we think, absolutely, going forward, there are significant ways we can be more efficient and more agile as a company, as I mentioned in my earlier comments. So there is a process we're working through. It's a process we're working through before COVID-19. And we certainly see that there's opportunities there.From a sports perspective, look, we're very pleased, obviously, with the return of NASCAR on May 17. We've seen a very strong demand from our clients to be associated with and to market within that race and within future races. So we're very pleased with what we see from an advertiser demand. We have worked, I should say, with our clients over the last six weeks incredibly closely, engaged through -- not physically closely, but digitally closely engaged in literally hundreds of teleconferences.We're taking them through the marketplace, having us understand the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses and how we can help them as we come out of this health crisis going forward. That process is now evolving where we can now have much more specific conversations with them, particularly about the fall. We're pleased that the NFL will be releasing their schedule 8:00 tomorrow night Eastern Time. That obviously gives us a trigger to be much more specific in our conversations with our clients.But we are seeing tremendous pent-up demand for sports programming and live event programming. As for the WWE, I have to give a shout out to the WWE. They have done a tremendous job delivering us live content, week in, week out, under very difficult circumstances. And we're very appreciative of them for it.So thank you, Jessica.Next in queue is the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good afternoon. I think it was a year ago you had your Investor Day, which feels like 10 years ago at this point. But I wanted to ask you about a couple of things that you guys focused on then.One was the outlook for retransmission revenues, which is obviously a key driver of growth for the business. And I was curious, just given how much the ecosystem has evolved since then, if you continue to be confident you can deliver on those expectations, realizing that the world has changed quite a bit. And then secondly, I can't remember, John, how you phrased it, but something to the effect of, we're going to be cautious with buybacks and conservative with our balance sheet sort of for a rainy day or for a change in the cycle and be opportunistic. And we've certainly arrived at that point, I think you would agree.I'm just curious how you think about using your balance sheet, which is a strategic advantage in times like this to continue to sort of reinvent the company as you look out over time. -- So Ben, let me address the first part of the question, and John and Steve can address the second question. From a retransmission perspective, we remain 100% confident that we can achieve our goal, which we announced at the Investor Day, which you're right, does feel like 10 years ago. I'm sure we all have a few more gray hairs. And to remind people, I think everyone was there, but that goal was to achieve an additional $1 billion in affiliate revenue by calendar '22.And we believe we are on track to achieve that goal. John, I'll pass it over to you for the second question. -- Thanks, Lachlan. And thanks, Ben. No, you're right. We've always viewed and have particularly viewed, with the birth of Fox Corporation, our balance sheet to be a true strategic asset of the company.But the balance sheet really reflects -- the strength of the balance sheet reflects the strength of the operations of the company. And I think, fundamentally, that's what you have to look at first is how strong the businesses are. It does give us optionality as we look longer term. But I think all the comments Lachlan made and Steve made in the near term, with the amount of uncertainty around, we're really just focused on the strength -- the operating strength of the business.As Steve said, we paused the buyback once the pandemic hit. And I think we're just going to be cautious here for a little while and know that we have this strategic asset to continue to build the company.Comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. I have two. So one is on Tubi. I was just interested in the rationale for you guys to do it.And where do you think you can add the most value? It seems like -- there's a lot of library content on there, and you guys are mostly a live-producing company. So I'd love to hear about where you see you can create value for Tubi. And then secondly, I think, Lachlan, on the last call you mentioned that you guys were still -- were talking to the NFL about a new renewal from next contract. I wonder if those discussions continue and if any of the data points you see of the quarter to come maybe give you some pause to hold on and to doing the deal until you see maybe light at the end of the tunnel in terms of what trends will emerge post-COVID? Thanks. -- Thanks, Michael. So two good questions, and we could talk about them for hours. But on Tubi, Tubi gives us tremendous reach. And we've talked before about our direct-to-consumer strategy.We were very pleased with both our kind of authenticated strategy through FOX NOW. It's obviously an authenticated platform for our product but also with the strength and the growth in FOX Nation. I should say FOX Nation has had -- I think April was the second-strongest month for FOX Nation, and it continues, which is interesting as it gets bigger, to achieve an over-80% conversion rate from free trialists into paying subscribers. So the consumers of FOX Nation are absolutely enjoying and paying for that product as it grows.And we've talked before about Fox Bet and Credible as a part of our direct-to-consumer strategy. But as far as Tubi goes, we feel that we are not getting back into the entertainment original production business through Tubi. We see our existing slate of brands as being very important to the growth of Tubi. What we can do both through the entertainment network and its content, you can see today.The No. 1 television show on Tubi is The Marked Singer and is driving a lot of important viewership and advertising impressions. And what we can do with sports and news and our local stations in the future, we think, is very exciting. So Tubi is a great business.It's grown 150% year on year in terms of in terms of video hours viewed, but we can make it an even greater business. And we're getting to know the team, and we like them a lot. We think they're going to do great things. But it is important that it's our brands, and Tubi's distribution, I think, is going to really be very exciting.On the NFL, obviously, COVID-19, we haven't been able to sit down across the table with the NFL to discuss their future plans and the renewal of our deals. We have been in contact with the NFL every day about a whole range of other things. So we remain very close to them. There's nothing that we see in the marketplace today that makes us feel any differently about the value of our partnership with the NFL.They've been a tremendous partner of ours for over 25 years. And we've built our business as they've built theirs, and we look forward to that continuing for many years to come.Next, we have the line of Alexia Quadrani of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much. I just want to follow up on your comments about the upfront market. I understand the process is very different this year, and there's a tremendous amount of flexibility. But do you believe there will be some upfront markets that will occur, meaning that advertisers will be willing to make commitments for the fall and for next year? And I guess when you look at Fox's portfolio, sports being such a big component of it, do you feel that they will remain on the sidelines until you do get better visibility on that front? I know you mentioned having the line of games coming out soon will be helpful, but is it enough to sort of get them to kind of make these commitments? -- Thanks, Alexia. So as I mentioned before, I think with Jessica's question, we've been fully engaged with our clients and ad agencies over the last six weeks. We don't see that changing. We don't see a virtual singular upfront as the right thing to do today because all of our clients are affected by COVID-19 in different ways.And they will all emerge from their COVID-19 impacts in different ways. So for example, our retail clients or our auto clients will emerge from COVID-19 in a very different way from, say, our financial services or insurance clients. Entertainment will be very different from telecom or professional services. And so it's important for us as we've engaged with them to understand what their needs are and to tailor our partnership with them in very unique and specific ways, and that will continue.Obviously, there are triggers to those conversations, such as the NFL schedule being released, such as NASCAR being back on air, on the track. And those are exciting milestones. But we'll continue to work closely with each of our clients and work to their specific needs to work them into our schedule. I think one of the key things to remember, Alexia, is, aside from the sports schedule, which is starting to take shape, our entertainment schedule in the fall looks incredibly stable, really thanks to a large amount of our programming already being filmed and edited and [Inaudible] them in the can.The only open question in our fall entertainment schedule is whether we get Masked Singer back into production in time for a fall schedule or for a mid-season schedule. The rest of our schedule -- and by the way, I should mention, I think I did in my earlier comments, the fact that animation is virtually -- the production schedule of our animation is virtually untouched, knock on wood, by COVID-19 has been a great boon to us. So we are very confident and pleased that we have a strong entertainment schedule in the fall. Now this, of course, the elephant in the room is the tremendous ratings of news.Our news ratings are the strongest they've ever been. The demographics within those ratings within that viewership is younger and as attractive as it's ever been, and we're very pleased with that. So it's not just about sports, sports coming back, but it's about news and entertainment that we are very confident, and we'll have a strong quarter.Thank you. Next, we have a question from the line of Doug Mitchelson, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Thanks so much. I guess the first question is jump ball. Has this environment impacted making any new investments in entertainment programming? And how does the accounting work for the programs that you're bringing back? I believe you booked them on a cash basis last year when you made the investments. Now that they're returning for second seasons and they've been successful, does that have any implications for downstream revenues that you start to book or cash you start to receive? And the second question, Lachlan, I was going to ask, it seems like you have an idiosyncratic mix of acquisitions to-date, and what should we expect next in terms of M&A? And it's interesting because you strung three together as part of a direct-to-consumer strategy.So either way, whether it's an idiosyncratic mix or whether it's actually targeted to a specific strategy, any thoughts on what's next for M&A would be helpful. Thank you. -- Doug, let me start with the first half of your first question, and then I can go to your second question. I'll let Steve answer the accounting of it, but the impact of any new investments in entertainment in terms of how we look at -- as I mentioned, the production today is effectively shut down globally. How we plan for new seasons and new shows, which we are excited about, whether for -- really for the fall -- sorry, not for the fall, for mid-season or for next year, there's been no sort of disruption in our development cycle in terms of new shows and new IP. One thing that's been occurring behind the scenes all the time is virtual riders rooms and virtual development where people don't have to be on an expensive movie studio a lot.For example, all of that work is continuing behind the scenes, which has been positive to see. -- Yeah. And Doug, just picking up on the accounting and just, we called out -- just going back to the Investor Day, again, we called out $200 million to $250 million of programming investments, and we're on pace to be in that range for the full year. So I think we'll spend close to sort of $170 million of that so far in the first three quarters of the year. So we're still on pace, and as Lachlan mentioned, continue to look at how we invest in that going forward.The accounting won't change for us in terms of the amort of entertainment programming, which we generally sort of go through on first run. So there'll be no changes on amortization. -- And then as to the idiosyncratic investment or M&A, look, I think you can put it into two different categories. One is expanding our existing strength on our existing base. So for example, if I look at Tubi and I think of the digital video impressions that they garner us, we can both strengthen Tubi from a content point of view, and we can strengthen them from an ad sales point of view. They benefit tremendously from the association with us.We think it's a tremendous acquisition that really plays to Fox strengths. But it's doing what we do today. It's putting with new technologies and advertising video-on-demand basis, puts our content in front of new markets with greater reach and gives more opportunity for our advertisers. So it's perhaps a simple strategy, but we think one that's really very exciting for us.So one bucket is the businesses that are in our wheelhouse. They're expanding what we already do in an exciting way. The other, which you can put Credible and Fox Bet into those categories is how do we look at businesses where we can monetize our existing audiences in different ways. So when you look at our revenues today, our revenue is equally split roughly between advertising and affiliate revenue to grow new revenue streams, less reliant on those two is an important goal of ours.Credible. We're incredibly excited. It's doubled in size over last year, doubled its loan volumes and doubled its revenue. And Fox Bet had an incredible Super Bowl.Obviously, since COVID-19, there's less sports being played, but I should say that part of that acquisition was an equity stake in TSG, which has done rather well with the merger with Flutter, which I should congratulate Peter Jackson for, which closed on Monday. So those businesses are really about getting -- those best strategies are really about getting into new businesses based upon our existing audiences and serving our existing audiences in new ways.Our last question will come from the line of John Janedis, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Come from the line of Steven Cahall, Wells Fargo. Your line is open, sir. -- Thank you. So maybe just first, you talked about the TV station pacing of around down 50%. As we've come through the current quarter, have you seen any sequential improvement that makes you think that that down 50% isn't going to repeat again in the next quarter? And I know that's a bit of a call on how reopening looks but just wondering if you're seeing that down 50% start to improve as parts of the economy start to reopen at this point? And then just a quick follow-up on political. -- Let me talk sort of broadly over local and national. I don't want to [Inaudible] too because they're obviously different. But clearly, when we talk about our projections for a 50% reduction in local advertising, that's a mix of all sorts of different categories, right? The categories that you would expect are being affected significantly worse by COVID-19, they're pacing below -- or say, worse than 50% below. So travel, entertainment, restaurants are all pacing worse than 50%.But that's ameliorated by many categories that are down significantly less than that. Professional services, insurance and some categories, frankly, that are up, like pharmaceutical. So it's a real mix. Again, as we said before, we can't really say from a local perspective, how local markets are going to recover.It will be state by state as various states and municipalities lift their shelter-at-home orders. But we are beginning to see positive signs in the pacing going forward. Over the last two weeks -- now, I'm not talking including national, over the last couple weeks, we have seen a severe lessening of requests for flexibility with advertising. I think people -- advertisers and marketers are starting to look forward into the first quarter of next fiscal year and are beginning to think about how they market and get their products and their brands in front of our consumers again.So we're just -- it's early days, but we're just beginning to see that positive shift. As to political advertising, despite the impact of COVID-19 in the last couple weeks of the third quarter, the third quarter still was a record political year for us -- sorry, quarter for us -- the third quarter for us. Fourth quarter always is a trough as the advertising start -- political advertising starts to pick up again in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year. So we expect that trend to continue.We expect the political advertising to ramp up in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. And we believe we are still on track for a record political season. The reason we say that is, if you look at our markets, obviously, it's going to be a hard-fought election. We have nine of our 18 markets or about half our markets are battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, to some extent also Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota.Ten of our markets have U.S. Senate races. I won't list them all. And two of our markets have gubernatorial races.Of course, the House has contests in every market. So we think our markets are -- I wouldn't say fortuitously, but are certainly positioned well to capture a lion's share of the political revenue really in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. Thank you. -- At this point, we're out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This includes live TV, radio, gaming, time surfing the web, and even watching this content on your smartphone or tablet of choice.Newer media channels from the likes of Netflix, Amazon\u2019s Prime service, or Hulu, are often mentioned as destinations of choice for consumers. But we still watch plenty of shows on cable TV, and this is increasingly shifting to channels that reach them more directly. I myself am almost through the last season of the Walking Dead on the AMC network.Research firm RBC Capital has noticed that shares of some more traditional providers of cable-TV content have been selling off rather dramatically lately. The drops are at least 30% and could be considered too severe. This is because these media assets still have considerable value and throw off profits that can benefit shareholders and the migration of reaching consumers more directly.We ran three media stocks which recently gotten the thumbs-up from RBC through  to see whether the Street agrees with this newly positive outlook. So which three stocks RBC is re-evaluating right now? Let\u2019s take a closer look.If I were to ask you about the value of a media company that has created hits like Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and The Walking Dead, you might think it would be pretty high. But AMC Networks\u2019 stock is down more than 40% this year and 60% over the past year.New York-city based AMC Networks owns five entertainment programming networks: AMC, WE tv, BBC AMERICA, IFC, and SundanceTV. Its content can be viewed in 130 countries and the bulk of its sales are tied to bundled cable packages from traditional TV. But it is migrating to going directly to the consumer and hopes to create shows as popular as the hits mentioned above.In an extensive 42-page report, RBC analyst  did concede that there is near term weakness: \u201cwe expect National Networks advertising revenue (32% of total company) will see material headwinds from softness across national TV ad spend given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\u201dHowever, Maral quickly acknowledges that the recent share drop seems to be extreme. The P/E ratio is ridiculously low in the low single digits.\u201cWith shares down ~46% YTD, we think there\u2019s broad acknowledgement of the challenges AMCX faces but not a lot of appreciation for the value it is creating across SVOD, its sustainable FCF outlook, deleveraging off an already healthy balance sheet, or M&A optionality.\u201d On the last point, with the stock being cheap and media content growing increasingly important, a larger media firm could buy the company outright.Maral also thinks AMCX \u201cwill increasingly be viewed as an attractive takeout candidate given its strong content production pedigree and studio, early traction with [going directly to the consumer], relatively attractive positioning across the linear ecosystem, and scope for cost synergies under a larger company\u201dAs a result, Maral has initiated coverage on AMC shares with an \"outperform\" rating and $27 price target. (To watch Maral's track record, )But the Street does not share this optimism \u2014 quite the contrary. Right now, AMC stock has a Hold consensus rating with only 1 recent Buy rating. This is versus 5 Hold and 1 Sell ratings. Yet, the $28.17 price target suggests a potential upside of 17% from the current share price. ()Maryland-based Discovery owns an impressive array of media assets. First and foremost is its namesake the Discovery Channel, followed by TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science Channel, MotorTrend, Food Network, the Oprah Winfrey Network, as well as other brands.Discovery\u2019s share price decline hasn\u2019t been as dramatic as AMCX\u2019s, but it is still down around 30% so far this year, and has fallen 28% over the past year. This has pushed the forward P/E into the single digits, which is probably too cheap for such a collection of appealing programming and channels.RBC's Kutgun Maral also initiated coverage on Discovery with an \"outperform\" rating and $26 price target. Its thesis echoes that of AMC Networks \u2013 namely a growing direct-to-consumer business, steady free cash flow generation, and takeover potential.Maral believes \u201cDiscovery is demonstrably balancing its legacy revenue streams while it leans into next-gen/DTC initiatives that are scaling rapidly.\u201d In other words, it is shifting from a model where sales come primarily from cable TV providers more to direct-to-consumer apps and channels for a monthly fee.Maral also details that Discovery generates a lot of free cash flow, has a solid balance sheet, and could end up getting bought out by a larger media company. On that last point, the analyst writes: \u201cDISCA is the most attractive takeout candidate within traditional media. It is uniquely positioned to offer the growing number of DTC services a way to differentiate their platform with leading nonfiction and lifestyle brands that have global appeal, with content that has a low-cost profile, is fully owned, and has demonstrated strong viewer engagement with a female-skew.\u201dOverall, Wall Street almost evenly split between the bulls and those choosing to play it safe. Based on 16 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 9 rate Discovery a Buy, while 7 say Hold. Notably, the 12-month average price target stands at $28.07, marking about 25% upside for the stock. ()Similar to Discovery, Fox stock is also down about 30% so far in 2020 and over the past year. Its forward P/E is down below 12, and RBC also sees potential here.New-York-based Fox Corporation owns an impressive array of news, sports, and entertainment assets. It is perhaps best known for FOX News, FOX Business, FOX Studios movies, and an impressive array of sports channels.Lead analyst Kutgun Maral has been busy and also issued an extensive initiation coverage report on Fox with an \"outperform\" rating and $31 price target. While Discovery has the greatest buyout potential, Maral believes \u201cFox [has] the most attractive portfolio of traditional media assets across our coverage.\u201dSimilar dynamics are at play as affiliate fees paid by cable TV firms, which are 48% of Fox\u2019s revenue, will slowly grow as consumers embrace content that can directly reach them. Advertising sales (43% of sales) will also struggle a bit as the economy struggles in the face of covid-19. But Maral sees continued steady free cash flow generation since Fox is one of the largest media players for advertisers to embrace. And sports, when it comes back, provides a very loyal viewership.Most of Wall Street is surveying the media giant from the sidelines, with TipRanks analytics demonstrating Fox as a Hold. Based on 13 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 4 rate the stock a Buy, 7 maintain a Hold, while 2 issue a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $32.40, marking a nearly 25% upside from where the stock is currently trading.

That was well below Monday's closing price of $63.84, which was already down a stunning 21.1% for the day during the worst single-day drop in the market since 1987. That was a  that large shareholders may have wanted out of the high-flying growth stock at just about any price. After all, Roku topped $176 per share as recently as last August, so to see a large shareholder wanting out at $60 was not what shareholders wanted to hear.\u00a0\u00a0However, we now know who the big seller was, and the answer to the question should probably make Roku shareholders breathe a bit easier -- at least, as easy as one can breathe in this environment.Image source: Getty Images.It turns out that Morgan Stanley was acting as an intermediary for   , which had retained its news and sports divisions after selling its massive movie studio and other television channels to   almost exactly one year ago. Fox had been a pre- investor in Roku since 2013, good for a 5% stake. Apparently, Fox had earmarked its Roku winnings to buy Tubi for $440 million, a deal that was announced on Tuesday. Tubi is a free streaming service that sells ads to make money.Fox is likely making the Tubi purchase in an effort for self-preservation. As more and more of the world cuts the cord on traditional linear TV, companies like Fox, which retained sports and news programming as the last bastions of the cable bundle, may feel the need to adapt in case even sports and news aren't enough to retain large cable audiences anymore. That means Fox needs a streaming option, and Tubi is just that. Tubi licenses non-exclusive films and TV shows, and claims that customers spend 160 million hours per month on its platform in total. Likely, Fox will add local news and sports to Tubi's current licensed offerings.Fox said in a statement that it is \"essentially exchanging a passively held minority investment for full ownership and control of a leadership position in the free ad-supported streaming market.\"\u00a0That's not totally the case, as the bargain-basement price it received for Roku only amounted to about $350 million, assuming a 6-million-share sale at $58 per share. That's well short of $440 million, and likely the reason that Fox panic-sold its stake after a massive drop in Roku's share price. If Roku continued to fall, it's likely Fox would have had difficulty paying up for Tubi, potentially endangering the deal altogether.For downtrodden Roku shareholders that have seen the stock fall a whopping 65% from its all-time highs, there's no doubt that last night's news was a relief. That's because it shows the sale was something of a panic sale for a specific purpose, not necessarily a statement about large shareholders' negative views on Roku.That being said, Roku's stock is still a story about massive .

But the biggest beneficiary of the paradigm shift spotted by digital video editing and production platform Grabyo is the soon-to-be-launched Peacock service from NBCUniversal -- a division of cable giant  . Simply put, Grabyo's recent survey of consumers indicates that 74% of television watchers will only be streaming their content by 2025.On the surface, it's neither surprising nor alarming. Cable companies that have been on the wrong end of the cord-cutting craze are finally stepping up their streaming game. In addition to the impending launch of Peacock,   revealed last month it was , similar ad-supported video platform.  just announced its , which injects advertisements into television programming and movies to make them free for watchers.Somehow, though, Comcast's Peacock still looks like it comes out the winner of this budding branch of the streaming video market.Grabyo's survey confirms what most investors already innately know -- streaming is so well focused and affordable that it's negating the need for cable TV. The firm's data further indicated 36% of consumers looking to cut the cord rated affordability as one of the top three reasons to do so... a data point that may understate consumers frustration with high cable bills.Image source: Getty Images.It's curious, however. While the poll found most consumers intend to use only streaming video services within five years, customers don't exactly hate their cable providers, or their prices. An impressive 33% of cable customers rate the value of their TV service as \"very good,\" while 43% of them deem cable television a \"good\" value for the money. Streaming fares a little better, but not leaps and bounds so.These numbers suggest what this year's expected slowdown in cord-cutting also imply. That is, we may be nearing a streaming/linear cable equilibrium where the remaining traditional cable TV customers have decided their monthly bill and their advertisement exposure is fair for what they're getting. It may also tacitly suggest there's a bit of ground in between those two extremes of the free/premium continuum that's been mostly overlooked by the industry... until now.The concept itself is certainly proven. SpotX's 2020 Vision report published in December points out that a little more than 60% of streaming consumers already do watch . SpotX also indicated 40% of video content now being streamed is actually ad-supported.Enter Peacock, built from the ground up to deliver cheap, network-caliber entertainment with a few ads, and backed by a sizable library of new and old content choices from a network and a major movie studio.With nothing more than a passing glance, Peacock could look just like another Netflix or Prime. That's not what it is though, by a long shot. Peacock is being built from the ground up to be a marketable hybrid of a Netflix-like service and network content one would expect to see on an NBC affiliate station. Live sports and regular prime-time programming will also be available via Peacock, with the commercials one would expect to see aired through a cable broadcast.In other words, Peacock may not be linear cable, but it's certainly close enough that consumers will be hard-pressed to identify a meaningful difference.Comcast won't operate by itself in this middle ground for very long, though. While details about its service are scant, ViacomCBS has made clear it's going to dig deep into its vaults to build on its existing CBS All Access platform. With properties like Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, Smithsonian, and more primed to contribute as many as 30,000 TV episodes and up to 1,000 films to the cause, ViacomCBS has the potential to become a player. It's just  on the planning front, however, that most consumers may have already become comfortable with Peacock before ViacomCBS even figures out what it is.This is a speed-based race too. Grabyo's outlook may say 74% of television fans will be purely streaming by 2025, but that migration has already started. Peacock will be available closer to the beginning than the end of that shift, and it will be the first real ad-supported option of its caliber, giving it a chance to turn test-drivers into buyers before a competitor does.If anything, the advent of the coronavirus outbreak might only accelerate Grabyo's expectation.TV-viewership measurement name  reports that when  have been stuck at home for prolonged stretches, television viewing time can jump as much as 60% above the norm. Although the COVID-19 contagion will eventually pass, consumers may still be nervous about getting out when Peacock officially launches in mid-July. Should a recession take hold, that too will keep people at home and looking for cheap entertainment.Either way, Peacock wins, particularly if consumers have tired of what's on Netflix or Prime by that point in time.ViacomCBS could conceivably have its ad-supported service up and running by around that time, but that would be rushed effort, and likely wouldn't have the well-planned  in place that Comcast has built for Peacock.In simplest terms, Peacock still looks poised to rule the roost, now more than ever. Comcast's platform will be an easy off ramp for hesitant cord cutters to take, and Grabyo agrees more and more that they are ready to make some sort of switch. The company's plans to amass at least  by 2024 now don't seem so crazy after all. Indeed, they may be a bit modest.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After selling its stake in Hulu to   last year -- along with most of its cable networks, film studios, and other assets -- Fox's presence in streaming video is just its TV Everywhere apps and a Fox News streaming service called Fox Nation.It's now bolstering its presence in streaming with the acquisition of Tubi, an ad-supported streaming service featuring old films and TV series. Fox will pay $440 million for the company, and it's notably funding the acquisition with the sale of its stake in  , which it acquired pre-IPO. The company  earlier this week, and likely raised about $350 million before taxes and fees.The divestiture in Roku and the Tubi acquisition ought to put Fox in a stronger position going forward as more consumers shift their TV time to streaming.Image source: Tubi.Fox faced a challenge earlier this year when its contract with Roku was set to expire just before the network aired the Super Bowl. Consumers that wanted to stream the game on their Roku devices would have been blacked out on Fox's TV Everywhere apps were it not for a last-minute agreement.\u00a0The main contention between Fox and Roku was how much ad inventory Roku would take in Fox's apps. While the terms of the two companies' agreement weren't disclosed,  by at the very least forcing Fox back to the drawing table.Disney, by comparison, likely had the upper hand on Roku and other streaming platforms like 's  Fire TV. When  ahead of the launch of Disney+, Disney was able to rely on its existing subscriber bases for Hulu and ESPN+ and its known demand for Disney+ to push back.Adding Tubi to its portfolio gives Fox more firepower when it comes to negotiations with Roku and Amazon. Tubi has 25 million unique viewers, and Fox says those viewers stream 160 million hours per month. While that's not huge engagement, it certainly expands Fox's streaming audience and ad-supported hours. For reference, the average Roku user streams over 100 hours per month.Fox also has plans to beef up Tubi's engagement. It's considering adding its own content to the platform. \"FOX will evaluate opportunities to expand the Tubi offering not through original content, but rather in a cost-effective manner by leveraging our expertise in national and local news and sports programming,\" the company said in a press release.The  is a huge opportunity for media companies. And as ad dollars shift from traditional TV to digital video, Fox is particularly at risk of missing out because it's now much more reliant on TV advertising than before its deal with Disney.One reason Tubi may have been eager to sell is that content is getting harder and more expensive to buy. The company planned to spend $100 million on content this year, licensing primarily from other major media companies.But as those  launch their own streaming services, they may be inclined to retain the streaming rights to a lot more content instead of shopping them around the secondary market.Fox's ability to engage consumers with more of its own content on Tubi will be a key strategy\u00a0to keeping the ad-supported service as part of the rotation of supplementary streaming options in consumers' lineups.

All of its profits come from the platform business, which earns money from advertising and sales commissions on premium subscription video services. Last year, the average Roku account generated $23.14 in revenue for the streaming company -- that was up 29% from 2018.But there's still a lot more room for Roku to grow, and there are three reasons that number will keep climbing in 2020 and beyond.Image source: Roku.Roku is already well positioned to benefit from the secular growth of connected-TV advertising, but the  last year ought to give it even broader appeal with marketers. There are two key things DataXu brings to the table for Roku.First, it makes Roku advertising more accessible to small businesses. \"We had historically been focused on talking to large advertisers and the agency holding companies,\" CFO Steve Louden said at an investor conference earlier this month. \"DataXu's focus was on the small- to mid-sized advertiser, which we had not looked at at all.\" He also points out a lot of the big digital advertising companies get a large percentage of their revenue from small businesses, so it's a significant opportunity in aggregate.The other opportunity for Roku with DataXu is offering broader reach for advertisers. Instead of just showing ads on Roku devices, DataXu can also place ads across the web with other advertising partners. Marketers can easily retarget consumers that saw an ad on Roku when they might be more ready to buy on a desktop computer.That could make Roku advertising even more appealing to more brands and puts Roku on better footing against competitors like . One of Amazon's advantages in advertising is that it can show an ad on its Fire TV platform and then show that viewer an ad for the same brand or product when she's browsing Amazon's marketplace. That can result in better overall conversion rates for marketers. While Roku can't emulate that exactly (no one can), DataXu helps it become far more competitive with retargeting advertisements.Roku's own ad-supported channel on its devices presents far superior economics for the company than convincing consumers to download individual apps. The Roku Channel aggregates content from dozens of ad-supported streaming services alongside select content Roku has licensed itself.\u00a0Over the last year or so, however, Roku has mostly focused on drawing in new partners to its revenue-sharing program instead of licensing additional content. The partners cede control of their entire ad inventory for content they offer in the Roku Channel, and Roku splits the ad revenue 50-50 with the partners. That compares to the standard ad inventory split in individual apps, where Roku takes just 30% of the inventory.The partnership is valuable for both sides. Roku's able to generate more revenue per hour streamed while partners get additional exposure and don't have to worry about ad sales. And as Roku improves its targeting capabilities through increased data and demand, the 50% revenue share could result in greater payouts than selling 70% of ad inventory itself for some partners.With more content coming to The Roku Channel through revenue-sharing partners, it's attracting more and more engagement. A highly engaged user base in The Roku Channel may be more likely to subscribe to premium services through the channel instead of through the main platform. The economics for subscriptions in The Roku Channel are far more favorable for the company, because it operates under a wholesale agreement. It also gives Roku more direct access to viewer data, which could be valuable for content recommendations and increasing overall engagement.Roku's audience is growing quickly. It added nearly 10 million new accounts in 2019, about the same amount as Amazon gained. That said,  in the fourth quarter of the year. Roku is also more widely used in the United States than Fire TV.That scale gives Roku a lot of negotiating power. Louden explained, \"We tend to sign shorter deals, because as our scale has been growing significantly, in general, we're getting better economics.\"\u00a0It's the same strategy has taken with record labels in order to get better music-licensing terms. Spotify is practically always negotiating its next deal with the record labels in order to improve the gross margin on its service. And as it has become more and more essential to the growth of the music industry, it gains negotiating power.\u00a0Roku has the same opportunity. \"We've become a more essential partner over time for the ecosystem. And now, in the U.S., if you want to have a legitimate OTT offering, you need to be on Roku,\" Louden said.Roku exercised its negotiating power earlier this year when it faced a \u00a0right before the Super Bowl. The two sides managed to come to an agreement before the game, but Roku showed considerable strength. Investors may see more blackouts or potential blackouts as Roku stands up to bigger  and asks for a greater percentage of ad inventory or subscription revenue.With all of these factors working in Roku's favor, investors should see the streaming specialist's revenue per user continue climbing as it scales its audience.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The two have failed to renew a distribution contract for seven Fox channels on Roku's platform.The blackout of Fox's channels -- set to begin sometime on Jan. 31 -- is somewhat unprecedented and runs parallel to the challenges smaller media companies have had in negotiating carriage deals with traditional pay-TV providers in recent years. While users of\u00a0's\u00a0 Fire TV couldn't stream YouTube for several months, that stemmed from a much broader spat between the retail giant and YouTube's parent company, 's Google.Roku's hardball tactics with Fox despite Sunday's Super Bowl indicates relative strength for the streaming platform. And while it could cause some short-term pain as a portion of Roku users are turned off by the inconvenience of the situation, Roku ought to come out ahead in the long run. Moreover, renegotiating distribution with other media companies and leveraging its sizable audience could lead to additional growth in revenue per user.Image source: Roku.Roku used to compare its active account number to the subscriber base of pay-TV providers. In the fourth quarter last year, management wrote, \"In the U.S. alone, our active account base would make the Roku platform equivalent to the No. 2 traditional pay-TV/cable company.\" And after substantial cord-cutting at the two biggest providers in 2019, Roku's audience is probably big enough to call itself No. 1.Roku is also substantially larger than Amazon's Fire TV in the United States. While Amazon counts over  globally, it seems to be far less popular than Roku in the U.S. Roku users streamed more than twice as many hours as Fire TV users in the third quarter, according to data from Conviva.The carriage dispute with Fox puts Roku's size in perspective. It's hard to imagine many other distributors willing to forego the potential audience provided by the Super Bowl.The details of the dispute remain unknown, but the blackout likely revolves around ad inventory splits. Amazon had a  with \u00a0ahead of the launch of Disney+. Amazon wanted a greater share of ad inventory for Disney's ad-supported streaming apps. The two were able to come to terms before the launch of the new service.Demanding a larger share of ad inventory presents a path to accelerate revenue per account for Roku. The streaming company generated $22.58 per account in the 12 months ended in September 2019. But growth is slowing as it gets bigger, despite continued  and the shift of ad spend from traditional to connected TV.Taking a bigger share of ad inventory provides another axis for Roku's revenue growth. Combined with increased engagement and increased average ad prices, it would provide a big shot in the arm for Roku's platform business.But it requires Roku to take tough stances like it's doing with Fox. Roku needs to be aware of its users' switching costs and available substitutes in order to come to the negotiating table with confidence. The more smart-TV users in its customer base, the higher the average switching cost. (Smart TVs are harder to replace than a streaming stick.) Roku's smart-TV user base is growing faster than any other company's, taking one-third of sales in the United States.\u00a0Furthermore, the more options for streaming similar -- or even the exact same -- content on Roku's platform, the stronger Roku's stance. In the case of Fox and the Super Bowl, Roku will have lots of alternatives, including the free NFL channel. What's more, Roku can use its marquee display advertising to point its users in the right direction, so the user experience remains pleasant with minimal costs.That won't be the case with all content providers. Some  will have much stronger positions than Fox and bring large, engaged audiences to the table. But as Roku grows its audience and engagement, it becomes more powerful, and it can grow revenue through demanding more from its content partners.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Last year, TTD stock returned a massive 132% for shareholders. And since its initial public offering, the equity has consistently broken new ground. But once you see that attractive entry point for Trade Desk, you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll want to pounce for one pivotal reason: the advertising efficiencies inherent in the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s programmatic platform.\tIn my last article about TTD stock, I discussed the underlying organization\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s . Particularly, innovations in streaming and connected TV affords advertisers informational opportunities that simply don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t exist in the linear TV ecosystem. I wrote:Where Trade Desk stock specifically benefits is that the underlying company can offer advertisers unprecedented information about their ad engagements. With streaming technologies, Trade Desk can offer clients the who, what, where, when and why. That simply wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t possible in the linear TV era.\tAnd this opportunity truly comes into play when we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re talking about live events such as the upcoming Super Bowl. Over the decades, the final game of the NFL post-season has become linear TV\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s flagship arena. According to data compiled by Statista, in 2002, the average cost of a 30-second Super Bowl XXXVI commercial was $2.3 million. Last year, for Super Bowl LIII, this figure ballooned to $5.25 million.But for advertisers, the Super Bowl is a big question mark. As Washington Post contributor Paul Farhi noted, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSecond-half advertisers, meanwhile, not only , they also have to fight viewer fatigue.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009dAnd this is exactly why TTD stock is so compelling longer term.As you probably know subconsciously, not all Super Bowl commercials are equal. Farhi further states that, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAdvertisers tend to clamor to show ads in the first half of the game and usually in the first quarter. The reason? It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s when the audience is most stable, most predictable and most attentive to the advertising.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009dThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a completely true statement \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u00a6 for linear TV. But what if an organization can mitigate this unpredictability and leverage it for advertising efficiencies? This concept is the core of what drives the longer-term narrative for TTD stock. As a representative from Trade Desk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s corporate communications wrote to me in an email:Within linear TV, the broadcast gives away ad slots or puts a low price tag on them during overtime for advertisers because live sports is just so unpredictable; there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no way a broadcaster can predict the game will go into overtime. But with CTV [connected TV], TTD can capitalize on the overtime and find advertisers willing to pay in real-time because that last 20 minutes may bring an audience that is the most engaged.That almost-exact scenario played out in 2017 for Super Bowl LI. Prior to this championship game, no other Super Bowl in history went into overtime. Obviously not knowing that this game would become possibly the greatest comeback in football,  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:)  for such a scenario.Now, if viewers watch on linear TV, this programmatic advantage is moot. But Trade Desk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s representative notes that:\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u00a6there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s an increasing number of people who will be watching the Super Bowl through streaming services\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u00a6That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s where the opportunity lies for programmatic advertising. If the game goes into overtime, advertisers will have the opportunity to target these viewers. Advertisers plan out their ad campaigns through TTD, knowing that overtime is a possibility.An interesting wrinkle to the burgeoning programmatic advertisement space is that linear TV is losing popularity even in marquee events. For instance, Super Bowl TV viewership  with 114.4 million viewers.Last year, viewership plummeted to 98.2 million.To be fair, this could be a combination of streaming\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s growing presence in live events, as well as declining interest in traditional sports. However, evidence indicates that when the modern Super Bowl audience watches the big game, they\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re more .\tFor instance, during the 2018 Super Bowl,  (NYSE:) reported a 671% increase in streaming for Will Powers\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAdventures in Success.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d This song was related to Squarespace\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s commercial. And Skylar Grey\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cStand by Me\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d enjoyed a 408% boost due to a Budweiser commercial.In other words, today\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s live sports audience members are watching in a digitally connected network of instant information and gratification. And as this audience evolves with the underlying technology, so too will their penchant for connected TV. Logically, this plays directly into the hands of Trade Desk and TTD stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The following are today's upgrades for Validea's  model based on the published strategy of .

After flying from the top rope and reaching all-time high's earlier this year, WWE has been down for the count, losing nearly two-thirds of its value, putting the stock down about 7% so far this year.The match is far from over, however, as WWE is scheduled to report the financial results of its third quarter after the market close on Thursday, Oct. 31. Let's look back at what has caused the wild swings to see if it provides any insight into what investors can expect when the company reports earnings.Kofi Kingston and Samoa Joe fight for the WWE Championship at Extreme Rules. Image source: WWE.For the second quarter, WWE reported revenue of $268.9 million, a 4.5% year-over-year decline, though the company faced tough comps because of record revenue in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) of $34.6 million declined by 20% compared with the prior-year quarter, though it exceeded the company's guidance.\u00a0That resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.11, which were flat year over year, but easily surpassed the expectations for a loss per share of $0.03.\u00a0The top line missed analysts' consensus estimates of $275 million, caused by declines in each of WWE's operating segments.

Both live events and consumer products also declined, falling to $48.8 million and $23.1 million, a decline of 7% and 13%, respectively. Average paid subscribers for the company's streaming service also decreased, falling to 1.69 million, down about 6% year over year.WWE has always been a cyclical business, but the timing of its recent slump couldn't be worse.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 231 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FOXA options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $27.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FOXA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $30.23/share today.\n\nBecause the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.67% return on the cash commitment, or 13.70% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fox Corp, and highlighting in green where the $30.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $31.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.40.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FOXA stock at the current price level of $30.23/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $31.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.49% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FOXA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fox Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FOXA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $31.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $31.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.94% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.55% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 33%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 244 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $30.23) to be 26%.

Then in late August, Disney opted to get a head start by offering all members of its D23 club (which has a free tier) a three-year subscription to Disney+ for just $141 -- that's less than $4 per month and well below its originally planned $6.99-per-month starting price.IMAGE SOURCE: WALT DISNEY CO.But make no mistake, the Disney+ hype machine is only just getting started.Disney hasn't offered specific numbers just yet for how many people seized that discounted three-year opportunity. But it seems to be working from a position of strength now; late Sunday, the company sent its first mass email containing a link for early interested users to preorder Disney+ at the regular price of $6.99 per month, or $69.99 (roughly $5.83 per month) for an annual membership.So why do I think Disney+'s marketing and early recruitment efforts are set to ramp up between now and its Nov. 12, 2019, launch date?Remember, Disney is arguably the most experienced business in the world when it comes to hyping the brands comprising its enviable , including not only its namesake studios, TV networks, and  but also Pixar, , Marvel, and a  (National Geographic among them) thanks to its recently closed $71 billion acquisition of most of the assets of .That's not to mention that Disney hasn't yet begun widely publicizing its separately announced $12.99-per-month bundle -- which is on par with the most popular pricing tier offered by Netflix -- that will include a combined subscription comprising Disney+, Hulu (of which Disney currently owns 70%, with a deal in place to  Comcast's remaining 30% stake), and ESPN+ (which  on its own this past February).In any case, if Disney follows the tried-and-true formulas it uses to promote its most popular blockbuster films and other entertainment products, I suspect we'll see marketing and preorder activity for Disney+ reach a fever pitch in the coming weeks -- just in time for the company to provide an encouraging update on its prelaunch progress during its next quarterly  in early November.

Even better, today\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bulls are in a winning position to take home an even larger technical trophy on the ROKU stock chart.\tUpstart and leading streaming video on-demand platform Roku has a roster of media giants in its ranks. From  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) YouTube,  (NYSE:) ESPN, Disney+, Hulu or  (NASDAQ:) Apple TV, there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s seemingly something for everyone on Roku.

The agreement  to stream one of the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s most popular sporting events on FOX Now and Fox Sports just a day prior to the contest.And after pleasing viewers with the ability to watch a come-from-behind victory, Roku investors showed their commitment to beat back the bears in similar fashion.\nSource: Roku has been in the process of forming a much-needed technical correction the past couple months. Shares established a downward-sloping wedge or triangle-like consolidation following a bearish lower-high candlestick in late November.And ROKU stock appeared on its way towards another bearish leg within its correction this past week as shares briefly broke pattern support. But conditions have quickly turned for the better for bullish investors.The business agreement with Fox has dismantled the bears\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 stranglehold on shares. The provided weekly chart shows Roku has reversed in price to trade back above resistance inside the congestion pattern. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a bullish step to be sure. And coupled with Roku sporting a supportive oversold stochastics crossover, as well as successfully testing the higher of two Fibonacci-based support zones, a meaningful low could be building in shares. So, what should investors do?One strategy for investors is to buy shares if pattern resistance near $137 is broken. The entry is still a few percent above current market prices, but Roku\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s volatility stresses having a buy order ready. A price signal could happen faster than you think.I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d recommend a blended stop-loss of $127 on any breakout positions. On and off the price chart, this looks like ample leeway, while also avoiding playing ROKU stock\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s volatility too close to the vest.Alternatively, another game-winning play to buy shares is to purchase Roku on weekly price confirmation a higher-low pivot is in place. This method of entry signaled Tuesday as the stock traded above last week\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s candlestick high of $131.80.The big picture suggests Roku could be developing a bullish \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cW\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d base and this purchase takes full advantage of this possibility. Here, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d suggest a stop using the pattern low of $120.35. The risk is modestly larger than the breakout entry, but smartly avoids staying long-and-wrong if the bears\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 offense shows up again on the Roku price chart.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2022 put at the $25 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.35.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.4% return against the $25 commitment, or a 2.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to FOXA's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $25 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Fox Corp sees its shares fall 28.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $23.65 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.35 from $25), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.8% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWorth considering, is that the annualized 2.8% figure actually exceeds the 1.3% annualized dividend paid by Fox Corp by 1.5%, based on the current share price of $34.95.  And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 28.41% to reach the $25 strike price.  \n\t\t\t\t\nAlways important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Fox Corp, looking at the dividend history chart for FOXA below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.3% annualized dividend yield.\n\n\n   Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fox Corp, and highlighting in green where the $25 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2022 put at the $25 strike for the 2.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Fox Corp (considering the last 240 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $34.95) to be 25%.

And Fox, for its part, chose the House of Mouse as its preferred suitor thanks to a combination of its enormous bid, superior strategic fit, the \"attractiveness\" of the equity portion of Disney's offer, and -- more pertinent to this article -- what it viewed as a lower risk that the purchase might fail in the face of regulatory scrutiny.Sure enough, Disney had already been working with antitrust regulators for months before making its final bid, and it later agreed to sell a portfolio of Fox's regional sports networks to help push the deal forward.As it turns out, Disney quietly closed on those sales in recent weeks, adding multiple billions of dollars to its coffers and effectively reducing the real cost of its blockbuster Fox acquisition in the process.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.First, with the approval of the U.S. Department of Justice, exactly two weeks ago, Disney sold 21 regional Fox Sports networks -- representing the bulk of its previously agreed divestments -- to   for an aggregate price of $9.6 billion (after accounting for minority interests).Then last Thursday (Aug. 29, 2019), Disney followed by announcing the sale of its 80% equity interest in the YES Network to a group comprising the Yankees (or Yankee Global Enterprises, which already owned the remaining 20% of YES) as well as Sinclair,  , and a number of other smaller supporting investors at an enterprise value of $3.47 billion.The result? Disney is now free of the regional sports networks that would have otherwise prevented its massive Fox acquisition from closing earlier this year -- and it's more than $13 billion richer for its divestment efforts.It's unclear, however, exactly how Disney plans to use the net proceeds of these divestments. But whether it goes to paying down debt, funding the  that is its studios segment, improving its , creating original content for Hulu and its upcoming , or helping fuel capital returns initiatives, it's clear the move leaves Disney better positioned to lead the entertainment industry forward.

Roku reports financial results next week, and there's no reason to think it won't be another blowout performance.\u00a0Roku was serving up streams to\u00a0\u00a0active accounts at the end of September, a 36% spike over the past year. The fourth quarter was probably huge for Roku, as the launch of two prolific services in November and the holiday shopping season probably helped light a fire in the migration process to its rapidly growing platform. Usage is growing even faster than its active account growth, and that's the kind of engagement that has made Roku the top operating system of choice for smart television manufacturers and a popular plug-in accessory for everybody else.\u00a0The climate is ideal for Roku. The only recent stumbling block -- a standoff with  that would've forced a blackout of Fox apps ahead of the Super Bowl -- was settled late last week. Roku isn't going to quadruple again in 2020, but it's highly unlikely to close out the year in the red. Next week's financial update should be just the ticket to turn the year-to-date returns around.\u00a0The consignment of luxury goods may not seem like fertile soil for growth investors, but there's always a market for deal-seekers looking to score bargains on big-ticket\u00a0clothing, fine jewelry, watches, fine art, and home decor. It also helps when consignment in general is trendy given the the way that young consumers are taking to the . The RealReal runs the leading consignment marketplace for verified luxury goods, a pretty big deal in a market rife with counterfeit merchandise.\u00a0If Roku's audience is growing fast, The RealReal's base is growing  fast. The 542,987 active buyers it had at the end of the third quarter were 53% more than it was watching over a year earlier. This is a pretty big business. Despite the bargains that are inherent with secondhand goods, we're talking about an average order size of $438. The take rate here is naturally a lot more generous in The RealReal's honor than it would be traditional firsthand sales.\u00a0The RealReal went public at $20 last year, and as a broken IPO it's now trading in the low teens. BMO Capital initiated coverage of the stock this week with an outperform rating. Analyst Simeon Siegel sees consumers growing more at ease with the consignment market, and The RealReal's average order size should continue to improve along with its widening audience. The lock-up expiration on the shares ended more than a month ago, so the coast should be clear on that front. Siegel's price target of $19 implies 35% of upside from current levels. The RealReal hasn't announced when its next earnings report will come out but it should take place later this month.\u00a0Roku and The RealReal are trading lower in 2020, but that's not the case with the world's leading ridesharing platform. The stock has , and investors are finally getting excited about one of last year's most disappointing IPOs.\u00a0Uber is starting to do a lot of things right. After leaving a trail of red-inked skid marks in the past, it's committed to improving on the bottom line. Unloading its presence in markets with no clear path to near-term profitability and taking a more calculated approach to growing its personal mobility and food delivery segments are helping.\u00a0Revenue growth accelerated in Uber's most recent quarterly report, and we won't have to wait long for another financial update. Uber reports its fourth-quarter results shortly after this Thursday's market close.\u00a0It's fair to say that \u00a0isn't for the risk-averse, but it's also sometimes where one can find some of the more compelling values.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That won\u2019t stop what may well be 100 million Americans tuning in to see the matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs. Indeed, more people have been watching of late. Ratings for televised National Football League games spiked 5% this season, bouncing back from the lows suffered after the controversy surrounding players\u2019 approach to the national anthem. New breakout stars like Jackson and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes probably helped with that. This is good and bad news for television broadcasters.NFL games pulled in an average of 16.7 million viewers during the regular season on television or in digital format, the most since 2016. And league games made up 47 of the top 50 telecasts for the season, which runs from September to the end of December. Sure, viewership is still well below the 2015 level, but it\u2019s moving in the right direction.Fewer off-the-field ructions are part of the reason. In 2016 San Francisco\u2019s Colin Kaepernick started \u201ctaking a knee\u201d to protest racial discrimination as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" played at the start of games. Other players joined him, and President Donald Trump eventually weighed in to object. Ratings plummeted \u2013 just when the NFL was already reeling from the concussion scandal. Thanks to a new generation of stars, the game is reenergized. Twenty-four-year-old Mahomes just knocked the New England Patriots\u2019 42-year-old quarterback Tom Brady off the top spot of the list of players whose merchandise is generating the most dollars, according to the licensing and marketing arm of the NFL Players Association.This presents a dilemma for networks like CBS, Fox, Comcast\u2019s NBC and Walt Disney\u2019s ESPN. They benefit from the ratings uptick because they can charge more for advertising. Fox is pocketing up to $5.6 million for a 30-second commercial this weekend. It also helps retain viewers who may otherwise consider joining many others who have cut the cord. But the resurgence works in the league\u2019s favor, too. The rights to air the games will soon be up for grabs for many networks. ESPN\u2019s contract with the NFL is set to expire next year. The sports cable network is already shelling out an eye-popping $1.9 billion, according to MofftettNathanson.

And that's one of the reasons why inclusive stories were only sporadically green-lit for major studio productions.For years, if you were to pitch a story to a major studio with an all-Asian cast, you would have had almost no comps other than \"Joy Luck Club.\" That critically acclaimed film pulled in US$32.9 million at the U.S. box office on a $10.5 million budget. While that's a respectable profit, it was no blockbuster, and it didn't trigger an onslaught of movies starring Asians.Then \"Crazy Rich Asians\" happened. The 2018 romantic comedy wildly surpassed expectations by earning $238 million around the world with a $30 million budget, making it the\u00a0top-grossing romantic comedy in 10 years, surpassing both \"The Proposal\" and \"Sex and the City: The Movie.\"Other successes have followed. \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" features a Korean American teenager whose secret love letters are mailed to her crushes. \"Always Be My Maybe\" is about two Asian American childhood friends who fall for each other as adults.The same thing is happening with films that feature African American leads.Just in the past few years, \"Get Out,\" \"Us\" and \"Black Panther\" were blockbusters that starred black lead actors.Now, any screenwriter who wants to pitch a horror and superhero movie starring black actors or a romantic comedy with Asian characters has a handful of highly profitable comps at their disposal.Some claim the lack of representation on screen could be attributed to a simple fact:\u00a0Movies need star power, and very few A-list movie stars were people of color.Aside from actors like Denzel Washington or Jennifer Lopez, it was rare for an actor of color to be able to \"carry\" a film. That reasoning doesn't hold water anymore. Today, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, who identifies as\u00a0black and Samoan, is the\u00a0world's highest-paid\u00a0movie star.But one of the interesting aspects of films like \"Crazy Rich Asians\" is that they were huge successes at the box office without any marquee movie stars.This has done two things: It showed studios that star power isn't as necessary as it was once thought to be. And it has allowed a new crop of diverse actors to emerge, with these films acting as a springboard to stardom.Studios have since realized it's less of a financial risk to hire unknown actors, who they can then cultivate and, if all goes well, leverage for future projects. is doing just that with talents like\u00a0Ali Wong. After two successful Netflix stand-up comedy specials, she co-wrote and starred in her first feature role in \"Always Be My Maybe\" for the studio.The same thing happened to\u00a0Daniel Kaluuya\u00a0of Universal Pictures' \"Get Out.\" Before the film, he was a relative unknown. Now he's starring in the upcoming \"Queen and Slim\" from the same studio.But why is all of this happening now?Ticket sales at U.S. cineplexes\u00a0are at a six-year low, while marketing costs\u00a0are soaring. As a result, studios are increasingly relying on international markets to reach profitability. Films like \"Coco\" \u2013 which is set in Mexico \u2013 and \"Fate of the Furious\" \u2013 which features Hispanic and African American lead actors \u2013 have global appeal.The most tantalizing market is China.\"Coco\" is the highest-grossing animated movie ever in China; it pulled in\u00a0$189 million\u00a0at the box office, which almost matched the\u00a0$209 million\u00a0it earned stateside. And \"Fate of the Furious\" actually made\u00a0$392 million\u00a0in China, easily overtaking the\u00a0$226 million\u00a0it earned in the U.S.China is presently Hollywood's biggest foreign market. According to\u00a0projections by PricewaterhouseCoopers, this year the Chinese box office will rake in $11.05 billion, compared to ticket sales in the U.S. of $12.11 billion. Next year, however, China  expected to surpass the U.S. for the first time and be crowned the world's largest film market.Chinese audiences love superhero flicks. \"Avengers: Endgame,\" for example, earned more than $600 million in\u00a0China\u00a0alone. But films with modest budgets can also do well there. With a $10 million budget, the 2016 Bollywood hit \"Dangal\" made $193 million in China, almost tripling its $77 million take in India.As for the future? 's upcoming live-action \"Mulan,\" which is based on a classic Chinese folk tale with an all-Chinese cast and a budget\u00a0exceeding $100 million, has the potential to shatter box office records.For too long, doors to mainstream Hollywood have been closed off to stories set in diverse cultures and precluded inclusive lead characters in popular movies.But now, thanks to a powerful , those doors are cracking open and studios are rolling out the red carpet.The result is happy shareholders and, for audiences, refreshing stories that more accurately reflect the world we live in.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n early trading on Friday, shares of Fox topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 0.6%.

Year to date, DIS stock is up 29%.\nSource: Shutterstock\n\tHowever, it may now be time for investors to take some of the impressive paper profits in Disney shares. In the next several weeks, I expect DIS stock to be volatile and Disney stock price to decline, possibly until the company\u2019s next earnings report in . Here are the most important things that investors should know about DIS and Disney stock.There are\u00a0 that may help Disney stock price reach new highs in the coming quarters. One of them is its diversified and robust revenue streams, spanning across multiple geographies. The conglomerate also enjoys tremendous  globally.Four segments generate Disney\u2019s revenue:On May 8, the company\u00a0 for its second fiscal quarter. It logged revenues of $14.9 billion on earnings per share of $1.61 and beat analysts\u2019 estimates on both the top and bottom line.Results from its\u00a0 operating segments varied. CEO Bob Iger highlighted higher affiliate revenues from ESPN, as well as the popularity of its domestic theme parks. DIS also said that it\u00a0 would be repositioning itself towards direct-to-consumer\u00a0 services.Now shareholders would like to see another strong quarter when Disney reports earnings, expected on Aug. 6.For all four segments, there have been many positive developments this year.This year\u2019s\u00a0 for Disney is quite impressive. In April, Disney stock price  when the company said that the opening of Avengers shattered box office records.Memorial Day weekend saw moviegoers fill up theaters nationwide to watch the live-action remake of\u00a0 Aladdin,\u00a0as the  $112.7 million at the box office \u2014 a Memorial Day record.Following the $2 billion Avenger success story, the positive reception of Aladdin by the public is rather important because it could set the stage for Disney to further update its other iconic movies for the younger generations and their parents.Management has recently pointed out that, despite the trade tensions, many movies are seeing huge interest in .Meanwhile, Disney\u2019s  increasing attendance rates and higher guest spending, leading to double-digit revenue growth. And devoted  have not hesitated to wait up to ten hours in line to ride the new roller coaster. Therefore, analysts are expecting another stellar year for the parks.The company\u2019s new streaming service, Disney+,\u00a0 and will include original movies and TV shows from Disney\u2019s brands, including ABC, A&E, Disney Channel, Disney Studio, Fox Assets, Lifetime, Marvel, National Geographic, Pixar, Star Wars and The History Channel.In the U.S., the service, which is likely to appeal to a wide range of viewers, will cost $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year.\u00a0 And the global launch of Disney+ will start in early 2020.Analysts expect \u00a0(NASDAQ:) to be\u00a0 by the launch, as DIS is removing its movies from Netflix. At present, Netflix needs to constantly produce original content or license content from other providers. Hence, Netflix has sizeable content costs.Netflix\u2019s most popular plan, the Standard tier, costs $12.99 a month, or twice the expected price of Disney+. It will be interesting to see how this price differential will affect the choice of subscribers.Could there possibly be a price war around the corner that could benefit the U.S. consumer? And could Disney+ potentially cost Netflix an important portion of its user base?Disney\u2019s ESPN+ platform, the DTC sports entertainment video service, currently has over\u00a0\u00a0subscribers.

After this acquisition, Disney \u00a0, another . Hulu is expected to have mostly adult content as opposed to Disney+, which will focus on kids and will not even feature any R-rated movies.In other words, as of 2020, DIS will be able to stream the combined content library of Disney and Fox over three platforms: Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. And their combined momentum may very well push Disney stock to new highs. how a prolonged trade war between the U.S. and China could adversely affect Disney stock price. I\u2019d like to highlight that Wall Street has also voiced concern that the U.S., as well as the global economy, could be headed for an .DIS is a . Prices of cyclical stocks tend to follow the business cycle. And, during prolonged economic downturns, cyclical stocks suffer. Let\u2019s briefly remember how the economic downturn of a decade ago affected DIS stock.In July 2009, Disney\u2019s quarterly profits\u00a0 as the company said it\u00a0 was \u201churt by soft advertising sales at ABC and ESPN and dropping consumer spending at Disney World. The company also continued to suffer from a creative slump at its film studio.\u201dDuring downturns, many businesses\u00a0. Because Disney depends on advertising dollars, during an economic contraction, maintaining positive revenue, strong margins, and earnings growth might become difficult for DIS. Over time, share prices and earnings expectations tend to move in tandem.Hollywood\u00a0\u00a0about how an upcoming recession may affect its results. Given that DIS is a\u00a0conglomerate that makes and distributes movies, will Disney and Disney stock be immune to an economic decline? An economic downturn may adversely affect Disney\u2019s sales, particularly in Consumer Products as well as Parks & Resorts segments.In 2019, Disney stock has caught the attention of investors. On Apr. 11, prior to Disney\u2019s investor day presentation, the share price closed at $116.60. The next morning, DIS stock gapped up to open at $127.91. Then, on April 29, DIS stock reached what was then an all-time high of $142.37.In early May, Disney stock gave back back some of its April gains, mirroring the stock market\u2019s volatility. On May 31, the stock saw $130.78. June has once again been good to shareholders, as the stock reached an all-time high of $142.95.So what is next for Disney stock, especially given that we have a fundamentally strong stock that might be making a double top in the technical charts?As a result of the recent impressive run-up of DIS stock, short-term technical indicators have become overextended. Investors who pay attention to s should note that Disney stock has become \u201coverbought.\u201dTherefore, between now and Disney\u2019s next earnings report in early August, there is likely to be some profit taking in Disney shares.In such a case, DIS stock price could fall to the $130 area. If there is any further volatility and decline in the broader markets or the industry, then Disney could fall even further, toward $115, where Disney stock has major support. Then DIS may trade sideways between $115 and $125.It\u2019s almost impossible to time a top and a bottom in the markets. However, it may be timely to take some of the paper profits in Disney stock. Alternatively, you may want to hedge your long stock position with a covered call that expires on July 19. That expiration date would give you enough time to evaluate your position prior to Disney\u2019s upcoming earnings.Finally, if you are not yet a Disney shareholder, you may use any dip in the stock price to buy into the shares.Within the past decade, the entertainment marketplace has been changing, as we have witnessed the impressive growth of streaming and mobile video. Disney has been adding to its\u00a0 entertainment empire, and I regard DIS stock as one of the key media and entertainment names to buy for value and future growth.However, the rest of June and July may bring further volatility to the stock market and I am expecting Disney stock to be hurt by further short-term profit taking.Long-term investors may want to use any potential price declines, especially around the $115- $125 level, as opportunities to buy DIS stock. Those who buy Disney stock will also benefit from its dividend, which provides a yield of 1.25%. In three to four years, patient shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely by DIS stock.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Analysts and holders of  (NYSE:) stock are gearing up for another exciting earnings announcement, with Disney\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter results  Nov. 7 after the close of the market.

This leads us to the question, then, of whether JPMorgan\u2019s pessimism is justified \u2013 and whether risk-averse investors should dump their DIS stock.It\u2019s amazing that Netflix, a much younger company, could have such a powerful impact on Disney. While Disney is jumping on the content-streaming bandwagon with Disney+, Netflix spearheaded the streaming trend years ago. As the University of Nevada\u2019s Benjamin Burroughs , the Netflix effect has been utterly transformative to the modern market for home-based entertainment:\u201cCable and telecommunication companies\u2026 are dealing with the loss of subscribers and anxieties about \u2018cord-cutters\u2019 and \u2018cord-nevers\u2019 amplified by the growth, popularity, and cultural salience of streaming services such as Netflix.\u201dUndoubtedly Disney\u2019s Netflix problem was top-of-mind for the owners of DIS stock as they watched the Disney stock price fall after its most recent earnings report, which was issued in early August. Indeed, a 4% share-price slide immediately ensued amid concerns that the Fox deal was too costly and wouldn\u2019t allay concerns about Netflix completely dominating the home-entertainment market.Evidently, Disney\u2019s theme parks aren\u2019t enough to keep Disney stock owners satisfied; they want the company to step up its streaming game, too, and they\u2019re hoping for better results in November. In August, analysts, on average, were expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.72, while the actual figure was $1.35 \u2013 a disappointment, to say the least.Still, for JPMorgan to slash its forecast so drastically seems like an overreaction, but I\u2019ll let you be the judge of that: Quadrani  Disney\u2019s Q4 earnings from $1.05 per share to 95 cents, and she similarly cut her projection for the company\u2019s FY20 EPS from $6.30 to $5.50.Those are nasty cuts, and the explanation  JPMorgan should sound familiar by now:\u201cThe investment spending in Disney\u2019s direct to consumer platforms and the choppy integration of Fox\u2019s assets lead to more uncertainty in the financial outlook near term.\u201dOkay, we get it; working through the kinks of the acquisition of Fox\u2019s assets is going to take time and money. As mentioned earlier, JPMorgan also essentially told investors to expect more estimate cuts in the near future:\u201cEstimate revisions will likely be frequent and sometimes notable over the next few quarters given so many moving pieces both internally and externally as this integration and media consumption evolution proceeds.\u201dI suppose that \u201crevisions\u201d could also mean that the firm will raise its estimates, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath and wait for that to happen anytime soon. As far as I\u2019m concerned, lowered expectations are setting Disney stock up for a relief rally when it reports its earnings. And with JPMorgan  Disney+ will likely have 75 million subscribers globally by the end of FY20, another post-earnings dip in the DIS stock price would only be a buying opportunity.I actually find it amusing when big-bank analysts take swipes at a globally recognized, cash-rich company like Disney. Let them slash their estimates for DIS all day long if they wish; I\u2019ll take my chances with the theme-park king, which could someday become the streaming king.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following are today's upgrades for Validea's  model based on the published strategy of .

Once a way to cut down on costs, Netflix originals are becoming vital as more and more of the service's content licensing partners announce competing streaming platforms of their own. It's no surprise that Netflix has lots more original content planned for the near future, including the recently (re)debuted .But in another way,  is an unusual choice for Netflix. Until recently, the program ran on 's  Fox network. Netflix rescued the show from the cancellation bin, and it did so right away.Image source: Getty Images.This isn't the first time that a streaming service has revived a cancelled show. In fact, it's not even the first time Netflix has done this, but reviving cancelled shows has not, by and large, been Netflix's operating model. The company has increasingly focused on making sure that everything it produces is contained in-house, even going so far as\u00a0\u00a0such as its Marvel superhero series.And when Netflix has revived shows, it's tended to focus on long-dormant properties.\u00a0\u00a0became one of Netflix's first originals after being off the air for seven years.\u00a0Another example, , picked up over two decades after the \u00a0series' original run.If Netflix is looking to revive recent cancellations, it will have plenty to choose from -- 65% of new shows are cancelled within one season, and even hits rarely stay on top long enough to go out on their own terms. In the 2017 to 2018 television season, more than 150 shows were cancelled. Most of them went out without much fanfare, much less a revival.So unlike some of those prior reboots,\u00a0\u00a0aired its final season with Fox just last year.\u00a0It was not the biggest or the best Fox series, but  had an established following, and for Netflix, cancelled shows like this one may be looking more and more appealing.Right now, Netflix features a lot of content that originally aired on major networks like NBC and Fox, including\u00a0 (NBC), (NBC), and  (FOX), to name just a few. But that may not be true for very much longer.  already has its own streaming option, CBS All Access. owns ABC, and the company is about to launch Disney+ on top of Hulu. owns NBC, which is also launching  in 2020.It stands to reason that these competitors will yank their best content from Netflix as soon as possible -- leaving the industry pioneer with its originals and not much else. Major network shows remain popular with many viewers, and their rewatchability is key for Netflix (, for example, is reportedly Netflix's most-watched show). The best way for Netflix to get major network properties is to buy them from the cancellation heap and revive them.An existing audience is no guarantee of ongoing success, and it won't be easy for Netflix to replace fan favorites like\u00a0 and  with recycled cancellations. But at the very least, reviving shows like \u00a0gives Netflix a viable path to leverage the effort major networks have already put into the content.As successful as Netflix's original content strategy has been, it still doesn't have a property quite like  or intellectual property that can match Marvel Studios. Netflix may never have these things, but beggars can be choosers if they know where to look. The company can at least keep an eye out for ongoing opportunities to pick up network programs (and lure in their fan bases), and that's the start Netflix needs to fill the content void competitors will be leaving it with as competition in the streaming industry heats up.\u00a0\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It has since been updated and republished.]Considering the high volatility of the stock market, investors may want to load up on entertainment stocks.At first, the notion appears counterintuitive.\u00a0 Our nation remains bitterly divided. Adding to this combustible environment is the trade war between the U.S. and China. From a common sense perspective, the best stocks to buy appear to be boring, but stable companies.Certainly, that instinct is a viable one at this juncture. Nevertheless, entertainment stocks offer potential upside, especially if the broader markets take another dip. For one thing, Americans have a history of  during troubled economic times, making entertainment names appealing stocks to buy now.While we take the idea of entertainment, and by logical deduction, entertainment stocks for granted today, back in the early 20th century, such frivolities were envy-inducing luxuries. However, the Great Depression changed that perspective, leading media institutions to specialize in escapism.In fact, some historians have argued that the amusement and entertainment industry kept the American psyche intact during the depression!Moreover,in good or bad times, I\u2019ve yet to meet an individual who didn\u2019t set aside some money for rest and relaxation. Therefore, the amusement industry offers some of the best stocks to buy during turbulent times.With this list, I cover multiple subsegments of the amusement industry, ranging from sure-things to speculative opportunities. Here are my choices for five entertainment stocks to buy now:   \n\t\n\t\t\nSource: Shutterstock\n\tWhen I think about the Great Depression, I envision bankers jumping off tall buildings. However, this dark period in our history ironically produced Hollywood\u2019s . Eager for distractions, millions flocked to the box office weekly despite their strained finances. This piece of Americana still vibrates spiritually with  (NYSE:).But in the digital age where content streaming reigns supreme, many folks dismiss AMC stock. Admittedly, its fallout from last October\u2019s broader market selloff hurt my bullish argument. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic over the long haul.If the popularity of the NFL has taught me anything, it\u2019s that Americans are willing to shell big bucks for a few hours of amusement. But at a certain point, everyone runs into budgetary constraints. For the price of one ticket to a football game, a family of four can watch a summer blockbuster.In terms of entertainment value, AMC simply looks like a good stock to buy.   \n\t\n\t\t\nSource: \n\tWithin the entertainment industry, hands down one of the best stocks to buy is  (NYSE:). For starters, the Magic Kingdom is an American icon that practically defined and redefined the sector. Also, DIS stock has largely remained stable through some very turbulent years.But what I really like about this company is its  and distribution dominance. Most fans recognize DIS stock as an investment into the Star Wars franchise. But with their acquisition of  (NASDAQ:) entertainment assets, Disney brought together several enviable franchises under one roof.As a result, Disney can distribute and profit from these assets more effectively than its competitors. The  is geared toward the sci-fi and comic-book based blockbuster, presenting natural tailwinds for DIS stock.I haven\u2019t even touched Disney\u2019s theme parks and resort business, which is also a big draw domestically and internationally. If you\u2019re seeking broad coverage in your entertainment stocks, DIS is your best bet.Telecommunications is a vital sector, but one that\u2019s hardly entertaining. In fact, I\u2019ve said multiple times that telecom firms are downright boring. But in the age of consolidation, business titans have engaged an acquisition streak. The most significant of these mergers is the  (NYSE:) buyout of Time Warner.Among the key assets going to T stock is HBO. While the premium-cable channel is historically rooted in the cord, its original content gives cord-cutter  (NASDAQ:) fits. Sure, NFLX enjoyed a resounding night at . But HBO, with compelling titles like Game of Thrones and Westworld, firmly stood its ground.While the Time Warner deal attracts criticism for its hefty price tag, at least AT&T has winning content assets. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for \u00a0(NYSE:). Plus, T stock will surely enjoy upside movements once the  begins in earnest.As a whole, AT&T isn\u2019t just among the best entertainment stocks, but one of the best stocks in any industry.With entertainment stocks increasingly taking on technological overtones, it\u2019s easy to dismiss traditional, analog forms of amusement. After all, our stereotypical image of young millennials involves them plastering their heads into their smartphones. But  (NYSE:) longer-term successes dispel that assumption.Since the beginning of 2017, LYV stock has doubled in market value. This surge runs counter to the digital revolution impacting the music industry. Thanks to streaming services, you can get the music that you want from multiple artists, all at reasonable prices.Yet concert-ticket revenues over the last few decades indicate  for live music. Moreover, millennials are driving this trend. Just as significant is their reason to do so: A vast majority attend music festivals to \u201c.\u201d Clearly, LYV stock offers potential upside irrespective of what happens in the underlying economy.In March of last year, I had legitimate concerns about  (NASDAQ:). At the time, sexual misconduct allegations forced former CEO Steve Wynn to resign. But that wasn\u2019t the issue I felt would derail WYNN stock. Instead, it was the disappointing Las Vegas economy.Using data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, I determined that Wynn Resorts wasn\u2019t benefiting from tourism. While visitor stats increased,  from its 2007 peak. That signaled to me that the catalysts for WYNN stock \u2014 namely, high-rollers who don\u2019t give a \u201cdarn\u201d \u2014 were fading.And boy, did it ever! Between the end of May through Dec. 31, WYNN stock tanked 49%. But if you\u2019re eyeing a speculative shot among entertainment stocks, pay attention: Last year, Clark County gaming revenue totaled . This is the first time since the sub-prime lending crisis that Vegas has hit the $10 billion mark.It\u2019s risky, but WYNN could be one of the best stocks for a surprising turnaround.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long AMC stock and T stock.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: The Motley Fool.\u00a0Q4 2019 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Fox Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 .

With that, I'll turn the call over to Lachlan. -- Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporations year-end . While we are ending a fiscal year we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically, we just reported strong financial results. We recently concluded a very successful advertising upfront very successful, we're making good progress on our distribution renewals and we are having a compelling content lineup across our linear and digital channels, all of which positions us well as we commence our first full fiscal year 2020. For fiscal 2019 we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving 12% revenue growth and 8% EBITDA growth our revenue growth was led by double-digit gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues.As you all know about half of our annual revenue comes from affiliate revenue and despite continued subscriber declines we achieved 12% affiliate revenue growth in fiscal 2019. Renew and distribution arrangements with our partners is a normal course activity for us and we have a competencies renewals without much clamor over many cycles, this past fiscal year was no exception. We were able to reset affiliate rates, particularly in the Television segment successfully renewing numerous distribution agreements. Today, the remainder of our annual revenue principally comes from advertising in fiscal 2019 we achieved 10% growth led by the addition of Thursday Night Football and record gross political revenues of more than $185 million at the Fox stations group surpassing by almost 50% the previous record set in fiscal 2013 during the Obama, Romney election.A particularly noteworthy facet of this year's growth was a 24% increase in digital advertising revenues, led by 46% growth at foxnews.com [Phonetic] alone. Our advertising partners are clearly supportive of our ongoing programming strategy this year's advertising upfront was one of the strongest we have seen in many years, yielding higher pricing across entertainment, sports and news specifically for Fox this strength reflects advertisers recognition of our unique capacity to deliver a highly engaged audiences at scale. Across our concentrated portfolio we were awarded for our continuing content investments on the entertainment front, we were able to achieve top of market low teen CPM increases and mid to high-single digit volume increases in addition, we were able to command mid to high single-digit pricing increases in sports and news in addition, even at this early days we're very encouraged by both the volume and pricing, we are seeing for the Super Bowl.We are in a strong television advertising market right now, which is due in part to an especially renewed interest by marketers in prime time and sports programing, which is clearly to our great advantage as you know, a significant amount of the company's revenue is tied to the Fox broadcast network, which is supported by key sports and entertainment content as well as by local programing delivered every day across America our network commands premium advertising and retransmission revenue rates because it delivers a complete schedule of diverse content genres that engage audiences from the NFL to the Simpsons, the network is defined by its programming breadth and not by our vertical concentration that is the hallmark of cable channels and it is this breadth the programming that makes the Fox broadcast network one of the top four channels across the country, week in and week out and such a strategic asset for Fox.While the power of sports is undeniable. We are not looking to turn Fox into a pure play sports channel. We have a few of those already rather keeping the Fox Network vibrant and connected to our audiences is what we are constantly focused on it is why we are investing entertainment originality at the network at a time and broadcast originality and the scarcity value of reaching large audiences attracts a market premium across our revenue streams as was demonstrated by advertisers in the recent upfront. To that end, we are pursuing a strategy to expand our portfolio of owned content to generate long-term asset value for Fox we are being strategic and judicious building smartly and deliberately around our strengths. As part of the strategy we are pursuing a new program co-production model that gives us an equity interest in nearly all new shows aired on the network, we are enhancing our internal content creation capabilities to the launch of side cars [Phonetic], which is already providing third party platforms like [Indecipherable] with content and also through the acquisition we announced yesterday of Bento box [Phonetic] the animation company that produces Bob's burgers as well as two new Fox series Duncan Ville and the Great North.Bento Box gives Fox access to the next generation of animators and the ability to originate owned IP to drive long-term value for the company. You need only to look at our Sunday broadcast schedule where we have launched more animated hits than anyone to know the animation has been the most stable Network Programming on Fox, Barr [Phonetic] none creating leverage loyalty and useful audiences across linear and digital properties. Beyond the network we are also focused on our direct to consumer initiatives Fox News continues to build a significant multi-platform presence well beyond the linear channel and has a strong position and direct to consumer News offerings. The Fox News digital properties attract over 100 million unique users per month and leads News engagement with over 3 billion page views per month.We are expanding our D2C News capabilities by offering a more immersive video on demand service in the form of Fox Nation which was launched just this past November. On the sports front we launched pay-per-view boxing with the car see about in March we followed that with the [Indecipherable] just a few weeks ago and we're encouraged by the results as total purchases increased by more than 30% and direct purchases on the Fox Sports digital properties nearly doubled from the first pay-per-view event in aggregate, the Fox portfolio of digital properties generates a monthly audience of over 200 million unique people and nearly 10 billion minutes of content consumption. But our progress does not stop there. During the past few months and consistent with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day, we've made key investments to expand the reach of our brands, beyond their traditional linear business models and deliver new and innovative products to our most valuable asset, our massive and massively engaged audience most notably in May Fox and The Stars Group announced plans to launch FOX Bet a national media and sports wagering partnership in the United States, we are on track to launch the Fox Bet product in the upcoming football season, or I should say, before the upcoming football season. And we see the opportunity in sports wagering as a long-term value contributor to Fox.Earlier this week, we announced the entry into a definitive agreement to the proposed acquisition of 67% of credible labs, a leading direct-to-consumer personal finance marketplace in the United States at a price that we believe is full, fair and attractive on all relevant metrics including our commitment to provide up to $75 million of growth capital over the next two years.The merger resulted from extensive discussions and negotiations with the special committee of independent directors and credible Board which has unanimously recommended the transaction. Through this prudent and disciplined investment, we will asses an adjacency to our numerous national and local news audiences and tap into a high growth market.Just like our investment in the Stars Group for our Fox Bet offering through Fox Sports, the credible marketplace it's comfortably adjacent to enhances our core Fox digital properties, specifically those are Fox News media and our local television stations. Upon the approval of the credible deal, you will see us activate the credible marketplace across foxbusiness.com which we will be refreshing later this year and across the fast growing digital footprint of our Fox TV stations.Over time, we expect to activate the marketplace across our wider digital network. We believe a given credible access to our highly engaged digital audience will accelerate the company's growth. It's also important to note that we plan to ensure that credible can continue to operate under its founder Stephen Dash, enabling it to continue to pursue the widest growth opportunity in the personal finance marketplace category.From an operational standpoint, we're entering fiscal 2020 with great momentum. The Fox News Channel dominates the cable news landscape for 17 consecutive years as the number one cable news network and maintaining its position as the number one cable network in both prime time and total day viewing this past year.Fox Sports led the industry in fiscal 2019 in the consumption of live sports events measured by minutes viewed beating second best CBS by 10%, ESPN by 13% and beating the combined viewing of ABC and NBC.With our Thursday night and Sunday afternoon broadcast of the NFL, we are football's most significant broadcast partner. We have a great schedule for the upcoming season and we're confident we can build on last year's solid ratings growth.our Fox Television Stations will continue their multi-year expansion of local news coverage and have collectively produced nearly 1,000 hours a week of news. This focus on local programming has led the station group to become number one in the locally programmed and high profitable daytime day part in our owned and operated markets.We're also looking forward to the addition of 50 weeks of WWE Smack Down starting on October 4. A reinvigorated entertainment schedule built around the return of two seasons of The Masked Singer. Our own the fall sports lineup across the network and our sports channels, and of course the broadcast of Super Bowl 54 on Fox.In support of our growth and as we noted during our Investor Day, we will continue to invest in our platforms in fiscal 2020, as we plan to deploy approximately $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA to the launch of the WWE, the Fox entertainment programming initiatives and to our digital properties, most notably at Fox News and Fox Business.We are confident that these investments will serve to drive future growth and value in the long-term. We are excited by the growth trajectory that we have set for our businesses and are pleased with the progress we are making. We believe that Fox is uniquely positioned to harness the opportunities created by this changing industry with a dynamic portfolio of leadership brands and compelling content that audiences are most passionate about.But before I turn it over to Steve, let me comment on the legal claim that we, along with the other broadcast networks filed against low cast last week, simply put low cast is a rogue streaming service violating the copyright laws for commercial gain, nothing more. Low cast claim to be a non-profit that is not operating for any direct or indirect commercial advantage is absurd. That operates for the clear commercial benefit of the corporations that support it.I commented earlier on the importance to the company of our Fox Network and our owned and affiliated station group. We are confident in the merit of our claim against low cast. The low cast theft is, of course, a validation of the irreplaceable value of our brands and the content that they carry.Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results. -- Thanks Lachlan, and good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth with this financial momentum and setting us up very well for fiscal 2020.Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year, as well as the fourth quarter along with providing some financial markets for the future. Our full year results. So total revenues grew 12% to $11.4 billion. Our revenue growth was broad-based with affiliate revenues increasing 12% led by retransmission revenue growth at the Television segment. Advertising revenue was up 10% on the back of our inaugural season of Thursday Night Football, which added five percentage points of advertising revenue growth coupled with the record year political advertising at our television stations. Within this advertising revenue growth, we are also encouraged with our digital progress. Digital advertising representing close to $500 million or 10% of total company advertising revenues.Finally, we delivered strong growth in content revenue, which we record as part of our other revenue line supported by the digital licensing of network entertainment programming. Total full-year segment EBITDA was $2.7 billion, an increase of 8% from last year reflecting 8% growth at the Cable segment and 24% growth at the Television segment.At this point, It is worth remembering that when looking at our full-year fiscal 2018 numbers, as well as the first three quarters of our fiscal 2019 results that these results have been prepared on a so-called carve out basis. As such, they include allocations of 21st Century Fox overhead and shared service costs in accordance with SEC guidance, which is we have said in the past and the state the costs required to support Fox as a stand-alone business.We estimate that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts formula likely allocated to our published financial statements should range between $225 and $250 million on an annual basis. Illustratively if we took 75% of these incremental costs into account that would have reduced our fiscal 2019 EBITDA by approximately $180 million.Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.6 billion this year or $2.57 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.63 versus $2.50 last year. Again, both these absolute values in the year-on-year comparison are influenced by the differences in allocated shared services and overhead costs.Turning to the fourth quarter, total company reported revenues were $2.5 billion, up 5% over last year reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $709 million, an 11% increase over the $640 million generated a year ago, led by higher contributions from the Television and Cable segments.This growth was partially offset by high corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which now will properly reflect the full cost of operating as a stand-alone public company. From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $450 million or $0.73 a share was lower than the $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EPS of $0.62 was down 7% over the last year.These reductions principally reflect increased interest and income tax expenses from our operating as a stand-alone public company. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a touch above the more normalized mid 20% range. We expect to have going forward.So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Well Cable Networks EBITDA of $602 million was up 4% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by affiliate fee growth of 3% supported by higher average rates across all our brands, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Ad revenues decreased slightly by 1% reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year.The ad revenue decrease at the National Sports Networks was partially offset by the continued strength of Fox News led by digital and advertising. -- Are on track to launch the FOX BET product in the upcoming football season, or I should say, before the upcoming football season and we see the opportunity and sports wagering as a long-term value contributor to FoxEarlier this week we announced the entry into a definitive agreement to the proposed acquisition of 67% of credible, a leading direct to consumer personal finance marketplace in the United States at a price that we believe is full fair and attractive on all relevant metrics including our commitment to provide up to $75 million growth capital over the next few years.The merger resulted from extensive discussions and negotiations with the special committee of independent directors credible Board which has unanimously recommended the transaction, through this prudent and disciplined investment. We will, access an adjacency to our numerous national and local news audiences and tap into a high growth market.Just like our investment in the Stars Group for our FOX BET offering through FOX Sports the credible marketplace it's comfortably adjacent to enhances our core Fox digital properties specifically those of Fox News media and our local television stations upon the approval of the credible deal, you will see us activate the credible marketplace across Fox Business.com which we will be refreshing later this year and across the fast growing digital footprint of our Fox TV stations, over time we expect to activate the marketplace across our wider digital network we believe that given credible access to our highly engaged digital audience will accelerate the company's growth.It's also important to note that we plan to ensure that credible can continue to operate under its founder [Indecipherable] enabling it to continue to pursue the widest growth opportunity in the personal finance marketplace category.From an operational standpoint we're entering fiscal 2020 with great momentum. The Fox News Channel dominates the cable news landscape parking 17 consecutive years as the number one cable news network and maintaining its position as the number one cable network in both prime time and total day viewing this past year.FOX SPORTS led the industry in fiscal 2019 in the consumption of live sports events measured by minutes viewed meeting second best CBS [Phonetic] by 10%, ESPN by 13% and beating the combined viewing of [Indecipherable] and NBC. With Thursday night and Sunday afternoon broadcast of the NFL. We are football's most significant broadcast partner.We have a great schedule for the upcoming season and we're confident we can build on last year's solid ratings growth. our FOX Television Stations will continue their multi-year expansion of local news coverage and will collectively produced nearly 1,000 hours a week of news this focus on local programing has led the station group to become number one in the locally Programmed and highly profitable daytime daypart in our owned and operated marketswe're also looking forward to the addition of 50 weeks of WWE smack down starting on October 4 a reinvigorated entertainment schedule built around the return of two seasons of the math Singer our own the fall sports lineup across the network and our sports channels and of course the broadcast of Super Bowl 54 on Fox.In support of our growth and as we noted during our Investor Day, we will continue to invest in our platforms in fiscal 2020, as we plan to deploy approximately 250 million of EBITDA to the launch of the WWE the Fox entertainment programming initiatives and to our digital properties, most notably at Fox News and FOX Business.We are confident that these investments will serve to drive future growth. And value in the long term. We are excited by the growth trajectory that we have set for our businesses and are pleased with the progress we are making.We believe that Fox is uniquely positioned to harness the opportunities created by this changing industry with a dynamic portfolio of leadership brands and compelling content that audiences are most-passionate about.But before I turn it over to Steve, let me comment on the legal claim that we, along with the other broadcast networks filed against low caste last week simply put low cast is a rogue streaming service violating the copyright laws for commercial gain nothing more low cash claim to be a non-profit that is not operating for any direct or indirect commercial advantage is absurd.That operates for the clear commercial benefit of the corporations that support it. I commented earlier on the importance to the company of our Fox Network and our owned and affiliated station group. We are confident in the merits of our claim against low caste.The low caste theft is of course a validation of the irreplaceable value of our brands. And the content that they carry now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results . -- Thanks Lachlan, and good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company as Lachlan mentioned we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth with this financial momentum, setting us up very well for fiscal 2020 let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year, as well as the fourth quarter along with providing some financial markets for the future.Our full year results. So total revenues grew 12% to $11.4 billion. Our revenue growth was broad based with affiliate revenues increasing 12% led by retransmission revenue growth at the Television segment advertising revenue was up 10% on the back of our inaugural season of Thursday Night Football, which added 5% points of advertising revenue growth coupled with the record year political advertising at our television stations within this advertising revenue growth. We are also encouraged with our digital progress digital advertising representing close to $500 million or 10% of total company advertising revenues.Finally, we delivered strong growth in content revenue which we record as part of our other revenue line supported by the digital licensing of network entertainment programming, total full year segment EBITDA was $2.7 billion, an increase of 8% from last year, reflecting a 8% growth at the Cable segment in 24% growth at the Television segment.At this point, It is worth remembering that when looking at our full-year fiscal 2018 numbers as well as the first three quarters of our fiscal 2019 results that these results have been prepared on a so-called carve out basis. As such, they include allocations of 21st Century Fox overhead and shared service costs in accordance with SEC guidance, which as we have said in the past and the state the costs required to support Fox is a stand-alone basis.We estimate that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts formula likely allocated to our published financial statements should range between $225 and $250 million on an annual basis. Illustratively if we took 75% of these incremental costs into account that would have reduced our fiscal 2019 EBITDA by approximately $180 million.Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.6 billion this year or $2.57 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.63 versus $2.50 last year. Again, both these absolute values in the year-on-year comparison are influenced by the differences in allocated shared services and overhead costs.Turning to the fourth quarter, total company reported revenues were $2.5 billion, up 5% over last year, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $709 million, an 11% increase over the $640 million generated a year ago, led by higher contributions from the Television in cable segments.This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses, reported in the Other segment, which Namal [Phonetic] properly reflect the full cost of operating as a stand-alone public company. From a bottom line perspective, Net income attributable to stockholders of $450 million or $0.73 a share was lower than the $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EPS of $0.62 was down 7% over the last year.These reductions principally reflect increased interest and income tax expenses from our operating as a stand-alone public company. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a touch above the more normalized mid 20% range. We expect to have going forward. So. Now turning to the performance of our operating segments.For the quarter. We're cable networks. EBITDA of $602 million was up 4% on revenue growth of 2% the revenue increase was led by affiliate fee growth of 3% supported by higher average rates across all our brands, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers ad revenues decreased slightly by 1% reflecting lower contributions from the women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year.The ad revenue decrease at the national sports networks was partially offset by the continued strength of Fox News led by digital and advertising growth. EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a stable cost base as digital investments at Fox News were offset by lower sports rights expenses related to the FIFA World Cup and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter. At the Television segment EBITDA was $214 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting revenue growth of 5% and expense declines of 4%.The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in affiliate revenue growth, which in turn was driven by programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we expect to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. In line with our expectations, advertising revenues in the quarter were down by 8% reflecting difficult comparisons to the quarter a year ago, which included political revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections, and more FIFA World Cup matches.When doing the segment as a whole, the advertising revenue decline was substantially offset by increased digital content licensing revenues. The decrease in expenses reflects lower sports rights resulting from fewer FIFA World Cup matches in NASCAR races in the quarter, as well as lower entertainment programming costs due to fewer hours of original programming in the current quarter.The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $800 million in this quarter and $2.3 billion for the year, representing a 115% and 85% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow respectively.And finally, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt.Looking ahead into fiscal 2020. There are few key items I would draw your attention to, many of which we had previously outlined at our Investor Day. Firstly, Lachlan has already outlined the targeted set of initiatives that will impact EBITDA in fiscal 2020. In addition, it is also worth remembering the changes in our major broadcast events that will affect year-on-year comparability. The single largest being our broadcast of Super Bowl 54 in February, which from a year-over-year EBITDA perspective. We're largely being neutralized by the combined effects of other cyclical events such as an off-cycle political year, one less NFC divisional playoff game and the absence of the FIFA World Cup.As we look at the cadence of fiscal 2020, we would note that our Q2 P&L results this coming year will be impacted by higher sports expenses of the network reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL and college football contracts, and the addition of WWE rights, as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year.Looking across our group wide other revenue category, we expect to post solid revenue growth in our Cable and other segment supported by the increase in Fox Nation subscription revenues. The expansion of our pay-per-view boxing business, growth in content revenues and a full year of revenues associated with operating our L.A. Law [Phonetic].Meanwhile, these gains will be at least partially offset by reductions in other revenue in our Television segment. As we have previously disclosed, we expect shared services and corporate expenses reported in the other Other segment to increase significantly as we will be operating as a stand-alone public company for the full-year as compared to only one quarter in fiscal 2019.On a full-fiscal year basis, we expect the Other segment to be a net EBITDA cost in the mid to high $300 million range . This includes a little over $50 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the initial shareholder alignment plan award, which will temporarily impact our P&L in fiscal 2020 and 2021. From a cash flow standpoint, we expect very robust conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. Here, we expect very low working capital usage and cash tax savings of approximately $370 million resulting from the tax basis step up obtained as a result of the Fox Corp spin. While our capital expenditure will increase to fund the build of our new Broadcast Center in Phoenix .Before concluding I'd like to reiterate that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balancing between organic investment, strategic M&A and shareholder returns of capital. As part of this strategy, you will have seen that we just declared our second semi-annual dividend of $0.23 a share and continue to expect to have a share buyback authorization in place in advance of our annual shareholder meeting in November.And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe. -- Thanks, Steve. Now operator, we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community.Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We first turn to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Thank you. I'll ask one to John or Steve. -- That's easy. -- Okay, I'll feel awful. -- I can make him hard. -- Okay. I'll give you two then, I was trying to be kind. So the first question is, when you look at the cadence of affiliate fee growth, a cable, it decelerated from 13 to 11, to 4 to 3. And the questions people have new companies what drove that deceleration. And when you look ahead some new fiscal year, what's the cadence of 38% of the new deals coming due to maybe reaccelerate that growth. So that's one. Now Lachlan to you is, I get the benchmarks acquisition, but why is credible good fit for you, like what expertise you bring to it, that perhaps we're missing from the outside? -- Right. I'm not sure you'll start with Steve and then -- -- Yeah. So, Michael on cables, I think as we mentioned at the Investor Day, the way we see affiliate, we see it in the round. So the split between Cable and Television is less relevant to us because we negotiate all the contracts in one bulk Group. And so we would, we finished Q4 versus Q4 was a plus 7% growth rate across the whole estate. And so we would anticipate that sort of growth rate at that level or above into fiscal 2020. The reason why Cable has sort of reduced sequentially over the quarters through the fiscal year, it just comes to just lapping deal maturities. And so as we go into new deals, the focus obviously will be getting fair -- a greater share of fair value on our retrans, so you will see a disproportionate level of the forward growth still being with in the Television segment as opposed to the Cable segment. -- Great. And then on credible and I'm happy to talk about it. We as a management team are very excited, extraordinarily excited about the opportunity . The credible affords us. We look at it and I think we've talked about this at the Investor Day. And since our key assets is not -- our skill set necessarily in selling advertising or selling affiliate revenue. Although our teams are extraordinarily good at that, and those are businesses that as you've seen in these results are performing extraordinarily well. But really our key asset, our key resource is the deep engagement that we have in News and in Sport and Entertainment with our audiences. And as we grow our digital platforms out, we are seeing that engagement really importantly and critically extend from a linear and analogue environment to a direct digital environment, which affords us the ability to monetize that engagement in new models.So that really led us earlier this year to The Stars Group where we decided with Sports obviously entering the sports gaming market was a tremendous. We see as a huge long-term opportunity for us and the correlation between obviously the sports audience and this is should be obvious to most people between the sports audience and the sports betting audience is extraordinarily high correlation. And so you could say getting into the sports betting arena is a no-brainer. Well, it's equally a no-brainer with credible in the news category.Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We first turn to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Thank you. I'll ask 1 to Doe or Steve. -- Make them hard. -- Okay. I'll give you two then. So the first question is when you look at the cadence of affiliate fee growth, a cable, it decelerated from 13 to 11 to for us to my question. People have new company is what drove that deceleration. And when you look ahead some new fiscal year. What's the cadence of 38% of the new deals coming due to maybe we accelerate that growth. So that's one.Now Lachlan to you is I get the benchmarks acquisition but why it is wise credible in good stead for you, like what equities you bring to it. That perhaps we're missing from the outside. -- Right. [Indecipherable] answer you will start with us with Steve and then. -- Okay. Michael and I think as we mentioned at the Investor Day, the way we see affiliate. We see it in the round. So the split between cable and Television the is less relevant to us because we negotiate all the contracts in one bulk Group. And so we would, we finished Q4 versus Q4 was a plus 7% growth rate across the whole estate. And so we would anticipate that sort of growth rate at that level or above into fiscal 2020. The reason why cable has sort of reduced sequentially over the quarters through the fiscal year just comps to just lapping deal and maturities. And so as we go into new deals to focus obviously will be getting fair a greater share of fair value on our retrans, so you will see a disproportionate level of the forward growth still being with in the Television segment as opposed to the cable segment. -- Great. And then on incredible and happy to talk about it. We as a management team, are very excited extraordinarily excited about the opportunity . Incredible affords us, we look at it and I think we've talked about this at the Investor Day. And since our key assets is not our skill set necessarily in selling advertising selling affiliate revenue , although our teams are extraordinarily good at that, and those are businesses that as you've seen in these results are performing extraordinarily well. But really our key asset our key resource is the deep engagement that we have in News and in Sport and Entertainment with our audiences and as we grow our digital platforms out. We are seeing that that engagement really importantly and and critically extend from a linear and analog environment to a a direct digital environment which affords us the ability to monetize that engagement in new models.So that really led us earlier this year to The Stars Group where we decided with Sports obviously entering the sports gaming market was a tremendous we see is a huge our long-term opportunity for us and the correlation between obviously the sports audience and this is should be obvious to most people between the sports audience in the sports betting audience is an extraordinary high correlation. And so you could say getting into the sports betting arena is a no-brainer. While it's equally a no-brainer with credible in the news, our category, if you -- growth EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a stable cost base as digital investments at Fox News were offset by lower sports rights expenses related to the FIFA World Cup and the absence of UFC programing in the current year quarter. At the Television segment EBITDA was $214 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting revenue growth of 5% and expense declines of 4%.The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in affiliate revenue growth, which in turn was driven by programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates this growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we expect to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022.

For the full year as compared to only one quarter in fiscal 2019.On a full fiscal year basis, we expect the Other segment to be a net EBITDA cost in the mid to high $300 million range . This includes a little over $50 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the initial shareholder alignment plan award, which will temporarily impact our P&L in fiscal 2020 and 2021, from a cash flow standpoint, we expect very robust conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow here, we expect very low working capital usage and cash tax savings of approximately $370 million resulting from the tax basis step up obtained as a result of the Fox Corp spin, while our capital expenditure will increase to fund the build of our new Broadcast Center in Phoenix .Before concluding I'd like to reiterate that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balancing between organic investment strategic M&A and shareholder returns of capital as part of this strategy, you will have seen that we just declared our second semi-annual dividend of $0.23 a share and continue to expect to have a share buyback authorization in place in advance of our annual shareholder meeting in November.And with that I'll turn the call back to Joe. -- Thanks, Steve. Now, operator, we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community. -- look, and we've done a huge amount of research and due diligence on this over the last couple of months. If you look at our news audience and I'm not just talking on our cable news, but importantly the nearly 1,000 hours of local news that we produce each week. If you look at that audience it correlates incredibly highly with credibles target audience for their financial marketplace. Our audience and news, which is natural, our skews are slightly older, it skews toward homeowners and it skews toward an educated audience. And these are all factors that people are searching for mortgages in particular and refinancing loans, skew heavily toward. And so when we saw credible and we can see that by combining their service with our audience and our digital platforms, first with Fox Business and then later through our other news platforms. We see a tremendous opportunity for it going forward. Next question.Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Hello. Lachlan, I wanted to come back to the comment you made around digital advertising at $500 million growing healthily, can you give us a little more color on what is that business, how much of it maybe video versus display, how sustainable you see that growth rate being especially as you head into what will be a political and elevated political year next year because obviously that helps sort of insulate the overall ad business to grow across the company. And I just wanted to ask if you had any update for us on the process in evaluating the buyback plans. As you know, that's a big focus for investors, particularly in the back of some of the acquisitions you've announced? -- On the digital advertising front, we're very pleased with its growth. We think we can aggressively push it even further. If you look at that, it's over 200 million unique users of our digital products, and as I mentioned sort of 10 billion views. If I take for instance just at foxnews.com, we are now often doing over 100 million page views per day. I mean, yesterday we did 90 million page views in a day, which was a slow day for us then. But we certainly think we can monetize those pages, we've built out the sites and the content more aggressively and faster than we've built out our monetization of those views. So we expect to push in further. -- And then just to pick up on that it's a pretty good spread where we get our digital advertising revenue from across Fox News on the entertainment side of things, both directly and by Hulu digital video views as well as FX go. So it's a good spread from where we get it from, but we think that sort of the front of the tip of the spear in terms of growth continue to be Fox News going forward. -- And Ben, it's John. On the question on the buyback, as we said at the Investor Day, the independents are spending time with their advisors. We expect as we did then that there will be a conclusion, and an announcement around the buyback framework just around the time of our Annual General Meeting, there has been no change to that timetable. -- Operator, can we go to the next question.Next, we turn to the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- So, on advertising. Lachlan very helpful to get that color on how you did in the upfront, it's it so strong. What are the drivers besides lack of ratings in the industry in general. And can you talk a little bit about how you're selling differently with everything under Marianne's umbrella, is everything cross platform now. And then on the gaming, can you give us some color, fact just to consider and how this will ramp, is it all dependent on state by state legislation, what else will drive it, how quickly can you ramp? Thank you. -- Thank you, Jessica. So on advertising, like we estimate this is the strongest advertising upfront in 17 years. So it's an extraordinarily robust result we've had certainly in both pricing and in volume, pleasingly the scatter market since the upfront has been even stronger. And we are in scatter doing double digits pricing premiums to what we sold in the upfront, so which means if you do the math, we're in the low 20s pricing in scatter over last year. So, and this is driven really across categories. So it's not one category that's driving it. We're seeing obviously the streaming platforms, we'll start to take their advertising digital platforms, pharmaceutical continues to be strong. They had a short pause as they work out some regulatory demands around the advertising, so they weren't initially -- they were slow in the upfront and then came back in strong and they're particularly strong in scatter now pharmaceutical, finance has been strong. And even now locally and this goes, partially to your second question on a state by state basis in a couple of our local stations are notably, New York and Philadelphia we are seeing some of this gaming, our revenue begin to appear in a fairly significant way.So we think from a gaming point of view as more states legalize online gambling that we have a tremendous revenue stream to us outside of the TSG partnership, but just from a local advertising point of view. Also obviously, and the Super Bowl, we'll start to sell the Super Bowl and we're very pleased with the Super Bowl, both in our pricing point of view in terms of where we are versus our last Super Bowl a few years ago. Then, your second question, I guess it was on gaming and the TSG partnership, Steve do you want to --? -- I think the ramp of it Jessica really dependent on the state by state legislation and having that open up and liberalized. And so that really drives the actual sort of operationalization of that within the joint venture in terms of opening up that state access. But in the meantime, we obviously have a partnership with brand royalty, all the rest of will have a modest positive impact on our P&L through the course of this year. -- I should say one of the things we're going to do is, as mentioned before the football season begins. We'll be launching a national free to play game which is legal across the country in every state, but certainly will help to put the brand out there and to begin to establish the business. -- Can we go to the next question please.And next, we turn to the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Thanks so much. Steve, you mentioned very robust free cash flow and you also mentioned 85% conversion for the full-year last year. Should we take that 85% to be consistent with very robust? And Lachlan, John, Fox Nation has come up a few times on this call and I think it was mentioned that growth in subscriptions was a driver, any context you can give us around sort of size and scale that business where you think you can get it to and as subscription subscribers is that the right metrics we should be looking at? -- Thanks, Doug. So on free cash flow, I think 85% probably a bit choppy from what we expect to convert this, the current fiscal year we're in. And the thing that will be a bit of a drag versus where we've been over the last quarter has been essentially the build out of the Phoenix Broadcast Center, which I think I said at the Investor Day, we expect capex to be sort of low to mid single-digits of revenue and this will put us at the sort of the higher end of that. -- Our Fox Nation is performing really very well, it is still early days, having launched only this past November. But as a subscription video-on-demand service, certainly subscription is the first part of that name and so it's clearly a metric subscribers that we are watching closely. We haven't really spent any external marketing dollars on it and the assumption that we will spend an appropriate amount of external marketing is within the EBITDA investment that Steve has spoken about earlier and that will begin in the fall. The pleasing thing is, is that the conversion rate to trial less [Phonetic] to paid subscribers is extraordinarily high. And if we can maintain that conversion rate widening the funnel of trial less in the fall, it will be extremely successful business. -- Thank you. Can we go to the next line.And next, we turn to the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. PleaseLook, and we've done a huge amount of our research and due diligence on this over the last couple of months. If you look at our news audience and I'm not just talking I'm cable news, but importantly the nearly 1,000 hours of local news that we produce each week. If you look at that audience it correlates incredibly highly with credibles target audience for their financial marketplace. Our audience and news, which is natural our skews are slightly older it skews toward homeowners and skews toward an educated audience and these are all factors that people are searching for mortgages in particular and refinancing loans skew heavily toward. And so when we saw credible and we can see that by combining their service with our audience and our digital platforms first with Fox Business and then later through our other news platforms we see a tremendous opportunity for it going forward. Next question.Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Hello. Lachlan. I wanted to come back to the comment you made around digital advertising at $500 million growing healthily, can you give us a little more color on what is that business, how much of it will be video versus display how sustainable you see that growth rate being especially as you head into what will be a political and elevated political year next year because obviously that helps sort of insulate the overall ad business to grow across the company and I just wanted to ask if you had any update for us on the process in evaluating the buyback plans. As you know, that's a big focus for investors, particularly in the back of some of the acquisitions you've announced? -- On the digital advertising front, we're very pleased with its growth. We think we can aggressively push it even further. If you look at that, it's over 200 million unique users of our digital products. And as I mentioned sort of 10 billion views. If I take for instance just at foxnews.com. We are now often doing over 100 million page views per day. I mean, yesterday we did 90 million page views in a day, which was a slow day for us then, but we certainly think we can monetize those pages, we've built out the sites and the content more aggressively and faster than we've built out our monetization of those views. So we expect to push further.And then just to pick up on that it's a pretty good spread where we get our digital advertising revenue from across Fox News on the entertainment side of things, both directly and by Hulu digital video views as well as FX. So it's a good spread from where we get it from, but we think that sort of the front of the tip of the spear in terms of growth continue to be Fox News going forward. -- And then as John on the question on the buyback, the, as we said at the Investor Day, the independents are spending time with their advisors. We expect as we did then that there'll be a conclusion, and an announcement around the buyback framework just around the time of our Annual General Meeting, there has been no change to that time period.Operator, can we go to the next question.Next, we turn to the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- So, on advertising. Lachlan very helpful to get that color on how you did in the upfront it so strong. What are the drivers besides lack of ratings in the industry in general. Can you talk a little bit of a how you're selling differently with everything on [Indecipherable] umbrella as everything cross platform now. And then on the gaming can you give us some color factors to consider. And how this will ramp is it all dependent on state by state legislation. What else will drive it, how quickly can you ramp? Thank you.Thank you, Jessica. So on advertising, we estimate this is the strongest advertising upfront in 17 years. So it's an extraordinarily robust result we've had certainly in both pricing and in volume. Pleasingly the scatter market since the upfront has been even stronger. And we are in scatter doing double digits pricing premiums to what we sold in the upfront, so which means if you do the math, we're in the low '20s pricing in scatter over last year. So, and this is driven really across categories. So it's not one category that's driving it and driving it. We're seeing obviously the streaming platforms we're start to take their at advertising digital platforms, pharmaceutical continues to be strong. They had a short pause as they work out some regulatory demands around the advertising so they weren't initially there were slow in the upfront and then came back and strong and the particularly strong then scatter now pharmaceutical finance has been strong and even now locally and this goes, partially to your second question on a state by state basis in a couple of our local stations are notably, New York and Philadelphia.We are seeing some of the gaming our revenue begin to begin to appear in a fairly significant way. So we think from a gaming point of view as more states legalize online gambling that we have a tremendous revenue stream to us. Outside of the TSG partnership, but just from a local advertising point of view. Also obviously, and the Super Bowl we start to sell the Super Bowl and we're very pleased with the Super Bowl, both in our pricing point of view in terms of where we are versus our last Super Bowl a few years ago. Then, your second question, guess it was on was on gaming and the TSG partnership Steve? -- I think the ramp of Jessica really dependent on the state by state legislation and having that open Apple liberalized and so that really drives the actual sort of operationalization of that within the joint venture. In terms of opening up that state access but in the meantime, we obviously have a partnership with brand royalty, all the rest of will have a modest positive impact on our P&L through the course of this year.I should say one of the things we're going to do is, as mentioned before of the football season begins . We'll be launching a national free to play game which is legal across the country, in every state, but certainly will help to to put the brand out there and to begin to establish the business. Can we go to the next question please.And next, we turn to the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Thanks so much. You, Steve, you mentioned very robust free cash flow and you also mentioned 85% conversion for the full year last year. Should we take that 85% to be consistent with very robust and then Lachlan, John Fox Nation has come up a few times on this call and I think it was mentioned that growth in subscriptions was a driver, any context, you can give us around sort of size and scale that business where you think you can get it to and subscription subscribers is that the right metrics we should be looking at?Thanks, Doug. Some free cash flow. And I think 85%, probably a bit choppy from what we expect to convert this, the current fiscal year we're in. And the thing that will be a bit of a drag versus where we've been over the last quarter has been essentially the build out of the Phoenix Broadcast Centre, which I think I said at the Investor Day we expect capex to be sort of low to mid single digits of revenue and this will put us at the sort of the higher end of that. -- On Fox Nation Fox Nation is performing really very well, it is still early days, having launched only this past November. But as a subscription video on demand service certainly subscription is the first part of that name and. And so, it's clearly a metric subscribers that we are watching closely. We haven't really spent any external marketing dollars on it and the assumption that we will spend an appropriate amount of external marketing is within the EBITDA investment at the Steve has spoken about our earlier and that will begin in the fall with the pleasing thing is, is that the conversion rate to try less to paid subscribers is extraordinarily high and and if we can maintain that conversion rate widening the funnel of trial in the fall. It will be extremely successful business. Thank you. Can we go to the next line.And next, we turn to the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. -- Thanks, I have two questions. Lachlan you brought up low cast. So I just want to ask you, can you walk us through the timeline. Now that this is filed. What's next? And then, I understand the permanent injunction was requested not a temporary one, I was just curious as to why that was?And then second, for Steve with your capital allocation policy. Is there a certain percent of free cash flow that you're sort of setting aside each year specifically allocated to M&A or is what you're investing in truly just opportunistic as things come up? Thanks. -- Thank you very much, Marci. And I'll turn it over to Steve for your second question. On low cast. I am -- I fleshed out as much as I could. What I can say in my kind of prepared comments and I hope I was punchy enough as I tried to be. But on legal advice and seeing at this case is now sort of before the courts, I'm better off not to add anything to those comments. Steve? -- And Marcy just on capital allocation. We're going to stay flexible. We will be balanced, but we're not going to have a strict percentage of free cash flow that's dedicated to M&A. We'll be looking at, we'll assess opportunities across organic M&A and also best use of capital in terms of returning an amount to shareholders and sort of review that periodically better the notion that we would dedicate the X percent of our free cash flow, it's not the way we'd operate. -- Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question.Thank you, sir. And our final question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Thank you so much. Lachlan, if you could maybe talk generally about the soft ratings that we've seen in the news network business, really the last couple of months, not just obviously Fox but just across the industry, what you attribute it to is it news fatigue? And I guess how quickly do you think it can turnaround. And then on the subscriber side . I'm sorry if I missed it, but if you gave a sub decline number and maybe a little color and how different these negotiations are, now that you don't have the RSMs[Phonetic]. -- I'll answer the last part first, which is the easier. But starting from the beginning, new ratings are softer when you compare them year-on-year. Historically, though, I think they are still incredibly high. We are an extraordinary new cycle. And so Fox News has lost less ratings or the less audience are relative to our competitors. And so we continue to be obviously number one and expect to continue that run for quite some time.I do think though there probably is some news fatigue, but you also remember this time last year we were also in an extraordinary new cycle. We are incredibly pleased that the hard work of the people at Fox News has continued to keep not only their prime time lineup. But their all day, our ratings in the position that they are, even despite having some talent shake up. So we are really pleased with the performance of Fox News.In terms of our sub declines. Overall, we're seeing about a 1% subject aggregate, subject clients, so that includes our kind of growing sort of smaller networks such as Fox Sports 2 and BTN. So we're down in aggregate numbers of subscribers, just about 1%. But if we at the market and we have to sort of make estimates. If we look at our subscriber universe inclusive of the growth of the digital MVPDs, we think the market is down around close to 3%. -- At this point, we're out of time. Thank you everybody for joining today's call. If you have any further questions, please give Dan Carey or me a call. Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect. go ahead.Thanks, I have two questions. Lachlan you brought up low cast. So I just want to ask you, can you walk us through the timeline. Now that this is filed. What's next.

I'm sorry if I missed it, but if you gave us some decline number and maybe a little color and how different these negotiations are now they going to be [Indecipherable]. -- I'll answer the last part first, which is the easier but but the limited but starting from the beginning. New news ratings are software when you compare them year-on-year. Historically, though, I think they are still incredibly high we are and extraordinary new cycle and so Fox News has lost less ratings are less audience our relative to our competitors. And so we continue to be obviously number one and and expect to continue that run for quite some time.
