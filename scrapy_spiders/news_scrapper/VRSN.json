One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $210.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.40.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $210.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $198.60 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $216.48/share today.\n\nBecause the $210.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.43% return on the cash commitment, or 8.26% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $210.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $220.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.85.  If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $216.48/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $220.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.49% if the stock gets called away at the September 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing VRSN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $220.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $220.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.86% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.43% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 24%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 23%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $216.48) to be 20%.

Buffett and his team focus on high-quality,  that can be purchased at reasonable-to-cheap prices, with the goal of holding for the long term.With so many securities, a few high-quality names in the Buffett portfolio are likely to be out of favor for one reason or another at any given time, setting up a compelling entry point for Foolish long-term investors. Here are three Buffett picks that look quite enticing at the current moment.Image source: The Motley Fool.The stock of   is well-known to many, but it's relatively new to the Berkshire portfolio. The stock was bought by one of Buffett's two younger lieutenants in the first quarter of 2019 and was subsequently increased in Q2.While Amazon isn't typically thought of as a Buffett-esque , Amazon does have deep competitive advantages in not one but virtually every one of its business lines. This includes dominant, leading market share in both e-commerce and cloud infrastructure-as-a-service, two high-growth sectors of the economy. E-commerce has also been bolstered by the company's Prime subscription program, which surpassed the 100-million subscription mark in January.With the backing of its massive consumer platform, Amazon is now expanding into new areas such as online advertising, which is estimated to exceed $11 billion in revenue this year;\u00a0shipping services, which puts it squarely in competition with giants   and  ; and healthcare, a huge market that could very well be transformed by the \"Amazon touch.\"Nevertheless, Amazon has actually underperformed many large-cap tech peers this year: data by This may be due to a number of reasons, including Amazon's outperformance in the years prior to 2019, concerns over  coming from Washington, and the recent  with the Department of Defense to .Nevertheless, I think these concerns may be overblown. Though Amazon has a leading share in e-commerce, it only generates around 4% of overall U.S. retail sales. In addition, the loss of the JEDI contract seems to fly in the face of Amazon having an unbeatable monopoly in the cloud space.On the plus side, the company's recent investment in  should accelerate core e-commerce revenue over the next year, while the cloud opportunity remains a long-term, high-margin growth driver. Basically, Amazon's 2019 may be a mere cooling off from several years of stock outperformance.Over the long term, I'd expect Amazon's wide moats, excellent management under CEO Jeff Bezos, and  to benefit patient shareholders. As such, any time the stock lags over a period of quarters or years, it's probably a good idea to scoop up some shares.Beleaguered bank   has actually been in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio since 1989-1990, when  after the .\u00a0While it has been a huge winner for Buffett over the long term, Wells Fargo ran into \u00a0-- trouble that continues to this day.In 2016, a series of customer abuses were uncovered. The first involved Wells employees opening customer accounts without permission, in order to hit the company's aggressive cross-selling incentives. In July 2017, the bank's internal investigation found it had falsely charged some 570,000 auto loan customers for failing to maintain car insurance. Then in mid-2018, a software glitch was discovered at the bank, which may have caused up to 545 erroneous foreclosures going back to 2010.\u00a0\u00a0These abuses led to the Federal Reserve implementing an asset cap on the bank in early 2018, essentially preventing Wells from growing over its $2 trillion in assets. They also led to the firing of not one, but two CEOs.Yet entering 2020, Wells may be on the brink of getting past these reputation-damaging scandals. On Sept. 27, the company hired Charles Scharf as its new, permanent CEO, recruiting him away from , four months after former CEO Tim Sloan resigned. That fills a leadership gap that added to uncertainty around the bank.Second, it's possible Wells' asset cap could be lifted in the near future. Former CEO Tim Sloan had originally thought the asset cap would be lifted in the first half of 2019, only to postpone that timeline earlier this year.Wells Fargo now has a new CEO and has spent two years in the penalty box, so the Federal Reserve could find its way to lifting the cap in 2020 -- though admittedly, there are no guarantees on this. Yet Wells has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.6 and a dividend yield at a robust 3.8%, so now may be a great time for investors to give the bank a fresh look.Finally, another stock chosen by one of the younger Berkshire stock pickers is  . The company is a unique mix of tech stock and utility, as it's the exclusive registry for the\u00a0\u00a0and \u00a0top-level domains (TLDs), as well as the ,\u00a0,\u00a0, and\u00a0\u00a0TLDs. If you have a website under any of these TLDs, you're likely paying Verisign a regular annual subscription fee of either $7.85 for  or $9.20 for . Verisign almost acts like a government entity, since it's a near monopoly that provides a key societal function. However, Verisign is allowed to operate as a private company under the authority of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is a non-profit consortium of governments, corporations, and individuals that regulate the core functions of the internet.Verisign has been keeping the internet up and humming since it acquired Network Solutions back in 2000. Since the company has performed such an important function for decades, it would be risky for ICANN not to renew its current agreement with Verisign, which runs through 2024.So why is Verisign so compelling now? Thanks to a 2016 amendment to the agreement with ICANN, Verisign will have the right to increase prices on the  name by 7% per year for the next four years, beginning in October 2020. \u00a0For context, Verisign hasn't raised prices on . since 2012, and . makes up a majority of its revenue, so this is a pretty big deal. Despite flat  pricing, Verisign has still been able to increase margins over the past few years, since the domain name base continues to grow in the low-to-mid-single digits, and Verisign has kept costs flat. Therefore, each 7% price increase could go straight to Verisign's bottom line, if and when it happens.While the stock is by no means cheap at 35 times earnings, this baked-in profit growth and wide-moat business model makes Verisign a great defensive play heading into 2020.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $170 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.35.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.6% return against the $170 commitment, or a 4.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to VRSN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $170 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Verisign Inc sees its shares fall 13.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $165.65 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.35 from $170), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.4% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $170 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $170 strike for the 4.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

These companies all have wide-moat, dominant businesses and benefit from the steady growth of the internet and digital businesses worldwide.The same can be said of another tech company you might not have heard of:  . Verisign isn't as well known as the big internet FANG platforms; however, there's no disputing the company's stock price performance over the past five years. It's , while the   QQQ ETF, which tracks the broader tech sector, is up \"only\" 130% in that time. data by .So, what's the secret of Verisign's success?Verisign is the exclusive registry for the  and . top-level domains (TLDs) for the entire internet, as well as the less-used , , , and  TLDs. Verisign also operates 2 of the 13 international root zone servers, which house this authoritative data, forming the backbone of the internet.You might think this function would be handled by a government agency, but it's not -- well, not entirely. Verisign performs these functions as a private, for-profit company under the authority of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN itself is a nonprofit, public-private partnership that runs the internet domain name system (DNS) worldwide. ICAAN's participants include a large number of governments, corporations, and individuals, which collectively believe that certain internet functions should be run as a private enterprise. Verisign used to operate under an agreement with the United States government, but ICANN took over those functions in 2016.Image source: Getty Images.Verisign's long-term contract with ICANN has presumptive rights of renewal, and the company recently inked an eight-year renewal in 2016 to run the . name until 2024 and  until 2023. Thus, Verisign operates almost like a regulated utility, with a kind of global monopoly on the most popular domain names. Verisign's financials have historically been tied to the amount of growth in the . and . universe. In 2018, the combined growth of those names was about 4%, with revenue up 4% in lockstep.Verisign's price-to-earnings ratio sits at nearly 40, which some may find egregiously expensive for a company growing by only 4%. However, there are four very good reasons for Verisign's high multiple. Verisign's monopoly status implies a high degree of stability in revenue and earnings. Since the Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes in the first quarter, many \"safe\" stocks such as consumer staples and even restaurants have seen their multiples expand, even if their growth prospects aren't exactly stellar. In addition, the overall trend of the internet is still one of growth, and most businesses will likely still want a  or . address. Verisign has a highly scalable business model that doesn't incur many incremental costs. As the company grows domain name registrants on its stable infrastructure, excess revenue tends to fall to its bottom line. For instance, last year, Verisign's 4% revenue growth enabled 8% operating profit growth, and operating margins expanded from 60.7% to 63.2%.: Perhaps most importantly, Verisign amended its contract with ICANN just last October, allowing it to request price increases on the . domain name up to 7% in  of the last four years of its contract. That means the company could potentially increase prices on domain names 7% in 2021 and each year thereafter until 2024, which Verisign had not been able to do historically. Verisign has been able to raise prices by 10% on the  domain name in each of the last two years, though . is far smaller than .. You might think an international body would be resistant to allowing Verisign -- a U.S. for-profit company -- to raise prices, but ICANN actually voted to allow a 7% increase on  back in 2012. It was the U.S. government that vetoed it. Now that ICANN has more powers, the chances of accepted price increases are actually higher.  Verisign's management has done a great job of capital allocation, opportunistically returning cash to shareholders in the form of . While the company doesn't pay a dividend, management's ample buybacks have allowed it to lower its share count from over 140 million in 2015 to just 122.66 million shares at the end of last year, about a 14% decrease. That's allowed Verisign's stock to increase a bit more than it otherwise would have had those shares been distributed as dividends. data by .While the main risk surrounding Verisign is its contract renewal in 2024, it doesn't appear as if that is in any great danger. Verisign has operated the  DNS for 21 years with 100% stability, so unless something drastic happens, I don't see ICANN risking upsetting the apple cart. While Verisign's earnings yield is roughly the same as that of the , its earnings and cash flows seem almost assured to grow, and in a tax-efficient manner.Verisign is a rare stock that has outperformed many high-growth stocks while exhibiting the financial stability of a utility or consumer staple. While the multiple is a tad high today, I think it's justified, and the stock could be an appropriate pick for those looking for stability and tech exposure at the same time.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I\u2019m not sure when this was a reason for a market rally, but we\u2019re in one.This is when it\u2019s good to have perspective on where we are and how best to take advantage of these conditions.And that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking about VeriSign stock now. You see, VRSN has a virtual monopoly in domain name registry services. Whether it\u2019s a .com, .net, or .eu, almost half of the domain names registered are done so through VeriSign.As a result, this company is directly tied to the growth of the world wide web. And that moat, at this point, is enormous.What\u2019s more, because internet advertising is on the rise, the growth of websites is at historic highs. There are nearly . But of these, fewer than 200 million are active.And that disparity shows you the reason VRSN is doing so well.Usually, when a company launches a website it not only registers the name but similar names, misspelled names, various suffixes and the like. It then renews those names.In addition, many businesses register names for products or marketing campaigns. For example, drug companies usually set up websites for their new and existing drugs. And each of those likely have a number of similar names registered to send you to their site as well.This process of registering names continues apace today, and it will only grow as more business finds its way to the web.There\u2019s also the fact that many people are registering their own names simply to keep them out of the hands other people who may then use them for purposes that are less than noble.This trend continues to be reflected in VRSN stock\u2019s growth as well as its consistently strong earnings and revenue figures. Its first quarter was the most recent example. VeriSign beat expectations across the board. The company did trim its revenue projections for the next quarter but it\u2019s still near analysts\u2019 expectations.My Portfolio Grader gives VRSN stock an A rating.\u00a0is a renowned growth investor.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 3 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisign Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $155.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $190.00. The standard deviation is $17.559.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSN crossing above that average target price of $173.33/share, investors in VRSN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $173.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $155 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.90. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.8% return against the $155 commitment, or a 4.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $155 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisign Inc sees its shares decline 11.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $149.10 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $5.90 from $155), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $155 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $155 strike for the 4.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

(NASDAQ: VRSN)Q4 2018 Feb. 07, 2019 , Good day everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 . Today's conference is being recorded and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead sir. -- Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's fourth quarter and full year 2018  . With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.This call and our presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recen  s on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterwards we will open the call for your questions.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. -- Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 2018 was marked by strong financial performance during, which we generated revenues of $1,215 million, $661 million in free cash flow and 2018 full year non-GAAP operating margin of 67.5%.2018 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as the company processed 38.2 million registrations and finished the year with 153 million names. During the year, we marked more than 21 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. As we announced on November 1, last year VeriSign and the Department of Commerce entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement. The amendment among other things permits VeriSign without further approval of the DOC to engage with ICANN to change the .com Registry Agreement to increase wholesale prices for .com domain name registrations and renewals by up to 7% in each of the last four years of each six-year period.Amendment 35 also clarifies that the vertical integration restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement on VeriSign's ability to own an ICANN-accredited registrar apply only as to the .com TLD and not to other services offered by VeriSign. Additionally, Amendment 35 also removes certain unnecessary and burdensome regulations, so that any future renewal of the .com Registry Agreement can occur without DOC approval unless VeriSign were to seek changes to certain key provisions such as further changes to pricing. Any change to the Cooperative Agreement can only be made by mutual agreement of VeriSign and the DOC except that the DOC can terminate the Cooperative Agreement at any time with 120 days' notice prior to the expiration of the term.As another update, the company completed the sale of the Verisign Security Services customer contracts on December 5, 2018. These contracts are related primarily to our DDoS and Managed DNS customers. As discussed last quarter, the sale of these non-core customer contracts will enable us to focus solely on supporting our core mission ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure. Of course, the sale of these customer contracts will be a slight drag on revenue in 2019, but our continued organic revenue growth from our core domain name business is expected to offset this decrease.At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 153 million consisting of 139 million names for .com and 14 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.5%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.29 million names. Although, the renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017.Looking forward to 2019, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.25% and 4.25% for full year 2019. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.2 million shares of common stock for $175 million. During the full year 2018, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $600 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $603 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.Our financial position remains strong with $1.27 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases.And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. -- Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the company generated revenue of $1.215 billion, up 4.3% from 2017 and delivered GAAP operating income of $767 million, up 8.4% from $708 million in 2017. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $307 million, up 4% year-over-year and up by 5.5% sequentially. As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $194 million compared with $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.1% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter a year ago.Net income totaled $182 million compared to $103 million a year earlier, which produced dilutive earnings per share of $1.50 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.83 for the same quarter last year. In the quarter, we recorded a $54.8 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of Verisign Security Services customer contracts. This gain increased GAAP net income by $52 million and GAAP earnings per share by $0.43.As of December 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $504 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide our 2019 full year guidance.As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million compared to $96 million last quarter and $106 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 66.7% compared to 68.7% last quarter and 64.1% in the same quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter, our sales and marketing expense increased sequentially as we had additional spend on programs in the market.Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $191 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 121.3 million shares. This compares to $1.23 last quarter and $0.96 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts increased non-GAAP net income by $42.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.36 during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $219 million and free cash flow was $211 million, compared with $199 million and $190 million respectively for the fourth quarter last year.Now I'd like to provide our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 2.25% and 4.25%, being partially offset by the loss of our revenue associated with the sale of our Security Service customer contracts.Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5% and will continue to include certain non-material operating costs associated with providing transition services for Security Service customers. Our interest expense and non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consist primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by payments collected as part of the aforementioned Transition Services Agreement.Capital expenditures in 2019 are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $95 million and $115 million. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate solid financial performance in 2018 during the fourth quarter and for the full year.Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. -- Thank you, George. 2018 was another solid year for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues. We generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders. We entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, allowing VeriSign to engage with ICANN to amend the COM Agreement to increase the price for com domain name registrations and renewals without further approval from the Department of Commerce. We concluded the sale of our Security Services customer contracts, further increasing our focus and efforts to protect, grow and manage this unique business. The success in our core business benefits our customers employees and shareholders.We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And first we'll hear from Sterling Auty with J P Morgan. -- Yes, thanks. Hi guys. So, ICANN 35 certainly is beneficial for you guys. But given all the moving parts, can you just simply explain what is different? -- Sure Sterling. I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are that we're allowed to increase prices for .com. We have more flexibility on vertical integration for services that are not .com services and there is reduced regulatory burden for both VeriSign and the government.And I think your question is in practice what will be different for us VeriSign. So, I'll contrast a process before and after Amendment 35. But let me just -- let me start with what will not change. Every six years, we engage with ICANN on a .com Registry Agreement renewal for which there's a presumptive Right of Renewal. That is not changed and the next renewal of the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN will occur in November of 2024. Some parts of the agreement may be changed in that process through negotiation. However, I'd note that ICANN has not historically negotiated pricing with us deferring to DOC on pricing in prior renewals.That process -- that ICANN process is unchanged. Prior to pick up there, prior to Amendment 35, the process that followed that renewal with ICANN was that we would present the .com Registry Agreement as negotiated by us, VeriSign and ICANN to the DOC. DOC would then review it based on a two-pronged test of one, our performance on security and stability; and two, a review of whether we were \"providing registry services on reasonable prices terms and conditions.\" And a standard applied for these tests was called the public interest standard and then DOC's consent to the COM Registry Agreement renewal following this review was required. So, they have to consent to what we had done with ICANN.Amendment 35 founded in the public interest to allow the following. First one, for us to raise .com registration and renewal prices 7% in the back four years of each six-year period. Two, that the restriction on vertical integration was only intended to apply to .com. Three, that the review process is now streamlined such that any NTIA review any DOC review and consent is no longer required provided that the COM Registry Agreement has not changed pricing from what's now allowed, specifically, the 7% noted -- I noted a minute ago.Also that the performance specs or SLAs in the COM Registry Agreement that we have to perform to have not been changed and also that we've not changed the vertical integration restriction on COM and that we have not changed the renewal or termination terms of the COM Registry Agreement. And five, that there's been no changes to the WHOIS services. Given all of those then consent from the NTIA or DOC to the renewal of the COM Registry Agreement is not required if these terms are not changed. So, further in such a case and absent any VeriSign and DOC mutually agreed changes, the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew, again, without reviewing consent as is for another six-year term.So, one could see the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew again without reviewing consent as is for another six-year term. So one could see the Cooperative Agreement now as evergreen without further review, given the terms stay the same. NTIA has also a right to terminate the Cooperative Agreement on 120 days' notice before the end of the term.So there is one other change which is that VeriSign agrees to quote, continue to operate the .com registry in a content-neutral manner, which of course we've always done. So that's basically Amendment 35 and what will be different for us although of course parts of the Cooperative Agreement including earlier amendments that had to be modified or deleted to make Amendment 35 work were also changed. But essentially that's it. -- Great. Now that's very helpful. -- Long answer sorry about that but... -- That's OK. But two -- I know these calls are relatively short typically so I'm going to take the opportunity to ask a couple of questions to follow up on it. The first one is, so the Cooperative Agreement has changed, but I haven't seen any news. Do you have to go back and actually refresh or change the .com Registry Agreement to now incorporate the same pricing parameters that's there in Item 35? Or is that kind of already de facto happened because of what you did with Item 35? -- Well, historically and in this case as well there is a process for that. There's a process for moving changes from the DOC to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com Registry Agreement. ICANN has historically as I mentioned deferred to the US government on matters relating to com pricing. But ICANN and VeriSign have an agreement to cooperate and negotiate -- there's a written agreement to operate -- cooperate and negotiate in good faith to amend the com registry as may be necessary for consistency with changes to the Cooperative Agreement.So we have begun that process with ICANN to amend the agreement to make these changes including pricing. And I don't think I can comment further to process. We've been through it a few times. It may take a number of months to work through it, but we'll update you as appropriate. -- All right, great. And then on the vertical integration, the way that I read that if we look back through the history of Network Solutions to VeriSign to where you are today once upon a time you were both registry and registrar. This appears to open up the ability for you to be a registrar as long as it's not for .com. Is this indicating that you would be interested in entering and becoming a registrar again, perhaps for the .web? -- Well first of all it was -- as I mentioned earlier this is a clarification that, that restriction only applies to .com. So .web or any other services that we offer technically are no longer covered with this modification. How that language would apply to our business, how we would use it, how it stands today? I think is it's too early to say how that flexibility might be applied, if it's applied. But that clarification is now made and the vertical integration restriction only applies to .com.And you're right, we did have both when we acquired Network Solutions in June of 2000. And then I think it was in 2003 or early 2004 we sold off the registrar. But I think at that time the agreement read that VeriSign couldn't be vertically integrated. And I think at that time VeriSign and .com were entirely synonymous, so this clarifies that and it applies -- the restriction only applies to .com, and as I said, too early to say how or if we'll use that flexibility. -- All right, great. Let me turn it over. And I will hop back in queue. Thank you. -- I'm sorry. -- I was saying, thank you I will turn the call over to next question.And it looks like our last question will come from Rob Oliver with Baird.It looks like our last question will come from Rob Oliver with Baird. -- Thanks. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob tonight. Guys, is there any update on .web kind of what are the remaining steps there? I know that's a process. Could you kind of help us understand what the remaining steps would be there?And then secondly on .web, what type of factors are you using to evaluate potential pricing there and what that might look like, because I think we understand, it can be unlimited or I guess unrestricted and you can charge premium pricing like you've talked about in the past. So are there any examples of what you're using to evaluate what that premium pricing might look like? -- Thanks for the questions. So, first of all, the update that I can offer since we last spoke on -- on the process toward delegation of .web is that one of the losing bidders in the .web auction a company named Afilias who is one of our competitors has filed an arbitration against ICANN trying to continue to delay the process. We are not parties to that arbitration yet, but we are actively seeking to join and participate in it. About your question, about pricing and what we might do two parts to that answer.Number one is, yes .web is not a regulated TLD like .com is or even like .net is. It's a TLD that would be operating under the new form the new so-called New gTLD Registry Agreement. And those agreements do not limit pricing similar to our IDNs, which are also signed up to the same form of agreement. They only require a six month notice for any price change, but they provide complete pricing flexibility. As to what we would do, how we would do premium pricing, how we would price that .web, how we're thinking about it, I think it's very premature at this stage really to say anything.And it just occurs to me too that back to Sterling's second question, he asked about, how we would use vertical integration, just to be complete. That ICANN process of incorporating all the Amendment 35 changes into the .com Registry Agreement pricing et cetera also applies to these other changes the clarification of what vertical integration restriction actually exists et cetera, so all that is subject to completing this process with ICANN that I described earlier.And I apologize I'd like to tell you more about .web, but it's just premature to talk about what we would do or how we're thinking about that at this point. But your assumptions about the flexibility that .web would offer based on the agreement, it would operate under are correct. It would not be restricted and we'd have flexibility to price premiums or whichever way we chose. -- Okay. That's helpful color. And then on the -- the next one's kind of high level. But so the domain name base for growth for 2019 the 2.25% to 4.25%, what could you tell us about what geographies are North America or international. Not looking for specific numbers or anything, but what kind of pockets of strength are you expecting there or which parts might be more of a headwind? Anything just directionally, no specific numbers, but what markets kind of look like they might be driving that? -- Well, what I can tell you Matt is that in 2018 as we've been talking about all year, we've seen good growth from registrars in both the US registrars, in both registrars located over in the China market. So those at least in 2018 have been good markets for us for growth. As you talk about 2019, obviously we're a global business. We factor a lot of things going on into our range. But we still expect as you -- as we talked about the domain name base to grow between 2.25% up to 4.25%. So just exactly where that growth is, I mean we're not giving a specific guidance there but we do see that there's been a good growth this year and we're looking for growth in the range that we outlined in our guidance. -- Okay. Sounds good. Thanks guys. I'll turn it back over to SterlingAnd it looks like we will be taking our final questions a follow-up from Sterling with J P Morgan. -- Thanks. We can just do this as an open forum go back for it. Just couple more, wanted to ask, I get a number of questions actually on the cash taxes and the cash tax rate. So if I just do the simplistic in and look at the cash taxes here for 2019. How should we think about actually maybe I'll just leave it to you. How should we think about the cash tax rate both in 2019 and going forward? Is this structural and they can maintain this rate or should it elevate to some other level and what would be the driving factors to that? -- Yeah, thanks for that Sterling. So as you know in 2018, cash taxes were about $85 million and that translates to about 12% effective cash tax rate and that's compared to our GAAP taxes of about $147 million, which if you do that math that translated into an effective tax rate of about in the low-20% range.So for 2019 as you know we've guided cash taxes to be between $95 million to $115 million. And if you do that math that still would be below our GAAP effective tax rate. And that's the result because we're still using up some foreign tax credits and state NOLs. And while we don't provide a long-term cash tax rate, we do expect our cash tax effective rate to accrete closer up to our GAAP effective rate over the next few years as we fully utilize those remaining attributes. -- Excellent. And then the last one for me. You increased the share repurchase. I missed what you said. How much was left at the end of the quarter for repurchase before you went to the -- to $1 billion? And what was the thought in terms of the timing of now to expand, because a lot of people wonder if you would lever up again and maybe get even more aggressive on the repurchase front? -- So, before we went back for authorization, we were just under $400 million remaining under that program before we went to the board and had it reauthorized up to $1 billion. -- All right. Great. And then just that last part of it. Maybe an update on what your thought is around optimal capital structure the potential to maybe add debt and be a little bit more aggressive this year within that buyback. -- Yeah. As you know, Sterling we constantly review the needs of the business and we try to make our decisions that are in the best interest of the company. And as we've talked about many times that's a pretty active process we go through each quarter. Jim and I sit down and look at the specific needs. We don't have a specific leverage target that we manage to. We try to use our protect grow and manage framework to make sure that we're maintaining the optimal level of liquidity.At present, we're looking ahead to what investment opportunities we need to make the business grow and then we're thinking about what the appropriate return of capital is to shareholders. And so, I don't really have anything to report at this time. We continue to look at the marketplace and then what the needs of the business are and we'll continue to do that in a very active fashion. -- Yes and Sterling, Jim here. I would just add too that Amendment 35 was a significant event for us and in 2018 and it does afford us additional flexibility in a number of different areas and I think we've certainly talked about that enough. But just fully understanding it, and factoring it into our strategic thinking. I think is just something that we do need to consider. And so that's a process that's under way too. So, as George said there's just really nothing specific to say about at this point. -- All right. Sounds good. Thank you, guys. -- Thanks.And ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to David Atchley for any final remarks. -- Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call.

The company reported steady growth in revenue, driven by growth in domain name registrations and improved renewal rates compared to the previous year, a trend which we expect to continue into 2019. Further, its renewed .net agreement until 2023 should further aid growth in domain name registrations - as more companies rely on growing their businesses digitally. In addition, the Neustar agreement provides a decent medium-term opportunity for VeriSign. The deal should not only help the company streamline its operations and focus on its core business, but also present ample opportunity to invest in its internet naming and related services. This deal, coupled with the company's leading position in the highly regulated domain industry, should drive its value in the near term. However, we expect the sale of these customer contracts to slightly dampen its 2019 outlook. Below we take a look at what to expect from the company in 2019. We have a  , which is lower than its current market price. We are in the process of updating our model based on the Q4 results. View our interactive dashboard -  - and modify the key drivers such as revenue and margins to gauge the impact on the company's valuation.VeriSign controls the exclusive rights to the registry of .com and .net Internet domain names. The company's domain name registration grew by just under 5% in 2018 as a result of improved adoption of the internet and increased e-commerce activity. Further, the renewed .net Registry Agreement with ICANN makes VeriSign the sole registry operator for the .net registry through June 30, 2023, with a contractual right to increase pricing by 10% annually. Additionally, it also entered an agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce (  ), which allows VeriSign to agree with ICAAN to increase wholesale prices for .com domain names by up to 7% in each of the last four years of each six-year period of the .com Registry agreement. Consequently, the company is expected to witness a rise in its domain name registrations driven by a strong internet adoption rate, global economic growth, e-commerce activity, and registrar go-to-market strategies. Further, as more and more companies depend on digitally growing their business, we expect the pricing flexibility to provide a boost. In addition, its deal with NeuStar for the sale of its customer contracts related to its Security Services business should allow VeriSign to focus on its core business and reinvest the additional cash flows into its business. Owing to the above factors, we expect 4% revenue growth for full-year 2018 to $1.2 billion, driven by 3% growth in domain registrations and 1% growth in average price per domain.What's behind Trefis?

The company entered into a contract extension with the Commerce Department that will allow VeriSign the flexibility to negotiate price increases for dot-com domain name registrations of up to 7% annually in the last four years of each six-year contract. VeriSign will still have to pursue such price increases with the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, but the Commerce Department's new position represents a policy shift from previous agreements that essentially restricted the company from seeking to boost domain prices.

In the las  ed quarter, VeriSign's earnings of $1.23 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. The figure increased 23% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 4.6% year over year to $306 million and came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $305 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has remained steady at $1.21 in the past 30 days. Further, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $308.4 million, up roughly 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.VeriSign holds a significant position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains, per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). | Per \"Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement\" between VeriSign and the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), signed on Oct 26, 2018, the company can now pursue with ICANN a price increase of up to 7% for .com domain names, in each of the last four years of six-year period of the Registry Agreement. Amendment 35 also extended the expiration of the Cooperative Agreement to Nov 30, 2024.The amendment is beneficial for VeriSign. The company is expected to benefit from growing Internet consumption globally. For the fourth quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase 0.9-1.4 million.Notably, domain name registrations increased 2.6 million or 0.8% sequentially to 342.4 million across top-level domains (TLDs) in third-quarter 2018.However, growth rate slowed down in the third quarter. Notably, in the second quarter, domain name registrations increased 6 million or 1.8% sequentially. This sluggishness is likely to hurt VeriSign's top-line growth. Moreover, increase in marketing expenses is expected to keep margins under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

(NASDAQ: VRSN)Q3 2018 Oct. 25, 2018 , Good day, everyone, and welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2018 . (Operator Instructions)At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2018 .With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.This call and our presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our third quarter 2018 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. -- Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone.I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.We reported revenue of $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year, and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.23, up 23% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.1 million shares for $175 million.Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 151.7 million, consisting of 137.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net. During the third quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2 million names.Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2018 will be 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the year-ago quarter.We now expect full-year 2018 domain name base growth of between 4.2% and 4.6%, with an increase to the domain name base for the fourth quarter of 2018 of between 0.9 million to 1.4 million net additions.Beginning with 2019 guidance, on our next , we plan to focus our guidance related to changes in the domain name base on annual changes. Starting next year, we no longer intend to provide guidance on quarterly net additions. This change reflects our commitment to managing the business for long-term growth and stability while aligning all of our guidance to be focused on key annual business and financial metrics.The daily transparency into net additions to the domain name base, which is updated twice per day, will continue to be available on our website.As indicated in our earnings release today, we have entered into an agreement with NeuStar to sell the rights, economic benefits, and obligations, in all customer contracts related to our Security Services business.Transaction includes the sale of customer agreements related to our DDoS Protection, Managed DNS, DNS Firewall, and Recursive DNS services. We will retain our proprietary technology, network assets, critical infrastructure, software and public DNS service to focus solely on supporting our core mission, which is ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure.As part of the transaction, we will continue to support the Security Services customers during the transition to NeuStar, pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement that is expected to be executed at closing.The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close shortly following receipt of such approval.We are committed to focusing on our core mission of providing critical Internet infrastructure, including Root Zone management, operation of two of the 13 global Internet root servers, operation of .gov and .edu, and authoritative resolution for the .com and .net top-level domains, which support the majority of global e-commerce. For this reason, we're transitioning our Security Services customers to NeuStar.To update you on our discussion about the Cooperative Agreement, we are mindful of the upcoming expiration and are progressing with the NTIA to amend the Cooperative Agreement by mutual agreement. When we are able to provide more information, we will do so.I will tell you that we are confident that an amended agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term, which is the end of November. However, until that process is complete, there is nothing more that we can disclose at this time.And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. -- Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.Revenue for the third quarter totaled $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. Operating income for the period totaled $195 million compared with $181 million in the third quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 61.9% in the same quarter a year ago.Net income totaled $138 million compared to $115 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.13 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.93 for the same quarter last year.As of September 30, 2018, the Company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $508 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million, the same as last quarter and compared to $97 million in the third quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 68.7% compared to 68.2% last quarter and 66.7% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $151 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 122.3 million shares. This compares to $1.18 last quarter and $1 in the third quarter of 2017.Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $187 million, and free cash flow was $177 million compared with $175 million and $153 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.Now, I'd like to provide updates to our full-year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.211 billion to $1.216 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.205 billion to $1.215 billion range provided on our last call.Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 67% and 67.5%, increased and narrowed from the 66% to 67% range provided on the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million to $84 million, decreased and narrowed from the $82 million to $89 million range provided on our last call.Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $40 million to $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are still expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, unchanged from our last call.In summary, the Company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter.Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. -- Thank you, George.The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues. We generated and efficiently returned value to our shareholders.We continue to work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Sterling Auty at JPMorgan. -- Hey, guys. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. So, you mentioned about your agreement with NeuStar to actually sell your Security Service. Just so that we can model the out years perfectly, how much revenue were you getting from that other business? And how much margins did that particular business have? -- Ugam, this is George. Thanks for the question. As I'm sure you're aware, VSS is not a material contributor to our overall business. If the transaction closes before year-end, we do not expect a material impact to our 2018 guidance and we will provide 2019 full year guidance on our Q4 call, which will include any impacts from the transaction once it closes. -- Okay, cool. And on the Cooperative Agreement, you mentioned that it can be amended before the expiration date, but given -- if suppose, say, the process continues, is there a provision where the -- like Cooperative Agreement can be extended for six months until which you are in the negotiation period? -- I don't have any comments beyond my prepared remarks, so I'll just reiterate that we're progressing with the NTIA to amend the Cooperative Agreement by mutual agreement and that we're confident than an amended agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term at the end of the -- of November. So, more when we can. -- All right. And if I could squeeze one last one in. If you see the operating margins for the current quarter, you see that much of the leverage came from sales and marketing expense. Is it something where it is -- it will be the normal course of business that we see such kind of margins? I know you provided 2018 guidance, but just from a qualitative perspective, was there a shift of timing of expenses in the quarter, or is it like more that the focus of the business in terms of the investments has changed? -- So, with regard to our Q3 expenses, as you can see out (ph) from a non-GAAP basis, our total expenses were about $96 million and we're relatively flat both year-over-year and sequentially. However, as you point out, we did see some movements between the categories. Sequentially, we did have a slight decrease in sales and marketing which was offset by small increases in G&A and cost of goods sold. Now, specifically with sales and marketing, sequentially we were down about $2.5 million quarter-to-quarter, and that primarily was a result of lower direct marketing activities in the quarter.As you may recall, we increased our direct marketing activities late in 2017, with the intent to do more in 2018. However, as we pursue more direct marketing activities outside of the US, we found it (ph), took and it is taking frankly us longer to execute on those direct marketing activities abroad. So, really no change. Just, I would say, the normal ebb and flow of how marketing expenses get deployed into the marketplace. -- Awesome. Thank you so much, guys.And we'll go next to Matthew Wells at Citi. -- Hi. This is Matt Wells and I'm on for Walter Pritchard. I was just curious, what was the catalyst for transitioning your Security Services business to NeuStar? Is there anything that read into the timing here relative to the Coop (ph)? -- No, this is completely independent. It's a decision we made to focus exclusively on our core mission. As you know, we operate a great deal of critical infrastructure, where we do resolution, of course not only for .com and .net but for .gov and .edu. We do Root Zone management, we operate two of the 13 Internet root service, and that we just decided that that focus wasn't consistent with continued pursuit of that business, and transitioning into NeuStar made sense for that reason, timing independent of anything else that's going on. -- Thanks, that's helpful. And I know -- I think last time we spoke, the .web process was still hung up with ICANN and timing sounded like it was a little uncertain. Do you have any more clarity on that process, or where it stands? -- No, no, no updates at this time. I hope to have some in the near future, but nothing to say at this time. -- Okay, thanks. And that's it for me. -- Okay, Matt, thank you.And moving next to Rob Oliver at Robert W. Baird. -- Great, good afternoon. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob. So, my question was on the sales and marketing expense as well. George, you mentioned that it was taking a little longer to execute, is that something -- should we expect that to kind of tick back up? Is it still a priority to get that level deployed -- those marketing expenses deployed? So is that something we should expect to tick back up going forward and maybe into 2019? -- We'll -- as I said earlier, we'll provide 2019 guidance on our next call. But -- look, we are constantly trying to invest in marketing activities. I think the goal there is for domain name sales to increase with marketing activities, and we fully pursue activities that we think will drive those results. We have switched year-over-year. We've done more direct marketing this year than we've done in prior years, and I just think we're -- we've executed some great campaigns in a variety of markets. But as I said, sometimes the international markets are taking a little bit longer to get that work (ph) through. So, I don't think anything is really different there. We continue to focus and make investments in marketing, and hopefully, that produces increases in domain name sales. -- Okay, thanks. And then, my second question was on, Jim, the number of new names process has ticked up nicely this year and been kind of 9.5 million or above each quarter. What's been driving you think? Was there any trends or any higher level comments that you could say driving the increase in the number of domains this year? -- I'll ask George to comment. I will just say that .com is an incredibly strong brand, you hear me say this all the time and I can't emphasize it enough quite frankly. It's a brand that gets a tremendous amount of exposure, it's the brand that gives you credibility worldwide for your online presence, and I think that has a great deal to do with the continued strength that .com is showing. But George, if you'd like to add some color, please feel free. -- Yeah. Sure. Matt, as you've observed, Q3 was a good quarter for us, we delivered 2 million net adds (ph) in the quarter, which was up from 1.5 million net adds in the third quarter of 2017, and that improvement is primarily result of gross adds. As you point out, gross adds totaled 9.5 million in the quarter. They were up from 8.9 million a year ago. And this is really the same trend that we've witnessed and reported on pretty much all year. We've had continued gross adds performance from both North American and China registrars. They seem to be performing better this year than they did previously, and that's been a trend that we've seen in previous quarters and it's continued here into the third quarter. So, again, I think it's the strong brand in both those markets and we'll continue to execute on marketing activities to accentuate that brand message into the marketplace. -- Got it. Thanks, guys.And with no additional questions at this time, Mr. Atchley, I'll turn things back over to you for any final comments. -- Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.And once again that does conclude today's conference. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new June 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $126.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $139.94/share today.Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $139.94/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $145.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.94% if the stock gets called away at the June 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 4 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisign Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $123.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $160.00.

So they offer cloud-based solutions and services that make customer interaction with businesses easier.So the primary factors impacting the industry are the general level of retail trade, industrial growth and progress, and level of technology adoption by businesses on the one hand and the proliferation of connected consumer devices that might help people connect and do business online on the other.Since technology adoption by businesses is still in its relatively early days, there is a lot of scope for growth, directly benefiting companies in this industry. Consumer devices too are getting more sophisticated and more capable, spurring businesses to adopt more technology and artificial intelligence.The industry appears to lag the broader computer software market as well as the tech influenced S&P 500 segment, which is not necessarily a negative in this case.That's because technology and particularly software has many drivers that don't apply to this industry that is relatively more dependent on retail. And retail typically doesn't grow at the same pace as technology by virtue of its being a relatively more mature segment. Still, electronic enabling continues to gather momentum, so growth rates should be sustainable.The relative performance of the  (a 20-stock group) with the broader  and the S&P 500 is depicted in the chart below.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 3.6%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer and Technology Sector have rallied 17.6% and 18.1%, respectively.While the industry hasn't had a great run in prices over the past year, there may be good reason for this. The last few years have seen considerably high financial leverage, probably necessitated by the volume of business moving online, but making the stocks relatively more risky. Therefore, a valuation based on the enterprise value may be in order.The industry currently has an  of 17.13X, which is below the annual high of 18.62X but above the median level of 16.83X, suggesting that upside if any will be limited. Comparing this with the S&P 500, we see that it is way ahead of the S&P 500's 11.92X (median 11.50X).It's evident that stocks in this industry are currently seeing rising costs and increasing investments, with a corresponding hit to profitability.The above ratio analysis shows that investors are upbeat about the industry's growth prospects. However, the real question for them is whether this group has the potential to continue performing better than the broader market in the quarters ahead.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects for a solid price performance going forward is the industry's earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that the earnings outlook for an industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Internet Software & Services industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #184, which places it at the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map for the last five weeks shows significant deterioration in the first two weeks of August followed by very gradual improvement in subsequent weeks.While the near-term prospects look uncertain for investors, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Internet-Software & Services Industry appears attractive. That's because more business is moving online as we speak from both existing and new players. New technology is also being introduced, existing tools fine-tuned and artificial intelligence is increasingly being employed to facilitate doing more business online.So it isn't surprising that the group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate of 13.74% compares favorably with the 9.82% growth for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.The long-term growth is a continuation of strong performance over the past few years. Take revenue for example, which is the best yardstick to measure the effectiveness of investments. It's also an indication that the high level of investments can continue.Understandably, profitability has declined as the industry continues to build assets, including intellectual property. So on the one hand, EBIT margin has dropped-While on the other, book value per share has increased-Even as return on assets declined-The high level of investment was partially financed with debt, although the debt/total capitalization is currently at manageable levels-The above charts show that the industry is focused on long term growth and will continue to sacrifice margins because the longer-term prospects are too good. Whether near term performance is matching up to expectations will be best understood by watching the topline.Given the above, investors with a short term focus won't find the industry attractive. Our model also doesn't have too many buy-ranked stocks in the industry (Zacks Ranks #1 and #2). You can see  .While none of the stocks in our Internet-Software & Services universe currently hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), here are four stocks that have been seeing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

One interesting put contract in particular, is the March 2019 put at the $105 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 83 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 0.8% return against the $105 commitment, or a 1.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $105 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisign Inc sees its shares decline 31.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $104.17 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 83 cents from $105), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $105 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the March 2019 put at the $105 strike for the 1.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Verisign Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $154.09) to be 19%.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 427 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new December 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $140.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $129.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $143.67/share today.Because the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $143.67/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $155.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 15.75% if the stock gets called away at the December 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Per the report, Q1 total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 20.9% on 11.5% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year.

The research firm estimates worldwide IT spending to increase 6.2% year over year to $3.74 trillion this year, breaking the earlier highest ever mark of $3.71 trillion in 2014.Though the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all firms in the space.

(AMZN) has been the target of several attacks from President Trump.Given this backdrop, investors would be wondering whether upcoming results can help override recent concerns. Fortunately, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select tech stocks which are also likely to outperform their earnings estimates.The variety of concerns plaguing technology, a sector which largely powered an unprecedented Bull Run, has had the strongest proponents of the sector scurrying for cover.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 84 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new May 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $115.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $110.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $116.43/share today.Because the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $116.43/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.20% if the stock gets called away at the May 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

These results come at a time when the technology sector is grappling with several crises which have sprung up at short intervals. Of the companies, slated to report earnings this week,  (NASDAQ:  ) has had to battle the fallout of a data leak scandal. Meanwhile,  (NASDAQ:  ) has been the target of several attacks from President Trump. Source: ShutterstockGiven this backdrop, investors would be wondering whether upcoming results can help override recent concerns. Fortunately, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select tech stocks which are also likely to outperform their earnings estimates.The variety of concerns plaguing technology, a sector which largely powered an unprecedented Bull Run, has had the strongest proponents of the sector scurrying for cover. Only recently, poor guidance from  (NYSE:  ) pulled down other tech majors like  (NASDAQ:  ).But not all the worries the sector faces at the moment could snowball into threats of significant proportions. For instance, most market watchers believe that a divided Congress is unlikely to regulate data gathering of the kind practiced by Facebook or Google. Online advertising spends, therefore, are likely to remain largely unchanged.However, higher user engagement will still be topmost on the list of investor priorities. Ultimately, earnings would not only have to be good overall. They would have to be strong enough to outweigh recent sector concerns.Unlike the Finance sector whose earnings performance notably improved this earnings season compared to other recent periods, the Tech sector's earnings performance has been strong over the last many quarters. This strength is expected to continue in the Q1 earnings season as well.Total Q1 earnings for the Tech sector are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 11.5% higher revenues. This would follow 24.2% earnings growth for the sector on 11.1% revenue growth in the preceding quarter.That's head and shoulders above the autos and conglomerate sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 9.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the first quarter. Overall, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 18% from the same period last year on 5.3% higher revenues.Tech stocks have been battered on several fronts this year, the latest being poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor. However, several of the concerns surrounding the sector are unlikely to build up into something larger.For instance, U.S. lawmakers are unlikely to impose stringent regulation on tech majors in the near term.

Most of these have done well in 2017, which is one major reason why Berkshire has done so well -- the total market value of its portfolio stocks has risen from $129 billion at the end of 2016 to  at the close of the third quarter this year.Three of Berkshire's stocks have risen by over 50% so far in 2017. One of those companies,  , is an extremely well-recognized company, and a top pick among many investors. The other two, however, aren't as renowned.Image source: The Motley Fool.Apple is only No. 3 out of Berkshire's top trio for the year.In first place is a stock that's rarely on anyone's must-own list: credit rating agency and research concern  (NYSE: MCO) . Yet the company has been on fire lately, delivering strong revenue and profitability growth. Its most  beat estimates with revenue leaping 16% higher year over year (to just over $1 billion), and net income ballooning by 24% to $317 million.A jump in international revenue bolstered the top line, while organic growth and acquisitions padded net profit.As an investment, Moody's is a model Buffett stock. The company has landed consistently in the black on an annual basis, although this profitability has been somewhat up-and-down over the years. Revenue, meanwhile, almost doubled since 2010; operating and free cash flow have risen even more sharply.Moody's core business, its credit rating operations, forms a very wide  . It's the star rating agency with only a very few competitors of similar power and influence; its ratings can often make or break a new debt issue. These days, money is still quite cheap to borrow so many companies are going to the well -- and having their debt evaluated by Moody's.It's no wonder the company's managed to grow so much. And it's hardly surprising that the stock has risen by almost 60% in 2017. Berkshire holds $3.7 billion worth of Moody's shares, for a nearly 13% stake in the company.The No. 2 performer in Berkshire Hathaway's big bag of stocks is  (NASDAQ: VRSN) , the price of which has climbed by nearly 52% in 2017. The company performs crucial registry, infrastructure, and indexing operations for the internet, and offers online security services.Since VeriSign holds the exclusive rights to operate the registers for the top-shelf .com domain (plus the lesser .net, and a clutch of minor domains), it's got one of those nice moats Buffett is so fond of. The company's slowly but steadily increasing revenue and consistent profitability are reflective of this, as is its typically chunky net profit margin (almost 39% in fiscal 2016, 35% the year before).Unlike Moody's in recent years, VeriSign hasn't been a particularly fast grower. In its Q3 the company managed to increase its top line by less than 2%, while adjusted net profit inched up slightly more by 4% (all told, revenue was $292 million for the period, and net profit came in at just under $115 million).VeriSign is a relatively recent investment for Berkshire and Buffett; it was purchased in 2013. Profitability and wide moat aside, it's actually not a typical one. For decades, Buffett diligently avoided tech stocks (he once counseled to \"never invest in a business you cannot understand,\" and tech didn't fit the bill).Buffett has changed his stance, however; these days his company holds nearly $1.5 billion worth of VeriSign stock for a 13% stake. The share price has increased by almost 51% in 2017.It's quite a feat for a stock in a portfolio run by one of the best investors of all time to overperform in a particular year. Apple, which has (for the most part) been an outstanding company dating back to the dawn of the iPhone in 2007, was almost a no-brainer as an investment choice. But choosing Moody's and VeriSign shows a clever, sensible, and patient approach to the market.In other words, an investment style entirely in character for the Oracle of Omaha.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The bottom line increased 7.2% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues increased 1.7% year over year to $292.4 million, which was slightly ahead of the consensus estimate. The improvement was driven by increase in the domain name registration in the .For fourth-quarter 2017, VeriSign expects revenues between $1.161 billion and $1.166 billion.VeriSign holds a dominant position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. In fact, the company is an exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Additionally, it experienced a combined growth of 1.2% year over year to 145.8 million in domain name registrations for .com and .net.

However, the same increased 3.7 million or 1.1% year over year.Additionally, Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs) increased 3.2% year over year and 0.3% sequentially to 144.7 million in the third quarter.Meanwhile, the company is benefiting from strong gTLD prospects. Markedly, new gTLDs (ngTLD) represent 6.4% of total domain name registrations. Further, gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties are likely to boost results.Improving trade in bitcoin and cryptocurrency sectors is also a favorable contributing factor for rising domain name registrations.For 2017, VeriSign has revised the guidance for its domain name base growth rate. Per the company's prediction, the metric is expected to grow in the range of 2.8% to 3.1%, up from its earlier forecast of 2% to 2.75%.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the September put at the $110 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.9% return against the $110 commitment, or a 5.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $110 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisign Inc sees its shares decline 4.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $105.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.30 from $110), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $110 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put at the $110 strike for the 5.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

According to the most recent run of this data, the short sellers have been increasing their bearish bets on a number of stocks over the previous two weeks, creating a generous number of short squeeze rally candidates.It is normal to see short interest go higher as some traders try to fade a rally by increasing their bets against further gains.Our proprietary model scans for those stocks that are maintaining strong, low volatility trends higher that may see some short-term selling, but are more likely to continue higher. This creates a volatility rally as the shorts finally move to close their positions to avoid further losses.The following stocks are among the top choices of our most recent short cover rally contender list. Let's take a look at the top three on our list according to the short interest data and their charts.Software company  (NASDAQ:  ) posted a nice quarter of earnings results in late October and the stock has maintained its rally until we started to see some rotation out of the technology universe toward the end of November.The reversal in Verisign and other technology issues appears to be more of a function of profit-taking than anything else as portfolio managers try to lock-in gains near their high watermarks. Considering this, the recent pullback should be seen a \"healthy\" and an opportunity to grab a good stock on a dip.The rub here is that the short sellers are now on the defensive and haven't been closing positions on the rally. The current short interest ratio indicates that it will take more than 18 days to cover current short positions. Furthermore, the current short interest represents 15% of the outstanding shares available to trade.This indicates that a bounce in Verisign's stock price, which has technical support at $110 from its rising 50-day moving average, will spark a short covering rally that will likely target a move to $120-$125.Industrial companies are in the crosshairs of the bulls considering the more recent data on economic growth. A focus on the housing and infrastructure areas of the economy means companies like  (NASDAQ:  ) are in the right place at the right time.Fastenal's chart has been strong recently as the migration of cash into the industrial names has pumped prices higher. The shorts have got to be feeling the pain, but we've not seen signs that the rally has been driven by shorts covering their positions. This means that the stock is still ripe for a \"covering rally.\"Short interest on Fastenal sits at an awesome 16 times the average daily volume. This sets Fastenal up for another leg in the rally.The recent pullback, about 3.5%, is likely to engage the \"buy the dip\" crowd, which will then see Fastenal move back toward its highs at $55. At that point, we expect a short squeeze rally to push shares toward $63.Another industrial name that is garnering the attention of traders is  (NYSE:  ). The company, well-known for its tools, has been on a tear lately by tacking more than 8% on to its price after crossing above chart resistance at $160.This stock is in the earlier stages of a rally cycle and gaining momentum, which bodes poorly for the short sellers betting against it.Currently, Snap-on shares are set-up to see a \"golden cross\" formation as the 50-day moving average gets ready to cross above the 200-day moving average. This is often seen as a bullish signal for intermediate-term outlooks.That signal is the enemy of the short sellers that currently hold more than 15 days worth of the stock's daily volume as bets against it moving higher.That's going to end as soon as the stock will start to attract buys on the current dip.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new June 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of 62 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $74.38 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $108.42/share today.Because the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 31% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 96%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $108.42/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.31% if the stock gets called away at the June 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.

Of these, approximately 71.3% of the companies posted positive earnings surprises, while 70.1% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies grew 9.4% from the comparable period last year, while revenues were up 7.3%.The trend this earnings season indicates that we will finally witness back-to-back five quarters of earnings growth after five straight quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the S&P 500 index will improve 2.6% from the year-ago period, while total revenues will be up 5%.Technology is one of the four sectors expected to report impressive earnings growth. The other three are Oil/Energy, Industrial Products and Construction. Various technology giants, including Alphabet  , Microsoft  and Amazon  , are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 9.9% on 7.1% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Though the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company's earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management's ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.The world's largest semiconductor company,  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results. We expect this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to post earnings of 80 cents per share and revenues of $15.71 billion. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter's actual figures, represent almost flat growth. You can see  | Intel's earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with the chipmaker's competition. Of late, the company has been sensing the pressure from the likes of NVIDIA and Avanced Micro Devices. Nvidia's artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment. (Read:  )However, we anticipate the company's strong growth at the data-center group segment to cushion its top- and bottom-line results. Increasing demand for data storage and high-performance networks has been propelling this segment's growth. As the number of smartphones and Internet-connected devices escalates, along with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, Intel's Data Center business will expand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's revenues is pegged at $4.82 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 6%. As Intel's data-center business accounts for nearly half of the company's operating margin, the benefit of increase in segment's revenues will trickle down to the bottom line as well.We expect  's third-quarter 2017 results to benefit from strength in paid clicks, solid advertising revenues, mobile search ads and increasing momentum in the Other Bets segment. Also, increasing use of machine-learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos will drive top-line growth.We expect paid clicks to grow in the to-be-reported quarter, driven partly by growing volumes of mobile and TrueView ads on YouTube. YouTube remains a strong contributor, benefiting from the heightening online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged in the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.The company's advertising revenues will likely be driven by healthy growth in its mobile search ads, YouTube ads and programmatic advertising. Furthermore, given an encouraging performance of the Other Bets segment during the second quarter, we estimate the segment to continue its momentum this quarter as well.In addition to this, the increasing use of machine-learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos will continue to drive top-line growth in the upcoming quarter. (Read:  )The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's revenues is pegged at $21.94 billion for the quarter under review, up 20.1% from third-quarter 2016.

Microsoft's cloud computing service - Azure - has been the major growth driver in recent times. In the last quarter, Azure revenues soared a whopping 94% at constant currency on a year-over-year basis. We believe robust adoption of this cloud computing service will continue to drive the company's top line in the soon-to-be reported quarter. According to data from Synergy Research, Azure  only Amazon Web Services (AWS) in terms of market share and revenue growth in the cloud infrastructure services market.Also, Microsoft now leads the enterprise SaaS market that gained almost 31% year over year to reach $15 billion in quarterly revenues. The outperformance was attributed to the buyout of LinkedIn that contributed revenues of $1.1 billion in the last quarter. Microsoft projects approximately $1.1 billion of revenues from LinkedIn in the fiscal first quarter.Additionally, we note that strong Office 365 and Windows 10 adoption are other growth drivers for the quarter.

The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). We note that the company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as international markets. Reportedly, in the last quarter, new .com and .net registrations were 9.2 million compared with 8.6 million in the year-ago quarter. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).Thus, strong gTLD growth, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results, in our view.

In an interview from the mid-1980s, Buffett said that the technological revolution had \"gone right past him,\" and he hadn't found any tech companies he understood.\"It's OK with me. I don't have to make money in every game,\" he said.In recent years, Berkshire has made room for some of the sector's companies, making it the portfolio's third biggest weighting. Buffett holds IBM (  ), and one of his deputy investors he hired to manage portions of the portfolio bought VeriSign (  ). Both Buffett and one of Berkshire's mangers also own a stake in Apple (  ).As 2017 draws to a close, Berkshire has a net profit on tech, though IBM has floundered.Buffett began to lose faith in IBM during 2017, initiating a reduction to the massive holding as its stock price stagnated since his 2011 purchase. He ended the third quarter with 37,026,698 shares after starting the year with 81,232,303 shares and reducing the holding each consecutive quarter. His quarterly average sale prices were $175 for the first quarter, $158 for the second and $146 for the third. With an estimated average purchase price of $175 and sale price of $160, Buffett will end the year with an approximately 10% loss on IBM.IBM made it on Buffett's radar as early as the mid-1980s interview. \"It's a sensational company, but I haven't owned any IBM,\" he said.But after finally investing in 2011, he began to change his mind this year.\"I was wrong... IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors,\" he told CNBC in an interview in May. \"I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying ...

It generated cash flow of $153 million versus $165 million.The improvements came as the company had 8.9 million domain name registrations, compared to 8.3 million, and ended the quarter with 245.8 million .com and .net domain name registrations, a 1.2% increase.Buffett's Apple has also gained 50% year to date. It trades for around $173.60 per share on Friday afternoon.Someone at Berkshire initially bought Apple in the first quarter of 2016 when the price averaged only $100 per share.

The increase was primarily driven by a benefit of 6 cents per share owing to a pre-tax gain from the divestiture of its iDefense business and lower share count.Revenues marginally increased year over year to $288.6 million from $286.5 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286.9 million as well. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by increase in domain name registrations in the U.S. as well as in international markets.Shares of VeriSign have gained 34% year to date, slightly underperforming the 39.3% rally of the  it belongs to.In the quarter, domain name registrations for .com and .net together grew 0.8% year over year to 144.3 million. In absolute terms, domain name registrations grew 0.68 million year over year. VeriSign processed 9.2 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, an increase from 8.6 million processed in the year-ago quarter.For the reported quarter, the exact renewal rate figures will be available after 45 days from Jun 30, 2017.

As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had $770 million available under its current share repurchase program.Buoyed by the encouraging second-quarter results, VeriSign raised its full-year revenue and capital expenditure guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $1.155-$1.165 billion (mid-point $1.16 billion), up from the prior guidance of $1.145-$1.160 billion (mid-point $1.153 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is $1.16 billion.Capital expenditure is now anticipated to increase in the range of $40-$50 million compared with the previous guidance of $35-$45 million.The company reaffirmed its earlier non-GAAP operating margin guidance range of 64.5% to 65.25%.VeriSign also raised its domain name base growth rate guidance for 2017.

However, the other terms of the agreement remained unchanged.VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names will continue to drive VeriSign's top line. Also, we believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results. The company continues to benefit from strong demand in the U.S. as well as in the international markets.Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market. VeriSign also has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space. Strong demand for VeriSign's cyber security products, following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya is also a key growth driver. Also an increase in annual fee for a .net domain name registration will drive the company's top-line results from next year onward.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.VeriSign carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The other two are Finance and Energy. Technology giants such as Facebook  and Amazon  are scheduled to report quarterly numbers this week.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space.

Notably, earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time.But earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price. Studies have shown that majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement.Basically, earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company. In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be referred to as earnings acceleration.In case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. On the other hand, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.Let's look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods' growth rates. : The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1). : The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2). : The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters: : This screens out the low-priced stocks. : High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.

Notably, the company has a mixed earnings surprise track record for the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.80%.Revenues increased 2.4% year over year to $288.6 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286.6 million.We believe increasing domain name registrations and strong demand for VeriSign's cyber security products, following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya, are key growth drivers.Cyber security companies like VeriSign are doing well because of increasing instances of cybercrimes. Its shares have massively outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock returned 30.1%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names are likely to drive VeriSign's top line.According to the company's latest \"The Domain Name Industry Brief\", domain name registrations across all top-level domains (TLDs) have signaled a  trend, with 1.3 million domain name registrations being added in the first quarter, an increase of 0.4% sequentially and 3.7% year over year. Thus, an increase in domain name registrations coupled with price hikes for the .com and .net domain names will drive revenues in our view.The company is also benefiting from strong gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs, investments in intellectual properties as well as growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market. It has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space as well.Moreover, the divestiture of iDefense Security Intelligence Services has helped the company to focus on core operations, which will have a positive impact on results.Going by the sequential decline trend in marketing expenses over the last few quarters, we expect it to remain muted in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Notably, management plans to defer marketing spend to the latter half of the year.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization is a concern. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that VeriSign is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: VeriSign's Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at earnings of 91 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . VeriSign's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a few companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:IPG Photonics Corporation  with an Earnings ESP of +3.07% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see Kemet Corporation  with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.SBA Communications Corporation  with an Earnings ESP of +10% and a Zacks Rank #1.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

This is because this security in the Internet - Software and Services space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Internet - Software and Services space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 50 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, VeriSign is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm's prospects in both the short and long term. | In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have risen from 89 cents per share to 91 cents per share, while current year estimates have risen from $3.62 per share to $3.69 per share. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is also a favorable signal. You can see So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider VeriSign. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 3 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisign Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $90.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $94.00. The standard deviation is $2.081.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSN crossing above that average target price of $92.33/share, investors in VRSN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $92.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisign Inc:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

According to the latest short interest report, aggregate short interest on the  component companies has increased by 2.4%. That might not sound like much, but that increase registers as one of the largest moves in the past six months. Source: ShutterstockThe increase in shorts suggests that the market may continue to buck the normally negative seasonality that comes as the calendar changes to the month of June and the market climbs the \"Wall of Worry.\"We have filtered through the technical and short interest trends of the S&P 500 companies to find potential short squeeze stocks. These are the stocks that show the highest probability of seeing the shorts press stock prices higher as they are forced to close losing positions.As usual, we like to profile three companies that stand out from our models' perspective as short squeeze stock candidates. So here's a look at the three best opportunities we see right now. (NASDAQ:  ) shares saw a tepid reaction to their earnings news last quarter as the outlook for the stock wasn't as exciting as investors had hoped. Since then, VRSN has been trading in a relatively tight range outlined by $90 and $91.50.Short sellers have increased their positions slightly, resulting in a short interest ratio of 16.2. This is in the top 1% of short interest ratios within the S&P 500.The fact that short sellers are betting against a company that is up roughly 19% year-to-date and is in one of the stronger performing sectors puts Verisign right on top of the list of stocks to benefit from a short covering rally.Look for a move above $92 to send the shorts into the market to cover their losing bets on VRSN, which will help this short squeeze stock target a range between $97.50 and $100.Another stock that got no love from a good earnings report is  (NASDAQ:  ). Since their report in April, the stock has been range-bound between $51 and $53 as traders have been backing off the stock.In Garmin's case, we're watching the technical picture closely as GRMN is getting ready to benefit from rising support. The 50- and 100-day moving averages are ascending and creeping up to $51. This should add a technical catalyst to break the stock higher.We've seen some analyst activity of late that should help Garmin stock. After earnings, a number of firms began raining targets on this underloved stock. We expect additional activity on this front, which will help to spark buying.A break above $53 will likely act as the catalyst for the next short covering rally on Garmin stock. In fact, our models target the covering rally to elevate this short squeeze stock to the $56-$58 range.The jobs market is still showing signs of expansion and businesses are growing. This is good for companies like  (NASDAQ:  ) that provide a variety of services from uniforms to industrial products that make companies run.The stock saw a nice rally after its latest earnings report, which was followed almost immediately by a \"sell the news\" selloff to support at the Cintas' 100-day moving average.Short sellers have been closing their positions in CTAS, but the stock's short interest ratio still registers a 9.4, well within the range of readings that our models designate as bullish with the potential of a covering rally.We just saw the stock move back above its 50-day moving average within the last week. This trendline is also moving higher, which our models designate as bullish. The move above this trendline and a break above $126 should combine for the next round of short covering to push Cintas stock higher.We're expecting to see the covering rally push shares of CTAS above $130. For this reason, it would be a good idea to keep an eye on this, as it is one of the most promising short squeeze stocks to buy.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - June 20, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ) and  (NYSE:  -  ).Earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time. Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts.Better-than-expected earnings results mostly lead to an uptick in the share price. Studies, however, have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement. Hence, earnings acceleration works even better in lifting the stock price.In case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Earnings acceleration is basically the increase in a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth within a stipulated frame of time. In other words, it is the incremental growth in earnings of a company.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. Sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance. :Let's pick stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates have been more than the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods' growth rates. : The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1). : The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2). : The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters: : This screens out the low-priced stocks. : High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.

That's because cybercrime, which includes destruction of data, identity theft, spying and other illegal activities, poses a threat. Enterprises and government agencies are frequently targeted by hackers, and therefore have to adopt strict cyber security measures.Over the past few years, high-profile business houses and government agencies have reported a significant rise in data breaches which, in turn, prompt them to impose tighter security measures.The latest was a massive ransomware attack on May 12, which halted daily work at several companies, government offices and even hospitals across the globe. According to a report from cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc.  , the attack, which persisted throughout the whole weekend, affected over 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries across the Americas, Europe, Russia and Asia over the following weekend.Known as WannaCrypt or WannaCry, the malicious software reportedly seizes the control of computers and encrypted files with a password which only hackers have access to. After that, victims were asked to pay ransoms in order to regain control of their systems. The hackers demanded ransom in bitcoin.The latest cyberattack proved that, whether government or private enterprise, most organizations around the world lack proper security measures.Per the predictions of CSO, a provider of news, analysis and research on a broad range of security and risk management topics, cybercrime damages may cost the world a whopping $6 trillion annually by 2021, double from $3 trillion in 2015.According to a joint report of Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and CyberScout, 1,093 data breaches had been recorded in 2016, which was 40% higher than 780 reported in 2015.The long list of data breaches puts the Internet security market in focus, as companies are beginning to realize the necessity of beefing up cyber safety measures.Moreover, with rapid technological advancement, more organizations are adopting the \"bring your own device\" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access. This trend, on the other hand, has made it necessary for companies to enforce stricter data security measures.From being a niche industry a decade ago, cyber security has grown into a very important segment in the IT space. Various independent research firms forecast strong demand ahead. According to a Markets and Markets report, worldwide cybersecurity spending will reach $90 billion in 2017, $101 billion in 2018 and $170 billion by 2020. Gartner had earlier mentioned that IT security spending peaked to above $83 billion in 2016.It should also be noted that cyber security companies are witnessing high single-digit growth, while overall IT spending is anticipated to grow just 2.7% year over year to $3.5 trillion in 2017, according to research firm Gartner.This indicates that business houses and government agencies would rather compromise on other IT expenses than security measures, which, we believe, will enhance long-term prospects for cyber security providers.Though billions of dollars and data are lost due to cyber crime, there does appear to be a positive side to it. Cyber security companies stand to gain from data breach as the chances of security-related purchase increase.While there are plenty of players in the industry, we would like to highlight five major companies that are projected to change the way we protect data. is a provider of network security appliances and Unified Threat Management network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide.

Ultimately, the cyberattack affected at least 200,000 computers across the world, as per EU law enforcement agency Europol estimates. The malicious software, characterized as ransomware, is now the principal cyber threat, according to Europol's executive director Rob Wainwright,Wainwright also pointed out that the attack had taken place on an unprecedented scale. Further, there were indications that attacks were likely to continue into the current week, which has brought cybersecurity companies into focus once again. Investing in these stocks is an imperative now, given that such attacks are likely to continue in the near future.According to Europol, Friday's \"WannaCry\" ransomware attack took place across a minimum of 150 countries. Ransomware is named as such because it takes computers or even entire networks hostage until a specific ransom is paid up. However, its impact may have been muted since most European companies were preparing to close over the weekend.Consequently, government agencies across the pond bore the brunt of the attack, in particular, the United Kingdom's National Health Service, rail systems in Germany as well as Chinese government agencies.Among those companies which were singed by the attack are the likes of PetroChina Company Ltd.  , Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.  and Renault SA  . Though the majority of U.S. companies remained unaffected, FedEx Corporation  bore the brunt of the attack. According to an Associated Press report on Friday, FedEx was quoted as saying that it was \"experiencing interference.\"The fact that such attacks have become commonplace to some companies was evident from Telef\u00f3nica, S.A.'s  reaction. The Spanish telecom major said that it did not face much trouble from the incident because it was used to facing such attacks on a regular basis. However, Microsoft Corp.  described the event as a \"wake-up call\" for the U.S. government.This is because the attack was orchestrated using information about security vulnerabilities stored by the U.S. government. Additionally, the software giant underlined the need for companies to keep their information systems up to date. Microsoft said that it had released a patch to tackle the Windows security flaw in March, but several users had not yet installed it.An unnamed security expert who is believed to have stopped the contagion by Saturday issued a warning the very next day that a fresh assault was possibly in the works. A new attack was likely to fix the chink in the ransomware's armor. The fallout of the attack was evident even on May 14, with PetroChina's parent yet to connect 20% of its large network of gas stations.A section of exports believe that Russian cybercriminals possibly perpetrated the attack. This is because they were more likely to use ransomware as a weapon. The countries hit by the attack also support such a theory. Estimates of the total ransom paid out by victims of the attack range from $40,000-$50,000.The \"WannaCry\" ransomware attack once again highlights the need for security software and systems. Even though the U.S. has remained largely unscathed, future attacks are unlikely to spare its shores. This only means that companies, particularly of the larger variety will spend larger amounts on cybersecurity in the days to come.Adding stocks gaining from such trends to your portfolios looks like a smart option at this point.

Buffett, who is price-conscious and won't repurchase his own companies' shares at more than 1.2 times book value, a statement he last made good on in 2012, approved of his investees' buybacks because he believes their shares \"have in most cases been underpriced.\"\"(Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders,\" he said in the letter.As the market pushed higher, share buybacks in corporate America totaled $115.6 billion in the third quarter, falling 28% from the same quarter of 2015. S&P 500 constituents also repurchased fewer shares for the second consecutive quarter and spent the least on repurchases since the first quarter 2013. Most striking, the pace has taken a turn since almost one year ago, which saw the highest buyback spending $161.4 billion - the highest since 2007.Corporate stock repurchases are vilified by some and loved by others. Because stock compensation forms the bulk of executive pay, it benefits them to buy back shares to increase their stocks' prices and achieve quarterly EPS targets, even in high markets where undervaluation of their shares is not a motivation, a Harvard Business Review article said in 2014.Buffett has had several other thoughts on repurchases, though. At Berkshire, he targets 1.2 times book value because he thinks the intrinsic value of the company far exceeds its book value. He also thinks the companies he holds that are aggressively buying back shares are undervalued by the market from their intrinsic value.Further, Buffett has recently also spoken favorably about his \"Big Four\" investments buying back shares because it increased his ownership in them. He then acknowledged that their repurchases lifted their share prices. Unlike the Harvard Business Review pointing out the self-interest in some executives buying back shares, Buffett has called the managers of the four companies \"both talented and shareholder-oriented\" and combined them with using retained earnings for \"business opportunities that turn out to be advantageous.\"Buffett specifically named only Bank of America as a responsible share repurchaser, but there are other companies within his portfolio that are buying back their shares aggressively and \"in most cases,\" he said, these are undervalued.The average share count of S&P 500 companies declined by 1.7% in the third quarter, and around 16% of companies repurchased more than 5% of their outstanding shares. Buffett's top five repurchasing companies reduced their share count by more than 6%.They are: United Continental Holdings Inc. (  ), Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (  ), DaVita Inc. (  ), American Express Co. (  ) and VeriSign (  ).VeriSignVerisign, a cyber security and domain name business, bought its shares at a rate of 6.3% in the past year. In the fourth quarter, it bought back 2 million shares for $160 million or an average share price of $80, In the full-year 2016, it repurchased 7.8 million shares for $637 million, of $81.66. Both were substantially higher than GuruFocus' DCF price estimate for the shares of $36.71.In the fourth quarter, Verisign's EPS rose to 84 cents from 76 cents in the same quarter a year ago. Full-year EPS also rose to $3.42 from $2.82 the previous year.Verisign's board authorized a share repurchase package of $641 million beginning Feb. 9, bringing its total repurchase program to $1 billion with no expiration date.American ExpressAmerican Express, the payments company, bought back its shares last year at a rate of 6.7%. This included $4.4 billion spending on 70 million shares at an average price of $63 in 2016, compared to $4.5 billion spent on 59 million shares in 2015. GuruFocus assigned American Express shares a fair value of $78.99.In the fourth quarter, the company reported EPS of 88 cents, declined from 89 cents the same period the prior year, and $5.65 for full-year 2016, increased from $5.05 in 2015.American Express has a repurchase authorization of 150 million shares effective Sept. 26 with no expiration date.DaVitaDaVita, a kidney health company, repurchased its shares at a rate of 7.2% last year. The company expended $416 million on 6,718,658 shares for an average price of $61.96 per share. For the full-year, it bought 16,649,090 shares at a cost of $1.1 billion and an average price of $64.41. Both exceeded GuruFocus' assigned DCF approximation of $51.60 per DaVita share.The company reported fourth-quarter EPS of 81 cents versus a loss per share of 3 cents in the fourth quarter last year, and a $4.29 EPS for full-year 2016 versus $1.25 the period year.As of Feb. 16, DaVita had $677 million remaining on its repurchase authorization.Sirius XM HoldingsSirius XM, a satellite radio company, repurchased its shares at a rate of 7.9% in the past year. It spent $1.67 billion to buy 420 million shares during 2016, paying roughly $3.98 per share on average, and In the fourth quarter, it retired 105,060,200 of its shares, paying an average of $4.37 per share. GuruFocus conferred a DCF fair price of $1.50 per share of Sirius stock.Sirius reported EPS of 4 cents in the fourth quarter, compared to 3 cents in the fourth quarter the prior year, and 15 cents for 2016, increased from 9 cents the prior year.At Dec. 31, Sirius' board approved a $10 billion purchase of its stock with no expiration date.United Continental HoldingsUnited Continental Holdings, the airline, retired its shares at the highest rate in Buffett's portfolio - 13% last year. The company bought back $156 million of its shares and for full-year 2016 it used $2.6 billion to buy back shares at an average price of $51.80 per share. GuruFocus estimates the fair value of its shares much higher at $74.38 using a DCF calculation.For the fourth quarter, the airline reported $1.26 per share, declined from $2.24 the same quarter the prior year and $6.85 for the full-year, declined from $19.47 in 2015.At the end of the year, the company had $1.8 billion left of share repurchases authorized.See a Buffett buyback screen  .This article first appeared on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - May 16, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 3 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisign Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $85.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $88.00. The standard deviation is $1.527.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSN price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSN crossing above that average target price of $86.33/share, investors in VRSN have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $86.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisign Inc:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

In the last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 6.33%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names are likely to drive VeriSign's top line.Furthermore, the company received approval from ICANN to increase domain fee from $7.46 to $8.20 effective Feb 1, 2017, which will be accretive to its revenues.Also, we believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results. Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market. VeriSign also has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space. | However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to marketing remain primary headwinds. We note that VeriSign has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry on a year-to-date basis. The company's shares have increased 16.3% compared with the industry's gain of 21.7% during the period.Our proven model does not conclusively show that VeriSign is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Take a company's revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!Earnings acceleration, however, works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Basically, earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company. In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be referred to as earnings acceleration.In case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. On the other hand, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.Let's look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods' growth rates. : The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1). : The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2). : The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters: : This screens out the low-priced stocks. : High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.

Amid all this, short sellers have taken the opportunity to increase their bearish bets after months of sitting idle. That's good news for those of us who lie in wait for short squeeze opportunities. Source: ShutterstockA quick explanation: A short squeeze is a quick, often significant pop in the price of a stock that occurs when a large number of short sellers suddenly want to exit their positions. The only way they can exit is to \"cover\" their positions, which means they have to buy shares. This increases the buying pressure on the stock, forcing more shorts to cover, creating a virtuous cycle that can send stocks higher by double digits in just a matter of a few trading days!Well, suddenly, the White House looks like it might be building momentum. President Donald Trump announced that he'd be releasing a \"massive tax cut\" as early as next week, financial reform appears to be back under the microscope, and the House appears ready to give healthcare reform another go, too.We recently ran through the most updated short interest data and found a growing number of stocks that are setting up beautifully for short squeezes. How? These stocks are on the precipice of breaking into new bullish trading ranges despite the fact that bearish bets against them are growing.Here are seven stocks to buy on their high likelihood of being squeezed higher over the next few weeks.Everyone talks about the likes of  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) in the tech sector this year, but somehow  (NASDAQ:  ) is overlooked despite a nearly 30% run so far in 2017.Much of that action came after  , which resulted in a 20% jump in just a few days.Since then, however, the short sellers have gotten brave, piling into STX stock and hoping for its demise. But that's not happening. Seagate's fundamentals continue to suggest strong industry demand, while its technical picture is one of the best in its industry.Seagate recently benefited from support from its 50-day moving average, which is once again trending higher. The stock also just worked through a consolidation that appears to have it ready to make another step higher.Seagate is slated to report earnings Wednesday, April 26, before the bell. With roughly 10% of the stock's float tied up as short positions, even a small beat should enough to trigger a covering rally that could match last quarter's 20% run.It's hard to bet against the tech sector write large, which is outperforming the market and stands out as a relative-strength leader.You wouldn't know it by looking at what the short sellers are doing, though.The short interest ratio on  (NASDAQ:  ) currently sits at 18.5. That's huge - it means it would take 18.5 days of trading at normal volume for all the shorts to cover their positions. Short interest on the stock only dropped 3% in the last report, meaning the bears aren't backing down.VRSN is another quiet tech leader, boasting 16% returns year-to-date, but the shorts don't care.However, Verisign earnings due out Thursday, April 27, after the bell could make the doubters take note. And as the report approaches, VRSN shares are creeping toward new all-time highs.Short squeeze rallies require a \"trigger,\" and in Verisign's case, a combination of new highs and earnings should do it. Watch for a move above $94 to shake some sense into the short sellers as they realize this stock is about to cost them a lot of money. I expect a powerful squeeze here - one that lasts much longer than normal. (NASDAQ:  ) has been in the news for several reasons of late - pricing changes, positive sales shifts and even takeover rumors.The shorts  these kinds of headlines.That's one of the reasons why WFM shares are on our short squeeze list. Naturally, we also like the short interest ratio of 9.3, and the fact that shorts control 12% of the outstanding shares available to trade. This means it'll be difficult for the shorts to cover without driving prices significantly higher.Whole Foods doesn't report earnings until Wednesday, May 10, but until then, there are growing whispers and hints about a potential buyout - maybe by  (NYSE:  ) - in WFM's future.Shares already are in the midst of a big move higher, and in fact, you could argue it's already in the midst of a squeeze. But we don't expect this to end soon. Right now, we're targeting prices above the $40 mark for WFM.Everyone hates retail right now, so it shouldn't be a surprise to see the short sellers trying to hammer  (NYSE:  ).There's just one small problem: This is one of the few names in the retail space that are actually  .From a technical standpoint, JWN is moving into a sustainable bullish trend as it prepares to break above its 200-day moving average. At the same time, the 50-day MA is signaling an intermediate-term bullish outlook.Despite this, short sellers are betting against a comeback - so much so that JWN's short interest ratio is approaching 10. Short interest represents 23% of the stock's tradable shares, so a powerful blowback could be coming. Short sellers will have to fight one another just to find enough shares to buy back and cover their losses.This is candy for the bulls. A short covering rally that sees JWN break above its 200-day moving average should target the $52 range.Nordstrom isn't the only retailer that's going against the grain. Consistently left-for-dead  (NYSE:  ) is up nearly 20% year-to-date as the electronics and appliance retailer continues to improve its outlook.And on the chart, BBY is trading above its 50-day moving average - a trendline that's ascending, nudging the stock higher and higher along the way.The short sellers are ignoring the technicals, however; the short interest ratio sits just above 8. Like the other companies mentioned, short interest is high here too, at 13%. This will make it difficult for the shorts to cover without moving BBY higher - and fast!Best Buy has just pushed the trigger - the $50 level, which has been chart resistance in the past. Plus, the market loves round numbers, so a sustained push above this mark will get investors interested in going long, which will pressure the shorts.Look for a move toward $56 on the covering rally.Nothing runs like a Deere, right?Well, the shorts don't think  (NYSE:  ) can run. The recent doubt around the Trump administration's ability to move forward with its aggressive agenda has it and other industrials trading in a range. As a result, the shorts are active; the current short interest ratio on Deere shares is 7.9.In Deere's case, shares have been able to remain somewhat strong and retain some relative strength. DE is actually matching the S&P 500, and is better than many of its peers, so it's still a leader at the moment.We're only $5 away from new highs, and there are some bullish developments on the chart that we like right now.However, don't look for earnings to be the catalyst that drives DE shares higher - the report isn't until Friday, May 19. Instead, look for the first sign of success from Donald Trump & Co., be it healthcare or tax reform, to light the fire under this stock again.I'm looking for a short covering rally to send Deere to at least $120.Lastly, healthcare companies have stalled out as the country waits to find out the fate of its current healthcare system. Still, a few sector companies could march higher, including  (NASDAQ:  ) - an information technology play focused in the healthcare space.Cerner shares are up an incredible 25% year-to-date and are locked in a strong technical trend. Shares did run into resistance around $60 as round-number resistance kicked in, and the shorts reacted by increasing their bets against the stock by 13% over the last two-week reporting period.This latest bout of action from the short selling crowd has driven the short interest ratio on CERN shares to 7.5, while the shorts control 8% of the stock's float. That's more than enough to drive a short covering rally.The trigger here is $60. A break above this mark will force the shorts to become buyers, triggering a rally toward $67.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  .

Yet, few have managed to match the success of this plain talking veteran who has consistently outperformed most other investors over an extended period. Buffett is always market-relevant, but there has been some additional focus on him over the last month following the release of the details of his annual portfolio holdings.Additionally, his sage investor advice, in the form of his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  , grabbed headlines last week. But it's not that his investing approach is without its fair share of detractors.One common criticism of his technique is that he has to continue to buy into larger stocks. This limits the extent of price appreciation even if one holds the stock for an extended period. Even so, his approach has helped investors reap dividends over an extended period and picking up Buffett's portfolio picks which carry a good Zacks Rank continues to make for a great investment option.Buffett's $150 billion portfolio is heavily concentrated around his top 10 holdings. In fact, his top three holdings, namely, The Kraft Heinz Company  , Wells Fargo & Company  and The Coca-Cola Company  account for 19.2%, 17.9% and 11.2% of his total portfolio, respectively. A cursory look at the others towards the top of the holdings charts also offers similar results.And Buffett is expanding his position in several of these behemoths.

This is only natural given the company's fiscal first quarter performance and rising optimism around the release of the much awaited iPhone 8.The veteran investor outlined his central tenet of investing once again in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders. According to Buffett, investors who can avoid incurring substantial costs and hold a portfolio of large, domestic companies which rely on conservative methods of financing are setting themselves up for good returns.One of the highlights of Buffett's recent portfolio-related disclosures was the heightened exposure to the airline sector. Buffett added Southwest Airlines  to his holdings and raised his positions in American Airlines Group  , Delta Air Lines  and United Continental Holdings  . This is a significant development, given that Buffett had shunned the sector for a long time until last November. Until only recently, the sector was battling multiple headwinds, and this comes as great news for airlines stocks.But Buffett's decision is easily understandable, since in this case, the value investor in him has come to the fore.

The ratio is almost near the low end of 4.7 during the period.Additionally, the reading compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 11 and the median level is 9.83.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 84 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new May 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.06. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $73.94 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $82.70/share today.Because the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 81%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $82.70/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.89% if the stock gets called away at the May 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

For the full year, we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.43 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.27.Also, for the current quarter, SABR has seen 2 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 34 cents a share from 40 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 11.2% in the past month. | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Internet - Software and Services industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock -  .

In the last reported quarter, the company disappointed with its earnings results. Also, it carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), with a weak earnings history.The company reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings of 97 cents per share which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. This was because the company increased its expenditure on acquisitions.Expedia has embarked on a large number of acquisitions to strengthen its position in the domestic market and expand internationally. But while this has increased its top line, it has brought on board a variety of different businesses that have to be integrated into its core. Moreover, these businesses require separate marketing and promotion costs, which could be a reason why these costs are rising exponentially.The company's quarterly revenues fell 18.9% sequentially to $2.09 billion.However, revenues were up 23.3% year over year and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 billion. Also, gross bookings decreased 13.4% sequentially.Expedia expects revenue and profitability to be negatively impacted, as Easter has shifted to the second quarter this year. The company expects pressure on margin early this year due to investments in selling & marketing ahead of the travel season.In terms of technology & content expense, Expedia expects spending to increase a shade faster than revenues in the upcoming quarter. Also, for 2017, the company expects additional spending to be largely offset by lower infrastructure CapEx requirements.Right now, Expedia's earnings picture doesn't look good. In the last 60 days, three out of five analysts revised their earnings estimates downward for the current quarter.

Even the U.S. presidential election campaigns have not been free from hacking scandals and data breaches.Cybersecurity threats are anticipated to intensify in the New Year due to growing proliferation of cloud computing, Internet of things (IoT) and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trends. Increasing interconnectivity between different devices makes the whole system vulnerable if any one of the nodes gets affected by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.Moreover, prevalence of open source as standard for infrastructure software has aggravated the cybersecurity threats. Further, growing incidence of Ransomware is a major headwind for cybersecurity providers.Despite being blamed for its sluggish actions, the U.S. federal government's cyber security funding is one of the largest in the world.

A National Cyber Security Alliance study found that 60% of small businesses close their doors within six months of a data breach.\"Morgan Stanley expects cyber security products and services market to surpass $60 billion in 2016 and double by 2020.

This ratio is obtained by dividing a stock's current market price with its historical or estimated earnings. It measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings.So the golden rule is - the lower the P/E of a stock, the higher its value for investors. This is because value investors believe that a stock's current market price is not reflective of its historical/future earnings and therefore chances of outperformance are higher.Naturally, there are very few investors who pay attention to stocks with an increasing P/E. But this often overlooked trend can prove worthwhile in finding great stocks. Let's dig a little deeper.Investors should note that stock prices move in tandem with earnings performance. If earnings come in stronger, the price of a stock soars. Solid quarterly earnings and guidance in turn boost the earnings forecast, leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price.So, if the price is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of the stock's fundamental strength, expect some strong positives out of it as well as solid and faster earnings growth. Moreover, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years)(These two criteria show that the price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes)(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500)(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal)In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers. Only companies with a Strong Buy or Buy rating can get through. High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 5.Here are the five stocks: : The company is into domain names and Internet security with the Zacks Industry Rank in the top 25%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). : It is a renowned manufacturer of replacement alternators and starters for imported and domestic cars and light trucks.

That's if you count from the first computer-to-computer linkup on ARPANET in 1969. Even counting from the creation of the world wide web in 1989, the online revolution would be getting close to its 30s.While few companies are trading at the dizzying heights of the dot-com bubble, there are still quite a few names that trade as 'growth' stocks on the assumption of years left to internet growth.But what if the internet stops growing?Nearly everyone in the United States (89%) is connected and internet penetration is as high as 94% of the population in the United Kingdom. What happens when the growth that investors are assuming to drive internet-related companies just isn't there?Turns out it may already be happening.A new study by  (  ) suggests that internet growth has slowed considerably or even stopped altogether and it could be disastrous for a few tech names.A report by Adobe suggests that internet traffic may have reached its peak as fewer net new people come online every year. The company's first Advertising Demand Report was compiled from more than 1.1 trillion visits to North American and European websites over the 41 months to June 2016.[More from StreetAuthority.com:  ]Just over half (six of ten) of the websites were growing, increasing traffic by an average 51% per year but the remaining 40% of sites were seeing a rapid decline in traffic. Websites growing traffic reported an average of $0.17 in revenue per visit while declining sites booked $0.159 in sales per visitor.The total number of new websites has been flashing red for a couple of years. The number of internet sites reached one billion in 2014 before falling and only hit that mark again in March of 2016. The number of active sites has been stable around 1.085 billion for growth of under 4.2% annually over the last two years.Internet usage is still growing in emerging markets but the total number of websites seems to have reached a natural cap. While companies exposed to growth in developing nations may still be able to eke out gains, those with a large share of revenue from North America and Europe could see expectations come down significantly. (  ) is the world's largest domain name registrar and trades just 4% off its 52-week high. The company provides website registration and hosting services. Earnings missed estimates widely last quarter and the company has lost 27 cents per share over the last year. GoDaddy acquired its 17th company late September, buying a Serbian WordPress management site that allows users to manage multiple sites from one dashboard.Sales growth has slowed every year since the company started reporting in 2011. Not only will slower growth hit sales to domain registrations but competition for hosting could increase as companies fight for market share.[More from StreetAuthority.com:  ] (  ) has sole authority to register several top-level domains like .com and .net and operates two of the world's 13 root servers used to route internet traffic. Not only is growth limited on peak internet but the company may lose its protected exclusivity to register domains with ICANN.Senators Cruz, Lee and Duffy sent a letter to the Department of Justice in August expressing concern over the government's renewal of Verisign's exclusivity with ICANN to operate the global .com registry. While the company will keep its monopoly for the next couple of years, it may not have exclusivity for much longer.Sales growth has slowed to an average of just 4.8% over the last two years versus an average of 11.8% over the two prior years. The company's .com and .net top-level domains command nearly 50% of the internet but other domains like .tv and .org are growing in influence.Against the potential for falling sales at companies reliant on domain registration and web services, there are two sectors that could benefit as the internet reaches maturity. While ecommerce sales should continue to rise, the cost of advertising has already been falling for some time as competition increases for advertising dollars. Per click advertising rates on Google Adwords have fallen for 17-consecutive quarters.Retailers stand to benefit as ad rates decline on an estimated $23 billion in sector advertising from the sector by 2020, up from an estimate of $15.1 billion in 2016 according to eMarketer. On an average operating margin of just 15% and with marketing accounting for the majority of expenses, companies in the consumer discretionary sector may be able to boost profitability as ad rates fall. This sets the  (  ) up to gain on lower ad rates and higher consumer spending on a recovering economy.[More from StreetAuthority.com:  ]Finance & Insurance also stands to benefit as one of the largest spenders by sector on Google Adwords, with the sector spending as much as $4 billion on Google in 2015 alone. The  (  ) has underperformed the  by 8.3% over the last year on a shrinking net interest spread but may be able to improve profitability on lower ad rates.Risks To Consider:  Avoid companies with revenue tied directly to overall internet growth like domain registrars while positioning in companies that could benefit from decreasing advertising costs.

And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at VRSN given that, according to its RSI reading of 22.78, it is now in oversold territory.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet, VRSN's low RSI value isn't the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to VeriSign's earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 1 earnings estimate revisions move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for VRSN has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $3.17/share two months ago to just $3.20/share right now.If this wasn't enough, VeriSign also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Lifestage has been created by a 19-year old Facebook employee, Michael Sayman.In a post, Sayman said, \"Lifestage looks back at the days of Facebook from 2004 and explores what can be done if we went back and turned the crank all the way forward to 2016 with video-first.\"He further added, \"Back in 2004, Facebook was all about 'who I am'.

Moreover, if more than 20 students of a particular school sign up for Lifestage, other users belonging to the same school can \"view\" each other's profiles. The company has a strong focus on the age factor. Anyone above 21 years will not be able to view any other profile except their own.Though the app cannot guarantee the true identities of its users but it has equipped users to block/report people by a single swipe.However, Lifestage is posing concerns for a lot of people. Media reports have labeled it as creepy and parents are worrying about the lack of privacy settings.However, for Facebook, it is a measure aimed to contain the threat from Snapchat's rising popularity. Teenagers have long been flocking to Snapchat from Facebook. As per Statista, Facebook has only 8% teenagers in its gigantic 1.7 billion user base whereas over 23% of Snapchat users are reportedly teenagers. Facebook had tried to buy Snapchat in 2014 but CEO Evan Spiegel had turned the offer down.Lifestage underscores Facebook's focus on videos. Online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising. As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text-based substitutes, Facebook is trying to incorporate more and more video oriented content to bring in more ad dollars. Facebook also added that an initial survey found that people reacted 10 times more to a live video than regular videos.The app is currently available only for iOS devices but there is no word on the Android version launch. Also, Facebook doesn't have a good track record with standalone apps (remember, Poke, Slingshot, Moments, Camera etc). Given the not-so-encouraging initial response to Lifestage, it remains to be seen whether it proves to be another addition to its list of unsuccessful apps.At present, Facebook sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other tech stocks worth consideration include Nvidia Corp.  , MeetMe Inc  and VeriSign Inc  .

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 88 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new November 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $71.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $75.72/share today.Because the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $75.72/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $80.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.40% if the stock gets called away at the November 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $80.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

However, the reviews were somewhat polarizing, reflecting a stark difference in opinion between the tech community and the general public.Facebook had initially faltered with shipments of Rift when it launched it in the U.S this March. \"Unexpected shortage of components\" caused a delay in shipping of pre-orders of the much anticipated VR headset, much to the dismay of customers.Facebook had acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.1% return against the $75 commitment, or a 5.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $75 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisign Inc sees its shares decline 11.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $72.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.30 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.7% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $75 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $75 strike for the 5.7% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

Domain names in the zone for .com and .net together grew 7.1% year over year in the reported quarter to 142.5 million. VeriSign processed 10 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, an increase from 8.7 million in the year-ago quarter.VeriSign's renewal rate for the last quarter was 73.3%, up 80 basis points (bps) year over year. For the reported quarter, the exact renewal rate figures will be available after 45 days from Mar 31, 2016.

Technology and financial stocks propelled the S&P 500 higher as all 10 of the index's sectors ended the day in the green. A strong comeback for sectors which have suffered losses through most of the year was the most notable event of the day.Rising fuel prices, strong economic data and a change in the manner in which investors perceive a possible rate hike seem to be fuelling these gains. This implies that concerns that were weighing on investors for quite some time now have dissipated. Picking technology and financial stocks from the S&P 500 looks like a prudent move at this time.Markets were gripped with fear following the release of Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) minutes on May 18. But last Friday, a change in perception among investors was clearly perceptible as benchmarks ended higher despite speculations that a Fed rate hike in June was most likely. This is because a data dependent Fed has shown keenness in making such a move due to encouraging economic data, something which investors have begun to latch on.Tuesday marked the release of record new home sales data, which increased by 1.6% from March to 619,000 in April, settling at its highest level since Jan 2008. This report came on the heels of a number of positive economic indicators. This led investors to react positively with tech and financial stocks leading the markets to close in the green.Financials are a sector which will immediately benefit from a rate hike. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) and the Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (XLFS) have lost 1.2% and 2.5% year to date, respectively. But, on Tuesday, XLFS and XLF increased 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. Over the last five days the XLF and XLFS have gained 2.9% and 3.4%, respectively.Meanwhile, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) increased 1.9% and was the biggest advancer among the S&P 500 sectors during Tuesday's session. XLK has gained 1.6% up to now in May after a spate of poor earnings numbers from big tech names dragged down the sector last month. Under par results from Alphabet Inc.  , Microsoft Corporation  and Apple Inc.  were among the major disappointments last month on the tech stock front.However, as the earnings season draws to a close, it seems the tech sector's results have outperformed the broader index. Currently, we have Q1 results from 96.3% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Tech companies are down 5.4% while revenues have gained a slender 0.8%, with 67.3% beating EPS estimates and 56.4% topping revenue estimates.Excluding the Apple drag, total earnings for the rest of the sector would have been up 0.8%. In contrast, 480 S&P 500 members that have reported results with estimates for the still-to-come 20 members, total Q1 earnings are currently expected to be down 6.6% from the same period last year on 1.1% lower revenues.Additionally, revenues for Facebook, Inc.  increased 52% in the first quarter and its shares have gained more than 6% over the last month. Shares of cloud computing company salesforce.com, inc.  have gained 8.2% over May up to now after experiencing double-digit revenue growth across all its divisions. A recovery from Apple has also boosted the sector's odds of success.Shares of iPhone maker had declined after it reported its first quarterly decline in revenues in nearly 13 years. However, the company has made a recovery after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  reported in a regulatory filing that it has acquired 9.8 million shares or a $1 billion stake in Apple during the first quarter. The iPhone maker has gained nearly 8% since May 12. Together, these factors have ensured a gain of 3.8% for XLK during May so far.Investors seem to have shrugged off fears of a possible rate hike in June and are choosing to focus on the strong economic data which are fuelling such a move.

(  ) reporting results after the markets close on Apr 27 along with PayPal Holdings, Inc. (  ), and followed by VeriSign Inc. (  ) on Apr 28.The last week ended on a disappointing note for the sector with both tech behemoths Alphabet and Microsoft missing estimates, in stark contrast to the general trend witnessed this earnings season, wherein low expectations have provided an easy-to-beat hurdle for most companies. The  with total earnings of the companies, representing 49.6% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index, down 6% on 1% lower revenues.Let's take a look at how Facebook and other Internet stocks are poised ahead of their scheduled announcements. After outstanding results in the preceding earnings season, investors expect another fabulous quarter from the social media giant. Online and mobile advertising along with Instagram ads and user growth numbers will be areas of focus. Moreover, CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined a sci-fi future for the company at the F8 developers' conference, making his vision of transforming Facebook into something bigger than just a social media platform crystal clear. The 10-year strategy will definitely impact long term (positive or negative, remains to be seen) results but for the near-term, (read the first quarter results), the company's ESP of -2.27 combined with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) makes it difficult to predict an earnings beat. (Read:  ). PayPal, one of the leading names in online payment, reportedly had over 175 million active accounts at the end of 2015. PayPal is focusing on its core capabilities and is operating with greater flexibility for success in the digital payments space. Its foray into mobile payments with the Braintree acquisition and its One Touch system reflects the same. However, intensifying competition in the payments -- especially mobile -- space can be a headwind for the company. Currently, PayPal's Earnings ESP of +3.33% when combined with a Zacks Rank #2 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter. However, earlier our model didn't predict a beat. (Read:  ). For Internet infrastructure assurance and domain registry services provider, VeriSign, renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names remain primary growth drivers for the company. Moreover, there are chances of VeriSign and ICANN extending the .com Registry agreement to match the expected 10-year term of the root zone maintainer contract to guarantee stability of root operations. However, search engine adjustments on domain monetization, rising expenses and increasing competition offer considerable resistance. VeriSign at present carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The market has also been adjusting prices and expectations aren't running too high at the moment. The backdrop is favorable for companies that are about to report, given the prevalent uncertainties.

If you haven't already,  . However, with first-quarter earnings season just around the corner, it's important to look beyond dividends, and assess the fundamental health of each stock you're planning on adding to your portfolio.Today, I'll share 40 top growth stocks that meet eight criteria that are essential to capital appreciation. First, let's briefly run down these eight metrics, which are all components of  .This is one of the hardest numbers to fake. Sales are the lifeblood of any business-whether it is selling a service, a gadget, raw materials or anything else under the sun. There are many ways that companies can temporarily find capital, such as selling off assets or making outside investments, but it's always bad news if people aren't buying what a business is selling. Great companies make sure that sales increase month to month and year to year so they can expand, dominate their industry and deliver big returns to shareholders.Making profits is all about the margin-the difference between production costs and the retail price. A company that's able to expand its operating margins is usually a company that has a dominant position in its industry. This company can raise prices without seeing a drop-off in sales. That's a nice place to be. But if a company has to keep cutting prices to entice reluctant buyers, it's not a good sign.Earnings growth is the heart of all good financial analysis. Simply, \"earnings\" is just another word for \"profits.\" This is a deceptively simple idea that is too often overlooked. The mainstream media is always finding excuses why a company didn't post bigger profits-consumer spending was down, a key contract fell through, you name it! But I'm not in the business of making excuses. I'm in the business of finding companies that are posting bigger profits no matter what the rest of Wall Street is doing. As long as any company is vital and able to grow its earnings consistently, its stock will do well.While earnings growth is important, I also want to see a company's rate of growth increase. This is what I refer to as Earnings Momentum. If a stock has shown that it is making more and more profits every quarter, it's logical to think more of those profits will be returned to shareholders. But if a business is seeing earnings shrink or dip into the red, I do not consider it to be a good investment.One key metric I closely examine is whether or not a stock is consistently beating analysts' estimates. Beating estimates is called an \"Earnings Surprise.\" I measure these as a percentage, calculated as the difference between actual earnings and consensus estimates. I grade over 5,000 stocks on this key metric, and only stocks with the highest grades are worthy of my recommendation. If a stock beats Wall Street's earnings forecast by a significant amount, share prices can rally dramatically. This is why I closely monitor the market to find stocks that regularly post earnings surprises. When I find an unsung stock that has regularly performed better than the \"experts\" have predicted, I recommend it on the premise that it should top expectations again-and see shares surge when it does.Upward revisions are an important indicator of a company's future success. You see, analysts are paid to estimate a company's earnings outlook. If an analyst makes a wrong estimate that ends up costing investors money, that analyst could be out of a job. If a number of Wall Street analysts start to move their forecasts higher, it's a good bet that the stock will outperform expectations and deliver market-beating returns to investors since positive revisions are never made lightly.Simply, cash flow is the money a company has left over after paying for the costs of its business. This is a crucial indicator of success because brisk sales and revenue don't always add up to big profits or an ability to expand. If every cent of a company's cash is tied up paying bills, a big sales number has a limited impact. If a company is flush with capital and on top of its game, it will deliver shareholders big profits!This is one of my gold standards. In simple terms, Return on Equity is the amount of profits a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. ROE tells me how efficiently a company is managing its resources. I can't interview every senior manager at a company, so I like to think of ROE as a report card for management. To check out a company's Return on Equity, simply take a business's net income and divide that by the amount of money shareholders own in common stock. If a company is run well, its net income will dramatically outpace what investors have pumped into it. If a company is lazy or poorly run, the value of shares investors own will be more than the profits the company actually produces.By using these eight metrics as your starting point, you can use the same tactics I do to add top growth stocks. As you'll soon see for yourself, this strategy pays back in spades. Now that you know these eight metrics (and 40 top stocks to buy), you can go out and invest with confidence in this market!The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eriSign reported Q1 2016 earnings recently.

Moreover, CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined a sci-fi future for the company at the F8 developers' conference, making his vision of transforming Facebook into something bigger than just a social media platform crystal clear. The 10-year strategy will definitely impact long term (positive or negative, remains to be seen) results but for the near-term, (read the first quarter results), the company's ESP of -2.27 combined with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) makes it difficult to predict an earnings beat. (Read:  ). PayPal, one of the leading names in online payment, reportedly had over 175 million active accounts at the end of 2015. PayPal is focusing on its core capabilities and is operating with greater flexibility for success in the digital payments space. Its foray into mobile payments with the Braintree acquisition and its One Touch system reflects the same. However, intensifying competition in the payments -- especially mobile -- space can be a headwind for the company. Currently, PayPal's Earnings ESP of +3.33% when combined with a Zacks Rank #2 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter. However, earlier our model didn't predict a beat. (Read:  ). For Internet infrastructure assurance and domain registry services provider, VeriSign, renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names remain primary growth drivers for the company. Moreover, there are chances of VeriSign and ICANN extending the .com Registry agreement to match the expected 10-year term of the root zone maintainer contract to guarantee stability of root operations. However, search engine adjustments on domain monetization, rising expenses and increasing competition offer considerable resistance. VeriSign at present carries a Zacks Rank #2. (Read:  ).Amid persisting growth challenges, technology companies are having a hard time beating estimates this quarter. The market has also been adjusting prices and expectations aren't running too high at the moment. The backdrop is favourable for companies that are about to report, given the prevalent uncertainties. Traditionally, tech sector prices have been responsive to earnings surprises and we might be in for some unexpected ones as well!So stay Tuned!

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" , a global provider of domain name registry services, recently reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings of 77 cents a share, up from 63 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 79 cents per share compared with 70 cents in the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 6.5% year over year to $272.6 million, easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $269.8 million.In the quarter, VeriSign Registry Services added 4.6 million net new names.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 85 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new May 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $76.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $83.45/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.06% return on the cash commitment, or 17.45% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $80.00 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.15. If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $83.45/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.83% if the stock gets called away at the May 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.97% boost of extra return to the investor, or 21.37% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 31%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $83.45) to be 24%.

Much of that has been the continued sluggish pace of recovery in Asia and Europe. Source: iStockphoto.comBut these 7 A-rated tech stocks are continuing their upward trajectory, regardless of broader market challenges. Some are strictly US focused, so they avoid the issue of a stronger dollar and a weak global economy entirely.Others are such dominant brands that they rise above many of their competitors during challenging times. While smaller firms are struggling for market share, larger companies gain client interest as they get more risk averse and tend to stay with well-known brands that have a history of success.But what they all share is solid technical and fundamental momentum, which in the end is what it's all about.That is why it comes as no surprise to learn that Boston Dynamics' parent company, (GOOGL, )\u00a0is putting it up for sale. Simply put, Boston Dynamics is just not a moneymaker. (  ,  ) is the second most highly valued company on the planet in a tight race with  (  ). Although its market cap has fallen from the half trillion dollar mark, it is well positioned to recover.The power behind GOOG at this point is online advertising: It has been the reigning champ in this sector and will continue to be regardless of growing competition. The fact is, the market is continuing to expand, so while other firms are grabbing market share, there's plenty of growth for everyone.Also, there's a big tax case -  (  ) vs. IRS - that looks to be coming to a head soon and may have significant implications regarding how overseas subsidiaries are taxed and how it is reported at the U.S. home office. (  ) certainly has cemented its social media empire, but it has never rested on its laurels. FB continues to grow its presence with new services as well as new products like its Oculus Rift virtual reality technology.Its VR work is emblematic of the long-term vision that FB continues to execute, regardless of the short-term desires of the markets. Many don't remember what a terrible response there was to FB's initial forays into online advertising.But FB was patient and continued to build out its capacity and security and when technology allowed more people to access FB products more easily on their smartphones and tablets, online advertising started to pop. Now it's growing by leaps and bounds, quarter after quarter and fueling FB growth.It's very likely that the Rift may not score significant revenue for FB in the short term. But long term, VR is going to be very big. And FB will be ready when it is.In fact, considering the 170% return of the S&P 500 in the last seven years, these stocks have been downright awful. (  ) has had quite a ride in the past five years, losing more than half its value over that time frame.But at this point, it has righted the ship and is on the upswing again. Although  are in the bargain bin, there remains a strong trend toward renewables.Plus, the  will be a big incentive for major solar players like FSLR over the next five years it's in effect. This has thrown off FSLR's bookings, since customers are either slowing down or speeding up their projects to get in on the credit.Also, according to GTM Research, energy storage was up 243% in 2015, compared to 2014. That is important because it means that solar is a more viable 24-hour energy source and it will help spark demand.This was further confirmed with FSLR's recent earnings report that showed the company is back to its moneymaking ways. (  ) is a quintessentially Chinese Internet company. When I say Chinese Internet company, I mean it has online operations that run from gaming to cybersecurity.Its chief claim to fame is its cybersecurity: Given the general distrust that major nations have of other nations' ability to hack into government and corporate systems, many large countries have opted to grow their own security firms.This kind of domestic branding is very important, not only to individuals but to all aspects of society. And it's a driving force in QIHU's growth. You see how well top U.S. cybersecurity firms are performing; in China the need is significantly larger, especially for a domestic security player.QIHU also continues to buy up smaller firms that will strengthen its diverse brand and help diversify its revenue stream. (  ) is one of the first Internet security firms. It is the first choice for registering domain names. And remember, it's not just about grabbing a name that you want - it's big business.Many firms will register the corporate name as well as similar names (in spelling or pronunciation) as well as descriptive names that it can use to set up promotional campaigns, etc.And these names have their own market where they are traded and sold to interested parties. That means there remains huge demand for this service.But VRSN is also a U.S.-based cybersecurity firm. It has a suite of products that are analytical as well as proactive in keeping companies safe and also has cloud-based domain name service security.The bottom line is, as the need for security grows, VRSN is a great proxy. (  ) is one of oldest online CRM firms around.This was one of the first sectors where the growing bandwidth of the Internet made clear its potential to revolutionize all aspects of business.CRM is essentially the combining of sales, marketing and services in one completely integrated space. That means there's total visibility about customers and customer experience with the products or systems their looking to take to the next level.Sales can see how marketing is delivering the brand and service can see by the sales how to anticipate what is selling and what isn't.Obviously, it gets far more nuanced than that, but the larger point is as speed and mobility grow, so will the demand for PEGA. Look at the selloff in February as a great way to buy at a discount. (  ) is a telecom service provider in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and central Pennsylvania.Basically, it has built a solid base in what was once the rural Mid-Atlantic, and now it is growing its list of services to include Internet, cable and wireless.Now that the U.S. is well connected and broadband speeds continue to grow rapidly, it makes it easier for people to live remotely from their offices and still remain engaged and productive, with more flexible work schedules.That means these once-rural areas are now seeing an influx of urban and suburban professionals who are opting out of the rat race and crumbling infrastructures in many cities.A pending merger with wireless carrier  (  ) has cleared all the regulatory hurdles and is awaiting approval in coming weeks.

Shares were up 3% yesterday at the close of trading.In June, the company had received a buyout proposal from Hongyi along with other investors for $77 per share, valuing the company at $9 billion. CEO Hongyi alone owns around 16% of the company.The idea back then was to delist from the U.S. and dismantle the VCE structure to make it eligible for a listing in China. The Chinese government was relaxing its grip on the financial markets, making it more conducive for local players wishing to raise funds. Also, the Chinese stock market was on a huge bull run and listing in China would fetch much higher valuations.However, The Wall Street Journal observes that the crash of \"mainland Chinese stock markets this summer sparked doubt among investors that the deals would go through. Spreads on announced take-private offers, which were nonbinding, widened dramatically with some stocks, including Qihoo 360, trading at almost half of the offer prices.\"The Wall Street Journal added that the Chinese government's timely action, \"halted the decline and regulators reopened the domestic initial public offering market after a freeze on new listings in July\", and thereby providing ample respite to frayed Chinese investors. However, the slowdown caused the valuations for takeover deals to come down considerably and as a result only a handful buyout deals materialized. Notably, privatization deals for E-House China Holdings Limited and Mindray Medical International Ltd were reduced from their original proposed offers.In that respect Qihoo seems to be lucky. Shares of Qihoo, which tanked to the range of $42-$48 in September, have bounced back to $67.96 as of Dec 1, 2015. At yesterday's closing price, the $77 offer gives shareholders a 13.3% premium.The transaction is expected to be concluded in the next few weeks.

The company's non-GAAP operating margin was 62.7% in the quarter, up from 60.6% in the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP EBITDA was $181.9 million, up 6.7% year over year.Exiting the quarter, the company's cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were nearly $1.9 billion compared with $1.4 billion at the end of 2014.Operating cash flow in the last nine months was approximately $463 million, up from $430 million reported in the year-ago period. The company's capital expenditures for the quarter were $7 million.VeriSign repurchased approximately $156 million worth of shares in the quarter. The total amount remaining under the company's share buyback program as of Sep 30, 2015 was $805 million.For 2015, VeriSign forecasts revenues in the range of $1.050 billion to $1.055 billion (previously projected range was $1.043 billion to $1.057 billion), which represents an annual growth rate of 4% to 4.5%.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%, while operating margin is forecast to be between 61% and 62%.Interest expense and non-operating income, net is expected to be within the range of $104 million to $108 million (earlier forecast was $104 million to $110 million) for 2015.Capital expenditure is expected in the range of $37 to $42 million for the year.We believe that this quarter was significant for VeriSign as not only did the company deliver strong results but management also remained upbeat for 2015.The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names remain primary growth drivers for the company. VeriSign will be increasing .net fees to $7.46 from $6.79, from Feb 1, 2016, which is expected to be accretive to its long-term revenue growth. In addition, an expected increase in the domain name base will remain a key driver of its growth.Also, we believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results over the long run. Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in its network security products and also in Network NIA services business.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to marketing remain the primary headwinds in the near term. Further, significant competition from AT&T Inc.  , Verizon  and Akamai Technologies  , Inc. in the NIA segment remains a major concern.Currently, VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Shares of Qihoo closed up 1.7% to $73 on Friday.As per the terms of the deal, shareholders will be offered $77 per ADS (2 ADS equals to three Class A or Class B shares) while Class A & B shares will each be entitled to receive $51.33 in cash without interest. This represents 16.6% premium to the company's closing price of $66.05 per share as of Jun 16, 2015 when the offer was made while it is 32.7% more than the company's ADS s average closing price in the last 30 days before receiving the buyout offer. At Friday's closing price, the buyout price offers a 5.5% premium.In June, Qihoo had received a buyout proposal from Hongyi along with other investors for $77 per share, valuing the company at around $9.3 billion. Hongyi along with president and director of Qihoo, Xiangdong Qi, who own a majority stake (61%) of the company, have already voted in favor of the deal.The idea back then was to delist from the U.S. and dismantle the VCE structure to make it eligible for a listing in China. The Chinese government was relaxing its grip on the financial markets, making it more conducive for local players wishing to raise funds. Also, the Chinese stock market was on a huge bull run and listing in China would have fetched much higher valuations.However, the estimated $5 trillion crash of the Chinese equity markets this summer left investors skeptical of these \"go private\" deals. Spreads on these non binding private offers had increased as stock prices fell. Some stocks including Qihoo had lost half their market price during the Chinese market rout. However, with the intervention of the Chinese government, markets have started to stabilize and the reopening of the IPO market has given a fresh boost to these deals.As per a Bloomberg report, in 2015, nearly 38 listed Chinese companies were offered to go private in deals worth a record $30 billion. With Qihoo going private, it is most likely that others will also follow suit as the Chinese stock market has improved considerably.As per Forbes, \"Zhou, Qi and the consortium get to take Qihoo private at a throwaway price given the fact that holders of the ADS were unable to correctly value the company. It wouldn't surprise me one bit if Qihoo 360 goes public in China or Hong Kong at 2x the buyout price pretty soon and then does another ADS issue on our shores a couple of years down the road. Our loss is Zhou and his consortium's gain\".The consortium of investors, which includes Citic Guoan, Golden Brick Silk Road Capital, Sequoia Capital China, Ping An Insurance, Sunshine Insurance, Huatai Ruilian and Huasheng Capital, will raise $3 billion in debt and another $400 million as bridge loan facility to fund the deal. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.Qihoo, one of the largest Internet security companies in China, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include Actua Corp.  , Ellie Mae, Inc.  and VeriSign, Inc.  . All carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 87 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new February 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $81.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $87.97/share today.Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.65% return on the cash commitment, or 15.30% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $87.97/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.29% if the stock gets called away at the February 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 84 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new November 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 8 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.92 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $69.48/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 28% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 95%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.16% return on the cash commitment, or 0.69% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.97. If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSN stock at the current price level of $69.48/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.02% if the stock gets called away at the November 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.27% boost of extra return to the investor, or 18.56% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 43%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 25%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $69.48) to be 19%.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the March 2016 put at the $60 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.67. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.8% return against the $60 commitment, or a 4.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $60 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisign Inc sees its shares decline 11.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $58.33 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.67 from $60), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.3% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the March 2016 put at the $60 strike for the 4.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Verisign Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $67.71) to be 19%.

Last quarter, the company's earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Verisign reported year-over-year growth in both its top and bottom-lines in the last reported quarter.We believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results over the long run. Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in its network security products. We are particularly optimistic about VeriSign's Network NIA services business. With the rapid adoption of cloud computing, cyber security has become a major concern for enterprises.According to research firm, MarketsandMarkets, the cyber security market is expected to touch $170.21 billion by 2020 from $106.32 billion in 2015; growing at an annual growth rate of 9.8%. VeriSign's partnership with Juniper Networks, Inc.  will boost its growth in the fast growing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market.Also, VeriSign is likely to benefit from the ongoing uptrend in the active domain name business for .com and .net TLDs. According to a recent Domain Name Industry Brief, as many as six million domain names were added to the Internet in the last quarter. Total registered domain names across the globe crossed 294 million (across all TLDs) as of Mar 2015.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to marketing remain the primary headwinds in the near term.

Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in its network security products.The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names drive VeriSign's top line. VeriSign increased .net fees to $6.79 from $6.18, from Feb 1, 2015 onward, which is expected to be accretive to its long-term revenues. In addition, an expected increase in the domain name base will remain a key driver of its growth.The introduction of new gTLDs is an adjacent growth opportunity. The company is in talks with ICANN for registering 14 new gTLD applications including 12 IDNs, which will expand the company's business significantly. The company has already won registries for .comsec and 11 IDN TLDs, out of which 8 are transliterations of .com and 3 of .net. Additionally, international expansion through IDNs will increase Verisign's penetration into the growing APAC markets. We believe that along with price increases this will aid results over the long term.However, under the agreement with ICANN, VeriSign is subject to certain restrictions in the operation of .com, .net and .name domains on pricing, bundling and use of registrars. However, these restrictions do not apply to ccTLDs. The introduction of new IDN TLDs and gTLDs by ICANN will further intensify competition. An increase in domain name availability in the marketplace while introducing new choices for end-users could also contribute to their confusion around brand preference, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on the company's business.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to marketing remain the primary headwinds in the near term.

This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below. : VeriSign currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 69 cents. : VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some stocks worth considering that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apple Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.38% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Amazon.com Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +175.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Akamai Technologies, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.96% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: PCL), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Verisign Inc (Symbol: VRSN), the market cap is now $7.47 billion, versus Plum Creek Timber Co., Inc. (Symbol: PCL) at $7.46 billion.Below is a chart of Verisign Inc versus Plum Creek Timber Co., Inc. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (VRSN plotted in blue; PCL plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of VRSN vs. PCL:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.At the closing bell, VRSN is off about 0.7%, while PCL is off about 2.1% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ), a global provider of domain name registry services, recently reported fourth-quarter and full year 2014 results.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the June put at the $40 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 24 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 0.6% return against the $40 commitment, or a 1.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSN's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $40 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisign Inc sees its shares decline 29% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $39.76 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 24 cents from $40), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisign Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June put at the $40 strike for the 1.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Verisign Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $56.41) to be 23%.

The strong growth was primarily driven by higher revenues and margin expansion.Revenues increased 4.7% year over year to $255.0 million, marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $254.0 million. VeriSign Registry Services added 1.15 million net new names. Active domain names in the zone for .com and .net increased 3.3% year over year in the reported quarter (14.9 million .com names and 15.1 Million .net names).VeriSign processed 8.7 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, up from 8.3 million in the year-ago quarter.VeriSign's renewal rate for the second quarter was 71.8%, down 90 basis points (bps) year over year.

Exact renewal rate figures will be available 45 days after the end of the quarter.As a percentage of revenues, total operating expenses decreased to 45.3% in the second quarter compared with 45.5% in the year-ago quarter.On a year-over-year basis, sales & marketing (S&M) expenses increased 10 bps, while research & development (R&D) expenses decreased 80 bps, overall leading to the decline in operating expenses.Operating income stood at $139,500, up 23.9% year over year. Operating margin was 54.7% in the reported quarter compared with 54.5% in the year-ago period. The expansion in operating margin was primarily due to lower operating expenses.Cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were $1.47 billion compared with $1.72 billion in 2013.

Outside of  , and more recently  , he has typically steered clear of technology investments. However, it was reported in May that his company  bought approximately 11 million shares of  . While on the surface there are reasons to be concerned about the telecom giant, shrewd value and income investors should seriously consider following \"The Oracle\" into this investment. Admittedly, Verizon's debt gives investors reason to pause. As of its most recent filing, Verizon's long-term debt-to-equity ratio was an astounding seven times. Coming off the largest debt offering ever, which saw the company place nearly $50 billion in paper, Verizon now appears to be in a much riskier position as far as its balance sheet is concerned.But debt used correctly can be beneficial for shareholders. The reason for this large debt issuance was Verizon Communications' acquisition of the crown jewel of its business: Verizon Wireless. Verizon Wireless had been a jointly owned entity, with Verizon owning 55% and  owning the other 45%. What initially started as a friendly joint agreement in the early 2000's quickly became a detriment to Verizon shareholders amid the huge growth in wireless telecommunications.Verizon took out the loan (and also issued shares) in order to fund a $130 billion buyout of Vodafone's stake of the wireless unit. The money was not excessively expensive in this low-rate environment: The bundle of notes ranged from a three-year note priced at 2.5% to a 30-year note priced at 6.55%. Does debt make the equity investment riskier? Sure--now Verizon has to pay new debt holders before that money can float down to the income statement as shareholder earnings. This requires continued strong operations from its newly fully acquired wireless segment. That might be easier said than done--while Verizon Wireless is the largest carrier in the United States, but it must watch the competition. A particularly pesky rival has been John Legere's reinvigorated  .Through its \"Un-carrier\" initiatives, T-Mobile is shaking things up. In addition to growing subscriptions (commonly referred to in the industry as subs), T-Mobile is forcing other carriers to present better deals to customers. And in this rather specific example, there is a direct and negative correlation between customers and shareholders. As average revenue per account goes down, less money is available for both debt holders and then shareholders. How has Verizon Wireless held up recently?Source: Verizon.In the scheme of things, Verizon's retail postpaid subscriber accounts -- the Holy Grail of smartphone revenue drivers -- are holding up well. The average revenue per account has risen on the back of more lines being added to accounts. It is something to watch as T-Mobile continues to hammer the entrenched duopoly of  and Verizon, but not anything to be overly concerned with right now.Another important figure is churn rate -- the percentage of subscribers who discontinue their service during a particular period. For what it's worth, on a seasonally adjusted basis, Verizon appears to be remarkably stable in the mid-0.90% range -- although it does typically jump above 1% in Verizon's first quarter due to seasonality issues. While this is also something Verizon investors should be aware of, at the moment the company is handling competition well. Warren Buffett is one of the shrewdest investors alive. He's made himself a billionaire and many early investors millionaires many times over. So when he focuses his attention on an investment it's a good idea for you to pay attention as well. What he sees in Verizon is a reinvented company of sorts that increased its net income on a year-over-year basis in the latest quarter by 87%; even with recent share dilution, EPS increased by nearly 30%.On top of that you have the classic signs of a value play, a price-to-sales ratio under 11 on a trailing-12-month basis, and an excellent yield of 4.3% in this yield-starved environment. Buffett once said \"[i]t's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\" But when you can buy a wonderful company at a wonderful price, it's time to take notice.Apple recently recruited a secret-development \"dream team\" to guarantee its newest smart device was kept hidden from the public for as long as possible.

The Notes are being offered to qualified institutional buyers under private placement. These Notes have been issued in two tranches of same amounts but with varying interest rates and maturities. The offering is expected to close on Aug 6, 2014, subject to customary closing conditions.The tranches of $450 million each, carrying an annual interest rate of 0.50% and 1.75%, are due to mature on Aug 15, 2020 and Aug 15, 2021, respectively. The new issuance will require the company to pay semi-annual interests in arrears on Feb 15 and Aug 15 of each year, beginning Feb 15, 2015.The Notes due to mature in 2020 are convertible into Qihoo's American Depositary Shares (ADS), at an initial rate of 7.9789 ADS per US$1,000 principal amount of the Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately US$125.33 per ADS). On the other hand, the Notes due to mature in 2021 can be converted at an initial rate of 8.2799 ADS per US$1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately US$120.77 per ADS).In order to manage over allotment, the joint book-running managers for the offering have been granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional US$67.5 principal amount of both the Notes. Qihoo expects to use the net proceeds from the offerings primarily for general corporate purposes.Qihoo continues to solidify its position as the undisputed leader in the Chinese Internet market with its PC security products covering nearly 95% of Chinese PC Internet users and the mobile security solutions covering approximately 70% of Chinese smartphone users.At quarter-end, Qihoo had cash and cash equivalents of $901.6 million versus $1,013.5 million in the prior quarter. The company had $6.0 billion in total debt (long-term plus short-term).

While I don't get into specific financial analysis or valuation estimates, I shared this with my investors after discovering a tremendous amount of confusion around VRSN, its capabilities, and its current regulatory status.---------------------------Founded in 1995, VeriSign (  ) was initially a \"certificate authority\" or issuer of \"digital certificates,\" 1 but sold this part of their business in 2010 to focus on a far better line of business, one that would usually be described as a \"monopoly.\" Of course, VRSN is far too prudent to use the m-word, and instead prefers \"registry services\" as the title for the line of business responsible for nearly all revenues and profits. But, as I detail below, \"registry services\" is really secret code for \"the internet won't work without us, and we have contracts that ensure our ongoing monopolist opportunities will continue to fill our pockets.\"Before delving into the details of VRSN's business and those contracts, it is important to understand something called top-level domains (TLDs). TLDs are the last part of every internet domain, examples of common TLDs would be .com, .net, .org, etc. Each time anyone - anywhere in the world - goes to a website of their choosing, they do so by typing a name (e.g., cnn, google, facebook, etc.) followed by a TLD (e.g., cnn.com, google.com, etc). 2In the digital world, VRSN is the \"  \" of all .com domain names AND \"the  of domain names within the .com\" generic top-level domain (gTLDs). 3 As a registry, VRSN maintains \"the master directory of all second-level domain names in these TLDs\" 4 (e.g., johndoe.com, example.com, facebook.com, etc). To fully comprehend the significance of these terms, consider the following examples:It is VRSN's role as the exclusive registry for .com that is by far the largest contributor to revenues and profits. Fortunately, there are only a few factors to consider when thinking about the .com registry and any potential impact this may have on VRSN's success going forward:It is worth noting that VRSN does provide the registry for a variety of other TLDs including .net, .name, .tv, .cc, and others. But, for brevity's sake we will simply note that VRSN's other registry operations are generally based on terms even more favorable (especially in terms of pricing) than those found in their .com Registry Agreement.Additionally, ICANN is in the early stages of introducing a whole slew of new gTLDs possibilities including such \"blockbusters\" as .today, .ninja, .company, and .tips! 11 While much has been made of this new \"land-rush\" of domains, .ninja hardly seems like a plausible threat to the long establish standard of .com or any of the alternatives already available. Nonetheless, it is always good to be prepared. Accordingly, should any of the new gTLDs prove more popular than anyone expected, VRSN stands to benefit as applicants for approximately 200 of these new gTLDs are already in contract with VRSN to provide back-end registry services.VRSN's role as \"authoritative directory\" - while fundamental to the daily functioning of the internet - involves a slightly complicated web of contracts and organizations: At the very foundation of the internet is a role called Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) which is the right and responsibility to assign names among domains. 12 Because the original architecture of the Internet was developed in the United States, this responsibility was initially managed by the US government. However, since the 1990s, the US government has offloaded much of the IANA responsibility to a non-profit group known as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN was essentially created for the purpose of being able to contract  the running of the IANA function - a power given to them (and periodically renewed since) by a contract from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). 13 While ICANN manages the IANA function under contract to the NTIA, the actual work of maintaining the core list of gTLD domains and their operators is handled by something known as the \"root zone.\" The technical work of maintaining the root zone is managed under a cooperative agreement between the US Department of Commerce 14 and VRSN.The reason the above detail is important to understand is that recent market pessimism for VRSN seems to indicate that most investors simply misunderstand - or are too lazy to even try - the dynamics of the non-registry part of VRSN's business. This became especially clear - and all the more important - given the government's recent noise-making:Ultimately, an investment in VRSN is a bet on the future of the Internet, and VRSN's continued role as a stable and reliable provider of several core functionalities. Developments related to the NTIA's departure may provide some near-term turbulence, but we suspect any turbulence will largely be noise and misunderstandings. Either way, we are confident that VRSN's dominant position will remain intact, and may even rise stronger whenever the dust settles. At just 14 times earnings, we suspect manning the .com toll both may be significantly more promising and enduring than current market consensus seems to think.1 Digital certificates serve as a trusted third party in cryptography to enable secure connections over the internet. For example, if two parties (i.e. you and me) are seeking to securely transact or communicate over the internet, a method is needed to verify each party is representing themselves truthfully. As a third party, trusted by both parties, a certificate authority serves as the verifier to each party that 1) both of us are who we say we are, and 2) the transaction is thus valid and secure.2 If drawing an analogy to the physical world, the name might be the street address, while the TLD might be the state or country of such address. Either way,  the name and the TLD are necessary to avoid getting lost in both the physical and digital worlds.3 From Wikipedia: \"a gTLD is one of the categories of TLDs maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.\" \"The core group of generic TLDs consist of the .com, .info, .net, and .org domains.\"4 While a much smaller part of their business, VRSN is no one-trick pony, it is also the exclusive registry and authoritative directory for .net, .cc, .tv, .name, .gov, .jobs, and .edu domain names.5 Popular registrars include GoDaddy, Network Solutions, and eNom to name a few.6 As of YE 2013, VRSN reported 112 million .com domains and 15.2 .net domains.7 8 The operations for .com, .net, and the .org TLDs were acquired in VRSN's acquisition of Network Solutions. VRSN would later divest the retail part of Network Solutions (i.e. the domain name registrar), while retaining the wholesale domain name registry that is now their main line of business.9 Except that VRSN will have \"the right to increase the price of a .com domain name during the term . . . due to the imposition of any new Consensus Policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the Security or Stability of the Domain Name System (DNS) not to exceed 7% above the price in the prior year.\"10 In both cases, Company is VRSN.11 On June 13, 2012, ICANN announced it had received 1,930 applications for over 1,400 unique new gTLDs.12 (amazon.com = online retailer,  a site about the rain forest).13 The NTIA would actually \"let out for bid\" the contract for the management of the IANA function. However, the contract has historically been written in such a way that there was only one entity, ICANN, that could realistically win the contract.14 of which the NTIA is a component.15 between the NTIA and ICANN.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["egardless of whether VeriSign (  ) posts a gain or decline in tonight's after-hours following its Q1 report, the stock historically is a strong play for the long side.VRSN has recorded an earnings-driven after-hours gain in 12 quarters tracked in our database over the last nine years.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new December 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.60.

This year, in addition to Apple and Facebook, RIMM \u2014 now Blackberry () \u2014 and Yahoo have joined the fray.A lot of investors think they should pay attention to the press coverage. I think the opposite is true. The press isn't in business to help you make money; the press is in the business of selling advertising. The pundits and practitioners that fill the airwaves and pages of investing magazines are giving their readers what they want, including in some cases, hype and hyperbole.Because of the press coverage, clients ask about Apple all the time and here\u2019s what I say to them: We have no idea what\u2019s going to happen to Apple. They have great products but everyone already knows that. There is no reason to assume we \u2014 or any other investment manager \u2013 has an edge on the direction of Apple\u2019s stock. Just think, if you had an edge would you want to publish it all over the airwaves?All this energy around stocks heavily covered in the media seems to have a impact on returns. Academics have studied this phenomenon, including , both at INSEAD.Overall, the academics collectively conclude that highly publicized companies tend to, but not always, underperform those with little publicity; since they attract a lot of capital that alone can push prices above a level which could by justified by another metric like cash flow. These academics made another interesting observation: the more a company is covered, the more disagreement there is among professional analysts about the future performance of the stocks.That\u2019s a big surprise.One would expect that media coverage would provide more information and a common set of facts which would lead well trained analysts to the same conclusion. In fact, more information seems to lead to more disagreement. We don\u2019t know why this occurs, but if the professionals can\u2019t seem to sort out the mess of information flying at them about hyped stocks, then certainly the average investors can\u2019t.More evidence that you may want to shun stocks with a lot of attention comes from a paper by . Their paper, \u201cIs the Market Mad? Evidence from Mad Money,\u201d traces the typical returns for stocks touted by former hedge fund manager Jim Cramer on his CNBC television show. That paper demonstrates that after Cramer mentions the stock, it soars as investors rush in. Nearly all the upside generated from a mention by the energetic TV host of Mad Money, however, disappears within 12 trading days.There are hundreds, maybe even thousands, of reasons why Apple is so heavily covered. Its stock has ricocheted between $390 and $700. Its products, the iPhones and iPads, are ubiquitous. After years of being led by charismatic founder Steve Jobs, the company has struggled to replace its visionary and creative genius.None of this really matters.The point is if you buy (sell or hold) Apple \u2013 or any story stock \u2014 based on what you read in the news alone, you\u2019re investing for all the wrong reasons. In other words, whether it\u2019s Apple or a bio-tech promising a cure for cancer, if you\u2019re basing your investing decision on news and hype, you\u2019re picking based on hype, which may not be the best way to make an investment decision.

As a first step, it has asked the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to bring together all global stakeholders to develop a proposal for the transition.VeriSign, which operates the infrastructure for the .com, .net and.gov, stated that the NTIA decision will not affect its operations in any way as its Internet functions are much different from those included in the announcement.Further, the company clarified that functions performed by VeriSign that come under the purview of the NTIA announcement have been performed as a community service spanning three decades without compensation and hence their non-renewal will not affect profitability going forward.Nevertheless, this announcement seems to be a major setback for VeriSign. It is likely to be an overhang on the registration business, which is a major contributor of revenues (contributed nearly $1.0 billion revenue in 2013). We believe that the less U.S. control will increase risk for VeriSign as it will reduce company's ability to renew .com and .net contract price as per its own terms.Nevertheless, the whole process of relinquishing control will take some-time. Hence, we believe that it will have no significant negative impact on VeriSign's near term results.We believe that increasing domain name registration, the renewal of the .com contract and the price hike in .net domain name will boost VeriSign's top-line in the near term. Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities from its network security products as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue to grow.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to the .com contract renewal remain the primary headwinds in the near term. Moreover, significant competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) in the network intelligence and availability (NIA) segment remains a major concern.Currently, Verisign has a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n early trading on Monday, shares of Biogen Idec (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the S&P 500 index, trading up 3.9%.

The combined solution can manage and protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and at the same time connect public and private clouds securely.Per the deal, Juniper Networks will combine its DDoS Secure technology with Verisign's DDoS Protection service, a cloud-based offering that protects data centers and enterprise applications from DDoS attacks. DDoS is the most common form of cyber-attack that uses a large number of computers to bring down the targeted network by choking it with too much traffic.DDoS attacks can come at the network level or at the application level. The partnership will better equip organizations to handle private and public cloud technology and control business applications securely. VeriSign has significant growth opportunities from its network security products as DDoS attacks continue to grow. We believe that Juniper Networks will also gain significantly from this collaboration.Due to the rapid adoption of cloud computing technologies, security and data protection have become the top priorities for enterprises in recent times. According to Gartner, the cloud-based security services market will rise from $2.1 billion in 2013 to $3.1 billion in 2015. We believe that the interoperability of Juniper's DDoS Secure and Verisign's cloud-based DDoS Protection service will help both to extend on-premise and cloud-based DDoS security services to their customers.According to research from ReportsnReports.com, global cyber security spending is expected to reach $165.0 million by 2023. We believe that this significant growth in spending bodes well for Juniper Networks.Additionally, the company's expansion into the software defined network segment is expected to strengthen its position in the networking space.While the company's new products, cost reduction initiatives and improving execution remain the growth catalysts, increasing competition from  (  ) and  (  ), uncertain economic conditions and constrained federal spending are the possible headwinds.Currently, Juniper Networks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n early trading on Friday, shares of Verisign (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the S&P 500 index, trading up 9.9%.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSN options chain for the new May 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 69 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.31 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.16/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

For SMT's full year estimate, we have seen 2 estimates go higher in the past 30 days, compared to none moving lower. This trend has helped the consensus estimate to trend higher, going from 12 cents per share a month ago to its current level at 20 cents.This positive shift in estimates has made some investors take notice and buy the stock. In fact, SMT has seen some pretty solid trading lately, as the company has moved higher by almost 51.0% in the past month.If Smart Technologies can keep up this great momentum on the earnings estimate front and continue to impress analysts, we could see more gains ahead for this company, suggesting that you might want to put SMT on your watch list for the future.Other top-ranked stocks worth considering in this space include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

The index lost over three percent and suffered its worst day since November 2011. Despite the rough patch, I found a stock that looks to have found support.Domain registration company  closed at $50.18 yesterday and this could be a good sign for the company's investors. The $50 level acted as resistance several times at the end of 2012 and again in 2013. The stock finally moved back above 50 last September-I say back above 50 because the stock had been there before, but that was all the way back on 2001.Many times a resistance point becomes support once it is able to break through. The reason for this is human nature. Investors see the resistance and hesitate to buy the stock. Once it breaks through, they tell themselves that they will buy it when it comes back down to the resistance point. In the case of VRSN, the stock moved all the way up to $62.96 before the recent pullback.VeriSign has plenty of doubters based on the sentiment indicators. The current short interest ratio is 13.7 and that is one of the highest I have seen in a while. As of April 1, the most recent short interest report, there are over 23 million shares sold short and that number has increased steadily over the last month.Short sellers aren't the only ones down on VRSN either. There are nine analysts following the company and only two have the stock rated as a \"buy\" while six have it rated as a \"hold\" and one has it rated as a \"sell\".VeriSign is scheduled to announce earnings later this month and the analysts expect the company to earn $0.63 a share for the quarter. If the analysts are accurate, that would be an increase over the last quarter and the same quarter a year ago. In both of those cases the company earned $0.58 per share.With the potential support at $50 and the  sentiment toward the stock, it won't take much for the stock to take off. If the stock starts to climb, the short sellers will have to start buying to cover and that will add buying pressure to the stock. If the company were to beat the analyst estimates, we could see a really sharp rally. There would also be a good chance for a few upgrades out of the skeptical analyst crowd.The stock is the most oversold it has been since November 2012, but oversold can always become more oversold. While I like the stock at this price, I would give it some room to play out. I would buy it here with a target of $65 or more in the next 6-9 months.

Research & development (R&D) expense increased a modest 20 bps from the year-ago quarter.The sequential rise in operating expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to a 50 bps expansion in G&A and an 80 bps upside in S&M.Operating margin was 53.0% in the quarter compared with 58.8% in the year-ago quarter and 54.5% in the previous quarter. The contraction in operating margin was primarily due to higher operating expenses on year-over-year as well as quarter-over-quarter basis. Net income margin was 36.3% compared with 38.6% in the year-ago quarter and 34.7% in the previous quarter.During the fourth quarter, Verisign liquidated for tax purposes one of its domestic subsidiaries which will allow it to claim a worthless stock deduction on its 2013 federal income tax return. The company recorded an income tax benefit of $375.3 million related to the worthless stock deduction, net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions in the quarter.VeriSign sold certain cost method investments during the quarter and realized a pre-tax non-operating gain of $15.8 million.The company also plans to repatriate approximately $700.0 to $800.0 million of offshore cash during the second or third quarter of 2014. During the quarter, the company recorded an income tax expense of approximately $167.0 million related to the taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of the intended repatriation in 2014.Cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were $1.72 billion (out of which $389.0 million was held in the U.S.) compared with $1.80 billion in the previous quarter.Operating cash flow was $147.0 million in the quarter, up from $134.0 million in the third quarter.

Earnings (minus stock-based compensation) increased 19.6% year over year but remained flat on a sequential basis.Revenues surged 9.0% year over year and 1.8% sequentially to $243.7 million, slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $241.0 million. Approximately 61.0% of the revenues were from the U.S, while the remaining came from overseas.VeriSign Registry Services added 1.55 million net new names compared with 1.22 million in the previous quarter. Active domain names in the zone for .com and .net increased 5.0% year over year to $125.9 million (.com 110.7 million and .net 15.2 million) in the quarter.VeriSign processed 8.3 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, up from 7.8 million in the year-ago quarter but slightly down from 8.7 million in the previous quarter.VeriSign estimates renewal rate to be approximately 72.5% in the third quarter, flat compared with the year-ago quarter. Exact renewal rate figures will be available post 45 days of the end of the quarter. In the second quarter of 2013, renewal rate was 72.7%.As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses declined to 45.5% in the third quarter compared with 48.1% in the year-ago quarter but increased from 44.8% in the previous quarter.A sharp decline in sales & marketing (S&M) as well as general & administrative (G&A) expenses, down 90 basis points (bps) and 250 bps, respectively, drove the year-over-year decline. Research & development (R&D) expense increased a modest 30 bps from the year-ago quarter.The sequential rise in operating expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to a 140 bps expansion in G&A and a 10 bps upside in R&D, which offset a 30 bps decrease in S&M.Operating margin was 54.5% in the quarter compared with 52.0% in the year-ago quarter and 55.2% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to lower operating expenses. However, a sharp rise in operating expenses on a sequential basis negatively impacted operating margin in the quarter.Net income margin was 34.7% compared with 35.5% in the year-ago quarter and 36.1% in the previous quarter.Cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were $1.80 billion (out of which $389.0 million was held in the U.S.) compared with $2.0 billion in the previous quarter.Operating cash flow was $134.0 million in the quarter, down from $147.0 million in the second quarter. Free cash flow was $134.0 million compared with $132.0 million in the previous quarter.VeriSign repurchased approximately 6.8 million shares for $331.0 million in the quarter.VeriSign intends to focus more on developing new revenue streams in 2013. The company expects to add 1.0 to 1.5 million net new names in the .com and .net registry for the fourth quarter of 2013.During the fourth quarter, the company expects to liquidate one of its domestic subsidiaries for tax purpose, which may result in an income tax benefit of $300.0 million to $400.0 million.For full year 2013, VeriSign forecasts revenues in the range of $960.0 to $965.0 million (up from prior outlook of $952.0 to $962.0 million), which represents an annual growth rate of 10% (up from the range of 9.0% to 10.0%). Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%, while operating margin is forecast to be between 58.0% and 59.0%.Interest expense and non-operating income, net is expected to be within the range of $60.0-$62.0 million for fiscal 2013. Capital expenditure is expected in the range of $65.0 million to $75.0 million (revised from $60.0 million to $80.0 million) for fiscal 2013.We believe that growing generic top-level domain (\"gTLD\") customer base, international expansion through IDNs (internationalized domain names), strong growth in the Network Intelligence and Availability (\"NIA\") services and investments on developing new intellectual properties will boost revenues and profitability going forward.However, negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing marketing expenses related to the introduction of new gTLDs and IDNs remain the primary headwinds in the near term. Moreover, the ongoing cash repatriation issue remains a concern with respect to liquidity in the near term.Additionally, significant competition from  ,  and  in the NIA segment remains a concern going forward.Currently, VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["erisign (  ), the provider of registry services for all .com and .net domain names, posted revenue growth of 9% annually in Q3 2013 to $244 million. We expect the company to sustain its moderate growth rate in the future, as we believe the market share of of .com and .net domain names in overall Internet domains could decline in the long-run. The restriction on .com domain fee hikes until November 2018, further supports our moderate growth outlook.The company's net income was recorded at $81 million during the third quarter. Its operating margin rose to 54.5% as compared to 51.9% in Q3 2012, due to leverage in sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. We expect the company's profits to increase on an y-o-y basis in the fourth quarter as well.Verisign added 1.55 million net new names during the third quarter, to end it with 125.9 million active domain names, which represented an y-o-y increase of 5%. This came in above its initial estimate of 1 million and 1.4 million net additions.The domain name renewal rate was recorded at about 72.5% (estimated) in Q3 2013, which was flat as compared to the prior year and 20 basis points down sequentially. The renewal rate for first-time renewals continued to be affected by macroeconomic challenges in Europe and changes made to search algorithms by Google. We believe the renewal rate could see some stabilization in the near future.Verisign's management forecasts the number of net additions to its .com and .net base to be in the range of 1.1 million and 1.5 million names in the fourth quarter. We believe the future growth rate of .com/.net domain name base will be lower as compared to the overall Internet domain name growth rate, on account of rising competition from country code domain names and the pending introduction of new gTLDs (generic top-level domains).In the fourth quarter, Verisign expects to liquidate one of its domestic subsidiaries, for tax purposes, through which it could obtain an income tax benefit of about $300 million to $400 million.The company is focusing its R&D resources on innovation and intellectual property strategy. It continues to file several patents for its new technologies, that support its core registry operations. We believe these activities could provide an additional revenue stream in the future, and we will look for updates on the company's IP strategy in the future.The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) plans on expansion of the gTLD universe, with the addition of around 300-1,000 new gTLDs annually. Verisign has applied for 14 of these new gTLDs, and applicants for around 220 new gTLDs had originally chosen Verisign to be their back-end registry services provider. There continues to be uncertainty regarding this process, and hence this revenue stream cannot be estimated at this stage.We are in the process of revising our price estimate for Verisign's stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["egardless of whether VeriSign (  ) posts a gain or decline in tonight's after-hours following its Q2 report, the stock historically is a strong play for the long side.VRSN has recorded an earnings-driven after-hours gain in 11 quarters tracked in our database over the last nine years.

Earnings (minus stock-based compensation) increased 19.6% year over year but remained flat on a sequential basis.Revenues surged 9.0% year over year and 1.8% sequentially to $243.7 million, slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $241.0 million. Approximately 61.0% of the revenues were from the U.S, while the remaining came from overseas.VeriSign Registry Services added 1.55 million net new names compared with 1.22 million in the previous quarter. Active domain names in the zone for .com and .net increased 5.0% year over year to $125.9 million (.com 110.7 million and .net 15.2 million) in the quarter.VeriSign processed 8.3 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, up from 7.8 million in the year-ago quarter but slightly down from 8.7 million in the previous quarter.VeriSign estimates renewal rate to be approximately 72.5% in the third quarter, flat compared with the year-ago quarter. Exact renewal rate figures will be available post 45 days of the end of the quarter. In the second quarter of 2013, renewal rate was 72.7%.As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses declined to 45.5% in the third quarter compared with 48.1% in the year-ago quarter but increased from 44.8% in the previous quarter.A sharp decline in sales & marketing (S&M) as well as general & administrative (G&A) expenses, down 90 basis points (bps) and 250 bps, respectively, drove the year-over-year decline. Research & development (R&D) expense increased a modest 30 bps from the year-ago quarter.The sequential rise in operating expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to a 140 bps expansion in G&A and a 10 bps upside in R&D, which offset a 30 bps decrease in S&M.Operating margin was 54.5% in the quarter compared with 52.0% in the year-ago quarter and 55.2% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to lower operating expenses. However, a sharp rise in operating expenses on a sequential basis negatively impacted operating margin in the quarter.Net income margin was 34.7% compared with 35.5% in the year-ago quarter and 36.1% in the previous quarter.Cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were $1.80 billion (out of which $389.0 million was held in the U.S.) compared with $2.0 billion in the previous quarter.Operating cash flow was $134.0 million in the quarter, down from $147.0 million in the second quarter. Free cash flow was $134.0 million compared with $132.0 million in the previous quarter.VeriSign repurchased approximately 6.8 million shares for $331.0 million in the quarter.VeriSign intends to focus more on developing new revenue streams in 2013. The company expects to add 1.0 to 1.5 million net new names in the .com and .net registry for the fourth quarter of 2013.During the fourth quarter, the company expects to liquidate one of its domestic subsidiaries for tax purpose, which may result in an income tax benefit of $300.0 million to $400.0 million.For full year 2013, VeriSign forecasts revenues in the range of $960.0 to $965.0 million (up from prior outlook of $952.0 to $962.0 million), which represents an annual growth rate of 10% (up from the range of 9.0% to 10.0%). Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%, while operating margin is forecast to be between 58.0% and 59.0%.Interest expense and non-operating income, net is expected to be within the range of $60.0-$62.0 million for fiscal 2013. Capital expenditure is expected in the range of $65.0 million to $75.0 million (revised from $60.0 million to $80.0 million) for fiscal 2013.We believe that growing generic top-level domain (\"gTLD\") customer base, international expansion through IDNs (internationalized domain names), strong growth in the Network Intelligence and Availability (\"NIA\") services and investments on developing new intellectual properties will boost revenues and profitability going forward.However, negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing marketing expenses related to the introduction of new gTLDs and IDNs remain the primary headwinds in the near term. Moreover, the ongoing cash repatriation issue remains a concern with respect to liquidity in the near term.Additionally, significant competition from  ,  and  in the NIA segment remains a concern going forward.Currently, VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["erisign (  ), the provider of registry services for all .com and .net domain names, posted revenue growth of 9% annually in Q3 2013 to $244 million. We expect the company to sustain its moderate growth rate in the future, as we believe the market share of of .com and .net domain names in overall Internet domains could decline in the long-run. The restriction on .com domain fee hikes until November 2018, further supports our moderate growth outlook.The company's net income was recorded at $81 million during the third quarter. Its operating margin rose to 54.5% as compared to 51.9% in Q3 2012, due to leverage in sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. We expect the company's profits to increase on an y-o-y basis in the fourth quarter as well.Verisign added 1.55 million net new names during the third quarter, to end it with 125.9 million active domain names, which represented an y-o-y increase of 5%. This came in above its initial estimate of 1 million and 1.4 million net additions.The domain name renewal rate was recorded at about 72.5% (estimated) in Q3 2013, which was flat as compared to the prior year and 20 basis points down sequentially. The renewal rate for first-time renewals continued to be affected by macroeconomic challenges in Europe and changes made to search algorithms by Google. We believe the renewal rate could see some stabilization in the near future.Verisign's management forecasts the number of net additions to its .com and .net base to be in the range of 1.1 million and 1.5 million names in the fourth quarter. We believe the future growth rate of .com/.net domain name base will be lower as compared to the overall Internet domain name growth rate, on account of rising competition from country code domain names and the pending introduction of new gTLDs (generic top-level domains).In the fourth quarter, Verisign expects to liquidate one of its domestic subsidiaries, for tax purposes, through which it could obtain an income tax benefit of about $300 million to $400 million.The company is focusing its R&D resources on innovation and intellectual property strategy. It continues to file several patents for its new technologies, that support its core registry operations. We believe these activities could provide an additional revenue stream in the future, and we will look for updates on the company's IP strategy in the future.The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) plans on expansion of the gTLD universe, with the addition of around 300-1,000 new gTLDs annually. Verisign has applied for 14 of these new gTLDs, and applicants for around 220 new gTLDs had originally chosen Verisign to be their back-end registry services provider. There continues to be uncertainty regarding this process, and hence this revenue stream cannot be estimated at this stage.We are in the process of revising our price estimate for Verisign's stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["erisign (  ), the provider of registry services for all .com and .net domain names, will announce its Q3 2013 financial results on October 24. We expect moderate revenue growth for the company, which will be driven by an increase in .com/.net domain names. We believe the future growth rate in .com and .net domain names will be lower than the overall Internet domain name growth rate due to rising competition from country code domain names as well as other factors. Our moderate revenue growth outlook further stems from the the restriction on .com domain fee hikes until November 2018.Verisign reported net revenue growth of 12% annually in Q2 2013 to $239 million. Its operating margin rose from 50% in Q2 2012 to 55.2% in Q2 2013, owing to 12% and 10% fall in sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses respectively. We expect the company's profitability to rise on an annual basis in the third quarter as well. The total number of registered domains in .com and .net was seen at 124.3 million at the end of Q2 2013, which represented a 4.9% annual and 1% sequential increase. The company had estimated the number of net additions to its .com and .net base in the third quarter to be between 1 million and 1.4 million. We estimate this figure to be somewhere around the high end of Verisign's guidance, based on the updates posted to the zone daily by the company.We believe the market share of.com and .net domain names in overall Internet domains will come down from 48.1% (2012) owing to competition from country code domain names as well as pending introduction of new gTLDs.The domain name renewal rate decreased to 72.4% in Q2 2013 from 72.9% in the same quarter last year. This decline was attributable to economic challenges in Europe and changes made to search algorithms by Google, which negatively affected monetization on certain domains. It will be interesting to see where the figure stands in this quarter as we expect this metric to see some stabilization in the near-future.Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) plans to expand the gTLD universe, with the addition of around 300-1,000 new gTLDs annually. Verisign has applied for 14 of these new gTLDs, and applicants for around 220 new gTLDs had originally chosen Verisign to be their back-end registry services provider. While these applications are expected to open new revenue streams, no significant revenue from these new gTLDs (if any) is forecast before 2014. We will track updates on the ICANN approval process during the .We will update our price estimate for Verisign's stock after the earnings release.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["VeriSign reported strong third-quarter 2014 results with both earnings and revenues growing year over year. We believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs, growth in the NIA services and investments in intellectual properties will boost results over the long run. Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in its network security products. However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to marketing remain the primary headwinds in the near term. Moreover, intensifying competition in the NIA segment is a major concern. Thus, we maintain our Neutral recommendation and set a price target of $58.00.Based in Reston, CA, VeriSign Inc.

It also operates a diverse array of network infrastructure, including two of the Internet's thirteen root name servers and the back-end systems for the .gov, .jobs, and .edu top-level domains. The company's share price has risen almost 15% since January 24, after the company reported steady revenue growth in 2012 and gross margins improved to almost 80%.We believe that the market is being over optimistic about Verisign's prospects. Its primary revenue growth driver for the past few years, the annual increase in the .com domain registration fee was fixed by the  (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). As a result, the company is now dependent upon the growth in the .com and .net domain name registrations and the annual hikes in .net domain names. The .com domain names have been losing market share to other gTLDs (generic Top-Level Domains) over the past couple of years, and new gTLDs are expected to be launched in the coming years. This will further increase the pressure on the revenues from .com domain registrations. Also, as the .net domain names constitute only 15% of the .com/.net domain mix, the impact of .net domain registrations on company-wide revenue growth is expected to be minimal. Limited revenue growth potential supports our  , which is 15% below the current market price.The .com domains constitute close to ~90% of the .com/.net domain name mix, currently governed by VeriSign. The restriction on .com domain fee hikes under the new agreement will result in the .com domain price staying steady at $7.85 until November 2018. At the same time, the agreement for .net domain registry permits price hikes of up to 10% per year.The growth of .net domain name registrations (~9%) has been slightly outpacing that of .com domain names (~6%), and we estimate the growth of the combined fee to slow down to 2% annually and reach about $8.50 by 2019. We estimate that the combined fee would have to increase to about $10 in the long term to support the current market price.As part of its contract with ICANN, VeriSign has to ensure 100% reliability of the .com/.net Domain Name Servers (DNS), for it to be eligible for contract renewal. To achieve this reliability, the company maintains layers of redundancy in its infrastructure to prevent an outage that can potentially render half of the internet inaccessible. The permitted price hikes in the .com and .net domain registration fees over the past decade had helped VeriSign maintain gross margin levels in the 70%-80% range, while investing in infrastructure simultaneously. With the .com domain name registration fee fixed, we now expect its margins to decline to about 70% in the long term. This will happen as the company maintains redundancy in the underlying infrastructure to ensure reliability and hence its eligibility for a contract renewal.Another threat to the company's margins comes from the fee it pays to ICANN for each registered .com domain name. As per the old agreement, the company paid $4.5 million as a quarterly lump sum fee, regardless of the number of domain names registered. However, as per the proposed agreement the company will be paying up to $0.25 per year for any .com registered, renewed or transferred domain. At the current levels it could translate to an additional annual expense of $10 million from the .com domains alone.A restructuring of the infrastructure could, however, lead to the associated costs going down and margins not declining as expected. The fair value of VeriSign will increase to about $47, if the margins were to stay steady at current levels of 80% over the forecast period instead of declining.The combined market share of .com/.net domains has been declining consistently over the past few years. This decline is a result of the growing popularity of country code domain names such as .uk, .in, .cn and .de. Currently, ICANN is overseeing an expansion of the gTLD universe, with an aim of adding 300-1000 new gTLDs every year. We expect the new gTLDs to negatively impact .com/.net market share of overall domain names. VeriSign has applied for 14 of these new TLDs. However, the process for the introduction of these new gTLDs is expected to take time, and we don't see a major adverse impact in the near term.We have a revised $41 Trefis price estimate for VeriSign, which is 15% below the current market price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hen CERN released the World Wide Web in 1991, few thought it would amount to much.

I, for one, was only 24 when the bubble burst in 2000.Fortunately, the space is about to go through a major change that could set off another boom for those able to get in front. Starting March 23, the InternetCorporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)will increase the availibility of Web addresses by assigning some 1,900 domain suffixes, the part of a website address that ends in .com, .org or .net. The project has been five years in the making, but this year looks like the watershed moment for many of the companies that will benefit. An additional 1,900 domain suffixes represents an increase of 8,600% over the 22 currently in use.And while the project may not bring tech the valuations seen in the 1990s, it couldmean a surge inrevenue for some industries in the sector. Specifically, companies in Web registry, search and advertising stand to benefit.Here are fourstocks I believe could reap the most advantages. , which currently manages the .com and .net domains, may see some increased competition, as other operators grab new domains and users flock to them. Still, the company just signed a six-year contract with the U.S. Department ofCommerce to run the main database of domains, which basically amounts to six years of guaranteed revenue.Company management expects between 900,000 and 1.3 million net additional addresses were added in the fourth quarter of last year. Dot-com registrations have grown from about 20 million in 2001 to 105.9 million in November 2012, according to Verisign. That is an annualized growth rate of 16.4% with little slowdown in sight and with a government contract on the fees. is sure to see an increase in search as Internet users wade through the new maze of Web addresses. The $239-billion behemoth should also see increased advertising as companies pay to highlight their new addresses. The increase in search, not only from the new websites, but also from the transformational change in mobility, could benefit Google more than any other company.The company has been able to sustain an 18%compound growth rate in revenue during the past five years, even while making a jump into new niches such as tablets and smartphones.

The better-than-expected result was primarily driven by strong revenue growth and margin expansion.Total revenue increased 13.0% year over year and 3.0% sequentially to $230.2 million, slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $229.0 million. Approximately 60% of the total revenue was from the U.S, while the remaining came from overseas. U.S. revenues increased 12.1% year over year, while international revenues grew 14.5% from the year-ago quarter.VeriSign Registry Services added 1.25 million net new names in the quarter. Active domain names in the zone for .com and .net increased 6.4% year over year to $121.1 million (.com 106.2 million and .net 14.9 million) in the quarter. VeriSign processed 8.0 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, up 1.0% from the year-ago quarter.VeriSign estimates renewal rate to be approximately 72.9% in the fourth quarter compared with 73.5% in the year-ago quarter. Exact renewal rate figures will be available post 45 days of the end of the quarter. In the third quarter, renewal rate was 72.5%.During the quarter, the U.S. Department of Commerce approved VeriSign's renewal agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to serve as the authoritative operator for the .com registry for the term commencing Dec 1, 2012 through Nov 30, 2018.VeriSign also announced hike in the registry fee for .net domain names. The hiked rate of $5.62 (up from $5.11) will be effective from Jul 1, 2013.Operating expenses plunged 14.4% year over year and 11.7% sequentially to $94.8 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses declined to 41.2% in the fourth quarter compared with 54.4% in the year-ago quarter and 48.1% in the previous quarter. These significant improvements in operating expenses were primarily driven by sharp decline in sales & marketing (S&A) and general & administrative (G&A) expenses.Operating income improved significantly as a result of lower-than-expected growth in operating expenses and higher revenue base. Operating income surged 40.7% year over year and 16.9% sequentially to $135.9 million. Operating margin was 59.0% in the quarter, much better than 47.4% in the year-ago quarter and 52.0% in the previous quarter.Net income surged 56.2% year over year and 14.2% sequentially to $87.5 million. Earnings per share (\"EPS\") jumped 54.3% from the year-ago quarter and 17.4% from the previous quarter to 54 cents.Cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were $1.56 billion compared with $1.49 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $697.6 million compared with $100.0 million in the previous quarter. This significant jump in debt was due to the addition of convertible debentures currently valued at $598.0 million.Operating cash flow was $171.0 million in the quarter, up from $122.0 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $155.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. VeriSign repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares for $94.0 million in the fourth quarter.VeriSign intends to focus more on developing new revenue streams in 2013. The company expects to add 2.0 million to 2.4 million net new names in the .com and .net registry in first quarter of 2013.For full year 2013, VeriSign forecasts revenues to be in the range of $945.0 to $960.0 million, which represents an annual growth rate of 8% to 10%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%, while operating margin is forecasted to be at least 57%.We believe that the renewal of the .com contract is a major positive for VeriSign going forward. Moreover, the price hike in .net domain name will boost its top-line growth. Additionally, growing generic top-level domain (\"gTLD\") customer base, international expansion through IDNs (internationalized domain names) and strong growth in the Network Intelligence and Availability (\"NIA\") services will further boost revenues and profitability.However, continuing macro-economic headwinds particularly in Europe, negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to the .com contract renewal remain the primary headwinds in the near term. Moreover, significant competition from  ,  and  in the NIA segment remains a major concern.Currently, VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eading internet infrastructure services provider  (  ) recently announced a hike in the registry domain name fee for .net top-level domain names, in agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).The price increase will be effective from July 1, 2013.

Most recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce approved the renewal of VeriSign's agreement with the ICANN to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the .com registry. The term of this agreement, effective from December 1, 2012, would continue through November 30, 2018.However, the agreement includes certain new terms and conditions. VeriSign's current pricing of $7.85 per domain name registration will continue for the six-year term of the agreement. It also mentions that VeriSign will not be entitled to four price escalations of up to 7% during the six-year period.Nevertheless, the price increase will positively impact the top line. In 2011, VeriSign completed its four-year restructuring plans, which included divesting or winding down non-core businesses, the sale of Authentication Services business, and relocation of its headquarters.This restructuring has resulted in a more efficient and more focused VeriSign with opportunities ahead.

In 2007, VeriSign decided to focus its attention on its core competencies to provide highly scaleable, reliable and secure Internet infrastructure services to customers around the world.Hence, the company divested a number of non-core businesses in its portfolio, such as communications, billing and commerce, content delivery, messaging and enterprise security services. Most recently, the company divested its Authentication Services business.VeriSign has been consistently repurchasing shares to utilize excess cash generated from the sale of business. In 2011, the company repurchased approximately 16.3 million shares for $534.6 million. In 2010, VeriSign repurchased approximately 15.7 million shares for $437.7 million.

With the sale of most non-core operations, continuing operations primarily consist of Naming Services (comprising Registry Services and Network Intelligence and Availability [NIA] Services).The company recently appointed a new CFO and it remains to be seen if a change in management will affect the company's performance as the previous management was instrumental in undertaking the bulk of the restructuring that the company has undergone in the last few years.Meanwhile, VeriSign faces stiff competition from the likes of  (  ) and others.

VeriSign posted a net income of 44 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, earnings estimates for 2013 have gone down by 6 cents as all the 4 analysts covering the stock lowered their estimates.VeriSign's registry, security and communications services are essential for the smooth functioning of the online world. However, as expected, growth in domain name addition has slowed down. The company added 1.37 million net new domain names in the third quarter, below its guidance of 1.6 million - 1.9 million.This was primarily due to continuous changes in search algorithms and weak economic environment in Europe. The guidance was also disappointing as management expects to add 0.9 million to 1.3 million net names in the fourth quarter. In addition, the company also narrowed its revenue guidance to $870 million and $875 million in 2012, from the previous guidance of $870 million - $880 million.Meanwhile, under the Cooperative Agreement between the Department of Commerce and VeriSign, the latter submitted its agreement on June 26, 2012 with ICANN relating to the renewal agreement to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the .com.However, the Commerce Department is currently conducting a review of pricing with the Department of Justice and this review in all probability will continue beyond the stipulated deadline of November 30, 2012. In such a case, a 6-month extension of the .com registry agreement would come into effect. The delay causes uncertainty over the renewal agreement and terms of pricing.Competition continues to be stiff for VeriSign from the likes of  (  ) and others. Hence, we maintain our Neutral recommendation as we believe that most of the positives are already discounted at current levels and the current environment demands caution from the investors.Our Neutral recommendation is supported by a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term rating of Hold.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["erisign (  ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal year 2012 earnings on 24 January. The company had a mixed year with the Department of Commerce approving an amended contract with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) for .com registry. As per the amended .com registry contract, Verisign has to now contend with a fixed .com domain registration fee for the duration of the renewed contract. You can read about how the amended contract affects our valuation for the company  . The company has already announced  , effective July 1, 2013 as per the contract for the .net registry.With the erstwhile primary revenue growth driver, the .com domain registration fee fixed, we will look for the company's strategy to mitigate the expected negative impact of a fixed fee on the gross margins. Also, the company's revenue growth now is heavily dependent upon the growth in registered .com domain names. We will look for the company's plans for promoting the .com and .net domain names as the other domains gain prominence and as ICANN plans to introduce several new generic top-level domain (gTLDS).VeriSign is primarily a domain name registrar which has the exclusive registry rights for .com and .net domains from ICANN. It competes with other domain name registry providers like NeuStar, Employ Media, and Afilias to win new, and maintain existing registry rights.The .com domains constitute close to ~90% of the .com/.net domain name mix, currently governed by VeriSign, and the .com registry fee together with the permitted fee hikes was the primary revenue growth driver for the company. The restriction on .com registry fee hike will result in the .com domain price staying steady at $7.85 until November 2018.The agreement for .net domain registry permits price hikes of up to 10% per year, and with the growth of .net domain names (~9%) slightly outpacing that of .com domain names (~6%), the .net domain registry will be the primary revenue growth driver for the company. We currently estimate the growth of the combined fee to slow down to 2% annually and reach $8 by 2019.The company's revenue has grown at 13% y-o-y to $643 million during the first nine months of the current fiscal year. We expect the growth to continue in Q4 and the annual growth to be similar. However, with the .com domain registry fee fixed, we would look for the company's plans to diversify its revenue stream over the coming years.A secondary impact of the restriction on .com registration fee hike will be on the gross margins of the company. The margins had increased steadily as the company exercised all the permitted price hikes under the contract, which ended 30 November, 2012. We expect the margins to decline steadily over the forecast period even as the company tries to maintain them at current levels by cutting down on its costs. For the fiscal year 2012, we expect the gross margins to be close to the 80% margins the company commanded during the January to September period.ICANN is overseeing an expansion of the gTLD universe with an aim of adding 300-1000 new gTLDs every year. We expect the new gTLDs to negatively impact .com/.net market share of overall domain names. VeriSign has applied for 14 of these new TLDs. However, the process for the introduction of these new gTLDs is expected to take time and we don't see a major adverse impact in the near term.We have a $38 Trefis price estimate for VeriSign, which is at par with the market price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he  is down -.99 to 2,646.93.

And any selling to relieve  conditions in the broader market could help some of these stocks slide to levels where these same buyers may be inclined to change their minds.Consider this: biotechnology and drug stocks may be vulnerable to headline risk next week, as the 30th Annual JP Morgan Global Healthcare Conference gets underway. Heading into trading on Monday, shares of one biotechnology,  (  ) are well over 1% and moving toward short-term lows above the 200-day moving average.Note that shares of CELG were trading at yearly highs at the beginning of the week, and are still up more than 10% from their last close in  territory in late November.

The sell-off in Rigel Pharma comes as traders and investors take profits from the stock's rally back toward its highest levels of the year in late last month.This profit-taking has RIGL finishing oversold for the past five consecutive sessions, surpassing even the  extremes from the stock's previous correction in the first half of February.

In the past few years, VeriSign has considerably streamlined its business to focus on providing, reliable and secure Internet infrastructure services. The disposal of non-core businesses boosted margins while the buyback of shares helped the bottom line.The company at present has a new management team. Additionally, we think increased domain fees and ICANN's plan to increase the number of generic domain names should positively impact its results. Earnings estimates have increased recently.Hence, we upgrade our recommendation to Outperform from Neutral.

The company reported lackluster results in the fist nine months due to weak mobile device sales in France, higher VAT rates and challenging economic conditions in Egypt and Cote d'Ivoire.Although Conquests 2015, exiting of minority holdings, expanding in emerging markets and cost-saving programs remain in place, we believe persistently weak economic conditions, labor concerns, lower mobile termination rates and unfavorable regulatory measures across its key European markets might restrict the upside potential of the stock.France Telecom continues to invest in the deployment of mobile broadband and fiber optic network in France, 2G and 3G roaming facilities as well as expansion in emerging markets. We believe these investments might increase the company's cost of operation, resulting in lower profits.Latest Posts on the Zacks  : (  ) is cutting its workforce over the next few quarters as part of its effort to increase efficiency by reducing costs in a challenging operating environment. As a result, the company would incur job cut related charges in the fourth quarter.In an investor conference Citi's Chief Executive Vikram Pandit said that the job cut will involve around 4,500 positions or less than 2% of its total workforce. The elimination process will start this quarter. The layoffs would result in the company incurring $400 million charge in the fourth quarter.Citi in fact has an efficiency goal of trimming 3% to 5% of its expenses or about $2 billion each year. In the first three quarters of 2011, the company has already achieved $1.4 billion in cost savings.Besides the job cut and its related charges, the Citi chief also said that the company will likely incur an additional $500 million in charges in the fourth quarter. Of this, $200 million stems from accounting-related charges associated with its own debt and $300 million related to hedging losses resulting from tightening of credit spreads. The $500 million charge is, however, subject to the spreads at the end of the quarter. Yet, Citi will record $300 million from valuation adjustment due to the lowering of the Japanese corporate tax rates.With the job cut decision, Citi joins the bandwagon of other biggies such as  (  ) and  (  ) who have opted for job cuts this year in the midst of economic weakness, market uncertainties and tighter regulatory norms that have restricted top-line growth. Hence, the focus is on pruning cost to increase efficiency and remain competitive.We believe that such a measure is a strategic fit for Citi in this difficult economic environment and would help its profit figure in the days ahead.

Because options pay off at a future date from the time of purchase, stock option trends can indicate where investors expect stocks to move.The two major stock options are call options and put options, and they represent optimism and pessimism respectively. Call options are the option to buy a stock at a future date and at a price set today \u2013 calls become profitable when the stock rises, so buying a call indicates the investor expects the stock to rise.Put options are the exact opposite. Whereas calls are the option to buy the stock, puts are the option to sell a stock in the future at a price fixed today. This becomes profitable if the stock falls over that time period, so investors buy puts when they become pessimistic on the stock\u2019s outlook.The Put/Call ratio is the number of put options relative to the number of call options for a given stock. If there are more put options (a put/call ratio greater than 1), then there are more investors who think that the share price will decrease than there are investors who think that the share price will increase.Simply put, a high put/call ratio reflects a bearish sentiment about a given stock while a low ratio reflects a bullish sentiment. For this article we focus on stocks with low put call options.To demonstrate this idea, we screened for stocks for that are seeing significant decreases in their put/call ratios over the last ten trading days, indicating bullish changes in sentiment from the options market.To further refine the list, we screened for companies that have significant cash holdings relative to average quarterly operating expenses \u2013 a sign of strong liquidity.

With that kind of upward move, it's reasonable to feel cautious. You want to participate in this impressive rally, but don't want to give up big gains if the market shifts direction. That's why defensive stocks make real sense right now. [My colleague Tom Hutchinson  ]I'm not talking about low  stocks that tend to ignore market gyrations. I'm talking about stocks with plenty of cash. Cash serves as a backstop in tough times and a competitive weapon in good times. And no sector is sitting on mountains of cash like the tech sector.Surprisingly, even after this sharp upward move in the markers, a number of tech stocks hold enough cash to account for a decent chunk of the entire stockmarket value . The table below highlights nine tech stocks that sport at least 25% in theirmarket value in net cash.-- David StermanWill these companies go on a buying spree (either of other companies or their own stock)? Or might they hang onto that cash to weather any upcoming pullback in theeconomy ? Either way, it's nice to have such options.

But it's unwise to spend time on stocks that lack any near-term catalysts, and aside from a current stock buyback, there are few timely virtues. Nevertheless, keep an eye on the M&A space. Some investors suspect that Comtech will be a buyer or a seller in 2011. highlights a tangible benefit that a bulletproofbalance sheet can bring. In late December, it paid out a $3 a share one-timedividend . And it could afford to do so several times more in coming years if it so choose.My favorite name in this table is  , which is a leading player in the field of barcode scanning, right behind  Symbol division.A wide range of retailers, along with companies operating massive warehouse/logistics operations, use these scanners to track goods as they work though the supply chain. Thanks to the economic slowdown, many customers decided to hold off on scanning system upgrades, leading Intermec to post a 25% drop in sales in 2009. Sales were flattish in 2010, but a recently rising  along with feedback from customers implies that sales could rebound 10% in 2011.This is known as a \"late-cycle play,\" as Intermec's customers tend to invest more heavily in capital spending when an economic rebound is fully underway. A bullish sign: Intermec just announced that 2010 fourth-quarter sales came in ahead of prior forecasts. The company also announced an acquisition of Vocollect Inc., which will enable workers to use voice commands to track goods as they move through the warehouse. This should enable a truly \"hands-free\" environment, yieldingproductivity gains in the warehouse.Intermec also holds an interesting wildcard that may be overlooked by many investors: The company owns a wide range of patents in the field of radio frequency identification (RFID), which allows for more advanced forms of asset tracking. The technology has not supplanted barcodes as many had expected just a few years ago, but it is starting to make serious inroads. Intermec stands to collect hefty royalty streams if RFID becomes even more widely adopted.Back when RFID was in the spotlight in 2006 as a key emerging technology, Intermec'sshares hit $35. These days,shares trade for a third of that value. A rebounding core business, an appealing new acquisition and a potential RFID kicker could be what Intermec finally needs to break out of its current two-year trading range. It's hard to pin specific upside for theseshares , although a reboundingeconomy could set the stage for a sustained double-digit rebound in sales and even more robustprofit growth. You can sleep better at night with these cash-rich stocks. And although Intermec is my favorite on this list, any one of these strong  stocks should provide ample downside protection even if the market swoons.P.S. -- We've just identified six surprising events that could break your portfolio wide open in 2011.

We expect that the declining market share trend for VeriSign in the .com and .net domain business could see a temporary stabilization in 2010 mainly due to healthy renewal rates. If VeriSign manages to maintain its market share in the long term as well, there could be an upside of 12% to our  .VeriSign currently controls the rights to the exclusive registry of .com and .net internet domain names. The company collects a fixed fee each time individuals or businesses register a new .com or .net domain name, or renew the registration of an existing domain name.VeriSign's share in the domain name market has declined from around 54% in 2006 to around 50% in 2009, and we expect it to continue to decline to around 43% by the end of Trefis forecast period.We believe the primary factor behind the declining market share trend for VeriSign has been the faster rise in country-specific domain names compared to .com and .net names. This effect is partially due to the fact that emerging markets like China, Russia and India, which seem to have a higher tendency to use country-specific domain names, have also shown faster GDP growth than the US. The majority of .com and .net domain names are registered in the US, which is one reason why the US economy's slow growth over the last few years has led to market share declines for VeriSign.VeriSign's observed renewal rate has steadily increased from around 70% in Q2 2009 to 73% in Q3 2010. The increasing renewal rate means that the number of domain name registrations is expected to increase from 97 million in 2009 to 105 million in 2010, indicating that VeriSign could maintain its market share in 2010 at 50%. Hence we expect VeriSign's market share to show signs of stabilization despite the country-specific domain name growth described above.There could be an upside of around 12% to our estimate for VeriSign stock if the company is able to maintain its market share at around 50% over the Trefis forecast period.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["erisign (  ) recently renewed its contract with the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) to serve as the exclusive provider for .net domain names (see:  ).

(  ) marched into the earnings limelight after the close on Thursday to reveal that it booked a huge gain on the sale of its authentication business. The company has shed more than a dozen businesses and thinned its employee ranks in recent years, and its narrowed focus has made it more dependent on its mainstay Internet domain operation.As a result of the sale, the company posted a quarterly profit of $784.9 million, or $4.48 a share, up from $53.6 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the sale and other items, per-share earnings rose to 27 cents from 16 cents as revenue increased 10% to $172.6 million. Analysts had predicted a profit of 26 cents a share on revenue of $172 million.The shares of VeriSign initially gapped more than 4% lower this morning, but quickly recovered and were most recently in positive territory. In fact, VRSN is up more than 37% since the beginning of the year. The security remains above key support at its rising 10-week and 20-week moving averages, which have guided the shares higher since July 2009.Heading into the earnings announcement, options players jumped on the stock's puts in an attempt to call a pullback in the shares. The International Securities Exchange (ISE) has reported 7.3 puts purchased to open for every one call purchased to open during the past 52 weeks. This ratio of puts to calls is higher than 92% of all those taken during the past 12 months.In addition, the Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) for VRSN comes in at 0.84, as put open interest nearly equals call open interest among options slated to expire in less than three months. This ratio of puts to calls is higher than 85% of all those taken during the past year. In other words, short-term options speculators have been more pessimistically aligned toward the shares only 15% of the time during the past 52 weeks.Meanwhile, short sellers are buying back their bearish bets. During the past month, the number of VRSN shares sold short dropped by nearly 19%. However, nearly 12 million shares remain sold short, accounting for 7.2% of the company's total float. A continued unwinding of these pessimistic positions could help to propel the shares higher.Looking in on Wall Street, we find that VRSN has earned nine \"strong buys,\" two \"buys,\" and six \"holds.\" There is still some room for potential upgrades following the company's stronger-than-expected earnings report.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["earish comments from analysts at JP Morgan and Robert W. Baird this week regarding tech spending has put an already-weak sector under even greater pressure. Major tech names like  and  are retreating from recent gains and some tech stocks are quickly falling into the abyss.On Tuesday, shares of  ,  , and  all hit 52-week lows. For existing shareholders, it's fair to wonder if it's time to cut their losses. And for investors that have avoided this sector as it has tumbled, do these newly-cheapened stocks signal it's time to jump in? Let's take a look...One of the key challenges for all tech stocks involves the steep peaks and dips in revenue and profit streams. With such robust swings, investors always apply relatively low multiples. In the area of semiconductors, investors are often even more wary, as capital spending cycles enter into boom and bust cycles with alarming frequency. Applied Materials, for example, saw sales plunge -38% in fiscal (October) 2009, yet is in the midst of a fresh growth spurt this year that should boost sales +70% to +80%.But fear springs eternal for this sector, and investors are already bracing for the next plunge. Perhaps that fear is quite premature. After all, capital spending for advanced semiconductor equipment -- for which Applied Materials is the acknowledged global leader -- is often a function of the cash customers have at their disposal. Right now, Applied Materials' customers are fattening their balance sheets again after a string of solid results from chip makers.Looking ahead, analysts still think Applied Materials will see sales grow in fiscal (October) 2011, perhaps in the +10% to 20% range. That may prove to be optimistic or pessimistic, but one thing is for sure: the company generates loads of cash in good times or bad. Sure, it lost $235 million in  in 2009, but it generated $6.7 billion in positive free cash flow during the previous five years. It would take an absolute plunge in global chip equipment spending for Applied Materials to move back into the red in terms of free cash flow.In a bid to please investors, Applied Materials recently shut down its money-losing SunFab unit that makes thin-film solar panels. That move is expected to boost profits and once again tighten the company's core focus on the semiconductor business (although it will retain some exposure to the solar industry). That move should allow gross margins to rise back up next year into the mid 40% range from a current 39%, according to Needham & Co. Operating margins should also rebound back into the low 20% range. Yet shares have moved even lower since that July 21st announcement and are now at levels last seen in 2003 (excepting the early 2009 swoon which cratered many stocks).Assuming sales rise at a moderate pace in 2011, as analysts currently expect, then free cash flow could approach $1.5 billion -- roughly in line with what Applied Materials generated in 2006 and 2007. Back then, shares traded in a range of $15 to $25 -- well above the current price near $11.15.As is the case with many tech stocks these days, Applied Materials can only rely on one catalyst to support shares: stock buybacks. The company's share count has already shrunk from 1.7 billion shares in 2004 to a recent 1.34 billion. The company could continue buying back 100 million shares annually without cutting into R&D spending or its $3 billion in cash and investments.Applied Materials is expected to report third quarter results next Wednesday, August 18th. Management noted in July that the quarter was faring well, and if recent quarterly conference calls are any guide, management should again speak of a still-rising  of orders. Perhaps that will be what it takes to get shares out of the summer doldrums.This hard-disk drive maker is also a victim of lousy sentiment toward the entire industry. Those bearish comments noted earlier from JP Morgan and Robert W. Baird specifically cited concerns about a slowdown in spending on PCs and servers. Seagate, which has exposure to both volume and pricing (both metrics are good when demand is strong, and bad when they're not) surely can post erratic numbers. When business was lousy in fiscal (June) 2009, the company barely broke even in terms of free cash flow. Yet in the  just ended, free cash flow surged to more than $1 billion. But the recent quarterly results also highlighted an emerging slowdown in demand, thanks in large part to cautious spending trends in Europe.Yet even as sales weaken a bit, Seagate remains highly profitable. Analysts had been expecting  in the $3.60 range for both fiscal 2011 and 2012, but thanks to the incipient slowdown, have lowered those forecasts by a little more than a dollar to about $2.40. Seagate's shares trade for less than five times those lowered 2011 and 2012 profit projections.To be sure, few positive catalysts exist in the near-term, so this stock is of much greater appeal to deep value investors than growth investors. Yet if the  does begin to turn around, Seagate is a very high  stock and could quickly double from current levels. Right now, few are envisioning such a scenario, as evidenced by Tuesday's new yearly low.This security software maker has been in the doghouse ever since it acquired computer storage firm Veritas in 2005 for more than $13 billion. Investors didn't see the synergies of the deal back then, and they still don't. Adding insult, results at both of these disparate divisions began to lag their respective rivals, perhaps due to management's lost focus.Even as organic growth has been lacking, Symantec has been a free cash flow machine, routinely spitting out about $1.4 billion in free cash flow, year after year. To boost growth, the company has put that prodigious  back into play, recently acquiring a security software division from  for $1.3 billion. At least this deal has real synergies.Symantec's ever-sinking stock is the result of tepid guidance issued in late July making clear that key customers were taking a longer time to commit to big new contracts. Like Seagate, Symantec has become a company with dim top-line prospects, but still-robust bottom-line prospects. And in this market, that trade-off holds little appeal. Interested investors may want to check out Applied Materials' conference call next Wednesday to get the latest outlook on this seemingly moribund sector.Applied Materials is the healthiest among these three stocks, though with shares trading for a little over 15 times projected profits, it lacks the absolute rock-bottom valuations seen with Seagate (4.5) and Symantec (9.6). All three of these companies are either first or second in the industries they operate and should rise anew when investors rotate back into the tech sector.Disclosure: Neither David Sterman nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold\npositions in any securities mentioned in this article.-- David StermanDavid Sterman started his career in equity research at Smith Barney, culminating in a position as Senior Analyst covering European banks.

The company is due to announce earnings figures on April 28 after the market closes, and analysts polled at Thomson Reuters anticipate earnings of 35 cents a share.

These calls are home to current open interest of just 446 contracts, indicating investors most likely bought these calls to open. Call buyers will make money if VRSN shares rally higher than $29.45 throughout the next five months, which represents a 10% move to the upside from the stock's current level. Keep in mind that VRSN shares have not reached $29 since September 2009, so it looks like at least one investor expects history to repeat itself. This long call trade prevents against significant losses if the stock does not rally higher, and caps any losses at the premium paid, or $1.45 per contract.The September 28 calls closed up 10 cents and had an implied volatility of 27% compared to the stock's 30-day historical volatility of 16% (the buying action pushed up the price and implied volatility of the options).VeriSign (  ) strangle actionOdds for stagnat VeriSign (  ) sharesThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eriSign has been climbing on a plan to divest its online-payment division for $1.28 billion, and traders expect it to remain trapped in a range. optionMONSTER's tracking systems detected the sale of about 13,000 September 31 calls for $1 and a matching number of September 28 puts for $2.85.

Now, with interest rates at all-time lows in the modern era, the bonds vs. stocks debate is getting turned on its head. With  yields stuck at low levels, stocks are comparatively much more attractive.That point has been noted by the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) at a wide range of blue-chip companies. These companies are increasingly realizing that they can alter their balance sheets to provide some much-needed support to their flagging stock prices. And that's a buy signal you shouldn't ignore.For a long time, many companies (especially in the field of high-tech) preferred to hold lots of cash and carry no debt. High cash balances were seen as a sign of strength in case any major economic slowdowns forced companies to burn cash to keep afloat. (Memories of the imploding dot-com bubble of a decade ago die hard.) Yet as we saw in the recent economic crisis, most large tech companies such as  and  stayed profitable. And their massive cash balances suddenly looked like an unnecessary precaution -- especially when that cash is earning almost no interest.So we're now seeing an increasing number of companies issue debt, and that could portend some real gains for per share profits and share prices. To boost  ) , many of these companies are using some of their borrowings to buy back stock. With borrowing costs so low and stocks sporting such low multiples, the math gets pretty compelling as the following example shows\u2026Each of these companies has similar sales and  . While the first has $100 million in cash earning just 2% interest, the other has spent all that cash and borrowed another $100 million at a 4% interest rate in order to buy back $200 million in stock. That move has helped to boost earnings per share by more than +20% as the share count has fallen even faster than net income:\n  \nThat's precisely what  is doing these days. As I wrote back in May:\"(An) improving profit trend led management to embark on plans to issue debt simply to buy back stock. The $625 million plan, announced last month, could reduce the share count -15% by the end of next year. There is a precedent: buybacks reduced shares outstanding by an average of -10% in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Put another way, shares outstanding, which stood at 197 million in 2006, could fall below 140 million by the end of next year.\"[See:  ]Just this week, U.S. companies have issued more than $50 billion in debt, according to Standard & Poor's. Demand for these bonds is very strong, as rates are low enough to be enticing for bond issuers and high enough to provide a better return than  or government bonds. Healthcare firm  was able to issue 10-year bonds with a  of just 3.375%. just sold $1 billion in bonds at an interest rate below 4%. What will the home improvement chain do with the proceeds? Buy back stock, just as it has before. The retailer had 2.3 billion shares outstanding in 2004. Six years later, the share count has dropped by 700 million, thanks to ongoing buybacks. That's a sure-fire way to boost  per share, and why many expect the company to post sharply higher  when the housing market is finally back on track.As companies decide to hang on to less cash, they are increasingly looking to buy back stock. August saw a flurry of new buyback announcements, highlighted by a $10 billion announcement from  . In addition,  ,  and  all announced buybacks of at least $1 billion last month, with many more companies announcing smaller buybacks.Satellite firm  announced plans to buy back $2 billion in stock, which is going to help boost per share profits at a fast pace, as I noted in this article [See:  ]. Look for this trend to continue. For a long time, investors assigned little value to excess cash sitting on the  . But if you come across companies with lots of cash and a depressed stock price, then a buyback may be in the offing. Companies with small amounts of debt that have room to take advantage of low rates and issue more debt could make a similar move. Use the exercise above to figure out what earnings per share would look like if your investment targets sought to buy back stock. If the results are intriguing, then it's a good reason to think about pouncing on the shares.-- David StermanDavid Sterman started his career in equity research at Smith Barney, culminating in a position as Senior Analyst covering European banks.

The trade pushed total options volume in the Internet security company to almost triple the average level.Buying in-the-money calls will allow the investor to leverage modest appreciation in the share price. For instance, if VRSN climbs to $35 on expiration from its $28.92 close yesterday, the calls would be worth $10--an 84 percent gain versus a 21 percent move in the stock price. However, the investor may have sacrificed some performance because they overlooked some basic rules governing in-the-money strategies. First, they overpaid for time value: VRSN traded for $28.79 at the moment the transaction priced, so they paid $1.66 more than intrinsic value. That means 30 percent of the premium will be melted away by the simple passage of time if the shares don't climb.Secondly, they surrendered delta. The January contracts had a delta of 0.71 when the trade priced, meaning they will appreciate $0.71 for every $1 that VRSN goes up.In contrast, they could have bought the August 25 calls for about $4.20, reducing the time value to $0.41, or about 10 percent. The August contracts also had a delta of 0.87, providing greater leverage to the shares going up. (Longer-dated options are usually less sensitive to changes in the price of the underlying. See optionMONSTER's Education section for more.)The downside of using August contracts is that the investor would have to roll the position forward at the end of the month. Still, when you consider that comparable September calls will have about the same amount of time value next month, they'd be able to roll the contracts 3-4 times before paying the same $1.66 in time value as in yesterday's transaction.Another potential problem with the trade is that other investors sold a large number of September options on VRSN in May, betting that the stock will remain trapped in a range. If those investors are right, it will be even worse for this week's in-the-money trader because they will have paid for time value at a very moment when the stock is literally marking time.Generally, in-the-money strategies are best in the current month. For instance, investors could have purchased the July 15 calls on Intel on July 2 for $4.15, paying only $0.05 of time value. Over the next eight sessions, the stock rose about 15 percent, but the calls appreciated 69 percent.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoBrian Katz is the Chief Investment Officer of  and is the lead Portfolio Manager for the company's large-cap equity strategy, which has assets under management of almost $300mm. The Colony Group's large-cap strategy invests in approximately 30 - 40 securities with market caps generally greater than $5bb. Brian and his analysts endeavor to find growth companies with defendable competitive positions that generate strong free cash flow.We asked Brian to share his single highest conviction position and provide his investment thesis.\u2022 \u2022 \u2022We purchased  this summer shortly after the stock dropped more than 14% in a day on word that an organization called the Coalition for Internet Transparency ((  )) won its appeal to force the district court to hear its antitrust lawsuit challenging the legality of VRSN's key contract. The stock has since recovered those losses, and we believe the management team has multiple levers to pull that could send the stock price higher from here. VRSN is a provider of Internet infrastructure services. It is best known for its domain naming services ((  )) business (56% of 2008 sales). VRSN, through an exclusive contract with Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers ((  )), the overseer of the World Wide Web, operates the authoritative directory of all dot.com and dot.net domain names (as well as other generic top level domains, or tGLDs). Its next largest segment sells SSL certificates that enable enterprises and Internet merchants to conduct secure transactions online. This segment also operates an identity protection business, called VeriSign Identity Protection, which helps enable consumer-facing applications to provide a secure online experience for end users. In total, this segment accounted for 36% of 2008 sales (29% SSL, 7% IP). The remaining 8% of sales are from VeriSign Japan.We are attracted to VRSN primarily for stock-specific reasons. VRSN holds a legal monopoly on the DNS industry and has the leading brand and market share in SSL certification. The overall growth of the Internet's role in commerce adds to the appeal of VRSN's business model. Virtually every business requires a unique web site for competitive reasons, and the number of businesses enabling customers to buy online will continue to expand for the foreseeable future.Can you describe the company's competitive environment? How is this company positioned vis a vis its competitors?We touched on VRSN's monopoly position in DNS and leading share/recognition in SSL in the previous section. As a result, VRSN holds one of the stronger competitive positions of any stock in our portfolio. The DNS contracts for managing the dot.com and dot.net domain naming registries were granted by ICANN in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The agreements expire in 2012 and 2011, respectively, but call for a \"presumptive right of renewal,\" i.e., the contracts should automatically renew with similar terms for another six years as long as VRSN meets its contractual obligations. Under the contracts, VRSN is allowed to take price increases of up to 7% and 10% (for dot.com and dot.net, respectively) in as many as four of the six years in the term. The SSL business also has a sustainable competitive advantage, albeit not as strong as DNS. Its VeriSign Secured checkmark logo is one of the most trusted security marks on the Internet according to some studies. As a result, it has greater than a 50% market share of the SSL certificate market.We believe VRSN's stock price is depressed at current levels. Its NTM P/E ratio had consistently stayed above 20x until last fall, and at 16.4x currently it is well below its 5-year average of 23.0x. The current multiple is a significant discount to a nominal peer group of Internet firms, although there is no direct comparable. Using a discounted cash flow framework, we believe VRSN may be as much as 30% undervalued at the current price. We estimate that the stock could trade north of $40 in the next three to five years.The above valuation discount is likely a function of two issues. First, on June 8, 2009, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals remanded CFIT's previously dismissed antitrust suit back to the district court. CFIT claims that the 2006 contract between ICANN and VRSN to maintain the dot.com registry was awarded non-competitively and that the presumptive right of renewal is anticompetitive. While we take the ruling seriously, we believe VRSN should ultimately win the case. The agreement between ICANN and VRSN was reviewed by members of the Department of Commerce and approved. VRSN had won the dot.net contract in a competitive process a year earlier and had demonstrated technological and scale superiority.Second, VRSN was hurt by the economic slowdown in both its DNS and SSL businesses, which crimped new business formations and e-commerce transactions. VRSN's DNS business appears to have stabilized over the past couple of quarters.One of the theses supporting our investment in VRSN was the return of Chairman and founder Jim Bidzos to the role of President and CEO in 2008. Mr. Bidzos returned after an ill-fated attempt by the prior CEO to diversify VRSN into several businesses outside its core competency. Mr. Bidzos promptly began to divest those 13 businesses, a process recently completed, and VRSN is a more focused company now. Mark McLaughlin, who held a number of key positions at the company from 2000-2007, returned to the company in January 2009 and took over the roles of President and CEO from Mr. Bidzos in August.VRSN has several catalysts on the horizon that could get the stock moving higher. Under its agreement with ICANN, VRSN is allowed to increase prices in four of the six contract years by 7% and 10% for dot.com and dot.net, respectively. VRSN opted not to take the increase in 2009 due to the weak economy, then on December 17th VRSN announced the maximum price increases to take effect in July 2010, sending the stock up +10% immediately.In addition, VRSN has spent more than $100mm over the past couple of years to build out its DNS infrastructure. With this spending program mostly finished, management is free to redeploy this cash flow into more shareholder friendly initiatives, like a large share buyback or perhaps the initiation of a dividend. Finally, a strengthening economy will help reaccelerate growth in VRSN's DNS and SSL businesses. Estimates for 2010 EPS have come down from $1.80 in January to under $1.50 today. Ongoing signs that the recovery is gaining traction could translate into higher EPS estimates for VRSN.The biggest risk to the stock is the CFIT lawsuit. We are reasonably confident that the district court, which initially threw out CFIT's claims, will rule in VRSN's favor; however, lawsuits are difficult to handicap.My pleasure.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."]], "Title": ["Analysts Forecast 15% Gains Ahead For QTEC", ["Analysts Forecast 10% Upside For QUS"], ["Verisign (VRSN) Shares Cross Above 200 DMA"], ["QTEC, AMD, VRSN, SNPS: Large Inflows Detected at ETF"], ["Analysts Forecast 10% Upside For QUS"], ["Nasdaq 100 Movers: TTWO, ATVI"], ["Verisign Inc.
