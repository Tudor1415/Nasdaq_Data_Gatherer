I also want to remind you that this conference call is a property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.  -- Thank you, Brittany. I first want to take a moment to share our respects from CDW to all who are suffering hardships or loss as we face this COVID-19 health crisis and also to recognize the extraordinary sacrifices and contributions being made by so many who are devoting themselves to serving others. I'll begin this morning with a high-level overview of first-quarter results and drivers of performance. I'll also discuss how we are addressing the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our coworkers, customers and operations, and share some thoughts on the balance of 2020.Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our first-quarter financials as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategies. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for Q&A. We had a very strong first quarter. Net sales were $4.4 billion, 9.2% above last year on an average daily sales basis, adjusted for the impact of one more business day in the first quarter of 2020 than 2019 and up 9.4% in constant currency.Non-GAAP operating income was $304 million, an increase of 5.8%. This includes a $29 million increase on our credit loss reserve to reflect the macroeconomic environment due to COVID-19. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.38, up 11% on a reported basis and up 11.3% in constant currency. As the quarter progressed in March, we served a meaningful increase in customer demand.CDW teams orchestrated solutions for client devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security and others from our broad portfolio to address our customers' remote work and business continuity needs. We experienced solid results across the U.S. business, with all five U.S. channels growing high single digit and solid local performance from our international teams.This growth came from both existing and new customers. To address anticipated supply constraints, we've leveraged our scale, distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, strong vendor partner relationship and healthy balance sheet and liquidity position, fulfilling our customers and prospects' urgent and critical IT needs. We procured the supply in key categories early and managed through longer industry lead times for our customers in a supply constrained environment. Our net sales performance for the quarter was balanced, with 9% growth for both U.S.hardware and software and 26% services growth. In March, customer priority quickly redirected to remote workforce enablement and work continuity, driving strong transactional performance of almost 20%. During this time, customers deprioritized infrastructure and less urgent service projects, resulting in a low single-digit year-over-year decline for solutions. Cloud customers spend in gross profit increased double digits driven by strong growth in collaboration, security and productivity, workloads consistent with remote workforce enablement.We generated strong double-digit growth in product categories that enabled work from home and operations continuity plan, including client devices, both notebooks and desktops, video, collaboration tools, configuration services and security. Our teams orchestrated a seamless combination of these products and services, plus others from our broad portfolio to provide full solutions to our customers. Clearly, the team delivered strong performance. I am proud of and grateful to our coworkers who persevered for our customers.Now looking more closely at our customer end markets performance. Our corporate and small business teams both delivered over 8% growth driven by double-digit growth in transactional categories as the team successfully developed work-from-home capabilities for our customers. The government team increased sales almost 15%. Federal had another excellent quarter with sales up double digit primarily driven by the Census project.The state and local team also delivered double-digit growth driven by strong transactional and solutions performance that enabled remote work capabilities and aided crisis readiness efforts. Education increased 17% with strong double-digit growth in both higher ed and K-12. Customers in both markets were focused on enabling remote learning capabilities. Our healthcare team delivered 7% growth primarily driven by transactional product categories to adapt to the new care delivery environment.Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased 3% on a reported basis. U.K. was up low single digits in constant currency that was on top of four years of first-quarter double-digit growth.The U.K. team has been instrumental in helping with the government's response to COVID-19, providing crucial technology to the new critical care field hospitals as well as enabling remote work capabilities for our customers. Canada increased double digits, also driven by remote work enablement and strong demand from healthcare and education customers. Our first-quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services that can address even rapidly shifting customer priorities across the IT landscape, and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth.I want to take a minute to review each of these for two reasons: first, because these are important drivers of CDW's first-quarter performance; and second, they provide a framework to think about CDW's performance under various macroeconomic conditions. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels that each generated annual net sales of more than $1.5 billion in 2019: corporate; small business; government; education; and healthcare. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets, including federal government, state and local government, K-12 and higher education, providing us insight into our customers' objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner.In addition, we have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered over USD 2 billion of net sales in 2019. The diversity of our customer end market service us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and businesses differently. This is especially relevant in the current environment.Next, the breadth of our offerings. With over 100,000 products, services and solutions for more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. And finally, our three-part strategy for growth, which is: first, to acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future.Before I turn to our thoughts about the balance of the year, I want to provide insights into our approach to managing COVID-19's impact on our business. To holistically manage our response in mid-February, we activated a cross-functional response team led by executive committee members. The team leveraged our preestablished crisis management protocols to ensure we responded as quickly as possible. The team has three key principles: safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers; serve the mission-driven needs of our customers and partners; and support our communities.One of the key actions we took to maintain the impact of the virus on our customers, on our coworkers on our operations was to implement a global work-from-home order for office coworkers in mid-March. We have excellent IT infrastructure and support, so the transition to work from home was swift and seamless. We are monitoring developments closely, developing plans accordingly, and we will be prepared for our return to office at the appropriate time. We are focused on our coworker's safety and well-being in the workplace.To do this, at our three distribution and configuration centers, we are operating under precautionary measures advised by public health authorities, including social distancing, segmented shifts, personal protective equipment, enhanced facility cleanings and temperature screening for anyone entering the facilities. Currently, all distribution and configuration centers are fully operational. At the end of March, to limit the virus spread after a few coworkers tested positive for COVID-19, we decided to close our Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center for several days and to require a shift of configuration center coworkers to self-isolate. These actions did not have a material impact, as the teams leverage flexibility in our distribution and configuration capabilities where possible.Our distribution center in Las Vegas fulfilled customer orders, and orders were dropped shipped directly to customers and we're now shipping times modestly increased. I regard our exceptional coworkers and our unique culture to be a meaningful competitive advantage. Our team has responded to the current environment in exemplary ways. One example is our internal gig marketplace created to match areas of our business where demand has spiked, with internal talents on temporary assignment.Another example is the reallocating of our sales and technical resources to where the growth is and will be going, which we successfully did during the Great Recession. We will again be nimble by identifying and implementing ways to optimally utilize our highly skilled coworkers. In addition, and consistent with our strong culture of giving, CDW has and continues to contribute meaningfully to support the COVID-19 response efforts locally in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.Now let me turn to our 2020 financial performance. As a result of COVID-19 and the unknown duration and depth of its impact, we withdrew our 2020 targets on April 16, as most all companies are doing. The near-term impact of COVID-19 on some customers we serve could be meaningful, with some end markets impacted more significantly than others. Consistent with prior experience where commercial customers have reacted relatively quickly to economic conditions, we anticipate the demand will be lower for some of our small business and corporate customers.We expect demand from our public customers to be relatively firmer, led by resiliency in our federal channel due to the Census project and the IT priorities we support, including infrastructure upgrades and security enhancements to remain top priorities. Demand will likely be mixed for our other public channels with budget uncertainty for healthcare, state and local and education customers. We continue to track stimulus support and, where possible, help our customers navigate the various programs. Regarding product categories, we expect customers to prioritize mission-critical IT spending and for some to push out longer-term solutions projects, including infrastructure projects and service engagement.In recent weeks, our focus has shifted to helping our customers manage their work-from-home environments at scale. Solutions for that includes security, network augmentation to accommodate new demand, remote performance management, virtual desktops and effective application management. Longer term, we expect our customers and prospective customers to design and implement technology-driven strategies to not just survive, but to thrive. We expect to see an acceleration in digital transformation, cloud migration and automation strategies, as companies invest to successfully compete in the future.We believe that technology will be as or more essential to all sectors of our economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We intend to continue to help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape. During our 35-year history, CDW has a successful track record of evolving with customer needs in the ever-evolving IT industry. We are committed to continuing to invest in our three-part strategy, including the capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity and enhance our competitive position.As we do so, we will keep a watchful eye on the impact of COVID-19, the macro environment and other unpredictable variables, such as potential supply disruptions, trade policies and the upcoming U.S. election. CDW will continue to do what we do best: leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives, and out-execute our competition. While this is a particularly uncertain and challenging time for all, I'm confident that CDW will continue to grow to new heights.Now Collin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin? -- Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our first-quarter results and capital allocation priorities in the current environment. Turning to our first-quarter P&L on Slide 9.Consolidated net sales were $4.4 billion, up 10.9% on a reported basis and 9.2% on an average daily sales basis as we had one additional selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 9.4%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 4.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. This was better than expected and historical seasonality.As the quarter progressed, and we moved into March, the impact of COVID-19 led to a meaningful increase in customer demand for client devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security and other solutions to keep customers' operations running. While there were pockets of supply dislocation, as Chris mentioned, we leveraged our scale and distribution capabilities to help customers get access to the IT they needed for business continuity. Some portion of the record monthly sales we achieved in March is likely attributable to a pull forward of future demand, but it's difficult to quantify at this point. Gross profit for the quarter was $757 million, an increase of 12.6%.Gross margin was 17.2%, up 20 basis points over last year, driven by product margin and services, partially offset by netted down revenue streams not growing as fast as net sales. Turning to our SG&A on Slide 10. Our non-GAAP SG&A increased 17.6%. The increase was primarily driven by a $29 million increase in our credit loss reserve to reflect the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of COVID-19.SG&A also reflects higher payroll cost, consistent with higher coworker count and higher gross profit as well as roughly $2 million of incremental COVID-19 expenses primarily to safeguard our coworkers. Coworker count of 10,104 was up 670 coworkers from March 2019, with approximately 100 of the year-over-year increase from the Aptris acquisition and the remaining from organic coworker investments. Roughly 60% of the 670 coworkers added year-over-year are in customer-facing roles. As you know, we have a variable cost structure given that sales commissions are paid on a percentage of gross profit, and growth in coworker count is one of our biggest investments.We have implemented hiring restrictions and are letting attrition run for a while, as we closely monitor the macroeconomic and demand environments. GAAP operating income was $246 million, up 7.4%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $304 million, an increase of 5.8%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 6.9%.Moving to Slide 11. Interest expense was $38 million for both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 12, was 20.7% in the quarter, up 50 basis points compared to last year. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $44 million.To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation, which is shown on Slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 10 basis points versus last year's rate. As you can see on Slide 14, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $145 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.16, up 13.1%. Our non-GAAP net income was $200 million in the quarter, up 7.9% over last year.Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.38, up 11% from last year. The increase in the credit loss reserve equates to approximately $0.15 per share. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 15. Liquidity is a clear priority in the current environment.As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $214 million, and net debt was $3.3 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.2 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we bolstered our liquidity position by issuing $600 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon of 4.8% for general corporate purposes. Additional measures to enhance liquidity include suspending share repurchases and implementing various cost savings initiatives.Free cash flow for the quarter was $116 million, as shown on Slide 16. This is lower-than-normal seasonality and below last year's $303 million for several reasons. One, because sales growth was back-end loaded in the quarter, the receivables associated with those sales are sitting on the March 31 balance sheet. Two, we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms.And three, we leveraged our scale and distribution centers to increase investment and inventory to better support customers in a supply constrained environment. Moving to Slide 17. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 20 days, up three days from last year's first quarter. The balance sheet dynamics I just described are somewhat moderated when you look at three-month average working capital metrics because of how sales phasing played out in the quarter.Looking ahead, our working capital metrics could be impacted as we strategically invest in inventory or due to pressure on receivable collections as customers are impacted by the macroeconomic environment. One of our greatest assets is our long-term customer relationships, and we know it's important to be there for customers during challenging times, like we were during The Great Recession. We will continue to balance managing customers' working capital needs, while appropriately managing risk. For the quarter, we deployed $195 million of cash to shareholders, which included $54 million of dividends and $141 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $123 per share.Turning to capital allocation on Slide 18. As I mentioned earlier, we are focused on liquidity and have reassessed other uses of capital within that context. Our priorities are: first, continue to pay the dividend. Today, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per common share, reflecting CDW's strong liquidity position and confidence in the cash flow generation capability of the business.We expect to evaluate any changes in the dividend in the fourth quarter of this year consistent with historical timing. Future dividends will be subject to Board approval. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We remain comfortable with the current target net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3.0 times for several reasons: one, we have no debt maturities in 2020 and just $57 million due in 2021: two, the weighted average interest rate on the debt portfolio was 3.9%, pro forma for the $600 million notes issued in April, so cash interest is manageable: and three, our debt capital structure is covenant light.We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.2 times, slightly below the low end of our target range and flat to year-end 2019. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. A challenging economic environment could present attractive M&A opportunities, so we remain active in evaluating targets. Any decision to deploy capital for acquisitions will be a function of our usual screens, strategic rationale, operating and cultural fit and financial return, all within the context of liquidity at that point in time.Fourth, as I noted previously, we suspended our share repurchase program to enhance liquidity. With first quarter buybacks of 1.1 million shares, we have already offset expected dilution associated with stock compensation for this year. The decision on when to resume stock buybacks will be dependent on several considerations, including the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and working capital, leverage and other potential uses of cash, such as M&A. Lastly, on the topic of capital.We intend to continue capital expenditure investments in the business. We have a capex-light model, historically running around 0.5 point of sales or slightly more. We believe it's important to continue prudently investing in the capabilities that will allow us to better serve customers, drive productivity and ultimately emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. While we have withdrawn 2020 targets and will not be providing an updated financial outlook, I do want to provide insights into what we're seeing roughly five weeks into the quarter.On the demand side, customer activity has been mixed. We entered April with a healthy backlog of remote workforce enablement solutions, which contributed to solid shipment growth in April. However, writings in corporate and small business were down double digits year-over-year, which will weigh on shipments going forward. This is consistent with past experience where we've seen commercial customers react sooner to macroeconomic conditions.On the other hand, public sector writings were up year-over-year, reflecting strength in government and K-12 and more muted demand in higher education and healthcare. Our international businesses are generally seeing similar trends with their customers. You may recall that both the U.K. and Canada have a lower mix of sales to public sector customers than the U.S.On the supply side, we continue to navigate through a fluid environment, with pockets of dislocation extending lead times in certain categories. We are in constant contact with our vendor partners, whose manufacturing operations are generally back up and running. Freight is a challenge, resulting in pricing surcharges and price increases on certain products. On the operating front, both distribution centers in the U.S.continue to be fully operational since the brief closure of our Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center at the end of March. Finally, I want to provide an update on the Device as a Service solution to the U.S. Census Bureau. The contribution to first-quarter sales was generally in line with expectations.In March, the Census Bureau temporarily suspended field data collection activities, and steps are being taken to reactivate field offices next month. In April, the Census Bureau announced it was seeking statutory relief from Congress for an additional 120 days, which would extend the window for field data collection and self-response to October 31. The delay is expected to shift a modest amount of net sales from Q4 \u2014 to Q4 from Q2. Finally, we are working with the Census Bureau to help meet the customers' objective of making up lost time due to COVID 19.CDW expects to provide additional devices, enabling the Census to have more workers on the field. As a result of these changes, we now expect the Census project to contribute up to approximately 140 basis points of incremental sales growth in 2020. The rollout schedule is fluid, so we could see revenue shift from 2020 into 2021. We will continue to provide updates on the Census as we progress through 2020.That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Olivia to open it up for questions. [Operator instructions]Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. -- Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to start off with Collin or Chris. I was hoping that you could spend a few minutes maybe just comparing how CDW performed through the '08, '09 recession.And what are the sort of the puts and takes when one compares that to what's going on right now? Maybe you can kind of frame that up, that would be really helpful. And then I'll ask my second question as well upfront. How does the share gain narrow to work for CDW in an environment like this? Is it easier? Are customers more willing to engage with new vendors? Or is that something that happens in a post-COVID post-recession world? Thank you.\u00a0 -- OK. Hi. Good morning. It's Chris, and I'll start and then Collin can add in.When we think back to the 2009 recession, first of all, I would say, as we all know, no two downturns are the same. And with respect to where we sit today, we can't tell with any level of certainty what's going to happen. This is that essence. The health crisis and the economic issues are derivative.But if we look back to 2008 and '09, it can be informative. So if we look at the segments, corporate and small business, they did tend to react more quickly, as Collin suggested in his script, to the downturn. And if you look at our investor deck, you can see that corporate was down 22% and small business declined 18%, and so significantly. The public sector channels, as we've mentioned, were more resilient, and we saw growth in government and education.Health care was a little flat. But I would think about coming out of the recession, we saw corporate, small business and healthcare grow quite nicely. And if you think about similarities, the business model that we have, the resiliency of that business model, our ability to stick with our customers and to offer them a wide slot of products, particularly coming out of this recession, remains strong. As I think about today, we are in a stronger financial position than we were in 2008 and '09.And I remember, Amit, meeting interest obligations in '09 when we were at 10times debt leverage, which was our peak, today, we have, obviously, a strong balance sheet and we have more opportunistic outlook. I would also say that technology today has become much more essential to our customer strategy, hard stop. There's been increasing complexity. The breadth of our portfolio, what we sell, our evolution has grown.And so today, we're better positioned than ever to help our customers through this downturn. But the lack of visibility that we all have still makes it difficult to predict with any level of certainty. Collin? -- Yes. Chris, I don't know that I have much more to add to that. That was a pretty thorough review. I mean as you think about the various channels, as we've said, corporate and small business reacted sooner.GDP bottomed, I think, in the fourth quarter of 2008 and then improved sequentially. It was still down a bit year-over-year over the next couple of quarters. We saw corporate and small business react very swiftly in the first quarter of '09, so that first quarter declined more than the full year. And then the rates of decline improved as we move throughout the year.But as Chris said, we've got \u2014 every recession like this is different. So not much more to add other than that. -- Yes. Amit, I'd add one more thing, and I'll come back to your second question is. When you think about the complexion of our resources, and remember, we've got over 3,000 technologists today, and we're really very well positioned to support customers and where they're heading. As we think about what might accelerate coming out of this current situation, we've got physical distance.Digital is now mandatory. It's a prerequisite for market survival, frankly, and we're very well positioned to help our customers with that. But on your second question on taking market share, we did acquire a healthy dose of new customers. We had product to offer them, and we could get it to them quickly.So we feel confident that we were able to take share in this environment. -- Thank you very much for the answers. Appreciate it.\u00a0Our next question coming from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. -- Yes. Thank you very much. Just given the magnitude of uncertainty that's out there right now, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about managing the expense base versus the desire to maintain investment and just how we should think about the flexibility of SG&A this time around compared to prior downturns? -- Matt, it's Chris, and I'll start, and then Collin, you can add in. Listen, you know we have a naturally variable cost structure. And just as it did in 2008 and '09, we benefit from that as we go through downturns like this. I would say that we've been proactive and prudent.We consider to manage our business prudently, part of what we need to do every day. But the team has been at this in a very granular level on a daily basis, watching a couple of things. Obviously, demand, we're very focused on sales trends by channel, gross profit that we're seeing in NGLI, and we're managing that and looking at that more closely than we ever had. Obviously, from a liquidity position, Collin and his team have been very granular around our cash collections and other things that impact our liquidity.So I would say, number one, we've been very proactive and very detail-oriented and making changes and moves quickly as opposed to waiting. As Collin mentioned in his prepared remarks, I think, we've already done things like change events and other expenses that we can do. We do have a performance excellence team. We've talked about this before.It's called reinvent to reinvest, and they have actually contributed meaningfully over the past few years to our results. And they are laser-focused on our operating model and ensuring that we are being as efficient and effective as we possibly can. So as we go through this, frankly, what we're doing is we're managing the business, but we aren't being shy about really finding places to improve from an operational perspective of the business, so that we can continue to invest as we move forward. And some of that might be not moving some resources.We've been working on that. We've got resources that actually can flex across the business. That's part of the beauty of the types of sellers and technical folks that we have in terms of their experience and their capabilities and our training programs, which are such an engine for us. So we're also moving resources on the right opportunities.Collin? -- Yes. I guess I would just add, again, Matt, we have a variable cost structure. Sales compensation paid on gross profit is our biggest expense. And our biggest investment is in people cost, and so letting attrition run add some variability to the cost structure.Obviously, we've taken a look at other parts of the cost structure, travel, events and things like that, that don't make sense in this environment. As Chris mentioned, ongoing productivity and efficiency is a part of the culture, and we've dialed that up. And we'll continue to be disciplined in managing costs, and we'll make adjustments based on market conditions and the demand environment as we go down the road here. But we are going to prudently invest in the business, so that we do emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. -- Got it. And then in the prepared remarks, you talked about supply constraints a few times. Can you just talk about what availability of product looks like across your business right now and going forward, just how you're thinking about managing inventory given the lack of visibility versus the potential for any future disruption of the supply chain? -- Yes, sure. I would say I think we used the word fluid or dynamic. It's choppy out there. We are running heavy on inventory just because we felt it made sense to carry additional days of safety stock.We provide preorders to some of our customers, and they get a lot of benefit out of that. So we're doing that to try to mitigate some of the choppiness in the market. I would say, unsurprisingly, there's a lot of demand for notebooks, so that's where we have taken some of our inventory positions as well as within the Chromebook market, obviously, given the strain that this has placed on our education systems. And then I would say, we've seen lead times pick up in some other categories on the solutions side of the business in servers.It's not, I would say, disruptive per se, but just extended lead times. And then I did comment a little bit about where we have seen some price increases, and that's primarily due to just increased freight cost that our OEM vendor partners are incurring and the passing along of some of those costs. So we have seen some price increases in client devices as well as within servers. -- Thank you.\u00a0Our next question coming from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open.\u00a0 -- OK. Thanks and good morning. Chris, I just wanted to start with some questions around the structural changes to the competitive landscape. Obviously, there's a number of clients out there in the industry that are hurting, and you're in a position to issue $600 million of debt at attractive financing terms to help those clients.But industry landscape is very fragmented. There's many small players that won't have visibility. So maybe you could just touch on how you see the competitive landscape changing as this unfolds. What structural changes are you thinking about? -- Yes. Matt, I want to make sure I understand your question. You're talking about customers, you're talking about others within the channel that are competitors for CDW. -- Other competitors in the channel to CDW and whether this leads to basically more industry consolidation over time as you potentially gain share through this. -- Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think, look, when there is a downturn of any kind that is severe, it exposes weaknesses across any industry.And not unlike other industries, I think we will see that certainly in our industry. And as we've said, we'll continue to keep our eye on opportunistic M&A. And I wouldn't say that we would \u2014you've heard me say this before, I wouldn't say that we're focused on a roll-up, but we certainly are focused on M&A that fits our various lenses that you know well. It's strategic fit, operational fit, cultural fit, makes financial sense.We haven't turned that lens off, and we will continue to look. -- OK. And just as a follow-up. Collin, on the $600 million debt offering, part of that, you talked about helping our clients. Just if you could double-click on what you mean by that.It would seem to be a bridge to help maybe on payment terms, so why not tap the revolver for that? And also the systems and processes you're putting in place to control risk as you do so. Thanks.\u00a0 -- Yes. Sure. Thanks, Adam. I think in terms of the $600 million, just in this kind of environment, given the uncertainty and with a wide range of outcomes out there and very difficult to probability assess where those outcomes are going to be, we just felt it was prudent to go and get excess liquidity.And I think most companies in corporate America that have the ability to do so went ahead and did that. We were able to get it at an attractive rate at 4.8%. So we viewed it as relatively inexpensive insurance in case these outcomes go to a more bearish place. But in the event we don't need the insurance, it's relatively cheap capital that we can deploy offensively.In terms of what we would do with that, we are mindful of the pressure that's out there for customers. So I think in terms of investing it in working capital, I talked a fair amount about potentially using some of that within inventory and to help smooth out some of the disruption that's out there, and that would competitively advantage CDW as well as help our customers get access to the IT they need, sooner rather than later. From a receivables perspective, obviously, our customers are under pressure, and they're managing their own liquidity circumstances and looking at their cost structures and things like that. One of the things that CDW does is we orchestrate financing solutions for our customers.So obviously, our OEM vendor partners and others make financing available. And so we've been very active in making those solutions available to our customers and that obviously helps both the customer, but also helps us manage our DSO risk. There are certain situations where customers are under pressure, and we'll deal with those on a case-by-case basis. In terms of how we're managing risks, we did a pretty thorough review of the portfolio in terms of credit limits and where we had exposures to various industries and customers and adjusted credit risk appropriately, again, managing or balancing some of these long-standing customer relationships we have, while still protecting the balance sheet and ensuring we had an appropriate risk profile in place.And obviously, again, like every other company in corporate America, we are very closely monitoring our daily cash collections and understanding where risks might be emerging in the portfolio and then adjusting credit limits accordingly. -- Very helpful. Thanks.Our next question coming from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is open.\u00a0 -- Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. For the first question, I'd like to ask, how many of your coworkers are currently still working from home? And how did that impact your ability to close deals in the first quarter? Or maybe if you can just help us quantify the impact of COVID-19 on both the top line and on the operating profit line in calendar 1Q. Thank you.\u00a0 -- Yes. Good morning, Ruplu. It's Chris. On the coworkers, we have north of 80% of our coworkers are now work from home.And the others are in our distribution centers, configuration centers and on-site engineers and a few security folks who are also on site. So it's a fairly large portion of our workforce. And I'll give kudos to our technology teams and all of those individuals because the move to work from home was swift and seamless. Our IT infrastructure was ready to go.And it was almost eerie how a few hiccups we had on that Monday morning. My view on their productivity is it's been incredibly strong. And in many ways, you might have heard this from other companies, this is driving even higher levels of productivity in some areas and greater connection between our own workforce and with our customers. It's been really quite interesting to see.In terms of dimensionalizing impact from COVID-19 on the numbers, I just think that's almost impossible to do. As we mentioned, we know, we saw the surge in March because of work from home and remote work needs. And now there were some pull forward, a redirection of investment into that first quarter. But to quantify it just seems impossible to do. -- OK. And just as a quick follow-up. As we stand, as we sit here today, can you comment on the business mix you're seeing between client devices and netted down items? And how do you see that impacting margins? -- Yes. I mean as we commented in the prepared remarks, Ruplu, client devices, very strong in the quarter and particularly as we exited the quarter. And also in my prepared comments, I talked about how we had a pretty healthy backlog then that we carried into April that contributed to solid shipment growth. You could assume that a lot of that was in the client device category.In terms of 100% gross margin items, they did not grow as fast as the rest of the business in the first quarter. I think that was largely driven by the focus on client devices and video and accessories and all the other things that you would need to enable work from home and learn from home and things like that. I think it remains to be seen what's going to happen as we go forward in terms of how some of those 100% gross margin items perform. It's logical that those things that are cloud would see strong growth on a go-forward basis.In previous environments, when things have slowed down, we have seen customers sweat assets. And you can see warranties and software assurance and things like that pick up as well. But I think we'll need to see what happens over the next few quarters here before I'd want to make a more definitive call on what happens with that portion of the business. -- OK. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it.Our next question coming from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. -- Thank you. Good morning. A clarification and then a question. First, when you referenced the double-digit declines in late March and April for the corporate sector, was that a revenue comment or that was new bookings that won't impact the reported results for several months? And then one of the clearest trends, and you talked about this in your prepared remarks, is an acceleration adoption of public cloud.Can you just talk about what you're doing to enable the sales force or expand the portfolio of services to capture more value from that shift? Thank you.\u00a0 -- Katy, I'll take the first one and maybe Chris will take the second. Just to clarify my comment. When I was talking about what we were seeing, those were comments really for the first five weeks of the second quarter, so primarily April. And when I said shipments, we saw solid growth as a result of the backlog.You can think of that as equivalent to a revenue. When we talk about writings or bookings, and that's what I referred to as being down double digits in corporate and small business, those, at some point, turn into future shipments or invoices, so that's more of a leading indicator. Hopefully, that clarifies it for you. -- That's perfect. That's what I figured. I just wanted to make sure. -- Yes. OK. And then I think... -- Yes. I'll take your question, Katy. On cloud, as you know, we've been building our capabilities around cloud and the hybrid multi-cloud work environment now for years. And when we think about cloud generally, I think about it adding even more complexity to the choices that our customers need to make.And you add the uncertainty of the world that we're in today, there's even another layer of complexity. Even simple cloud choices, like the video and call solutions that we all are using now, creates complexity for the IT staff as they've got to enable coworkers to use it consistently and at high-performance levels, etc. So this plays very well into our value proposition. We have, as you know, I think we have over 250 cloud offerings on our line card, and we're essentially, our value prop is we're vendor and technology and consumption agnostic.So we can play that trusted advisor role for organizations as they're sorting through what their strategies ought to be. And frankly, when we talk to customers now, the questions, because they're moving so quickly, is help us figure this out, what should we do, how should we do it. We're having those types of questions around assessing and design more frequently than ever before. So you think about professional services, managed services for public and hybrid cloud, those are areas that we have been investing and we'll continue to invest in, so we can help our customers assess their options, where to migrate, how to evaluate, how to integrate, how to support the deployment and then how to manage cloud workloads.So I would say, it's a full spectrum from assess, design, integrate and manage across a multi-cloud world. -- Thank you.\u00a0Our next question coming from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open.\u00a0 -- Hi. You've talked about kind of reallocating sales and technical resources, and maybe this builds on that previous question a little bit. But obviously, some of that has probably been done to meet the surge in demand in March and into April that you saw. But can you take a little bit more of a medium-term outlook on that? Where are the strategic changes coming into play as we think about the coming quarters and the rest of the year? -- Maggie, so in connection with the resources, yes, think about it a couple of different ways. One is I think about our sales organization and where demand is and how we can help generate demand and also help customers facilitate through stimulus packages and things like that. So some of the more resilient end markets, we're ensuring that we've got the sales organizations well aligned from a resource perspective there. From a technology perspective, we've been building capabilities across the full spectrum of solutions and certainly focused on the most pressing solutions right now.We talked about network augmentation, things like that. But we are building our cloud capabilities, our automation capabilities. Aptris was a great example of an acquisition that brought us extremely strong capabilities in a cornerstone IT software application. And Scalar was another great example of doubling the size of our business up in Canada through a strategic acquisition of organization that has, from your cloud capabilities, both professional services, all the way through to managed capabilities.And we continue to add those in the U.S. as well. You might be familiar, we introduced our CDW Amplified Services last year. And one key focal area, a pillar of those services, is around a multi-cloud environment.So we'll continue to focus there. The other area that, I think, we all believe is going to be accelerating is helping customers with their digital needs. Digital now is a matter of survival, in addition to competitive advantages. We hear it across the board.Even retail fast food organizations who are taking a real accelerated approach to digital. Our technology organization has solutions architects as well as engineers who can support in the design and deployment of digital strategies. And so we'll expect to see more and more of that, I think, over the next few months. Those might not come to fruition perhaps until later in the year.But certainly, we are having those conversations now. -- And then as we think about some of the segments, obviously, you've stated it's very difficult to see where demand is going to come from in terms of the client base. But if we think about the segments in the context of your growth strategy, in particular, picking up market share, is there a strategic change there, particularly maybe around small business, which is something that was starting to get traction and, obviously, will change in this environment? And then we'd be interested to hear what you're hearing from clients in higher ed and education in general as well given some of the dynamics going on in that segment at the moment -- Yes. OK. So let me try and take those in order. In terms of strategic shift, the way I'd think about it is our overall strategy and the value proposition to our customers, it stays the same in terms of diversified portfolio of end markets, breadth of product and services that we offer to meet the customers' needs now and in the future.In terms of new segments potentially or within segments, we also subsegment, and sub-verticalization is a focus of how we serve our partners and our customers more effectively. And so, certainly, coming out of this environment, I could envision some additional subsegmentation or markets that we serve in a different way or a more concentrated way. On the small business side, we've been investing in our e-commerce capabilities over the last several years when we started the small business of stand-alone unit 2.5 years ago, and we've been seeing great results. And I would expect, in this environment and in the future, that digital will play a continuing bigger role in small business.But just as it will, with respect to the rest of our segments, I expect to see kind of a human and digital combination be very strong. Within education, on the K-12, we've seen strength there. And as you know, the educators are focused on access and equity. There's a large proportion of students across the world and across the U.S., excuse me, that do not have access to endpoint devices, client devices and/or the Internet.And there's quite a focus on ensuring, as e-learning is expected to continue, that those devices get into their hands. And so we're helping try to support that. On the higher ed side, we saw strength in the first quarter, as we said. But equally, we think that budget, I'll call it budget concerns, as we go into the latter half of the year in a couple of the segments could weigh on demand, and we'll have to see how that plays out. -- Thanks so much.\u00a0Our next question coming from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. -- Thank you very much. I was wondering, Collin, you talked a bit about what you've seen in the past five weeks. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit more, you mentioned stimulus or maybe, Chris, you did during your conversation. I'm just curious if you've seen any near-term changes in discussions as some of the dollars have started to hit the small businesses as well as some of the states are starting to open up.So that's the most sort of maybe a change in conversation in the last couple of weeks. And then I have a follow-up. -- Yes. I think it's difficult to say, Shannon, how those stimulus dollars have changed the tone of the conversation in just the past few weeks because it has been moving so quickly. I think those are part of longer-term conversations with our customers and some of the resources we bring to bear and helping them understand how those stimulus dollars are ultimately going to flow from CARES. So for example, in education, I think there's $13 billion \u2014 $30 billion roughly split between higher ed and K-12, and it follows program funding and Title I and things like that.And helping our end-user customers understand how those funds might be made available to them and ensuring that they have their best opportunity to go ahead and access. And there've also been modifications made to e-rate and timing changes. And again, just helping our customers understand those. So I would say, it's unlikely that it has factored into the trends that I referenced in April.I think it's more of a go-forward opportunity. -- OK. And then I was curious, in the discussions with some of your customers, when obviously priority shifted during the quarter to more work from home and just business continuity. The longer-term projects that you had that are sort of in place, have those been canceled, pushed out? Have any customers started to revisit a time line for some of those? I'm just again trying to get into the mindset of your customer base. Thank you.\u00a0 -- Yes. Yes. Shannon, thanks for that question. All of the above, I would say.And it is such a, I'll call it, almost diverse experience, depending on the industry, depending on the customer. We have not seen a large portion of customers cancel projects. That's the No. 1 thing.We have seen more customers who have just diverted their resources and their attention to the more urgent needs. And they're still focused on urgent needs in terms of optimizing the work from home or remote working situations that they're in. There's a lot of focus on that right now. But equally, we have seen some customers who are coming back.We've got some larger digital transformation projects that customers have actually accelerated, and we're working with them across the board because, as I said before, it's a matter of obviously survival, but also competitive advantage coming out of this. So it's quite a wide range, and I'm not sure there's much that we can pull out of that in way of trend. We're just staying close to our customers and ensuring that we keep the projects going forward that can. But very few have canceled, Shannon. -- Thank you very much.\u00a0Our next question coming from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. -- Yes. Thanks. Good morning and thanks for all your candid answers so far. Just one quick follow-up for me regarding your comments on the Census project in federal.It sounds like trends in federal continue to be normal in terms of seasonal demand, the only change being, Collin, your discussion about some of those Census projects get pushed out from Q2 to Q4. So could you give us some more color on that and confirm that? -- Yes, Matt. As both Chris and I said, we expect federal to hold up relatively well from a budget perspective. And the time change I referenced was primarily due to the devices being in the field longer, which is spreading the revenue over a longer period of time, largely from Q2 into Q4. -- OK. And just actually one more follow-up. Just regarding the surge in demand, near-term demand you're seeing for work at home solutions. And I know that's one slow trend that we've seen over the last couple of years as is technology as a service, where there's a leasing component.Are you seeing any acceleration in that as customers look at their own capital requirements and their own balance sheets and perhaps look to that as a service model? -- Yes. Matt, I would say, I mean in terms of the most recent surge, the objective was speed and getting it deployed rapidly. So most of that transacted in a traditional way. I think, as we go forward, and customers are wrestling with their own budget challenges, I think we could see that option enter into the discussion more than it has historically.But in terms of the recent surge, it was primarily transacted in a traditional purchase model. -- Got it. OK. Thanks a lot.Our next question coming from the line of Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\u00a0 -- Yes. A quick follow-up question on work from home, if you don't mind. Has this demand drawn you into at-home sort of shipments, at-home installations, at-home maintenance of the client technology? If it has, is that a good business to be in? And is it sort of yielding any sort of value-added opportunities of any materiality? -- Yes. It's Chris. It has in some ways because of the urgency of getting the devices where they needed to be. And CDW's team did a really great job of moving shipments.So I'll give you an example. When you've got a shipment for 10,000 devices that goes to one location, and those 10,000 devices now need to go to 10,000 locations or 5,000 locations, that's not easy to do. And the organization did a great job of being flexible and responsive there. In terms of continuing to support, yes, we are adding additional hardware, software and support services to these work-from-home and remote requirements.But generally, those are being managed centrally through the IT group of the organization. So it feels like it's more just a dispersed workforce, if you will, managed centrally. And that's something that we're highly capable of doing. -- Got it. And then, Collin, you mentioned that you sense there's a pull forward for work from home. Of course, that's intuitively correct. So I'm just wondering at what point you'll know whether or not there's real pull forward.And if it's sort of post factor, then I guess, it doesn't really matter, but when do you think you'll know? And how do you think you'll know? -- Yes. Good question, Paul. I'm not convinced we're ever really going to know because I think the wildcard here is how much is pull forward of something that was going to be purchased anyway versus what's an incremental use case, meaning that companies, school districts, government agencies never intended for these coworkers or students or teachers to have mobile devices. And it's effectively a shift from their IT budget to a use case that they didn't know that they were going to need.And I think it will be nearly impossible to ultimately parse that out. -- Thank you.\u00a0Our next question coming from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. -- Good morning. Chris, I was hoping you could provide a bit color in terms of the ability to access client facilities. Historically, how important has that been to the CDW sales process? And I guess as we look at the potential that some customers may not allow any visitors on-site for the next several months, how are you guys looking at that for the next several months? And could that be an impact on sales? Thank you.\u00a0 -- Keith, yes. Great question. Thank you. There are a couple of different levels there.Let me just start first with the service engineers and then move into the sales organization. Our service engineers, we broke immediately into several components, what could be done remotely and what needed to be done on-site, and then provided them with the protective equipments and peace of mind that they could go on-site with customers. And they have been doing that and doing that very effectively. But we did break that into pieces.And remote access can get us very far in some of the work we've had to do for work from home. Regarding our sellers, I'll come back to the comments I mentioned earlier. Certainly, in-person connections and meetings at the office and relationship building live has always been important to any relationship sales organization. But I don't want to call it surprising, but it's been a really positive discovery for me in any event is the incredible way that our sales organization is staying connected with our customers, almost more deeply than in person.So I think what we're going to start to see is flexible ways of working. Our hybrid world will probably become our workforce hybrid world. And they'll all do what they need to do to make the connections and serve the customers and ensure that we can have learning sessions and white-boarding sessions that are as effective as possible. And some of that might go back to kind of the way it was prior to this epidemic.But I also think we're going to see some significant changes. The other thing I would say is our sales organization, as you know, is a legacy inside organization that goes back a long way. And so the teams have been built with resources wrapped around them that have, in many cases, been remotely accessed. So it's not a new thing for our sellers and our solutions architects and engineers to be on collaborative tools actually helping to solve solutions.So I hope that answers the question. I think we'll see a little bit of a new world going forward. And I feel like the team has already been effective, and we'll take the learnings and continue to drive even greater and deeper relationships with our customers. -- OK. I appreciate that. And then, Collin, just a follow-up to the commentary regarding the $29 million credit reserve. I guess how does that compare to, I guess, the average quarter? And then are you already starting to see some credit deterioration? Or is this an anticipation of what you expect to see later in the quarter and the rest of the year? -- Yes, Keith. I'll take the last one first. I think it's too soon to see any material credit deterioration. I think it's in anticipation of what we expect to come down the road.When you look at our balance sheet, you'll see that at March 31, the reserve was approximately $35 million, which is a little bit more than 1% of our outstanding customer receivable balance. Historically, that balance has been much lower. If you look at where it was at year-end or in the year ago period, it's been running around $7 million to $8 million previously. So we used a variety of data points to estimate the reserve.We looked at historical information, what our experience was back in 2008, 2009, current conditions and, again, estimates of what we think could be coming. -- Thank you.\u00a0I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks. -- Thank you. Thank you all for staying on a little longer with us. Concluding today's call, I want to once more recognize the remarkable dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. They continuously reaffirm my conviction that we will enjoy better days ahead.I'm so proud and grateful to be part of this team. So thank you to the team. And thank you to our customers and our partners for the privilege and opportunity to serve you during these times, and to our investors and analysts for participating in this call. We appreciate you and your continuing interest and in support of CDW.Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Until then, stay healthy, stay safe and be well.

Since then, I have not found another business not already in the Foolish universe worthy of such an assertion. Until now!For only the second time since that discussion in 2017, I've come across a stock -- this time,\u00a0 -- that is one of the very best businesses not appearing as an active recommendation in a Motley Fool service.Why do I have such a high opinion of the company?To help explain, I pulled together a list of important questions I think investors should be asking about the company, and then went about answering them for readers on ! In a way, I'm having a conversation with myself about CDW. Here's what I had to say.CDW specializes in B2B computer equipment sales. Image source: Getty Images.CDW was founded in 1984, and its stock went public the first time in 1993. It currently generates about $18 billion in revenue, has about 10,000 employees, and has a market valuation of about $18 billion as well. CDW originally stood for Computer Discount Warehouse, but today the official name is CDW Corporation. In the early 2000s, CDW mainly sold desktops, laptops, and printers.Today, it still sells the latest computer and device hardware, but also sells products for data centers, networks, cybersecurity, mobility, virtualization, collaboration, automation, the public/private/hybrid cloud, and software as a service. CDW's cloud practice is large and growing. It offers services from over 70 public cloud vendors, and CDW generates about $3 billion in cloud revenue. When breaking down its sales, roughly 80% are from hardware and 20% from software and services.CDW is a value-added reseller of a variety of technology products and a provider of business-to-business information technology solutions. Those products and services come from a wide range of companies, including\u00a0, , , , , , and\u00a0. It also serves as a sales and solutions provider for companies like , , , , , , and .Image source: CDW Corp.Investing in CDW is a way to benefit from the growth of many of the most innovative companies in the world without paying elevated multiples of 10 or 20 times sales -- and sometimes higher. (I'm OK paying those multiples for small bets, but this is just another way to get exposure.)CDW's success is not tied to any one technology product or tailwind. Instead, it offers a range of products and services from some of The Motley Fool's favorite companies. And unlike some of those early stage, rapid-growth companies, CDW is a highly profitable growing business. Also, unlike many tech darlings, CDW is not subject to disruption risk. Rather, CDW is technology agnostic, and technological disruption and innovation drive its business!Information technology (IT) is getting more complex and more integral to businesses across industries as they adapt to the digital revolution, so I'm confident that CDW's service offering will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future. If you want to invest in the latest and greatest technologies but feel like they are outside your circle of competence and you are afraid of disruption risk -- but you still want exposure to technology -- then CDW may be right for you!\u00a0Image source: CDW Corp.CDW operates in a large and growing market. It currently has a 5% share of a $360 billion total addressable market and is consistently growing its share. In the span of 2009-2019, CDW grew sales at 1.8 times the market rate (or by 4.4% compounded annually).CDW's above-market growth is driven by three things:And here's where it gets exciting: Even though it only has 5% share, CDW is by far the largest player in this highly fragmented market with tens of thousands of smaller competitors, so there is a very long runway of attractive top-line growth from market share gains and occasional acquisitions. All in all, a pretty awesome elevator pitch, eh?Image source: CDW Corp.I've long been aware of CDW because I report on (and own stock in) two other leading digital IT service providers,\u00a0  and . If you know me, then you know that Accenture and EPAM are two of my very highest-conviction investments. I was aware that CDW had a different business model, but that it was still a high-quality growing business. I followed the company from a 30,000-foot view but never got closer because I tend to prefer businesses with net cash and high free cash flow (FCF) margins, among other things (more on that later).But then I read an excellent investment thesis on CDW by David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners, in his third-quarter 2019 letter to investors. Ever since, I've been analyzing CDW (equity research takes time, Fools), and I really like what I've learned! My investment thesis is very similar to Rolfe's because my research has led me to agree with everything he said.CDW has shifted from selling discrete technology products to selling integrated technology solutions to include technology road-map planning (advisory),\u00a0design, installation, ongoing maintenance and support, and then eventual renewal. In other words, CDW provides support across the entire IT life cycle, and by doing so it creates long-term, sticky customer relationships. To support this business model shift, CDW has increased its hiring of technology engineers and specialists to provide these higher-margin services.The business model shift, while ongoing, has been a huge success and has helped cement CDW as a leading IT solutions brand. In 2019, it was ranked the fifth-best solutions provider out of 500 by  (CRN).CDW was acquired by a private equity firm in 2007 and had a second  in June 2013. The company's fundamentals have improved dramatically since year-end 2012 (the year before it went public). Today, the company has lower debt ratios, higher interest-coverage ratios, and higher returns on invested capital (ROIC). The company's high-single-digit top-line growth (more on its growth below) is almost all organic since CDW has only made three acquisitions in the last 10 years. Its former chief legal counsel, Christine Leahy, became CEO on Jan. 1, 2019. Since then, she's made two of those three acquisitions, so it's possible that she will prioritize acquisitions more than her predecessor. But that remains to be seen.CDW acts as a middleman between technology vendors and customers. It does not manufacture products, so it spends very little on capital expenditures and nothing on research and development. A significant portion of its advertising expense is reimbursed by vendors through cooperative programs, so CDW only spends an average of about 1.2% of sales on advertising. Its two biggest areas of investment are working capital and people. Of its 10,000 employees, two-thirds are customer-facing.It sells over 100,000 products from more than 1,000 vendor partners to over 250,000 regular customers. Vendor partners include OEMs, software publishers, cloud providers, and others. CDW adds between 50 and 75 new partners each year to ensure its product/service offerings remain relevant and innovative, to maintain long-term growth, and to future-proof the business. In addition to procuring products directly from its vendor partners, it also buys from third-party wholesale distributors. It primarily sells to customers with fewer than 5,000 employees.Vendors want access to CDW's 250,000 customers (especially the smaller ones where the OEMs don't have a long-term relationship) as well as its sales force and distribution footprint, installation, service, and support staff. This is why CDW is typically the first- or second-largest channel partner for OEMs in North America (and often in the world).Customers want the large product selection and availability, and the ease of buying hardware, software, and services from one reliable IT provider. They also appreciate that CDW is technology agnostic so they know it's providing them with unbiased advice. This is why the average customer has been working with CDW for 11 years.It has diverse revenue streams selling its products to corporations, governments, and education and healthcare organizations. CDW primarily serves customers headquartered in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, with roughly 88% of 2019 revenue generated in the U.S. But those customers have locations all over the world, so CDW is indirectly serving 150 countries across the globe.Traditional competitors include  ,  , and  . Relative to its peer group, CDW is multiples larger, growing faster, more profitable, and more attractively priced based on dividend yield and free cash flow yield.Data is current as of Feb. 19. Sales, net income, free cash flow (FCF), return on invested capital (ROIC), and FCF yield are all trailing 12-month totals. Sources: S&P Global and New Constructs.CDW is starting to offer more consulting services, so it does compete with Accenture and EPAM from time to time. But the big difference is that CDW is a value-added reseller that carries inventory on its balance sheet and has distribution centers to house that inventory and speed fulfillment. The other difference is that CDW mainly works with small and medium-size businesses so, for example, it would likely not be hired to do an enterprise resource planning implementation at a Fortune 500 company.While we're on the topic, CDW does hold inventory, but it also has drop-shipment arrangements with vendors and distributors so that it doesn't have to hold that portion of inventory at its warehouses. Roughly 50% of CDW's sales come from these drop-shipment arrangements.CDW was previously owned by private equity firms (through a leveraged buyout) so it has significantly more debt than I am typically comfortable with. By the company's own account, it has substantial indebtedness.\" It has $3.2 billion in net debt and $951 million in trailing FCF, according to the website\u00a0, so its net debt to FCF is about 3.4 times.I typically don't want to see the net debt/FCF ratio higher than 2, meaning that the company could pay off all its net debt with two years' worth of FCF. In CDW's case, it would take almost four years of FCF to pay off all its net debt. But since CDW's 2013 IPO, it has reduced its leverage ratios significantly, and according to , CDW has improved its interest coverage ratio (EBIT/interest expense) from 2 times in 2013 to 7 times at the end of 2019. The average maturity on its debt is over six years, and its weighted average cost of debt is only 4.3%.I'm also comfortable with CDW's financial leverage because it does not also have a fixed-cost business model with a lot of operating leverage. (It's when companies have both debt leverage and operating leverage that they are more likely to get into trouble.) Instead, CDW has a variable cost structure. That means if sales slow, the company can immediately respond by reducing compensation expense and working capital (working capital is the company's biggest capital investment, and if business slows it can easily cut investments in inventory). This ensures that there is enough operating income or cash flow to service the debt. Importantly, CDW is capable of generating even more cash flow than normal during a recession because it could dramatically reduce working capital.CDW has a target net-debt-to- ratio of 2.5 to 3. It's currently slightly below its target. I think the debt is used to support its capital allocation plan (see below) and to boost return on equity (ROE) to fantastically high levels. According to S&P Global, CDW's five-year average ROE is 55%, and its trailing ROE is 76%.Image source: CDW Corp.CDW is operating with lots of business momentum because of solid execution, its business model shift, and the digital revolution. From 2014-2019, this was CDW's five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in various metrics:FCF grew slower than net income during this time period because in 2014, the starting year for these calculations, FCF was so much higher than net income. Regardless, FCF still grew at almost double the rate of revenue.In 2019, CDW's sales grew 11%, GAAP-diluted EPS increased by 19%, and adjusted diluted EPS increased by 18%. Of the 11% top-line growth in 2019, roughly 1% came from acquisitions and a little less than 1% came from the devices-as-a-service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau. CDW is leasing smartphones and tablets to enable 500,000 field workers to take the census. This will also add about 1 percentage of incremental revenue growth in 2020, but the census project will end this year (so this is a significant but nonrecurring revenue stream).At the same time that CDW is generating stable and strong organic revenue growth, its ROIC is consistently rising. The combination of strong or rising organic revenue growth with strong or rising ROIC is investors' nirvana because it indicates that CDW is creating lots of business value.It's a growing business with a growth mindset. In fact, the company recently created a new role of chief growth and innovation officer to address that fact.Long-term growth should come from a conversion-to-digital tailwind and continued market share gains. Additional growth could come from acquisitions and continued international expansion. CDW has a growing presence in Canada and the U.K. and recently set up legal entities in the Netherlands and India. That's the first small step to setting up larger fulfillment operations in those countries over time. This is an exciting growth story, Fools.Its revenue growth is somewhat tied to customer headcount growth, but CDW has been able to generate slight operating margin improvements as it shifts to higher-margin services and from leveraging technology and automation internally. Below the operating margin line, CDW's net income also benefited largely from deleveraging (paying down debt reduces interest expense) and from corporate tax cuts. Almost 90% of its sales are generated in the U.S., so it benefited greatly from corporate tax reform.As a reseller, CDW is a low-margin business. Its gross margins are stable in the 16.5% to 17% range, and its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) margins are less than 5%. It has a long-term goal to generate free cash flow margins of about 4%.But, according to New Constructs, it was still able to generate a trailing 12-month ROIC of 17% and a return on tangible invested capital of 53%. CDW's return on tangible capital is so much higher than its ROIC (which is also high) because lots of goodwill was added to the balance sheet during the leveraged buyout. That return-on-tangible-capital figure shows the truly awesome profitability of the underlying operating business.Impressively, its ROIC has increased for the past five consecutive years, and we can use a  to see that the increase was driven by higher NOPAT margins and higher invested capital turns. Basically, the company is becoming more efficient at managing its working capital and other assets on its balance sheet. This means CDW is , or invested capital turns, and its improving margins are boosting returns as well. In my experience, it is somewhat rare to find a business whose ROIC is getting a boost from both higher turns  higher margins, and I think this is an indicator that the company has been firing on all cylinders.Image source: New Constructs. WACC = weighted average cost of capital.Image source: New Constructs.One of the benefits of operating under private equity ownership is you get very focused on aggressively managing working capital and cash conversion very quickly because those cash flows are needed to service the large debt load. Today, CDW's balance sheet is much healthier, but it is still operating under its tougher efficiency guidelines, especially with regards to monitoring the cash in and out of the business. It's just built into this company's corporate DNA now.Image source: CDW Corp.We've talked about revenue growth and ROIC, which are important because they ultimately drive free cash flow. CDW is a low-margin business, but its FCF is pretty strong because its average capital-expenditures-to-sales ratio is only 0.5% (that's really low) and because the company is very efficient at managing working capital and its cash conversion cycle. As I said earlier, CDW's FCF grew at a 5-year CAGR of 16%. CDW generated more FCF than net income in each of the past four years (2016-2019), and it has a long-term goal to generate an annual FCF margin in the 3.75% to 4.25% range.From 2018 to 2019, CDW's capital expenditures increased a whopping 174% (from $86 million to $236 million) as it dramatically ramped up spending for the contract with the Census Bureau. But this is a one-time project that will end in 2020. This means that CDW's capex will return to its normal level of about 0.5% of sales, and that the 2019 boost in capex will turn into depreciation (which is a non-cash expense that is added back on the cash flow statement). Expect that the company's FCF will remain strong and continue to grow at least in line with its organic revenue.CDW's moats include its long-term relationships with both vendors and customers, the scale and scope of products and services offered and distribution capabilities, and unique insights gained from being a key partner to both customers and IT vendors. The company sits in the middle of the tech supply chain offering attractive value propositions to both customers and vendor partners (OEMs, software companies, and the like). CDW says that it acts as both \"an extension of its customers' IT staffs\" and \"an extension of its partners' sales and marketing resources.\"What truly makes CDW unique is its multiple sources of interlocking competitive advantages. Of those, I'm most impressed by its scale and scope relative to its peers. Its size allows it to invest heavily in its sales force and engineering teams, own three distribution centers, and make sure that it gets its fair share of inventory from vendors when there are supply shortages. This means that CDW will have the inventory that its customers require.This is similar to the competitive advantage question, but it goes a step further. I won't recommend a company that isn't truly differentiated and doesn't have differentiation that shows up through superior corporate financial performance.CDW is unique because it has multiple sources to reinforce its moat. I especially like that it is the single largest player in an attractive industry and has a scale and scope that is multiples larger than its peers. This provides the company with negotiating leverage, innovative product offerings, multiple levers of profitable growth, and an attractive workplace for top tech talent.I also think it's unique because it provides an equal amount of value to both its vendor partners and its customers and is run by a CEO who is committed to taking a stakeholder approach to drive sustainable profitable growth. This second point is of grave importance and will contribute as much (or more) to long-term business value growth than anything else.It is CDW's  and stakeholder approach to growing the business sustainably over time that provides the company with its most enduring moat, while providing investors with a CDW's capital allocation priorities are (in order):CDW paid a $0.17 per share annual dividend in 2013, and the current annual dividend is $1.52 ($0.38 quarterly). That means it has increased the dividend nearly ninefold (or 794%) since its June 2013 IPO. It most recently increased the quarterly dividend by 29%. Its goal is to maintain a payout ratio of about 25% and to grow the dividend in line with earnings. If you like dividend growth stories, this company has one!Although its first priority is to increase the dividend, CDW actually spends more on annual share repurchases than it does on dividends. It has historically reduced the diluted share count by about 3% per year. Given that CDW is currently operating below its target leverage ratio, it intends to return more than 100% of FCF to investors in 2020 (as it did in 2019).Regarding acquisitions, CDW looks for product relevance and innovation, strategic and cultural fit, international expansion, and attractive financial returns. I like that CDW is not overly aggressive with acquisitions (it's only bought three companies in the last 10 years) and that this is not a roll-up story. Its ROIC has actually improved despite the acquisitions, which is a key indicator of success.Image source: Getty Images.I'm going to say no, for now, because it doesn't increase prices annually and doesn't have recurring revenue that we'd see from companies with long-term contracts or that sell use-once-and-dispose consumables, or that sell subscription services.CDW's contracts are not long term (with customers or vendors), but only 12 months in length. Its managed-services contracts are longer (and therefore recurring), but managed services are a small part of its business. Managed services provide basic infrastructure hosting for things such as database management, break/fix support and patching, and performance and capacity monitoring and reporting.Pricing at CDW is actually set by the account managers (sellers) because they have the closest relationship with the customer. The sales force is given a price minimum and a price range, and then picks the best price based on its knowledge of the customer and the competitive environment. Sellers are compensated based on a percentage of gross profit, and this model clearly works because of CDW's (already referenced) very stable gross margin profile. More than 50% of CDW's sales are generated from account managers who have been working at CDW for at least seven years. This long-tenured sales force helps to build those long-term, sticky customer relationships.It's also important to note that a great business generates high ROIC and has opportunities to reinvest at high returns to drive organic revenue growth and strong FCF over a long time. Pricing power and recurring revenue are two paths to high ROIC and consistent growth, but not the only paths. CDW generates high and increasing ROIC and has demonstrated a long record of above-market organic revenue growth.The lack of pricing power is more than made up for by its unique business model of providing a real value proposition to both its vendor partners and its customers. It also helps that CDW has a CEO with a stakeholder approach to sustainable profitable growth.Christine Leahy has been CEO since Jan. 1, 2019, and has worked at CDW since 2002. According to S&P Global, she owns $11 million worth of its stock, which is not bad for only holding the CEO position for about 15 months. In her first letter to shareholders, Leahy stressed CDW's :We will never take for granted our reputation with our customers, co-workers, partners, shareholders and communities where we employ, live and have impact -- a reputation that has been built over 35 years through relentless commitment, dedication, hard work, philanthropic contributions and complete integrity. I assure you that every single day during my time as the leader of your Company and as your fellow stakeholder, CDW will continue to never allow for complacency regarding our business performance or anything less than the full commitment to serving our customers and enhancing the value of our shareholders' investments and the lives of our stakeholders. The means will be as important and non-negotiable as the ends. This is my commitment to you.I admire several of the company's corporate governance policies, including having a clawback\u00a0policy, a separate CEO and chairman, majority voting, no executive perquisites, diversity on the executive committee (six of 13 execs are women) and board (four of 11 board members are women), and strict stock-ownership guidelines. Board members are required to own five times their annual cash retainer in stock, and the CEO is required to own six times her annual base salary in stock.I also love that the company's executive compensation plan is partly based on both market share gains (which drive organic revenue growth) and free cash flow (which is the driver of intrinsic value growth and what we are ultimately after as investors). Would I like to see CDW add an ROIC metric to its incentive compensation plan? Yes, of course, because ! But this is a management team that clearly understands the drivers of business value and the importance of return-based metrics, so I'm agreeable with this comp plan.I also applaud that the company is transitioning to an annual election of directors starting in 2021.CDW sells a wide assortment of computer equipment to consumers and businesses. Image source: Getty Images.This is an important question, so we need to spend some quality time discussing it. One thing I really love about this management team is its . In her first annual report to investors, Leahy mentioned the phrase \"profitable growth\" at least four times.Later in that same report, it becomes clear that Leahy and her management team understand the vital link between reinvestment, proper incentive compensation, and profitable growth, when she says: \"We have built a strong sales organization and deep services and solutions capabilities over time and expect to continue to invest to enhance these capabilities, which we believe when combined with our competitive advantages of scale and a performance driven culture, will help drive sustainable, profitable growth for us today and in the future. ... Our strong, execution-oriented culture is underpinned by our compensation system.\"Then on the , an analyst asked CDW management if the company is \"underearning a little bit because of the investments?\" CFO Collin Kebo's response (which I absolutely ) was:... in your question, are we underearning? I guess, the flip of that is, are we overinvesting? And I would say, no. We feel like we have the right balance between investment back into the business that allows us to continue to create differentiation in the marketplace that enables the sustainable outperformance versus the market. So could we pull back on investment in the short term? Yes. Absolutely. Would the margin float up? Yes. But I think that 200- to 300-basis-point premium that we've consistently been able to deliver [referring to the 2% to 3% in annual market share gains], over time, you would see that get chipped away. So we think we have the right balance between investing in the business and growth in margin.Earlier on the same call, Kebo said: \"... our fourth-quarter and full-year results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business that build on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth, and return cash to shareholders.\"On the earnings call, Leahy explained why the company created the new role of chief growth and innovation officer:We're really focused on scaling sustainable growth. So this is about focus for growth. And in particular, when we think about our customers, our partners and products and the channels and platforms that we use [and] sell, and the technology and digital capabilities that underpin those, the connective tissue between them is becoming more and more important. So this role is really intended to help align and focus our efforts and investments around driving the connectivity there. When you take a step back, CDW has historically delivered meaningful profitable growth. And we've done that through continual innovation and continual investment, disciplined investment, and focus on investing where the growth is. So when I think about growth and innovation and bringing that team together, it's just another natural step in the way that we think about growth in the future.As a long-term, business-minded, quality-growth investor, this is exactly the language I love to hear from a corporate management team that I'm thinking of partnering with.Competition for tech talent these days is intense. CDW has a workplace culture that's performance-driven (I already discussed the incentive programs for sellers and executives) and highly engaged. It runs an engagement survey of employees every two years and pulse surveys in off years. CDW has a 96% participation rate in the surveys, and actions to come out of them include expanding paternity leave, improving automation, and offering ongoing career training.Leahy has a 93% CEO approval rating on Glassdoor.com, and CDW is on Glassdoor's 2020 list of Best Places to Work. CDW scores a perfect 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, is ranked in the top 100 Best Places to Work in IT, according to Computerworld, and is ranked as a \"best place to work\" for military veterans and for women. CDW is also ranked as one of the top 100 \"most just companies\" in the U.S., according to JUST Capital.The company is also on ' 2020 list of America's Best Employers for Diversity, and CDW has several groups to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace and has a \"be Green\" environmental initiative. The company would be well served to set stricter environmental goals and to share the progress against those goals by publishing annual sustainability reports.Possible near-term risks are that CDW is unable to get enough inventory because of supply constraints brought on by the novel coronavirus outbreak or that customers cut back on spending due to uncertainty in a U.S. presidential election year. These are wild cards to be aware of.Another risk is vendor concentration. Products from  and  account for 25% of CDW's overall sales. And products from its seven largest vendors account for 60% of sales.But a potentially larger long-term risk to the stock is if we experience a broader economic downturn in which customers may temporarily cut their IT spending. CDW's diversified revenue clientele may help mitigate what could be significant cuts (for example, government or education spending may remain healthy even though corporate spending is cut). It also helps that, as the world has digitized, technology has become more integral to organizations than it was during the Great Recession.On the other hand, a recession scenario could actually present an opportunity for CDW. A neat thing about its business model is that cash flow actually has the potential to be stronger during a recession because the company would significantly reduce working capital, which is its single largest capital expense. This strong FCF would allow the company to continue to increase the dividend, buy back discounted stock, and (hopefully) make acquisitions that allow it to come out of the recession even stronger.CDW held up fairly well during the global financial crisis with sales decreases of only 1% in 2008 and 11% in 2009. Then sales quickly rebounded 23% in 2010. An awesome showing, considering it was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But earnings did not hold up so well. The company reported losses in 2008 and 2009, largely because of impairment charges to write down some of the goodwill from going private. But those were noncash charges in 2008 and 2009, so cash flow from operations was still positive.CDW is a people business and thus has a variable-cost structure. This means if sales slow, the company can immediately respond by reducing compensation expense and working capital to make sure there is enough cash flow to service the debt, increase the dividend, and invest aggressively during the downturn. Today CDW is in a much more favorable financial position than it was during the last recession. It entered the last recession leveraged at 10 times EBITDA. In fact, CDW's management says that whenever the next recession occurs, it will be ready to make acquisitions on the cheap.The market downturn in late February has brought the stock price down more than 20% from its 52-week high of $146 a share. When evaluating whether a stock is a bargain, a lot of investors focus on the , so let's start there. CDW's forward P/E is currently hovering around 17, compared with a past average of about 15 since its 2013 IPO. The stock has clearly re-rated higher because:What precise P/E does it deserve? I don't know. But I'm very confident that an appropriate P/E is closer to 18, 19, or 20 (or even higher) than it is to 15. CDW has developed into a high-quality growing business with excellent management and exposure to long-duration tailwinds.According to market research firm IDC, global IT spending is projected to grow at a roughly 4% CAGR through 2023. But U.S. IT spending (CDW's largest market) has historically grown at an average of 5% per year, and CDW's core markets are projected to grow at 5% annually over the next four years. Let's assume long-term market growth of 5% and that CDW outgrows the market (i.e., takes market share) by 2% to 3% per year which is its goal. Based on that, long-term organic revenue growth would average around 7% to 8%.CDW outgrew the market by 2.9% annually from 2006 to 2019 and by a whopping 4.4% from 2009 to 2019. And from 2009 to 2019, CDW's revenue grew at a 9.7% CAGR. To be fair, 2009 was in the depth of the financial crisis, so that calculation is starting from a low base. But from 2009 to 2010, CDW's sales rebounded 23%. If I start the CAGR calculation in 2010, its sales still grew at an annualized rate of 8.3% from 2010 to 2019.In addition to the projected 7% to 8% top-line growth, it would be fair to factor in slight margin expansion as the company shifts to selling higher-margin software, services, and solutions and continues to reduce the diluted share count by about 3% per year. That suggests that EPS and/or FCF per share could grow about 10% to 11% per year. Add in the dividend yield of 1%, and investors can expect total annualized shareholder returns of about 11% to 12%, assuming that the P/E ratio does not change (to be conservative).Here's another way to think about it. According to New Constructs, CDW trades at a 4.7% FCF yield. That by itself is relatively attractive because it is more than four times higher than the 10-year U.S. Treasury note (a proxy for the risk-free rate), which yields an all-time record low of nearly 1% as of this writing.Add CDW's almost 5% FCF yield plus an expectation that the company can grow FCF per share by about 10%, and I calculate that CDW can provide investors with an expected annualized return of roughly 15%.When you combine these two methods, you can estimate that CDW will provide investors with expected annualized returns in the 11% to 15% range. Those should be market-crushing returns, Fools.I plan to buy a starter position as soon as The Motley Fool's trading restrictions allow.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and CDW wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["In 2017, I told The Motley Fool's chief investment officer, Andy Cross, that I thought  was one of the very best businesses not currently listed as a recommendation in a Motley Fool service. Since then, I have not found another business not already in the Foolish universe worthy of such an assertion. Until now!For only the second time since that discussion in 2017, I've come across a stock -- this time,\u00a0 -- that is one of the very best businesses not appearing as an active recommendation in a Motley Fool service.Why do I have such a high opinion of the company?To help explain, I pulled together a list of important questions I think investors should be asking about the company, and then went about answering them for readers on ! In a way, I'm having a conversation with myself about CDW. Here's what I had to say.CDW specializes in B2B computer equipment sales. Image source: Getty Images.CDW was founded in 1984, and its stock went public the first time in 1993. It currently generates about $18 billion in revenue, has about 10,000 employees, and has a market valuation of about $18 billion as well. CDW originally stood for Computer Discount Warehouse, but today the official name is CDW Corporation. In the early 2000s, CDW mainly sold desktops, laptops, and printers.Today, it still sells the latest computer and device hardware, but also sells products for data centers, networks, cybersecurity, mobility, virtualization, collaboration, automation, the public/private/hybrid cloud, and software as a service. CDW's cloud practice is large and growing. It offers services from over 70 public cloud vendors, and CDW generates about $3 billion in cloud revenue. When breaking down its sales, roughly 80% are from hardware and 20% from software and services.CDW is a value-added reseller of a variety of technology products and a provider of business-to-business information technology solutions. Those products and services come from a wide range of companies, including\u00a0, , , , , , and\u00a0. It also serves as a sales and solutions provider for companies like , , , , , , and .Image source: CDW Corp.Investing in CDW is a way to benefit from the growth of many of the most innovative companies in the world without paying elevated multiples of 10 or 20 times sales -- and sometimes higher. (I'm OK paying those multiples for small bets, but this is just another way to get exposure.)CDW's success is not tied to any one technology product or tailwind. Instead, it offers a range of products and services from some of The Motley Fool's favorite companies. And unlike some of those early stage, rapid-growth companies, CDW is a highly profitable growing business. Also, unlike many tech darlings, CDW is not subject to disruption risk. Rather, CDW is technology agnostic, and technological disruption and innovation drive its business!Information technology (IT) is getting more complex and more integral to businesses across industries as they adapt to the digital revolution, so I'm confident that CDW's service offering will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future. If you want to invest in the latest and greatest technologies but feel like they are outside your circle of competence and you are afraid of disruption risk -- but you still want exposure to technology -- then CDW may be right for you!\u00a0Image source: CDW Corp.CDW operates in a large and growing market. It currently has a 5% share of a $360 billion total addressable market and is consistently growing its share. In the span of 2009-2019, CDW grew sales at 1.8 times the market rate (or by 4.4% compounded annually).CDW's above-market growth is driven by three things:And here's where it gets exciting: Even though it only has 5% share, CDW is by far the largest player in this highly fragmented market with tens of thousands of smaller competitors, so there is a very long runway of attractive top-line growth from market share gains and occasional acquisitions. All in all, a pretty awesome elevator pitch, eh?Image source: CDW Corp.I've long been aware of CDW because I report on (and own stock in) two other leading digital IT service providers,\u00a0  and . If you know me, then you know that Accenture and EPAM are two of my very highest-conviction investments. I was aware that CDW had a different business model, but that it was still a high-quality growing business. I followed the company from a 30,000-foot view but never got closer because I tend to prefer businesses with net cash and high free cash flow (FCF) margins, among other things (more on that later).But then I read an excellent investment thesis on CDW by David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners, in his third-quarter 2019 letter to investors. Ever since, I've been analyzing CDW (equity research takes time, Fools), and I really like what I've learned! My investment thesis is very similar to Rolfe's because my research has led me to agree with everything he said.CDW has shifted from selling discrete technology products to selling integrated technology solutions to include technology road-map planning (advisory),\u00a0design, installation, ongoing maintenance and support, and then eventual renewal. In other words, CDW provides support across the entire IT life cycle, and by doing so it creates long-term, sticky customer relationships. To support this business model shift, CDW has increased its hiring of technology engineers and specialists to provide these higher-margin services.The business model shift, while ongoing, has been a huge success and has helped cement CDW as a leading IT solutions brand. In 2019, it was ranked the fifth-best solutions provider out of 500 by  (CRN).CDW was acquired by a private equity firm in 2007 and had a second  in June 2013. The company's fundamentals have improved dramatically since year-end 2012 (the year before it went public). Today, the company has lower debt ratios, higher interest-coverage ratios, and higher returns on invested capital (ROIC). The company's high-single-digit top-line growth (more on its growth below) is almost all organic since CDW has only made three acquisitions in the last 10 years. Its former chief legal counsel, Christine Leahy, became CEO on Jan. 1, 2019. Since then, she's made two of those three acquisitions, so it's possible that she will prioritize acquisitions more than her predecessor. But that remains to be seen.CDW acts as a middleman between technology vendors and customers. It does not manufacture products, so it spends very little on capital expenditures and nothing on research and development. A significant portion of its advertising expense is reimbursed by vendors through cooperative programs, so CDW only spends an average of about 1.2% of sales on advertising. Its two biggest areas of investment are working capital and people. Of its 10,000 employees, two-thirds are customer-facing.It sells over 100,000 products from more than 1,000 vendor partners to over 250,000 regular customers. Vendor partners include OEMs, software publishers, cloud providers, and others. CDW adds between 50 and 75 new partners each year to ensure its product/service offerings remain relevant and innovative, to maintain long-term growth, and to future-proof the business. In addition to procuring products directly from its vendor partners, it also buys from third-party wholesale distributors. It primarily sells to customers with fewer than 5,000 employees.Vendors want access to CDW's 250,000 customers (especially the smaller ones where the OEMs don't have a long-term relationship) as well as its sales force and distribution footprint, installation, service, and support staff. This is why CDW is typically the first- or second-largest channel partner for OEMs in North America (and often in the world).Customers want the large product selection and availability, and the ease of buying hardware, software, and services from one reliable IT provider. They also appreciate that CDW is technology agnostic so they know it's providing them with unbiased advice. This is why the average customer has been working with CDW for 11 years.It has diverse revenue streams selling its products to corporations, governments, and education and healthcare organizations. CDW primarily serves customers headquartered in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, with roughly 88% of 2019 revenue generated in the U.S. But those customers have locations all over the world, so CDW is indirectly serving 150 countries across the globe.Traditional competitors include  ,  , and  . Relative to its peer group, CDW is multiples larger, growing faster, more profitable, and more attractively priced based on dividend yield and free cash flow yield.Data is current as of Feb. 19. Sales, net income, free cash flow (FCF), return on invested capital (ROIC), and FCF yield are all trailing 12-month totals. Sources: S&P Global and New Constructs.CDW is starting to offer more consulting services, so it does compete with Accenture and EPAM from time to time. But the big difference is that CDW is a value-added reseller that carries inventory on its balance sheet and has distribution centers to house that inventory and speed fulfillment. The other difference is that CDW mainly works with small and medium-size businesses so, for example, it would likely not be hired to do an enterprise resource planning implementation at a Fortune 500 company.While we're on the topic, CDW does hold inventory, but it also has drop-shipment arrangements with vendors and distributors so that it doesn't have to hold that portion of inventory at its warehouses. Roughly 50% of CDW's sales come from these drop-shipment arrangements.CDW was previously owned by private equity firms (through a leveraged buyout) so it has significantly more debt than I am typically comfortable with. By the company's own account, it has substantial indebtedness.\" It has $3.2 billion in net debt and $951 million in trailing FCF, according to the website\u00a0, so its net debt to FCF is about 3.4 times.I typically don't want to see the net debt/FCF ratio higher than 2, meaning that the company could pay off all its net debt with two years' worth of FCF. In CDW's case, it would take almost four years of FCF to pay off all its net debt. But since CDW's 2013 IPO, it has reduced its leverage ratios significantly, and according to , CDW has improved its interest coverage ratio (EBIT/interest expense) from 2 times in 2013 to 7 times at the end of 2019. The average maturity on its debt is over six years, and its weighted average cost of debt is only 4.3%.I'm also comfortable with CDW's financial leverage because it does not also have a fixed-cost business model with a lot of operating leverage. (It's when companies have both debt leverage and operating leverage that they are more likely to get into trouble.) Instead, CDW has a variable cost structure. That means if sales slow, the company can immediately respond by reducing compensation expense and working capital (working capital is the company's biggest capital investment, and if business slows it can easily cut investments in inventory). This ensures that there is enough operating income or cash flow to service the debt. Importantly, CDW is capable of generating even more cash flow than normal during a recession because it could dramatically reduce working capital.CDW has a target net-debt-to- ratio of 2.5 to 3. It's currently slightly below its target. I think the debt is used to support its capital allocation plan (see below) and to boost return on equity (ROE) to fantastically high levels. According to S&P Global, CDW's five-year average ROE is 55%, and its trailing ROE is 76%.Image source: CDW Corp.CDW is operating with lots of business momentum because of solid execution, its business model shift, and the digital revolution. From 2014-2019, this was CDW's five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in various metrics:FCF grew slower than net income during this time period because in 2014, the starting year for these calculations, FCF was so much higher than net income. Regardless, FCF still grew at almost double the rate of revenue.In 2019, CDW's sales grew 11%, GAAP-diluted EPS increased by 19%, and adjusted diluted EPS increased by 18%. Of the 11% top-line growth in 2019, roughly 1% came from acquisitions and a little less than 1% came from the devices-as-a-service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau. CDW is leasing smartphones and tablets to enable 500,000 field workers to take the census. This will also add about 1 percentage of incremental revenue growth in 2020, but the census project will end this year (so this is a significant but nonrecurring revenue stream).At the same time that CDW is generating stable and strong organic revenue growth, its ROIC is consistently rising. The combination of strong or rising organic revenue growth with strong or rising ROIC is investors' nirvana because it indicates that CDW is creating lots of business value.It's a growing business with a growth mindset. In fact, the company recently created a new role of chief growth and innovation officer to address that fact.Long-term growth should come from a conversion-to-digital tailwind and continued market share gains. Additional growth could come from acquisitions and continued international expansion. CDW has a growing presence in Canada and the U.K. and recently set up legal entities in the Netherlands and India. That's the first small step to setting up larger fulfillment operations in those countries over time. This is an exciting growth story, Fools.Its revenue growth is somewhat tied to customer headcount growth, but CDW has been able to generate slight operating margin improvements as it shifts to higher-margin services and from leveraging technology and automation internally. Below the operating margin line, CDW's net income also benefited largely from deleveraging (paying down debt reduces interest expense) and from corporate tax cuts. Almost 90% of its sales are generated in the U.S., so it benefited greatly from corporate tax reform.As a reseller, CDW is a low-margin business. Its gross margins are stable in the 16.5% to 17% range, and its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) margins are less than 5%. It has a long-term goal to generate free cash flow margins of about 4%.But, according to New Constructs, it was still able to generate a trailing 12-month ROIC of 17% and a return on tangible invested capital of 53%. CDW's return on tangible capital is so much higher than its ROIC (which is also high) because lots of goodwill was added to the balance sheet during the leveraged buyout. That return-on-tangible-capital figure shows the truly awesome profitability of the underlying operating business.Impressively, its ROIC has increased for the past five consecutive years, and we can use a  to see that the increase was driven by higher NOPAT margins and higher invested capital turns. Basically, the company is becoming more efficient at managing its working capital and other assets on its balance sheet. This means CDW is , or invested capital turns, and its improving margins are boosting returns as well. In my experience, it is somewhat rare to find a business whose ROIC is getting a boost from both higher returns  higher margins, and I think this is an indicator that the company has been firing on all cylinders.Image source: New Constructs. WACC = weighted average cost of capital.Image source: New Constructs.One of the benefits of operating under private equity ownership is you get very focused on aggressively managing working capital and cash conversion very quickly because those cash flows are needed to service the large debt load. Today, CDW's balance sheet is much healthier, but it is still operating under its tougher efficiency guidelines, especially with regards to monitoring the cash in and out of the business. It's just built into this company's corporate DNA now.Image source: CDW Corp.We've talked about revenue growth and ROIC, which are important because they ultimately drive free cash flow. CDW is a low-margin business, but its FCF is pretty strong because its average capital-expenditures-to-sales ratio is only 0.5% (that's really low) and because the company is very efficient at managing working capital and its cash conversion cycle. As I said earlier, CDW's FCF grew at a 5-year CAGR of 16%. CDW generated more FCF than net income in each of the past four years (2016-2019), and it has a long-term goal to generate an annual FCF margin in the 3.75% to 4.25% range.From 2018 to 2019, CDW's capital expenditures increased a whopping 174% (from $86 million to $236 million) as it dramatically ramped up spending for the contract with the Census Bureau. But this is a one-time project that will end in 2020. This means that CDW's capex will return to its normal level of about 0.5% of sales, and that the 2019 boost in capex will turn into depreciation (which is a non-cash expense that is added back on the cash flow statement). Expect that the company's FCF will remain strong and continue to grow at least in line with its organic revenue.CDW's moats include its long-term relationships with both vendors and customers, the scale and scope of products and services offered and distribution capabilities, and unique insights gained from being a key partner to both customers and IT vendors. The company sits in the middle of the tech supply chain offering attractive value propositions to both customers and vendor partners (OEMs, software companies, and the like). CDW says that it acts as both \"an extension of its customers' IT staffs\" and \"an extension of its partners' sales and marketing resources.\"What truly makes CDW unique is its multiple sources of interlocking competitive advantages. Of those, I'm most impressed by its scale and scope relative to its peers. Its size allows it to invest heavily in its sales force and engineering teams, own three distribution centers, and make sure that it gets its fair share of inventory from vendors when there are supply shortages. This means that CDW will have the inventory that its customers require.This is similar to the competitive advantage question, but it goes a step further. I won't recommend a company that isn't truly differentiated and doesn't have differentiation that shows up through superior corporate financial performance.CDW is unique because it has multiple sources to reinforce its moat. I especially like that it is the single largest player in an attractive industry and has a scale and scope that is multiples larger than its peers. This provides the company with negotiating leverage, innovative product offerings, multiple levers of profitable growth, and an attractive workplace for top tech talent.I also think it's unique because it provides an equal amount of value to both its vendor partners and its customers and is run by a CEO who is committed to taking a stakeholder approach to drive sustainable profitable growth. This second point is of grave importance and will contribute as much (or more) to long-term business value growth than anything else.It is CDW's  and stakeholder approach to growing the business sustainably over time that provides the company with its most enduring moat, while providing investors with a CDW's capital allocation priorities are (in order):CDW paid a $0.17 per share annual dividend in 2013, and the current annual dividend is $1.52 ($0.38 quarterly). That means it has increased the dividend nearly ninefold (or 794%) since its June 2013 IPO. It most recently increased the quarterly dividend by 29%. Its goal is to maintain a payout ratio of about 25% and to grow the dividend in line with earnings. If you like dividend growth stories, this company has one!Although its first priority is to increase the dividend, CDW actually spends more on annual share repurchases than it does on dividends. It has historically reduced the diluted share count by about 3% per year. Given that CDW is currently operating below its target leverage ratio, it intends to return more than 100% of FCF to investors in 2020 (as it did in 2019).Regarding acquisitions, CDW looks for product relevance and innovation, strategic and cultural fit, international expansion, and attractive financial returns. I like that CDW is not overly aggressive with acquisitions (it's only bought three companies in the last 10 years) and that this is not a roll-up story. Its ROIC has actually improved despite the acquisitions, which is a key indicator of success.Image source: Getty Images.I'm going to say no, for now, because it doesn't increase prices annually and doesn't have recurring revenue that we'd see from companies with long-term contracts or that sell use-once-and-dispose consumables, or that sell subscription services.CDW's contracts are not long term (with customers or vendors), but only 12 months in length. Its managed-services contracts are longer (and therefore recurring), but managed services are a small part of its business. Managed services provide basic infrastructure hosting for things such as database management, break/fix support and patching, and performance and capacity monitoring and reporting.Pricing at CDW is actually set by the account managers (sellers) because they have the closest relationship with the customer. The sales force is given a price minimum and a price range, and then picks the best price based on its knowledge of the customer and the competitive environment. Sellers are compensated based on a percentage of gross profit, and this model clearly works because of CDW's (already referenced) very stable gross margin profile. More than 50% of CDW's sales are generated from account managers who have been working at CDW for at least seven years. This long-tenured sales force helps to build those long-term, sticky customer relationships.It's also important to note that a great business generates high ROIC and has opportunities to reinvest at high returns to drive organic revenue growth and strong FCF over a long time. Pricing power and recurring revenue are two paths to high ROIC and consistent growth, but not the only paths. CDW generates high and increasing ROIC and has demonstrated a long record of above-market organic revenue growth.The lack of pricing power is more than made up for by its unique business model of providing a real value proposition to both its vendor partners and its customers. It also helps that CDW has a CEO with a stakeholder approach to sustainable profitable growth.Christine Leahy has been CEO since Jan. 1, 2019, and has worked at CDW since 2002. According to S&P Global, she owns $11 million worth of its stock, which is not bad for only holding the CEO position for about 15 months. In her first letter to shareholders, Leahy stressed CDW's :We will never take for granted our reputation with our customers, co-workers, partners, shareholders and communities where we employ, live and have impact -- a reputation that has been built over 35 years through relentless commitment, dedication, hard work, philanthropic contributions and complete integrity. I assure you that every single day during my time as the leader of your Company and as your fellow stakeholder, CDW will continue to never allow for complacency regarding our business performance or anything less than the full commitment to serving our customers and enhancing the value of our shareholders' investments and the lives of our stakeholders. The means will be as important and non-negotiable as the ends. This is my commitment to you.I admire several of the company's corporate governance policies, including having a clawback\u00a0policy, a separate CEO and chairman, majority voting, no executive perquisites, diversity on the executive committee (six of 13 execs are women) and board (four of 11 board members are women), and strict stock-ownership guidelines. Board members are required to own five times their annual cash retainer in stock, and the CEO is required to own six times her annual base salary in stock.I also love that the company's executive compensation plan is partly based on both market share gains (which drive organic revenue growth) and free cash flow (which is the driver of intrinsic value growth and what we are ultimately after as investors). Would I like to see CDW add an ROIC metric to its incentive compensation plan? Yes, of course, because ! But this is a management team that clearly understands the drivers of business value and the importance of return-based metrics, so I'm agreeable with this comp plan.I also applaud that the company is transitioning to an annual election of directors starting in 2021.CDW sells a wide assortment of computer equipment to consumers and businesses. Image source: Getty Images.This is an important question, so we need to spend some quality time discussing it. One thing I really love about this management team is its . In her first annual report to investors, Leahy mentioned the phrase \"profitable growth\" at least four times.Later in that same report, it becomes clear that Leahy and her management team understand the vital link between reinvestment, proper incentive compensation, and profitable growth, when she says: \"We have built a strong sales organization and deep services and solutions capabilities over time and expect to continue to invest to enhance these capabilities, which we believe when combined with our competitive advantages of scale and a performance driven culture, will help drive sustainable, profitable growth for us today and in the future. ... Our strong, execution-oriented culture is underpinned by our compensation system.\"Then on the , an analyst asked CDW management if the company is \"underearning a little bit because of the investments?\" CFO Collin Kebo's response (which I absolutely ) was:... in your question, are we underearning? I guess, the flip of that is, are we overinvesting? And I would say, no. We feel like we have the right balance between investment back into the business that allows us to continue to create differentiation in the marketplace that enables the sustainable outperformance versus the market. So could we pull back on investment in the short term? Yes. Absolutely. Would the margin float up? Yes. But I think that 200- to 300-basis-point premium that we've consistently been able to deliver [referring to the 2% to 3% in annual market share gains], over time, you would see that get chipped away. So we think we have the right balance between investing in the business and growth in margin.Earlier on the same call, Kebo said: \"... our fourth-quarter and full-year results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business that build on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth, and return cash to shareholders.\"On the earnings call, Leahy explained why the company created the new role of chief growth and innovation officer:We're really focused on scaling sustainable growth. So this is about focus for growth. And in particular, when we think about our customers, our partners and products and the channels and platforms that we use [and] sell, and the technology and digital capabilities that underpin those, the connective tissue between them is becoming more and more important. So this role is really intended to help align and focus our efforts and investments around driving the connectivity there. When you take a step back, CDW has historically delivered meaningful profitable growth. And we've done that through continual innovation and continual investment, disciplined investment, and focus on investing where the growth is. So when I think about growth and innovation and bringing that team together, it's just another natural step in the way that we think about growth in the future.As a long-term, business-minded, quality-growth investor, this is exactly the language I love to hear from a corporate management team that I'm thinking of partnering with.Competition for tech talent these days is intense. CDW has a workplace culture that's performance-driven (I already discussed the incentive programs for sellers and executives) and highly engaged. It runs an engagement survey of employees every two years and pulse surveys in off years. CDW has a 96% participation rate in the surveys, and actions to come out of them include expanding paternity leave, improving automation, and offering ongoing career training.Leahy has a 93% CEO approval rating on Glassdoor.com, and CDW is on Glassdoor's 2020 list of Best Places to Work. CDW scores a perfect 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, is ranked in the top 100 Best Places to Work in IT, according to Computerworld, and is ranked as a \"best place to work\" for military veterans and for women.The company is also on ' 2020 list of America's Best Employers for Diversity, and CDW has several groups to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace and has a \"be Green\" environmental initiative. The company would be well served to set stricter environmental goals and to share the progress against those goals by publishing annual sustainability reports.Possible near-term risks are that CDW is unable to get enough inventory because of supply constraints brought on by the novel coronavirus outbreak or that customers cut back on spending due to uncertainty in a U.S. presidential election year. These are wild cards to be aware of.Another risk is vendor concentration. Products from  and  account for 25% of CDW's overall sales. And products from its seven largest vendors account for 60% of sales.But a potentially larger long-term risk to the stock is if we experience a broader economic downturn in which customers may temporarily cut their IT spending. CDW's diversified revenue clientele may help mitigate what could be significant cuts (for example, government or education spending may remain healthy even though corporate spending is cut). It also helps that, as the world has digitized, technology has become more integral to organizations than it was during the Great Recession.On the other hand, a recession scenario could actually present an opportunity for CDW. A neat thing about its business model is that cash flow actually has the potential to be stronger during a recession because the company would significantly reduce working capital, which is its single largest capital expense. This strong FCF would allow the company to continue to increase the dividend, buy back discounted stock, and (hopefully) make acquisitions that allow it to come out of the recession even stronger.CDW held up fairly well during the global financial crisis with sales decreases of only 1% in 2008 and 11% in 2009. Then sales quickly rebounded 23% in 2010. An awesome showing, considering it was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But earnings did not hold up so well. The company reported losses in 2008 and 2009, largely because of impairment charges to write down some of the goodwill from going private. But those were noncash charges in 2008 and 2009, so cash flow from operations was still positive.CDW is a people business and thus has a variable-cost structure. This means if sales slow, the company can immediately respond by reducing compensation expense and working capital to make sure there is enough cash flow to service the debt, increase the dividend, and invest aggressively during the downturn. Today CDW is in a much more favorable financial position than it was during the last recession. It entered the last recession leveraged at 10 times EBITDA. In fact, CDW's management says that whenever the next recession occurs, it will be ready to make acquisitions on the cheap.The market downturn in late February has brought the stock price down more than 20% from its 52-week high of $146 a share. When evaluating whether a stock is a bargain, a lot of investors focus on the , so let's start there. CDW's forward P/E is currently hovering around 17, compared with a past average of about 15 since its 2013 IPO. The stock has clearly re-rated higher because:What precise P/E does it deserve? I don't know. But I'm very confident that an appropriate P/E is closer to 18, 19, or 20 (or even higher) than it is to 15. CDW has developed into a high-quality growing business with excellent management and exposure to long-duration tailwinds.According to market research firm IDC, global IT spending is projected to grow at a roughly 4% CAGR through 2023. But U.S. IT spending (CDW's largest market) has historically grown at an average of 5% per year, and CDW's core markets are projected to grow at 5% annually over the next four years. Let's assume long-term market growth of 5% and that CDW outgrows the market (i.e., takes market share) by 2% to 3% per year which is its goal. Based on that, long-term organic revenue growth would average around 7% to 8%.CDW outgrew the market by 2.9% annually from 2006 to 2019 and by a whopping 4.4% from 2009 to 2019. And from 2009 to 2019, CDW's revenue grew at a 9.7% CAGR. To be fair, 2009 was in the depth of the financial crisis, so that calculation is starting from a low base. But from 2009 to 2010, CDW's sales rebounded 23%. If I start the CAGR calculation in 2010, its sales still grew at an annualized rate of 8.3% from 2010 to 2019.In addition to the projected 7% to 8% top-line growth, it would be fair to factor in slight margin expansion as the company shifts to selling higher-margin software, services, and solutions and continues to reduce the diluted share count by about 3% per year. That suggests that EPS and/or FCF per share could grow about 10% to 11% per year. Add in the dividend yield of 1%, and investors can expect total annualized shareholder returns of about 11% to 12%, assuming that the P/E ratio does not change (to be conservative).Here's another way to think about it. According to New Constructs, CDW trades at a 4.7% FCF yield. That by itself is relatively attractive because it is more than four times higher than the 10-year U.S. Treasury note (a proxy for the risk-free rate), which yields an all-time record low of nearly 1% as of this writing.Add CDW's almost 5% FCF yield plus an expectation that the company can grow FCF per share by about 10%, and I calculate that CDW can provide investors with an expected annualized return of roughly 15%.When you combine these two methods, you can estimate that CDW will provide investors with expected annualized returns in the 11% to 15% range. Those should be market-crushing returns, Fools.I plan to buy a starter position as soon as The Motley Fool's trading restrictions allow.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For more details on this strategy, About John Neff: While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as \"relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative.\" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.About Validea: Validea is an  service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.10.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $125.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.73/share today.\n\nBecause the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.74% return on the cash commitment, or 10.34% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.50.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CDW stock at the current price level of $138.73/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $140.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.48% if the stock gets called away at the September 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDW shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CDW's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $140.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Once again, we delivered record quarterly results and both strong sales growth and profitability. In the fourth quarter, net sales were up 11.3% on both a reported and constant-currency basis to $4.5 billion.Gross profit increased 12.1% to $778 million, non-GAAP operating income increased 14.3% to $342 million, and non-GAAP net income per share was $1.57, increasing 18.4% on both a reported and constant-currency basis. For the year, net sales were $18 billion, up almost $1.8 billion year over year, or 11% on a reported basis and 11.5% in constant currency. Gross profit increased by 12.3% to $3 billion. Non-GAAP operating income increased 12.5% to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP net income per share increased 18% to $6.10.On a constant-currency basis, non-GAAP net income per share increased by 18.5%. Our excellent performance reflects the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services that address customer priorities across the IT landscape, and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. I'll walk you through each of these and how they contributed. First, the balance across our customer end markets.As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels: corporate, small business, government, education, and healthcare. Each of these channels is meaningful businesses, generating annual sales of more than $1.5 billion. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets, including the federal government, state and local government, K-12, and higher education.In addition, we have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together, delivered over $2 billion of net sales in 2019. These unique sales organizations serve us well when end markets behave differently from each other. Sometimes that occurs because markets are disrupted by macro or external challenges, sometimes it occurs when customer behaviors differ due to different priorities.In 2019, the teams did an outstanding job helping customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives, delivering exceptional results. I am really proud of our team's accomplishments. Our 2019 double-digit sales increase was driven by excellent results with strong underlying performance, as well as some incremental drivers. The U.S.and U.K. both increased by almost 11% in local currency. Our competitive advantages drove outsized growth in a market that played to our strength. Our scale, scope, and robust distribution capabilities helped minimize the impact of tariffs and supply constraints and helped us gain market share.Our device as a service solution to the U.S. Census Bureau also contributed to our excellent net sales growth. The success of the Census depends on everyone's participation, and that is what our mobile solution is enabling, confirming addresses in 2019, and this year, collecting Census data from households that do not respond otherwise. The Census project will be completed at the end of 2020.Collin will talk more about the expected impact of the Census on our financials. And lastly, the acquisition of Scalar. Recall, Scalar brought capabilities in security, cloud, infrastructure and digital transformation to our Canadian business, bolstering past solutions investments. Those investments also paid off last year, delivering double-digit organic gross profit growth.I'm excited to share that both Scalar and Aptris are now operating in the market as CDW. We are one company, one CDW, leveraging our integrated capabilities to deliver a seamless experience to customers. In short, 2019 was a terrific year. Turning to the fourth quarter.You also see the benefit of our diverse customer end markets. So let's take a deeper dive. In corporate, the team delivered 7% growth with balanced transactional and solutions growth, as they successfully addressed ongoing customer demand for client devices, while driving solid solution results, in particular, double-digit growth in servers and enterprise storage hardware. The small business team delivered nearly 8% growth, driven by client device strength.Both channels lapped double-digit growth rates. Customer activity and purchasing remain strong as corporate and small business customers continue to move ahead with technology investments, highlighting the importance of technology to achieve business goals. The government team increased sales by over 20%. Federal had another excellent quarter with sales up over 20% driven by very healthy client device performance as the team helped civilian departments move to Win 10.The state and the local team delivered high-teens growth, driven by double-digit solutions results. The team continued to leverage expanded contracts, helping customers secure their environment and modernize their infrastructure with strong growth in enterprise storage and server hardware. Education increased 1%, with low single-digit growth in higher ed and flat K-12 results. Higher ed continued to leverage our sector expertise and broad portfolio to help campuses enhance student and teacher experiences through client device upgrades and collaboration tools.For K-12, strengthened net comm hardware and desktops was offset by a decline in notebook due to Chromebook performance. The healthcare team delivered excellent performance, up almost 14%, with double-digit growth in client devices, as well as enterprise storage hardware and software. Healthcare demand continued to be driven by infrastructure refresh and a heightened focus on patient experience and clinical mobility. Other, which represents our U.K.and Canadian operations, increased 27% on a reported basis. The U.K. team delivered excellent double-digit growth in local currency. The team continued to help customers transform their infrastructures and gain efficiencies which drove double-digit solution growth.Canadian growth was driven by Scalar. Integration is nearing completion, and we are providing expanded portfolio options to both legacy customers in Canada and Scalar customers. So as you can see, our results demonstrate the power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Our results also demonstrate the power of our second driver of performance, the breadth of our portfolio with over 100,000 products, services, and solutions.For more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well-positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the IT spectrum. For the quarter, U.S. transactions increased low double digits, led by 16% growth in client devices. U.S.solutions increased mid-single digits. Sales performance was balanced with U.S. hardware and software increasing high single digits and services increasing 15%. Let's take a deeper look.Hardware increased 9%, fueled by double-digit growth in client devices and datacenter hardware. Client device growth was broad-based and driven by continued customer refresh and market gains. For datacenter hardware, we saw customers move forward with larger projects driving the strong growth. As we've discussed before, our solutions business can be lumpy with the variability, driven by the timing of when projects come to fruition and also the mix of hardware and software in the solution.Customers continue to be focused on optimizing their datacenter infrastructure with economical yet high-performing solutions. They are leveraging on-premise and off-premise solutions, as well as software-based technologies that create efficiencies. Total software grew 8%, with strong double-digit growth in storage management, operating system software, and network management. We continue to work closely with our customers to maximize the return on their IT investment, whether it be hardware, software or services, which leads me to our services category.Services' strong growth was led by configurations and professional services. Our services business had a tremendous 2019 with high-teens growth, reflecting our services-led go-to-market approach. Cloud also contributed to this quarter's results with double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit. Growth was driven by productivity, security, and collaboration, as well as public cloud infrastructure as a service.As you can see, we had an excellent, well-balanced performance in the quarter. And we were able to help our customers across a broad spectrum of IT needs. That leads me to the final driver of our performance, the impact of investments we are making in our three-part strategy for growth, investments made to ensure we continue to serve our customers' IT needs in this evolving market, whether in a physical, a virtual or cloud-based environment in the U.S. or internationally.Our three-part strategy for growth is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars work in tandem, each is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. These pillars help us stay in front of our customers' emerging and ongoing priorities. Let me share a couple of examples of our strategy in action.Last October, one of our customers, a medical technology company, with over 1 million patients, had a cyber attack. The attacker locked the company's on-premise datacenters and public cloud access and proliferated through its entire IT environment. A few months prior, members of CDW sales and technical teams had presented to the company on CDW's approach to information and network security. Historically, this customer had primarily purchased transactional products from us, but not fully leveraging our solutions and services capabilities.The company's IT director called CDW to utilize our expertise in this critical situation due to our team's presentation. CDW's security incident response team was engaged and immediately helped to assess in light of the attack. It was crucial to maintain patient safety and protect sensitive information. Ultimately, in the coming days and weeks, CDW helped to assess, contain and remediate the attack.Then we advised and installed security technology to ward off future attacks and rebuild customers' datacenter infrastructure to get the business' operations running again with enhanced security. CDW had a well-orchestrated response, providing deep technical knowledge and services in addition to our full suite of product capabilities. This is not a unique example. In today's environment, a cyber attack is a question of when not if.Security is a top priority for our customers. We have made investments in this capability from a coworker and vendor partner perspective to provide the right services and solutions to increase our customers' readiness and protection from future attacks. Another important IT priority that CDW is helping customers address is the upgrade of IT infrastructure to utilize the Internet of Things and data analytics. Customers are pursuing these investments to increase automation, improve safety and efficiency, manage quality control, and drive growth and higher profits.One of our manufacturing customers has positioned itself at the forefront of advanced manufacturing in recent years, by upgrading its IT infrastructure to enable the Internet of Things technology and enhancing automation throughout its plans. Several years ago, the customer began modernizing all 47 of its manufacturing plants in North America. At the start of the customer's modernization journey, the executive director of IT turned to CDW as its trusted strategic IT partner given our past track record, successfully completing turnkey projects. To take advantage of the data it wanted to collect, CDW developed and deployed solutions to upgrade the customer's centralized IT capabilities and infrastructure, as well as each plant's network infrastructure.In each plant, CDW designed and deployed, high-speed, state-of-the-art secured network with redundancy and plenty of bandwidth and scalability to serve as the foundation for the customers' advanced manufacturing push. On top of the secure and reliable high-speed network that CDW created, the customer deployed scales, sensors, and robots, modernizing its manufacturing and operating processes. The customer is now reaping the benefits of its upgraded IT capabilities, including automating tasks, which significantly reduce costs, making more informed business decisions at a quicker pace based on the new data. And lastly, improving security due to the protocols and protections put in place, supporting the customer's focus on safety.CDW is an integral partner for each step of this initiative, and we continue to work on other projects to support our customers' goals. These examples highlight CDW's three-part strategy for growth, including how well CDW is positioned for important IT trends and how IT is crucial to achieving our customers' objectives. CDW has a proven track record of evolving with IT trends. These examples also underscore the importance of one of CDW's competitive advantages, our coworkers.They get IT and make meeting and exceeding the needs of our customers their top priority. We continue to invest thoughtfully in customer-facing coworkers and ended the year up 223, excluding Scalar and Aptris. As our services business has grown, the composition of customer-facing coworkers has changed to a mix of demand generating coworkers and service delivery coworkers. Additionally, other factors, such as leveraging third parties for service delivery have made this metric less meaningful.Therefore, going forward, we plan to share stats on our customer-facing coworkers periodically rather than quarterly. Know that we will continue to invest prudently in coworkers. And as always, adjust our hiring plans based on market conditions. And that leads me to our expectations for 2020 financial performance.In 2020, we currently expect the U.S. IT market to grow between 2.5% to 3%, which is below 2019 U.S. IT market growth, reflecting a lower 2020 GDP growth forecast. We expect our top line to grow faster than the U.S.IT market, slightly above our 200 to 300 bps range in constant currency. The Census project is expected to partially offset moderating client device growth in 2020 which drives our expectations slightly above our target range. For 2020, we expect non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth of approximately 10% on a constant currency basis. We will, of course, continue to keep a watchful eye on the macro environment, including wildcards like supply constraints, the U.K.EU trade deal, tariffs, coronavirus, and the U.S. presidential election. In the meantime, the team will continue to do what they do best, out-execute the competition and leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives. I hope you can tell from my comments that 2019's outstanding performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place.We want to continue to evolve with the market, continue to capitalize on technology trends and continue to invest in fast-growing areas of the business. We do this by performing a rigorous, detailed strategic plan every three years and executing against it. We recently kicked off the planning process for our next cycle. Also, we recently made two important leadership announcements, Chris Corley named chief commercial and operating officer, and the addition of Sona Chawla in the newly formed role of chief growth and innovation officer.Chris is known for her strong sales and operating leadership, cultivating talent, delivering for our customers and delivering results. Sona joins CDW with a track record of success, shaping omnichannel sales operations, building e-commerce businesses, developing digital platforms and driving innovation. They will work with CDW's outstanding executive committee and teams across the organization to enhance our competitive advantages and to continue to drive differentiated performance, generating superior returns and serving our stakeholders. Now let me turn it over to Collin to share more details on the financial performance. -- Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Chris indicated, our fourth-quarter and full-year results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business that builds on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth and return cash to shareholders.Turning to our fourth-quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.5 billion, up 11.3% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. The currency was neutral in the quarter. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 6.1% versus the third quarter of 2019.As expected, the sequential average daily sales decline was greater than historical seasonality given the strength in the third quarter but better than expected, driven by, one, strong client device growth in four of five U.S. channels as we continue to leverage our competitive advantages to gain market share and help customers refresh their devices; and two, over 20% local currency year-over-year growth in the U.K. where we saw solutions projects come to fruition. Gross profit for the quarter was $778 million, an increase of 12.1%.Gross margin was 17.1%, up 10 basis points over last year driven by product margin, partially offset by netted down revenue streams not growing as fast as net sales. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9, our non-GAAP SG&A, including advertising, increased 10.4%. The increase was primarily driven by sales compensation, which moves in line with gross profit growth. Coworker count of 9,896 was up over 870 coworkers from December 2018, with roughly 50% of the increase from our 2019 acquisitions and the remaining from organic coworker investments.GAAP operating income was $284 million, up 16.8%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $342 million, an increase of 14.3%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.5%. Moving to Slide 10, interest expense was $38 million, up 3.2%.The increase was primarily due to paying a rate on the term loan in 2019 that exceeded the capped rate in 2018. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 21.4% in the quarter, down 150 basis points compared to last year. This resulted in fourth-quarter tax expense, $50 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation, which is shown on Slide 12.For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.7%, flat with last year's rate. Our full-year 2019 tax rate was favorably impacted by a benefit from research and development tax credits. As you can see on Slide 13, with fourth-quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $146 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.27, up 21%. Our non-GAAP net income was $229 million in the quarter, up 14.2% over last year.Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.57, up 18.4% from last year. Turning to full-year results on Slides 14 through 19. Revenue was $18 billion, an increase of 11% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant-currency basis, consolidated net sales were 11.5% higher than the prior year.As Chris mentioned, 2019 was a terrific year, reflecting great execution against the right strategy and our balanced portfolio. Additionally, 2019 net sales growth benefited from several extra drivers, one, the Scalar acquisition, which contributed just over 100 basis points; two, our device as a service solution for the U.S. Census, which contributed approximately 60 basis points; and three, a backlog flush in certain categories, such as net comm. You will recall that lead times extended in 2018 and then returned to more normal levels in 2019, creating a onetime positive flush.Collectively, these three items contributed approximately 250 basis points of net sales growth in 2019. While difficult to quantify, we believe our competitive advantages of scale and distribution centers helped us navigate chip shortages and gain additional share in client devices. Gross profit was $3 billion, up 12.3%. And gross profit margin was 16.9%, up approximately 20 basis points due to product margin and an increase in the mix of netted down revenue streams, partially offset by year-over-year net sales growth outpacing the year-over-year growth in partner funding.GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, up 14.8%. Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion for the year, up 12.5%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%. Net income was $737 million, and non-GAAP net income was $902 million, up 13.6%.Non-GAAP net income per share was $6.10, up 18%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20. On December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $154 million, and net debt was $3.2 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion.As shown on Slide 21, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during the quarter. Our three-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down one day from last year's fourth quarter. Full-year free cash flow was $789 million, which is 4.4% of net sales and slightly above the high end of our free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. The $37 million year-over-year increase in free cash flow primarily reflects higher cash profit, partially offset by higher inventory.2019 capital expenditures totaled $236 million or 1.3% of net sales. This higher level reflects CAPEX for the 2020 phase of the Census device as a service offering, which I'll discuss in more detail at a moment. As expected, we returned more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2019. We deployed $840 million of cash to shareholders, which included $183 million of dividends and $657 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $108 per share.Turning to capital allocation priorities on Slide 22. Our priorities remain the same from the previous quarter and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through returns of capital and strategic investments. In order of priority, first, increase dividends annually. To guide these increases, we will target the annualized fourth-quarter dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and grow in line with earnings going forward.Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 2.2 times, slightly below the low end of this range. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Our acquisitions of Scalar and Aptris are great examples of this.And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. At the end of December, we had $679 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Given the current leverage, we expect to once again return more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2020. Our capital allocation priorities support our 2020 targets which you'll see on Slide 23.Before I review our annual targets, let me first provide some comments on the device as a service solution for the United States Census Bureau. As you've heard us discuss, the rollout consists of two phases -- the address canvassing phase, which was completed in 2019 and contributed approximately 60 basis points to 2019 growth, the majority of which was recognized in the third quarter. In the 2020 phase or the Census collection phase, hundreds of thousands of smartphones and tablets are being deployed into the field to take the Census. We currently expect the 2020 phase to contribute approximately 110 basis points of incremental net sales growth in 2020.As a reminder, CDW is the lessor for the Census device as a service offering. Therefore, we will recognize lease revenue over the period that devices are used in the field. Depreciation from the Capex, most of which was spent in the fourth quarter of 2019, will be matched to the lease revenue. As Chris mentioned, the Census project will be completed at the end of this year.To summarize, the Census really showcases how CDW helps customers achieve their objectives by leveraging CDW's differentiated capabilities, integrated solutions from multiple vendor partners, professional and configuration services, logistics and distribution capabilities, all delivered as a service. Turning to our 2020 targets, we expect U.S. IT market growth of 2.5% to 3%. This modest deceleration, compared to 2019, reflects lower GDP forecasts, strong client device comparisons and moving past some end of support dates.We expect CDW net sales growth slightly above the high end of the 200 to 300 basis point range of our U.S. IT market growth. The incremental contribution from the Census helps us overlap 2019's strong outperformance, including some of the extra drivers I previously mentioned. Currency is expected to be neutral, assuming foreign exchange rates of $1.28 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar.We expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range and non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth to be approximately 10% on both a reported and constant-currency basis. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering financial targets on an annual constant-currency basis. Slide 24 provides additional modeling thoughts for full-year 2020. We expect net sales in the first half of the year to be in line with our historical norm of 48% to 49% of full-year net sales.Keep in mind that the normal rhythm of our business is for first-quarter net sales to typically be the lowest dollar amount and sequentially below our fourth quarter. Over the past five years, on an average daily sales basis, the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline has averaged down approximately 7%. We expect this year's first-quarter sequential decline to be generally in line with historical seasonality. Moving down the P&L, non-GAAP operating income margin is expected to be in the mid-7% range.Total annual depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $390 million to $400 million. This includes approximately $160 million of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and approximately $145 million of cost of goods sold depreciation. Depreciation and amortization expense and SG&A excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles is expected to be around $90 million. Equity-based compensation is expected to be several million dollars higher than in 2019.Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $156 million to $158 million, with the year-over-year decrease driven by expected lower short-term interest rates. Our 2020 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5%. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth, 200 to 300 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income growth. Currency is expected to be neutral for the full year to non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth.We expect constant-currency non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth in the first half of the year to be higher than our full-year constant-currency target as we have one additional selling day and more incremental contribution from the Census project. In the fourth quarter, we will have one fewer selling day, and the contribution from the Census winds down. One selling day difference impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 25.Our free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. We expect capital expenditures to be roughly 0.7% of net sales, slightly above the normal half a point of sales, primarily reflecting gross capital investments related to our downtown Chicago office move. To be clear, this slight increase does not change our free cash flow rule of thumb. We expect the cash tax rate to be in the range of 25.25% to 26.25% of pre-tax income, adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.We expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within the annual target range of high teens to low 20s. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Shannon to open it up for questions. [Operator instructions] Thank you.Operator[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.Your line is open. -- Thank you. Just starting off on the downtick in the wider IT spending environment that you talked about. Just wondering if you could touch on just what you're hearing in terms of customer budget plans heading into 2020 and what's driving your expectation for a return to a more normalized two to three points of share gain this year? -- Good morning, Matt. This is Chris. Customers have returned the corner in 2019. Customers were clear that IT continues to be a priority.So we saw some good momentum, and they're buying and in our business. They're continuing to hire, they're continuing to focus on investing in IT. So that felt good coming out of the year. The downtick is based on what we see in front of us.We've got GDP forecasts that have come down. We've got uncertainties out there. I tick through those wildcards in our prepared remarks. And so when we take a look at what's out there, that's how we think about it.We also, frankly, from an IT growth perspective, take a look at a wide variety of data, both internal data that are proprietary as well as external factors and try to land on a solid expectation for the upcoming year. In terms of our premium, you know us, we're always going to be focused on outgrowing the market by that 200 to 300 basis points. But we're confident this year in guiding slightly above that 300 because we feel good that the Census work that we're doing will contribute and will offset some of the client moderating growth that we expect to see. -- Got it. And then on that point about client growth monitoring, yes, PC is definitely top of mind, given crosscurrents around Win 7 and the CPU shortages. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you've baked into your current plans for PCs in 2020? And just how we should think about the cadence of that through the year? -- Well, as we anticipated last year, we expected client device to grow but at a moderated rate because we've got a couple of years of strong, strong growth from Refresh. The end of service that's already happened now in January and our expectation was that we see some growth in the first half of the year because based on past experience, when there's the end of service, you still get some flow through into the quarter or a little bit beyond. There are more wildcards out there. Right now, you look at coronavirus, for example, and it's too early to tell how that's going to impact.But that could impact the supply chain and add to some delays. We are still looking at Intel shortages. Of course, we leverage our competitive advantages to take inventory, but there are a couple more factors now that we weren't looking at 6 months ago, that makes it more difficult to understand where those client purchases will be taking place throughout the course of the year. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. -- Thanks a lot. Two questions from me as well. I guess, maybe to start with the 2020 guide, Chris. Could you just help clarify? You're basically saying it's IT spend at 2.5% to 3%, plus share gains of 200 to 300 basis points, and then plus $200 million of revenues from Census Bureau.Is that the right way to think about your 2020 guide? And then just on the Census Bureau contribution, is it going to be fairly linear through calendar '20 or is it going to be more H1 heavy, given the way that's going to ramp up? -- Yes, Amit. Let me back up and get that right. So we're looking at two components. 2.5% to 3% is what we expect the U.S.IT market rate of growth to be. And we're saying that our typical target of premium above that 200 to 300 basis points. You should expect us to come in slightly higher than that 300 basis points as a premium over. It is not a premium plus additional bps.Does that make sense? -- That makes perfect sense. -- OK. And in terms of the sequencing, I'll let Collin give you the details. -- Yes. Amit, we would expect more contribution from the Census in, let's say, the first half or first three quarters of the year. As I said in my prepared comments, we expect it to wind down by the time we get to the fourth quarter. -- Got it. And then, I guess, just calling as a follow-up, your net leverage target, at least based on the math we're doing, will be well under 2x by the end of the year. As you know, there are no deals done, you maintain the buyback dividends that we've talked about. If that's really the case, are you comfortable with leverage going under two times? Or should we start thinking about 2020 being a year where perhaps buybacks will be more larger to get you back in the 2.5 to 3 times target range? -- Yes, Amit. So we ended the year at 2.2 times. In my prepared comments, I did say that we again intend to return more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. Obviously, we're mindful that we're sub the 2.5 to 3 times target.Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. -- OK. Thanks and good morning. Chris, I just want to revisit the goal to expand the capabilities that you talked about on the slides. I think the leverage math would suggest that you have about $2 billion in liquidity to still stay within your leverage target, and probably even more if you want to temporarily sit above it as you have in the past.I know you've done some smaller tuck-ins, but just first question would be wondering if you would consider something more elephant-sized to borrow above the term? And what would be the key items you look for in that potential asset? -- Yeah, and thanks for the question. Elephant size, I don't know how big that means. But I would say this, look, you know that we are actively looking for potential companies that can supplement our solutions and services capabilities. And we're looking at different kinds of organizations, small tuck-ins, frankly, can be more simple to do and very easy to gain traction quickly.Larger organizations, we need to think about a lot of factors, including the ease of integration and the way that we can operationally bring onboard a large organization. Do you know the filters that we look at, is it a strategic fit for our customers? That's first and foremost. Is it going to create more relevance to our customers? We don't get that. Through that filter, we don't get even further than that.Operational alignment is the second one, and then obviously, cultural fit and financial return. I will tell you on cultural fit when I think about Kelway several years ago, and Scalar and Aptris, the cultural fit in those firms have been really terrific. And I think that's been a very large portion of why we've been successful. The teams have done a great job integrating and becoming CDW, one company, and going to market as a seamless team to our customers, who have really appreciated that and that actually speeds the ability to leverage our solutions capabilities across all of the organization.In terms of a larger company, if we find one that makes sense and ticks through all those levers, we absolutely would take a look. -- OK. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, Collin, thanks for all the model commentary. I just wanted to ask, you talked about Q1 revenue, expecting to be down about 7% sequentially per day.I think that's maybe a little over 5% sequentially, as reported. The question is, historically, EPS, it's a little bit imperfect, but I think generally, down somewhere around two times that revenue decline on a sequential basis. Correct me if I'm off here, but given your investment plans and timing, would this normal seasonality that you're talking about on revenue also apply to EPS in Q1, whereas reported would be down maybe just over 10% sequentially? -- Adam, I don't normally think of sequential EPS quarter to quarter. What I did say, though, in my prepared comments is that we do expect the first half of the year EPS to be stronger than the full year. Some of that is due to Census timing and some of that is due to the extra day we have in the first quarter. -- OK. That's helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.Your line is open. -- Hi, and thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter and on the guide. Collin, the guide for full-year operating margin at mid-sevens. I mean, that's actually pretty strong.I mean, your margins have been better than many of your competitors. Just wondering, I mean, we assumed you're going to see a mixed shift between client devices versus more of cloud solutions and netted down items. So can you talk about what are some of the things that can drive that a little bit higher than mid-7s? What do you need to see to get the operating margin a little bit higher? -- Thanks for the question, Ruplu. Yes. There are a lot of things that impact our operating margins, starting at the gross margin. There's the mix of items that we sell, which you're referencing, there are commoditization headwinds, end market mix.So there are a whole series of mixes that move in and out. As we mix into solutions, that does put upward pressure on our gross margin, but we do have a higher cost to serve associated with solutions. So the flow-through to the operating margin might not be as great or I think the operating margin might be closer in line to the transactional side of the business. I think the big wild card here is how strong hardware is as we go forward.This narrative that our margins are going to float up over time has been out there for several years. I think a lot of that, we've had an assumption that hardware growth was going to slow down and not be as robust. And clearly, we've been through a pretty heavy cycle here of three years, where that hasn't been the case. And you haven't seen as much upward movement on the operating margin, as you might expect, notwithstanding all the success we've had in cloud and solutions and netted down items.So I think if we were to go through an extended period of time, multiple quarters or years where we saw that play out, I think we would revisit at that point in time. At our Analyst Day a few years ago, we took our margin target up a little bit as a result of that trend. But again, I think we'd want to see more sustainability of the strength of the netted down items, relative to where hardware is. -- Yes. That makes sense. For my follow-up, I just wanted to touch on the education end market. You've seen some strong growth in the higher ed segment, but maybe a little bit slower on the K-12.So any thoughts on how that segment trends in 2020? -- Yes. It's Chris. On education, we're just under a little pressure right now. We've seen ASPs declining a bit.Also, the Chromebook space has been the one that has been most constrained when it came to supplying opportunities and supply availability this past year. And availability simply if it was out there, we could get it. So we do expect to continue to see into 2020 those same pressures on the business. The other thing that's happened is Google's extension of its auto-update expiration, which is simply the equivalent of an end of service, they've extended it a year.So that alleviated what I'll call the urgency of customers to refresh and upgrade. But that will be an opportunity when the year expires next year. But look, K-12, we still consider being a growth area for us. And the teams are really focused on specific solutions that they can bundle and bring to those customers that have to do with things like modern classrooms that are more collaborative and learning environments that are modular, etc.So we feel good about K-12 in the long term. -- OK. Thanks for all the details.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Yes. Thank you and good morning. A question regarding the strength that you saw in the U.K. I think you said that was up 20% year on year.Is that related at all to the Brexit transition? And post that close, are you seeing any impact either positively or negatively? -- Matt, yes. Thanks for the question. The answer is no. We haven't seen a lot of change over the last couple of years in client behavior as a result of Brexit and the uncertainty surrounding that.We've tried to comment on that regularly with you. I think that's just great execution and performance by the team and a number of solution projects coming to fruition. We also have as you recall, a Netherlands entity, and so customers are comfortable using that in their regular course of business. When I look at the U.K.business, the nice thing is the balance that we've seen in growth, in both their U.K. local business as well as the referral business, meaning U.S. to U.K. business.And also collectively, U.K. and U.S. customers doing business outside of those regions, so call it widely international. All of that is on a good growth trajectory, and we're really excited to see that because that reflects the power of the thesis going into the combination, and it's working. -- OK. Then relative to the expectations on hardware, we certainly get the headwinds that you're going to see in terms of the PC Refresh cycle. But looking at the solution side of the enterprise-class hardware, networking storage, servers, you had some strength. You talked about networking for some of those reasons.But what should we be expecting there in terms of your outlook for the enterprise-class products? -- Yes. I think of it this way. As I said, customers are still prioritizing IT investments. And they have different priorities, sometimes it's client, sometimes it's the datacenter, depending on where they're focused in their business and what they're trying to accomplish.Looking forward, we expect to see the benefit of that investment. And the key thing is that when it comes to these solutions, projects, they are lumpy. And I keep saying we're going to find another word, but that really is the best word. I mean, if you think about 2019, we had some lumpiness throughout the quarters and we just saw a number of deals come to fruition, and you saw a nice, healthy Q4.You got to expect that going forward just because of the timing and also the mix, which is a big part of that. Whether it's hardware, software, services, the more software component, the more muted the top line. So again, customers are focused on using technology to drive strategic outcomes in their business, and they're focused on securely running their \"utility IT\", and we've got the full portfolio to help them do that. -- OK. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much for taking my question. I just have one. Chris, can you talk a bit about what drove you to put a chief growth and innovation officer in place? How you're sort of thinking about that position? So work with others within your executive team at this point? I'm just kind of curious as to what created that role. -- Yes. No. Sure. Thanks very much for the question.Well, I'll start with a simple reason. When we think about forward-looking, we're really focused on scaling sustainable growth. So this is about focus for growth. And in particular, when we think about our customers, our partners and products and the channels and platforms that we use to sell, and the technology and digital capabilities that underpin those, the connective tissue between them is becoming more and more important.So this rule is really intended to help align and focus our efforts and investments around driving the connectivity there. When you take a step back, CDW has historically delivered meaningful profitable growth, and we've done that through continual innovation and continual investment, disciplined investment and focus on investing where the growth is. So when I think about growth and innovation and bringing that team together, it's just another natural step in the way that we think about growth in the future. -- OK. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good morning. Just thinking through seasonality for the year. In the first half, you have the bulk of the benefit of Census, the spillover of some of the Win 10 refreshes and the extra selling day.So just what are the offsets to those tailwinds that land you at more normal seasonality in the first quarter and first half versus maybe a little bit better seasonality given those factors? -- Can you repeat the question, Katy? -- Yes. Just thinking through some of the tailwinds in the first half and the first quarter. You have the bulk of the Census impact in the first half of the year, and hopefully get some spillover effect of PC refreshes, at least in the first quarter and then you have the extra selling day. So I'm just curious why you wouldn't see maybe a little bit better than normal seasonality in 1Q and the first half because of those factors.Are there some offsets that you're thinking through? -- No. I would say no real offsets. We do have some pretty meaningful overlaps in the back half of the prior year. So I think that's also informing us. -- OK. And then just as a follow-up, have you gone back and looked at just spending trends and customer behavior around elections in terms of any expectation around how that might impact spending this year? -- Yes, Katy. This is Chris. If you go back to the 2012 and 2016 elections, what we did see is, we did see a deceleration in IT spend, IT growth. So that's why we call out, as a wildcard, the U.S.election this year, because the uncertainty leading into it could cause some deceleration. That came in those two years in the back half of the year. -- OK. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JP\u00a0Morgan. Your line is open. -- Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, you've been pretty specific about the three-part investment strategy and investing in the future generically. But where do we see this in terms of the dollar spend? Is it in CAPEX? Is it in the operating expenses? What kinds of people are you recruiting? How are you reallocating resources to capitalize on these opportunities internally? And could you even argue that you're underearning a little bit because of the investments? That OPEX is a bit higher than it might be otherwise? -- Yes. Thanks for the question. I think you see it up and down in various line items in the P&L. So for example, we're investing in people, investing in technologists, solution architects, delivery engineers.We're also investing in technology and digital capabilities to enable our sales organization and to enable our coworkers to deliver to our customers, to create an experience for our customer that becomes more seamless and useful to the sales process. So we're investing in a number of different areas as we always do at CDW. In terms of the impact on our profitability, look, I don't think you'd see anything different. But outperforming the market allows us to deliver on our commitments to shareholders, but also reinvest in the business, and that's very important for the future growth of the organization.When I think about scaling for sustainable growth, it's not just about performing for today, but it's also about laying the foundation for growth against our growth model in the future, and that's where we're investing today and tomorrow. -- Paul, I would just add. The investment is both in the OPEX and the CAPEX line. The majority of our normal CAPEX goes against our IT infrastructure. And then in your question, are we underearning? I guess, the flip of that is, are we overinvesting? And I would say, no.We feel like we have the right balance between investment back into the business that allows us to continue to create differentiation in the marketplace that enables the sustainable outperformance versus the market. So could we pull back on investment in the short term? Yes. Absolutely. Would the margin float up? Yes.But I think that 200 to 300-basis-point premium that we've consistently been able to deliver, over time, you would see that they'll get chipped away. So we think we have the right balance between investing in the business and growth in margin. -- Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. -- Good morning, everybody. Can you help me understand back last year and the past few years spending in the Win 10 refresh cycle? Was that generally done within companies or the customers' general budgets or were they special, I guess, onetime expenditures that either won't repeat? Or do you expect to be reprioritized going forward? -- Yes, Keith. My sense having talked with customers and feedback from our sales organization is we didn't hear a lot of chatter about onetime increases in budgets to refresh client. It's really the natural process of their IT investment cycles. -- Yes, Keith. Again, just as we think about how we manage our own business. Our CIO sure didn't get incremental budget to get us upgraded to Win 10. I think part of what a customer goes through every year is determining what their priorities are and addressing those priorities within the context of their budget. -- All right. That's helpful. And then changing gears, I guess, slightly, as my follow-up. I can respect, it's completely early with the coronavirus.But can you help us understand, like, in terms of the supply chain and inventory in the channel, how long could the coronavirus go on or how bad does that get before it actually impacts anybody? Is there enough inventory in the channel that can withstand quarantine for some factories for several weeks? -- Yes. No. I wish I had an answer to that, Keith. I just don't.It's too early in the process right now. And what I can say is we're working very closely with our OEMs right now to get a better understanding, but we don't have visibility to that. I think our vendors are still trying to figure that out. And it's always going to depend on how long it lasts, what alternatives they have, but we'll just do the best that we can to ensure that we take care of our customers and if the extensive inventory is available, we'll leverage competitive advantages and take that.It's just hard to know at this point in time. I don't want to project out into the future. -- OK. I appreciate that. Thank you.Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks. -- Thank you, Shannon. I'd like to recognize the hard work of our almost 10,000 coworkers around the globe and their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. They are the reason we had such exceptional performance in 2019 and why we will continue to outperform the IT market going forward. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals.And thank you for your time today and continued interest in CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The Nasdaq has also been stalling out right near the old highs from last July.Over in Europe the Stoxx 600 has failed to push up above 392.5 five different times in the past fifteen months, three in the past three months alone. Yet another failure here likely means dropping down to test the 200-day moving average.Manufacturing continues to weaken across the globe while the Services Sector is holding up better, but both have been weaker than expected.Earlier this morning\u00a0\u00a0at 49.4\u00a0(contraction\u00a0is below 50) versus the previous 50.9 and expectations for 50.9. The\u00a0\u00a0from 49.1 to 52.5 versus expectations for a decline to 45.3 - a mixed bag here, but as a proxy for China\u2019s economy, it is not falling off a cliff.This morning we also saw data from Europe with\u00a0\u00a0growing 0.8% year-over-year in July compared to 0.9% in June,\u00a0\u00a0for just a 0.5% improvement. This is still well below the 1.98% average the nation has experienced from 2003 through 2019, but with the dour picture of Industrials in the Eurozone, we\u2019ll take what we can get.By contrast,\u00a0, dropping to 41.1 in September from 43.5 in August, far below expectations for a slight increase to 44 as this nation has been dealt severe blows from the ongoing trade wars. The country\u2019s\u00a0, falling to 52.5 from 54.8, below expectations for 54.3 - the Eurozone\u2019s largest economy just may be in a recession.\u00a0\u00a0with Services down to 51.6 from 53.4, below expectations for 53.2 and Manufacturing dropped to 50.3 from 51.1 and again below expectations for 51.2.\u00a0\u00a0for an increase to 47.3, instead it dropped to 45.6 from 47.\u00a0\u00a0falling to 52.0 from 53.5 versus expectations for a smaller decline to 53.3.Later this morning\u00a0, and investors will be comparing the results vs. the August PMI data to determine if business activity slowed further in September.\u00a0Today at 8:30 am the\u00a0, which is a weighted average of 85 existing monthly indicators of national activity, will be released, having dropped to\u00a0-0.36\u00a0in July from +0.03 in June and is expected to weaken a bit further to\u00a0-0.35.\u00a0A positive index reading indicates growth above trend while a negative index reading indicates growth below trend.

As we saw with last week\u2019s results from FedEx\u00a0(),\u00a0these reports and corresponding conference calls are likely to be insightful in terms of assessing the impact of the US-China trade war, the speed of the economy, the spending health of the consumer and dollar headwinds faced by multinational companies in the upcoming earnings season that will kick off in just a few weeks.\u00a0Before the market open, we\u2019ll hear from healthcare company\u00a0\u00a0that is expected to deliver EPS of \u00a0$0.61 per share, and China-based used car e-commerce company\u00a0,\u00a0whose consensus forecast is looking for a loss of $0.82 per share.\u00a0After today\u2019s market close, womens\u2019\u00a0focused specialty retailer\u00a0\u00a0will report its quarterly results. There are no consensus expectations for the quarter, but investors will want to utilize Ascena\u2019s top-line results as a barometer of retail spending on clothing, comparing it to the data contained in the August Retail Sales report. Investors will also want to take stock of Ascena\u2019s comments on the trade war as it shares it\u2019s\u00a0outlook for the coming quarter.\u00a0Over the weekend,\u00a0\u00a0and with lines reported outside major stores around the world, odds are Apple will likely report the new model has sold out. We continue to think the next major upgrade cycle for the iPhone will happen in sync with 5G mobile network services going mainstream.\u00a0Tough news for those on tour this week as the world\u2019s oldest\u00a0\u00a0after talks over the weekend with lenders, shareholders and the UK government failed to produce a rescue package. As if the UK needed more challenges, the collapse of the 178-year-old travel company leaves 21,000 employees looking for new jobs, 150,000 UK tourists and 350,000 foreign nationals stranded abroad,\u00a0While the US and China are battling it out across conference tables and social media, the\u00a0\u00a0is planning its biggest annual investment in China in history, expecting to invest over $1.4 billion in the next year to combat slowing sales growth amid rising competition.With just six trading days until we close the September quarter, investors will be on watch for any earnings pre-announcements, positive or negative, to be had as company\u2019s begin to roll up their books for the quarter. Other items to watch this week include:As we get ready to sunset the quarter, we are approaching quarterly index rebalancing.

The decision was made after trade officials from the two countries conducted low-level talks ahead of the next round of negotiations planned for October. However, renewed pessimism over U.S.-China trade relations returned following a decision by the Chinese trade delegation to cancel visits to farms in Montana and Nebraska, potentially signaling a lack of progress on trade negotiations. That pessimism was also stoked by comments from President Trump that he is\u00a0\u201c\u2026not\u00a0looking for a partial deal; I\u2019m looking for a complete deal,\u201d and that in his view there is no need to work out a trade deal with China before the 2020 election because the American economy is\u00a0\u201cso\u00a0strong.\u201d President Donald Trump announced further sanctions on Iran.That Friday slump led all the major stock market indices to finish the week in the red, with the hardest hit being the small-cap Russell 2000\u00a0which lost\u00a01.2%. Meanwhile, as geopolitical tensions ratcheted back up, gold futures closed the week out with a gain. Quarter to date, the Russell is the only major stock market index in the red albeit modestly, but none of the other three major market indices finished last week up more than 1.7% on a quarter to date basis.\u00a0And whether you liked the last season or not,\u00a0\u201cGame\u00a0of Thrones\u201d took home the 2019 Emmy award for Outstanding Drama last night as well as 9 other Emmy wins.\u201cSuccess is a lousy teacher.

With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris. -- Thanks, Brittany. Third-quarter results were excellent, with both strong sales growth and profitability. Consolidated net sales were $4.9 billion, up 12.2% on a reported basis. With one additional selling day in the quarter, average daily sales increased 10.5% and 10.9% in constant currency.Gross profit increased 14.4% to $816 million. Non-GAAP operating income increased 13.9% to $380 million, and non-GAAP net income per share increased 19.8% to $1.70 per share. On a constant-currency basis, non-GAAP net income per share increased 20.4%. These excellent results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of offerings that address customer priorities across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth.First, the balance across our customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channel: Corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education. Each of these channels are meaningful businesses generating annual sales of more than $1 billion.This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets, including federal government, state and local governments, K-12 and higher education. In addition, we have our Canadian and U.K. operations, which together delivered over $2 billion of net sales the last 12 months. These unique sales organizations serve us well when end markets behave differently from each other, sometimes that occurs because markets are disrupted by macro or external challenges, sometimes it occurs when consumer behavior differs due to different priorities.This quarter, our double-digit sales increase was driven by excellent results across the U.S. business, with four of our five U.S. channels growing double digits and solid local our performance from our international teams. U.S.customers remained focused on client devices to meet growing needs from full employment as well as refresh driven by older equipment, new use cases and new security features. At the same time, customers continued to modernize their IT infrastructure and adapt more flexible architectures. The teams did an outstanding job helping customers address these priorities. In corporate, the team delivered 10% growth as they successfully addressed ongoing customer demand for client devices, while driving solid solutions growth.The small business team delivered nearly 12% growth for the quarter driven by hardware strength, in particular client devices. Our corporate and small business customers continue to move ahead with technology decisions despite macroeconomic uncertainty, highlighting the importance of technology to achieve business goals. Customer activity and purchasing behavior remained strong in the quarter. The government team drove a 22% increase in sales.Federal had another excellent quarter of sales more than up 35%. The team delivered strong transaction and solutions result from both civilian and defense departments as we continue to benefit from investments we made to become a strategic technology partner to the federal government. In addition, in the quarter, the U.S. Census Bureau Device as a Service project contributed more to growth than previously expected.Changes to the final rollout schedule for 2019 resulted in more revenue recognized in the third quarter than other quarters this year. As we've discussed previously, we created a mobile technology solution that supports field data collection for the 2020 Census, that combine our services and logistics capabilities with our broad product portfolio and deep partner relationship. Census is a great example of the power of the breadth of our offerings and our technical capabilities. The State & Local team delivered flat performance as we lapped last year's mid-teens growth, which was driven by timing of new and existing contracts in the third quarter of 2018.The team continued to expand existing contracts and win new contracts, and helped customers modernize their infrastructure and secure their environment. Education's flat performance reflected a double-digit growth in Higher Ed and a slight decline in K-12. We continued to gain market share on Higher Ed, leveraging our team's expertise and our broad portfolio to help campuses utilize technology to upgrade and enhance student and teacher experiences. K-12 couldn't fully overcome last year's nearly 20% growth driven by strong Chromebook results.Difficult compares aside, K-12 customer purchasing priorities otherwise remained consistent, focused on refresh and classroom transformation. The healthcare team delivered excellent performance, up 11% driven by double-digit growth in client devices and NetComm hardware. healthcare demand continued to be driven by security needs, infrastructure refresh and a heightened focus on patient experience. Other, which represents our Canadian and U.K.operations, increased nearly 11% on a reported basis. In local currency, Canadian growth was driven by both organic and Scalar performance. Integration is on track, and we're providing expanded portfolio options to both existing CDW Canada and Scalar customers. The U.K.team delivered mid-single-digit growth in constant currency, successfully overlapping more than 20% growth for each of the last two years. The team continued to help customers transform their infrastructures, gain efficiencies and improve interoperability of their systems. As we have previously shared, our recently established presence in The Netherlands supports our broader growth opportunities in the EU and, as needed, serves as a Brexit contingency plan. Clearly, third-quarter results demonstrate the power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets.Third-quarter results also demonstrate the power of our second driver of performance, the breadth of our offering, with over 100,000 products, services and solutions for more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. U.S. transactions increased mid-teens led by over 20% growth in client devices. U.S.solutions increased mid-single digits and was the main driver of our gross margin improvement. Sales performance was strong and balanced with U.S. hardware, software and services all increasing double digits. Let's take a deeper look.Hardware increased 10% fueled by client device growth. Client device growth was broad-based and driven by continued customer refresh, market share gains and the deployment of our Device as a Service solution to the Census Bureau. Four of our five U.S. channels delivered double-digit client device growth.During the quarter we continued to leverage our competitive advantages and experienced minimal impact from tariffs and supply constraints. As we have discussed before, customers continue to focus on optimizing and modernizing their IT environment, however, infrastructure projects can be lumpy. The variability is driven by the timing of when projects come to fruition and also the mix of hardware and software in the solution. This quarter, data center hardware, including enterprise storage and servers and NetComm hardware, declined single digits on a consolidated basis, with the results mixed across channels.Once again, hyper-converged infrastructure and all-flash storage put us at meaningful double-digit growth as customers continue to seek improved economics and enhanced performance. Customers also sought to enhance the performance of their data centers and networks by investing in software. Success helping customers adopt new architectures, refresh infrastructure and secure their environments drove strong growth in storage management, security, operating system software and network management, driving total software growth of 12%. As you know, software is becoming a larger component of IT solutions, we're working closely with our customers to maximize the return on their IT investment, whether it be hardware, software or services.Which leads me to our services strategy. Services' 16% increase was led by warranties, professional services and configuration. Cloud also contributed to this quarter's results with healthy double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit. Growth was driven by productivity, collaboration, security and mobility workloads.As you can see, we had excellent well-balanced performance in the quarter and were able to have our customers across a broad spectrum of IT needs part. That leads me to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making the three-part strategy for growth. Investments made to ensure we continue to serve our customers' IT needs in this evolving market whether in a physical, virtual or cloud-based environment in the U.S. or internationally.Importantly, our three-part growth strategy includes acquiring new customers and capture share, enhancing our solutions capabilities and expanding our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars work in tandem, each is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Our recent investment in Aptris is an example of our strategy in action. We acquired Aptris, a premier IT service management solutions provider and ServiceNow elite partner on October 1.As you know, IT service management and digital workflow platforms are rapidly becoming a cornerstone of IT and driving digital transformation across organizations. IT service management implementations and integrations are typically very complex, Aptris is a leader in IT service management solutions helping customers simplify the end-to-end process. Aptris' talent and expertise further expanded our capabilities in this fast growing segment of the IT market and enhanced the value we can deliver to our customers. Aptris has been a partner of CDW since 2017.We knew from our partnership that Aptris is also focused on exceeding customer expectations and that the two organizations are culturally aligned. Let me share an example of how CDW and Aptris partnered to solve a customers' business problem. A long time CDW customer wanted to migrate to ServiceNow to improve service levels from legacy systems that lacked full capabilities. The joint CDW and Aptris team started with discovery to understand the customer's pain points and goals to develop the right solution.With Aptris' deep team of technical talent and proprietary ServiceNow implementation processes, the team was able to develop precise plans for the migration and module rollout. Given the complexity of ServiceNow implementations, this expertise was critical to gaining credibility with the customer and successfully designing, integrating and delivering the solution. Aptris presents an exciting growth opportunity for our business, our customers, our partners and our coworkers. It brings the right talent and strategic capabilities we want to deliver to our customers.We welcome Aptris' nearly 100 coworkers to the CDW family. We remain focused on utilizing M&A as part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDW's strategic capabilities and we continue to explore M&A opportunities as part of our three-part strategy for growth. We also continue to invest organically in our three-part strategy for growth. Organic investments in our strategy include the addition of new coworkers, new partners, enhancing internal system and developing new capabilities.The next example I'll share highlights how the three pillars of our strategy work in tandem as well as the importance of consistently executing and delivering for our customers as their trusted IT and business partner. A retail customer needed help modernizing one of its distribution centers. The customer wanted a partner who could assess, design, configure, deploy and implement different technologies from many vendor partners in a very tight window. Our ability to pull technical resources together from several different solutions practice areas enabled us to win the business and then execute the initial engagement at the highest standards.Note I said initial engagement because the team demonstrated CDW's competitive advantages and helped the customer to achieve its objectives, we earned a much larger opportunity to help the company open over 100 new stores and refresh another 400 stores annually, increasing the customer's annual spend with CDW by over 30%. For new stores, we developed an IT Store-in-a-Box, consisting of over 100 SKUs from over 20 different vendors to deliver the store's point of sale and credit card systems, customer interface tools, wireless access points and more. Our logistical excellence in large-scale project management, technical know-how and services delivered unique value to the customer. We have further partnered with the same customer to develop its store of the future and are helping the customer execute on its digital transformation strategy.This is a great example of our exceptional coworkers solving business challenges by leveraging CDW's deep solutions expertise and service capabilities to provide a unique offering and capture market share. That's how our three pillars work in tandem. Both of these examples highlight the importance of one of CDW's competitive advantages: our coworkers. They get it and make meeting the needs of our customers their first priority.We continue to prudently invest in customer-facing coworkers and ended the quarter up 275 from year-end, excluding Scalar. Additions are primarily due to an increase in service delivery coworkers to support the strong solutions and services growth seen year-to-date as well as technical coworkers and sellers. Fall timing of our account manager class has increased third-quarter count, with normal attrition we now expect to end the year with new customer-facing coworkers in the mid-200, excluding Scalar and Aptris. As we always do, we will monitor the market and adjust as appropriate.And that leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. Given year-to-date market performance, our current view of 2019 U.S. IT market growth remains in line with the expectations we have shared previously of full-year growth of roughly 3%. Reflecting year-to-date share gains and expectations for the fourth quarter, we now target constant currency organic growth between 625 and 675 basis points above the market, roughly 200 basis points above our prior view.We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an incremental 100 basis points of growth for the year. Aptris is not expected to have a material impact on 2019 net sales. For full-year 2019, we expect to deliver constant currency earnings-per-share growth in the mid-teens, meaningfully above prior-quarter guidance. We continue to expect ongoing but moderating strengthen in client devices and solid growth in solutions as we overlap last year's fourth quarter double-digit growth.We will keep a watchful eye all of this, including the wildcards we have spoken about this year, like Brexit, tariffs and supply chain constraints. In the meantime, the team will continue to do what they do best, out-execute the competition and leverage our competitive advantages to help our customer address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives. I hope you can from tell my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place. A strategy that leverages our competitive advantages and flexible business models to deliver both excellent profitability and strong cash flow.This confidence has led our board to approve a 28.8% increase in our annual cash dividend, which puts us on track to achieve our capital allocation priority of delivering a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow by year-end. I know many of you are may be wondering what we expect for 2020. We are in the middle of our planning process and Collin and I will provide the 2020 outlook on our year-end results conference call. Now let me turn it over to Collin to share more details on the financial performance. -- Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Chris indicated, our third-quarter results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business that build on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth and return cash to shareholders.Turning to our third-quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.9 billion, up 12.2% on a reported basis and 10.5% on an average daily sales basis as we had one additional selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.9%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 6% versus Q2 of 2019, which was approximately 300 basis points better than historical seasonality and better-than-expected driven by: one, client device growth, particularly in corporate, small business and government as we leveraged our competitive advantages to gain market share and help customers refresh their devices; and two, successfully delivering Device-as-a-Service to the United States Census Bureau for the 2019 canvassing phase of the project.The majority of the devices were rolled out and the majority of the 2019 revenue was recognized during the third quarter. Gross profit for the quarter was $816 million, an increase of 14.4%, reflecting the benefit of an extra day in the quarter. Gross margin expanded 30 basis points driven by an increase in the mix of netted-down revenues, such as Software-as-a-Service and warranties. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9.Our non-GAAP SG&A, including advertising, increased 14.9%. The increase was primarily driven by sales compensation, which moves in line with gross profit growth, incremental Scalar expenses, performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals and investments in the business consistent with our bold forward strategy, including coworker count. Coworker count of 9,843 was up over 900 coworkers from September of 2018 with nearly 400 of the year-over-year increase from Scalar and the remaining from organic coworker investments. Roughly two-thirds of the 900-plus coworkers added year-over-year were in customer-facing roles.Non-GAAP operating income was $380 million, an increase of 13.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.8%. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $42 million, up 15.6%.This was primarily driven by a higher effective interest rate on the term loan in 2019 than 2018 when we had one and a half percent caps in place. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 22.7% in the quarter, down 20 basis points compared to last year. This resulted in Q3 tax expense of $59 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation, which is shown on Slide 12.For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.8%, down 110 basis points compared to last year's 26.9% rate primarily due to guidance issued by the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2018 on foreign taxes creditable against Global Intangible Low-taxed Income. As you can see on Slide 13, with third quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 147 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.37, up 14.6%. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects operating performance, was $250 million in the quarter, up 14.8% over last year. Recall that one additional selling day positively impacts third-quarter profit growth by approximately 200 basis points.Not GAAP net income per share was $1.70, up 19.8% from last year. Currency headwinds dampened non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth by approximately 60 basis points in the third quarter. Turning to year-to-date results on Slides 14 through 19. Revenue was $13.5 billion, an increase of 10.9% on a reported basis and in average daily sales basis, since the additional selling day in the third quarter offset one fewer selling day in the first quarter.On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales were 11.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $2.3 billion, up 12.4% and gross profit margin was 16.8%, up approximately 30 basis points. Non-GAAP operating income was $1 billion year-to-date, up 11.9%. Non-GAAP operating net income margin was 7.6%.Net income was $551 million and non-GAAP net income was $673 million, up 13.4%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $4.54, up 17.9%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents were $167 million and net debt was $3.1 billion.Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion. As shown on Slide 21, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during the quarter. Our three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down one day from last year's third quarter and at the low end of our annual target range of high-teens to low 20s. Free cash flow year-to-date was $590 million compared to $459 million year-to-date 2018.The year-over-year increase in free cash flow primarily reflects higher cash profits and favorable timing of collections. For the quarter, we returned just over $200 million to shareholders, which included $43 million of dividends and $161 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $114 per share. Turning to capital allocation priorities on Slide 22. We announced earlier today that the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share to be paid on December 10, 2019, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 25.This represents a 28.8% increase over last year's dividend. We are pleased to announce that with this increase, the annualized dividend of $1.52 per share achieves our dividend payout target of 30% of free cash flow based on the midpoint of our free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. The objective of increasing the dividend to 30% of free cash flow was established when we provided our capital allocation priorities in November of 2014. Having met our five-year dividend commitment, we are updating our dividend objective going forward to grow in line with the earnings.We will target our dividend paid in the fourth quarter, annualized, to be approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income. This earnings payout ratio is equivalent to maintaining the dividend at approximately 30% of free cash flow. We are expressing the payout ratio as a percentage of non-GAAP net income because non-GAAP net income is a less volatile metric than free cash flow on an annual basis. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through returns of capital and strategic investments.In order of priority. First, increase dividends annually to guide these increases. As discussed, we will target annual dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5 to 3 times.We ended the quarter at 2.2 times, slightly below the low end of this range. In September we took advantage of favorable capital markets to extend our debt maturity profile by redeeming the outstanding $525 million of 5% senior notes due 2023, with the proceeds from the issuance of $600 million of four and a quarter percent senior notes due 2028. The increased proceeds were used to cover transaction cost and term out a portion of the data from the Scalar acquisition. Subsequent to the quarter, we further linked the maturities by extending our term loan by three years.With these two transactions now closed, our weighted average debt maturity increased from 4.7 years as of June 30 to 6.7 years on a pro forma basis as of September 30. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Our recent acquisitions of Aptris and Scalar are great examples of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases.At the end of September we had $842 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our capital allocation priorities support our updated 2019 outlook, which you can see on Slide 23. As Chris mentioned, we continue to expect U.S. IT market growth of approximately 3%.We now expect net sales growth of 625 to 675 basis points above U.S. IT market growth in constant currency on an organic basis. Included in the 625- to 675-basis-point premium is the Census project, which we now expect to contribute approximately 60 basis points of net sales growth this year. Given the majority of the Census revenue was recognized in the third quarter, we expect Census to have a modest contribution to fourth-quarter growth.We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an additional approximately 100 basis points of growth on top of the 625 to 675 basis points, while Aptris is not expected to have a material impact on 2019 net sales. Currency is expected to represent a 60-basis-point headwind for the full year assuming year-to-go exchange range of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. Given year-to-date exchange rates, this implies currency headwinds of 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2019.Considering our performance in the first 9 months and year-to-go expectation, we expect to exceed our previous outlook for 2019 non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth. We now look for non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth on a constant-currency basis to be strong mid-teens, call it, 16 to 16 and a half percent. Currency headwinds are projected to shave 60 basis points from the constant currency rate similar to the top line. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering financial targets on an annual constant-currency basis.Slide 24 provides additional modeling thoughts for full-year 2019. Moving down the P&L, total annual depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $265 million. This includes approximately $180 million of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, including preliminary estimates for Scalar and Aptris, which could change slightly once the purchase accounting is final. Depreciation and amortization expense and SG&A, excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, is expected to be approximately $80 million.Equity-based compensation is expected to be approximately $7 million to $9 million higher than 2018. Interest expense is now expected to be between $162 million and $164 million, reflecting our recent refinancing and expected lower short-term interest rates. Our 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be slightly below the low end of the 25 and a half to 26 and a half percent range. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth approximately 400 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income.Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 25. Our free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at three and three-quarters to four and quarter percent of net sales. We now expect capital expenditures to be roughly one and a quarter percent of sales. This includes business as usual capex of slightly above half a point of sales, plus approximately three-quarters of a point of sales to support Device as a Service for the Census.Recall that CDW is the lessor for the devices and procurement of most of the devices is treated as capex, which is effectively our cost of goods sold. To be clear, this increase in capex does not change our free cash flow rule of thumb. We now expect the cash tax rate to be approximately 24.5% of pre-tax income adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We expect to deliver a cash-conversion cycle within the annual target range of high-teens to low 20s.That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. [Operator instructions] Thank you.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. -- Yep. Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. I guess to start off with, I was hoping we could just talk a little bit more about the Census Bureau ramp.And I think Collin talked about this program that had contributed 60 basis points of growth in year 1 in 2019. That thing is an update from what you guys had talked about before. I guess could you just talk about the scope of this program? And is it fair to think that, year 2, calendar '20, should have a much more meaningful contribution than what you have in 2019? -- Sure, Amit. Good morning. You're right, we did pick up the 2019 outlook for the Census to 60 basis points from the 40 basis points we had previously shared earlier in the year. That was primarily due to finalizing the actual device count with the sensors and then deploying those.And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the majority of that revenue will be recognized in 2019 -- in the third quarter of 2019. As it relates to 2020, we will provide more thoughts on 2020 at our year-end earnings call. I did comment on a tick-up in capex and most of that capex is for devices that will be deployed in 2020. As you think about that though and the contribution to growth, remember we have 60 basis points of contribution sitting in the base.So as you think about the 2020 growth, you need to think about the delta between the two. -- Totally fair. Understood. And then I guess Chris, when you look at the 2019 growth, which is going to be at this point, plus 650 basis points versus IT spend. As you reflect on that, I'm curious, what do you think are sustainable in that growth trend versus unsustainable as you go forward? Just help us parse that because this seems to be a fairly impressive outperformance versus the broader markets. -- Yeah. Thanks, Amit, and really pleased with the team's execution so far this year. I mean, look, this is a year where we've been hitting on all cylinders with a strategy that is right for what our customer needs and the capabilities to deliver. So when you think about client devices as an example, certainly some tailwinds there from a refresh perspective, from an end of life market event coming up and full employment.And the teams have taken full advantage of that in making sure that we're helping our customers along that journey. By the same token, infrastructure modernization and optimization is also equally important, particularly as organizations continue to digitize across the organization and as IT has become, I call it, front and center. It's really in the middle of driving outcomes for our organizations. So the trends that we see across the full landscape of IT seem to be continuing to be strong.Now all that said, as we move into Q4 and look forward to 2020, we do have some challenging overlaps. That's for sure. When you look in the client-side, for example, and you look at corporate and small business and double digits on double digits. And even as a segment, we're working on double digits on double digits.We've got some headwinds coming forward with that end of life coming to fruition, we've got some wildcards out there that we've talked about, Brexit, and tariffs and trade, etc. So we'll have to keep our eye on all of that. I guess what I would say is that, as we said in our prepared remarks, customer sentiment continues to feel strong. And activity is strong, notwithstanding the uncertainties.But it's hard to say what's going to happen next year and our expectation is we'll see solid growth in Q4, although client in particular moderating down. -- Thank you and congrats on the quarter, guys. -- Thanks very much, Amit. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Yeah, thank you. It sounded like data center hardware was a bit of a drag in the quarter. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what drove the slowdown there. And if you're seeing any impact at all from budget dollars being shifted over to PCs in support of the needed refresh on that side. -- Yeah. Hi, Matt. Good question. I would say a couple of things there.First of all, when you see this kind of client growth, customers can only absorb so much. So there is a factor of what customers can absorb and what they're focused on right now. That's absolutely part of it. In terms of data center in particular, what you saw was on a consolidated basis, data center hardware not as strong.It was still up but not as strong. If you look at data center solutions, including software, we had very strong growth in software, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. And so what you'll find is in these types of projects, I'm going to try and find another word, but lumpy is the best word that we have right now. They really are lumpy.When they come to fruition, when they roll out and frankly what the mix is in the solution between hardware and software. So we are not feeling a tangible softness there. We continue to have conversations with the customers. I would say frankly, that I think uncertainty, macro uncertainty right now, is weighing on these types of decisions that are complex, where there are so many options, where customers are deciding things on-prem, off-prem, private cloud, multi-cloud, consumption models, as a service, all underscored by opex and capex decisions.It does feel like customers are weighing those options and scrutinizing them with a little bit more carefulness right now. But the conversations continue to take place, and we're feeling good about them. -- Got it. And then on international. Wondering if you can talk a little bit more about, first, how the ramp of Scalar is going? And then I know you just bought Aptris, but curious how you think about the potential for a larger M&A down the road, particular to move more meaningfully into newer geographies? -- Yes. Thanks for the question. Scalar is going as planned. I have to say and a shout out to the teams up in Canada and also the teams here in the U.S.who have been working diligently to make that integration successful. It's lot of hard work while you are trying to support your customers, deliver performance and integrate. So they've been doing a really terrific job. And our customers have been -- what they're telling us is they're really appreciative of the ability for us to bring them a full portfolio and have holistic conversations, and we are seeing wins across the board with customers on the Scalar side and the CDW U.K.side, where we're able to benefit them both with a broader portfolio. So that's all going well. We said and we continue to expect that Scalar will add 100 basis points of growth this year, and we still expect that to be the case. Regarding Aptris, Aptris is a great example, frankly, of a clear need in the marketplace, a pipeline of opportunity, an organization that brought to bear the type of expertise needed in a fast-growing software area with great implementation and assessment skills and a culture that fit.And as we think of Aptris, smaller sure but what I'd call a mature practice, a well-developed practice, and so for us it's really building that to scale as quickly as we can, and that's what we intend to focus on. We certainly will continue to focus on larger opportunities, but as you know, we've got a number of filters that we use. It's got to be a strategic fit from a capabilities perspective or a deal perspective. Operationally, it needs to be something that we feel confident we can absorb.We know how hard these things are and we know how important it is to get them right. It needs to have -- to be a cultural fit. That has proven to be very important, frankly, in the success of our acquisitions. And then finally, obviously, the financials screens.We need to feel that the financial return is going to be where we need it to be. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. -- OK. Thanks and good morning. Chris, I just wanted to start maybe on the growth strategy, that the two -- the last two enhancing capabilities in solutions and services. If you could just maybe double click to help us understand why each of these are important to your existing customer base.You've always talked about being the trusted advisor, you've been with many of them for decades. What's causing the increased focus? Are they to the point where they're willing to pay separately for services in particular? -- Yeah. I actually -- let me start with that last comment and work back from there. Yes, they are. Customers are willing to pay for added services.What's important is a service-lead conversation that we are able to have as we develop a spectrum of service capabilities and depth in our service capabilities create conversations with the customers that are, frankly, more rich and strategic. So it allows us to have a seat at the table at the front end of when they're making decisions about their organization. The acquisition of Aptris is a great example of that because the conversations that are taking place when customers are thinking about IT service management are instrumental and fundamental to how they're thinking about overall modernizing their infrastructure and digitally transforming their organization. So those types of things, number one, the projects customers do pay for, but they also get us a seat at the table which creates broader, deeper and larger opportunities for us to help our customers and, obviously, opportunities for us.When you think about Scalar in particular, we really -- in Canada, we really replicated, if you will, what we have in the U.S. now, where we have, what I would say, is a very broad-based offering capability. We've got depth in our technical organization now in the areas where customers are needing help sorting through complexity in the area of security, infrastructure, cloud questions and those types of things that they're grappling with. And we've got presence across the whole of Canada at this point.End market presence, the geo presence is also very reflective of what we have in the U.S. We've got nice balance up there. We've got a nice diversity up there. We've got nice depth in Canada.And we become a place where a customer can come as a one-stop shop for their IT needs. So that's how we think about services and solutions capabilities that we've been folding into the larger organization. -- OK. That's helpful. Maybe just as a quick follow-up to tie in some financials to that. Could you touch on non-GAAP operating margin.When you make exchanges, I know you talked about device cycle moderating, spending, shifting to data center and services. You typically expect a higher gross margin, but higher opex and similar if not improved operating margin. But is there a difference maybe at this time as we think forward on vendor programs and devices that would theoretically not repeat being a greater headwind to gross margin and offsetting some of that upward mix? To where operating margins could be flat or down? Or maybe just some directional things with mix and operating margin in particular. Thank you. -- Thanks, Adam. Boy, there's a lot in that question. I would -- I guess I'll stick with our -- look, we expect a mid-7% non-GAAP operating margin. As I think about the quarter and the strength we saw in gross margin, I guess it's a little counterintuitive given the heavy client device strength that the margin would have -- the gross margin would've ticked up 30 basis points.We have seen quite a bit of success helping our customers with cloud solutions, and so that mix in the netted down items provided some lift to offset some of the margin pressure from heavy client device growth. What I would say though, and you touched on this in your question, is we do have a highly variable cost structure and pay people on a percentage of GP. So that was mitigated to some extent at the bottom line. I think there was also a question in there on vendor funding.Typically, we'll comment on that if it's growing or contributing meaningfully more or less in the overall rate of sales growth. We didn't this quarter, so that wasn't a material factor. Hopefully, that addresses your question. -- Yeah. Thanks, Collin.Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good morning. A number of your vendor partners are announcing a shift from capex to opex model, essentially, subscription model for data center infrastructure. What are you hearing from your customers in terms of where this model makes sense, what type of customers, what types of applications do they want to buy as opex? And to the extent that the model were to significant shift in the direction, is there any difference in the way that you recognize revenue? -- Hi, Katy. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we do have, as you know and you've mentioned a number of OEMs who are shifting to that model.The good news for us is that creates, frankly, more complexity and more choices for customer to sort through in terms of understanding a couple of things. Number one, as you point out, opex versus capex. But also when you think about performance and reliability and scalability and agility in our customers' infrastructure needs, they've got to take all of those and put them together and determine what's going to be the best modern infrastructure that they're looking for. So we do have the capability and have those conversations, frankly, more and more frequently given the technology now becoming available in as a service basis.In terms of the accounting, I'll let Collin take that because the accounting for CDW, as you know, is different than how our OEMs would recognize on as a service basis. -- Yeah, Katy. I'd say very early innings on this in terms of on-prem subscription. So the models are -- and there is no standard is the easiest way to say that. It depends on the way the transaction is structured.So if there's a third-party intermediary in there and we're just selling it, then we would recognize it as we typically would, which would be upfront. To the extent that we're performing more of an agent role, we would take that on a netted down basis. -- OK. Thank you. And Collin, just as a follow up. Cash conversion cycle is stronger year-to-date, as you noted, and you're tracking ahead of your free cash flow targets for the year, rule of thumb.Any reason that we shouldn't expect a seasonally strong fourth-quarter cash flow? And does that put you ahead of the model this year? -- Yeah. I think, Katy, we're still expecting to deliver within our rule of thumb for the full year. We've had some favorable timing that's helped us year-over-year as we moved throughout. This year, in the second quarter, we mixed into vendors with extended payment terms, so that helps us on the payable side.And then this most recent quarter, we had favorable timing of collection just the way the calendar fell. We had a lot of really good cash collecting days in the month. I would expect that to normalize by the time we get to the end of the year. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open. -- Hi. I wanted to take a slightly different spin on the M&A question. After that acquisition with the ServiceNow capabilities, is quite interesting. Is M&A going to become a more consistent part of your strategy going forward, and especially considering where your leverage is today? And then, are there any other capabilities or partnerships in particular that you feel like need to be added to the portfolio? -- Morning. Maggie, thanks for the question. I would say that M&A is always part of a means to achieving our strategy. And we are, as we've said consistently, actively examining potential targets.And those are folks who come to us. Those are folks that we know in the market. But again, we are a really disciplined buyer. Again, as I know you know this, we hold to those four lenses very strongly.And so certainly, M&A is part of how we think about scaling capabilities, filling in areas where we think we could bolster those capabilities. But it just comes down to what's available and whether or not it's affordable and whether or not there's a fit there. So the answer to the question is yes, but it all depends on what's in the market and whether we think it's a good fit. In terms of certain areas, look, we feel like we've got some real strength across the full spectrum of solutions' needs right now.So we're growing those organically. And to the extent we can find some that fit externally, we'll think about that as well. As you know, we've recently brought on a new cloud partner, a couple of -- about 18 months ago now, and so you can imagine that we've been building capabilities in our public cloud area pretty aggressively. -- OK. Thanks. And then obviously, the Device as a Service census work was a strength this quarter. Are you seeing continued traction with that type of offering? And do you feel confident that you can land additional Device as a Service engagements on a consistent basis? Or is this something that we should be thinking about as kind of more of a one-off type of engagement for the time being? -- Yeah, it's a great question, Maggie. I think I would suggest you consider it more of a one-off for the time being. Similar to what Collin said about on-prem, private cloud, we are really are at the front stages of Device as a Service being developed as, what I'll call, a repeatable solution. That said, we do have a number of customers, some large customers, some small customers, who are really quite interested in Device as a Service that we are centrally focused on building out the capability and the practice area in a consistent uniform way to approach a solution like that. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ruplu Batajarya with Bank of America. Your line is open.Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. And congrats on another strong quarter. Just wanted to ask on the government side, you had strong above seasonal growth this quarter. Were there any pull-ins from the fourth quarter? And should we expect above seasonal growth again in the fourth quarter? So just any thoughts on strength going forward on the government side. -- Yeah. Government had a great year. And when I think about federal government, in particular, there are couple of things happening there. One, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have, over the past several years, worked very hard on bringing to bear the right capabilities in terms of internal resources, such as technologists, as well as things like contract capture and project management, and all the things that the federal government needs from a technology supplier like CDW.And we've really seen the teams leverage those capabilities into success. So as a real strategic partner to the federal government, we continue to support them and more and larger projects that they're working on, which is obviously good for us. The other thing about federal government this year is census, as we've just talked about, has also been helpful in terms of the third quarter in particular. And then, lastly, what we are seeing is we are actually seeing refresh in the federal government.You'll recall, Department of Defense a few years ago mandated moves to Win 7 -- Win 10 client devices, and frankly, we're seeing those devices actually already being refreshed. So we have a lot of nice momentum. That said, they've delivered very well this year and we expect a solid fourth quarter, but somewhat cautiousness. In terms of pull-ins for the third quarter, we didn't see anything other -- out of the ordinary.We saw what I would characterize as a pretty normal year-end for federal government.OK. That's helpful, Chris. Maybe just as a follow-up. I think HP as a vendor that accounts for more than 10% of your consolidated net sales.On their Analyst Day, they talked about a shift in their business model, at least on the printer side where they're going to charge more for printers upfront. I was wondering if you've seen any changes in their go-to-market and how do you think this impacts CDW, if at all? -- Yeah. We wouldn't talk about any, in particular, vendor. I can't say that there is a shift that we've been seeing in the market yet. That sounds like a fairly recent announcement, but we wouldn't comment in any of our particular vendors.OK. Thanks for taking my question. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Yes, thank you and good morning. I just wanted to touch again on your comments regarding the strong client refresh cycle that you've seen both on the government and in corporate side. As you talk to your customers, do you have any visibility, particularly as we're getting close to this Microsoft deadlines in January? How many of your customers are not complying and still need to upgrade? And then, as you pointed out, Chris, you're already seeing some government customers sort of lap their last refresh because they were the first ones to adopt Windows 7 -- or Windows 10. Are you starting to see the corporate customers sort of get in line as well? Or are you seeing expectations for more of a drop-off following this upgrade cycle? -- Yeah. Hi, Matt, thanks for the question. There's a lot of things in what's happening with clients, I would say. First of all, when we look at our customer base, we have a large number of customers who've moved to Win 10, but we still will expect more in Q4, frankly.There's always a bit of a rollover. So we would still expect to see people moving to Win 10 at least through the first quarter of next year. But we do have a lot of customers who have already moved to Win 10. That said, yes, we are seeing refresh.Some that I mentioned corporate customers from a couple of years ago, we're seeing refresh. When you think about the strength in the employment, full employment, that continues to drive purchases and, frankly, refresh as well. And also, new use cases. We talked about that a number of times in terms of tablets and what not being used for a variety of industries from a digital expansion perspective.So if the economy remains solid, we'd expect customers to continue on a refresh trajectory. But again, moderating due to the Win 7 end-of-life coming to an end, we would expect that to dampen the demand a bit. And remember for CDW, we have, as I mentioned earlier, very high overlaps that we're going to have to deal with in 2020. And then lastly, there's been some noise around potential supply chain constraints again in 2020.And obviously, we've done a great job this year. The team's done a phenomenal job of using our advantages to be able to take supply, and really have no impact from that constraint. But we are hearing again potential constraints in the market going into 2020. -- OK. Thanks for taht. And then, regarding your healthcare sector, which has had double-digit growth for two or three quarters now, and I know that was prior last two or three years, fairly lumpy. It seems like more sustainable.Is that tied to just more investments in the healthcare community as they transform more toward digital? Or is that -- some of that a client refresh story as well? -- Oh, it's a little of both. You hit them both. I think budgets are stabilized. So that's number one.That's good. And we are seeing healthcare systems that are finally adopting Win 10. They're are usually little laggards in that area, but they are. And also, as you said, very much focused on infrastructure to drive patient experience, clinical mobility, efficiencies, etc.And M&A activity, frankly, continues to happen out there. And that's an opportunity for us to work with the healthcare systems as well. -- OK. Thank you. -- Thank you, Matt.Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much. My first question is just you had mentioned customer sentiment remains strong, but I'm curious during the quarter what was the linearity like? Did it strengthen? Is it weakness? And I guess, frankly, was there any variation from what you usually see on a seasonality basis? -- Yeah, Shannon, I -- hard to answer that question. Throughout the quarter, I would say, that customer sentiment and activity remained pretty much consistent during the quarter and consistent with seasonality. I think that's how I'd answer that question. -- Shannon, just as a matter of policy, we typically don't comment on intra-quarter momentum or trends, unless we feel that there's something noteworthy to call out. And as Chris said, there wasn't anything noteworthy to call out on the floor within the quarter. -- OK. Thank you.. And then Tim, last night on the Apple call, talked about utilizing the trade-in program for the iPad business that's going through the census. So I'm just curious, how are you -- are you exposed at all to residual risk on those? And I assume, just in general, you talked about how you're setting up sort of a Device as a Service capability.Will you manage that? Are you going to use outside partners to minimize the risk? Thank you. -- Sure. So we do not have residual value risk on the census offering. So I think Apple referenced that in terms of the strong residual value being able to drive down a lower cost to the ultimate customer the Census Bureau. And then, I'm sorry, the other question was on the capability? -- Well, just in general and I'm curious as to how involved you'll be on managing. Because that's one of the areas where you can find a lot of profitability, correct, if it's managed correctly and be resold into the market. So I was just curious if that's part of what you're going to do. Or are you just going to partner with somebody and not get involved? -- Yeah, we'll work with a reseller then when those devices come back, and we're not going to get into the economics of that. -- OK. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. -- Good morning, guys. Chris, just a question for you just in terms of employees, especially customer-facing. Obviously, we're in times of full employment here. Can you talk about the opportunity or just the challenge you guys have in terms of retaining your top sales guys? And any challenges in recruiting new salespeople and retaining them? -- Yeah, great question. It is a tough market out there. I would say a couple of things. Number one, we pay a lot of attention to it.We are seeing -- for a variety of positions, we are seeing an extended time to hire and sometimes requirement of bringing more candidates in to be able to convert. But one of the things that we do very well here as a core competency is talent acquisition and development. And so the teams have really become very creative around uses of data, artificial intelligence and ways to target, very specifically, folks that we know will be high-performing, have the characteristics and will be high-performing at CDW and then really laser-focused in from a recruiting perspective. And they've been very, very successful during this period of a tight labor market.Our attrition rates have not increased higher than normal. And in fact, in some of the areas within CDW that you'd expect that they might be, like in our technology teams, they're lower than the average. And look, CDW is a unique culture as we talk about, but the ability to make a good living here, particularly as a seller, when you think about our outperformance of the market and that translates into GP dollars and commissions for our sellers and for our technical specialists, it's a good place to be right now. -- Great. Appreciate it. And then just moving back over to the Census Bureau contract. Can you give us an idea in terms of how many contracts of that type or size are generally out there in any given year? And I'm assuming the sales cycle is relatively long.Is there any idea what the pipeline looking into 2020 about most of the deals that might be out there where you guys compete with? -- Yeah. I'll start on this one. What I said earlier, and I communicate again, we do have customers, large customers and smaller customers who are very interested in Device as a Service for the obvious reasons. It's an operating expense model.It makes sense. But how these are constructed is pretty complicated we're finding. And so what I wanted to convey is we're at the front end of trying to develop a methodology and practice that allows us to deliver, I'll call it, consistent offerings to our customers in ways that are repeatable, as opposed to highly tailored offerings that are not necessarily repeatable at scale. So that -- we're really at the front stages of that.If I look across the market, I would suggest that I think most of our -- the folks who are in this business are also at the front stages. -- Yeah. I would just add, I think, the census is a very unique use case, right? It's once every 10 years. The devices are deployed for a relatively short period into the field relative to the useful life of the asset. And so you have a unique use case and a unique use period.And so I don't think there are a lot of other things like that floating around out there, but that doesn't mean that customers in general aren't interested. And as we've talked about though, those are all kinds of different flavors. -- Great. Thanks.Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back to Chris Leahy for any closing remarks. -- Thank you, Lauren. Let me close by highlighting CDW's addition to the S&P 500 in September. This marks another important milestone in our company's history. I also want to recognize the hard work of our over 9,800 coworkers around the globe and their ongoing dedication to serving our customers.They are the reason we have and will continue to lead the industry. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you for your continued interest in CDW. Thanks again, everyone. Happy Halloween.Collin and I look forward to talking to you next quarter.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. -- Thank you, Beth. It's a pleasure to discuss CDW's results and strategic progress with you today. I'm pleased to report that we had an excellent start to the year with strong top-line growth and profitability. In the first quarter, average daily sales increased 11.5%, up 12.4% in constant currency.Net sales of $4 billion were up 9.7% on a reported basis, with one fewer selling day this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income increased 10.7% to $287 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 18.2% to $1.24 per share. This quarter's results reflect three key drivers, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio and ongoing execution against our three-part strategy. Let's take a look at how each of these drivers helped us deliver profitable growth this quarter.First, our customer end market performance. As you know, we have five U.S. channels: corporate, which serves customers with coworkers from roughly 250 and up; small business, which serves customers with roughly 20 to 250 coworkers; and healthcare; government; and education. Within each channel, we have teams further focused on customer end markets and verticals.For example, in government, we have federal, with teams focused on serving the Department of Defense and across civilian agencies, as well as state and local teams. Each of our U.S. channels generated more than $1.3 billion of net sales in 2018. We also have our U.K.and Canadian operations, which, together, delivered nearly USD 1.9 billion of net sales in 2018. As most of you are familiar, our balanced customer end markets position us to perform even when external factors impact certain sectors and industries. Reflecting a generally healthy economy, all of our customer end markets grew this quarter. I was particularly pleased with the execution of our government channel, which delivered strong performance despite the government shutdown.Our corporate, small business and public segments, as well as our international businesses all contributed double-digit growth this quarter. Taking a closer look at this performance. Our corporate team delivered a 13% increase in net sales, with balanced double-digit growth in transaction and solution. Transactions growth was powered by our unique ability to provide high-value services, including preorders, configurations and staging, and to secure client device inventory in a supply constrained market.This enabled the team to meet strong client device demand, driven by strength in the economy and healthy employment. Client devices grew 20% in the quarter. This was the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. At the same time, the Corporate team continue to leverage our deep technical capabilities and strong solutions portfolio to help customers modernize their IT infrastructure and realize the benefits of more flexible architectures.This drove excellent results in servers, storage, software and netcomm. Small business net sales increased 10%, with double-digit growth in transactions and high single-digit growth in solutions. Small business customers remained optimistic and continue to invest in their businesses and employees. Similar to corporate, our competitive advantages enabled the small business team to deliver client device growth of approximately 20% on top of similar growth last year.Small business continues to benefit from the focus created when we establish a stand-alone segment. For example, our small business technical team provides advice tailored to the unique needs of small businesses, including emerging technology and consumption alternatives. Our ability to do this contributed to nearly 50% growth in software as a service this quarter in small business. Public's 10% increase in net sales reflected strong contributions from government and healthcare.Government delivered high-teen net sales growth, with double-digit growth in both federal and state and local. The federal team delivered these excellent results despite the partial government shutdown in January and tough year-over-year client device comparison. Regarding the shutdown, the team worked closely with impacted civilian agencies when they reopened. And by the end of the first quarter, our sales with civilian agencies were generally in line with plan.Our ability to support the government's continuing priorities around modernizing infrastructure, enhancing cybersecurity and combat readiness drove strong solutions performance. Federal solutions growth were also benefited from timing as we had several larger projects that were delivered earlier than anticipated. Solutions performance was partially offset by a decline in transactions. As you recall, Federal had tremendous success helping agencies meet the Department of Defense mandate to move to Win 10 devices through 2017 and into the first quarter of 2018.We have now lapped the Win 10 shipments related to the DoD mandate. State and local performance was driven by contracts and ongoing success in public safety projects, which contributed to growth in enterprise storage, netcomm and software. Education increased 2.4%, with both K-12 and higher ed delivering low-digit growth. K-12 net sales performance was driven by solid growth in client devices and video, which was offset by some lumpiness in solutions.The team continues to work with schools to design and transform classrooms to enable collaborative learning in more active and flexible learning spaces. Higher education strength in client devices was partially offset by a decline in solutions as we lapped strong performance from several large networking projects in the first quarter of 2018. Helping higher education customers address security drove strong growth in security software. Healthcare was up over 8%.The team continues to help customers secure their IT environment and modernize their infrastructure. This drove double-digit solutions growth in the quarter. Customers also continue to refresh client devices, which drove a mid single-digit increase in transactions. Our international teams delivered strong growth with combined sales up nearly 13% in U.S.dollars. Both teams executed well in the quarter, each posting strong double-digit growth in local currency. In Canada, solutions growth continued to outpace transactions. Scalar, which closed February 1, performed in line with expectations.Integration is on track, and we are starting to provide expanded portfolio options to both existing CDW Canada and Scalar customers. We are winning new business based on our enhanced value proposition and the combined breadth of our products, services and solutions. In the U.K., the team did a great job capturing share of public sector fiscal year-end buying, delivering particularly strong growth, as they benefited from go-to-market refinements we've made in our government team. Multinational customers continue to leverage our international scope with U.S.to U.K. referrals growing over 20% this quarter. Today, we have not seen any impact on demand from Brexit. As I mentioned last quarter, we established a presence on the continent to support CDW U.K.'s broader growth opportunities in the EU.This presence also serves as a Brexit contingency plan. With the new entity in place, we've expanded our ability to support customers on the continent. First-quarter results also demonstrate the second driver of performance, our broad portfolio of both transactions and integrated solutions. This quarter, performance was strong across the entire portfolio.Hardware increased 10%, software increased 18% and services increased 16%. Solutions grew midteens, our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while transactions grew 10%. Solutions performance reflected the ongoing strength in the economy, coupled with customer need to replace aged infrastructure and their desire to take advantage of more efficient and flexible architectures. Our sales and technical teams did an excellent job helping customers successfully address these requirements.Our solutions results also reflect the benefit of backlog flush as lead times in solutions category, such as NetComm, returned to more normal levels. These trends contributed to our strong hardware growth as we delivered more than 20% increases in both servers and enterprise storage. Hardware growth was also fueled by double digit client growth as we leveraged our competitive advantages of scale in our distribution centers to help customers navigate through supply constraint in the quarter. Software net sales increased 18%.As you know, software is becoming a larger component of IT solutions. Success helping customers adopt new architectures and secure their IT environments contributed to excellent performance in network management, storage management and security software, all growing strong double-digits in the quarter. Our cloud solutions capabilities also contributed to this quarter's strong results. We drove significant double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit, led, again, by productivity, platform, security and collaboration workloads.Service's 16% increase was led by professional services and warranties. Strong growth across solutions categories, including software as a service and warranties, both of which are recognized on a net basis, contributed to our 30-basis-point gross margin expansion in the quarter. As you can see, this quarter's results demonstrate the power of our balanced customer end markets and broad products and solutions portfolio, both clearly contributing to our strong top line and bottom-line performance. While we benefited from some favorable timing, adjusting for this, net sales still increased double digits in constant currency, a great result by our team as they navigated through uncertainties, including the government shutdown, the looming Brexit outcome and shipment constraints.Our results also demonstrate the power of the third driver of our performance, our three-part strategy for growth. For CDW, our strategy starts with our customers. Maximizing their technology investments to drive productivity and growth is a priority for them, but given limited IT resources and the pace of technology change, our customers need help making technology decisions, implementing solutions and then managing their technology investments. Our three-part strategy is designed to make sure that customers turn to us for the help they need to make the right decisions for their business.Our three-part strategy for growth is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance the solutions capabilities; third, expand our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars intersect, together contributing to our ability to profitably deliver the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need. The first pillar focuses on productivity improvements. We do this through enhanced systems and data, sales force productivity initiatives and investments in our brand and marketing.This underpins our ability to achieve our overall strategy. Productivity gains fuel our ability to invest while delivering profitable growth. The second pillar ensures we stay relevant to our customers by investing in solutions capabilities that enable us to be their trusted partner today and into the future. And our third pillar ensures we have value-added services capabilities to deliver many of today's integrated end-to-end solutions.The combination of these three interconnected pillars with our scope and scale creates powerful differentiation in the market. Let me share some examples of our strategy in action. Our first pillar includes driving productivity through investments and process improvement and automation. Our new proprietary partner portal, which was implemented last year, is a great illustration of this.The partner portal further enhances our ability to onboard and to collaborate with our vendor partners. For example, we've enhanced the exchange and presentation of real-time data with our partners, delivering timely analytics and insights to our partners, enables us collectively to deliver more targeted and effective sales programs, training and enablement for our sales and technical organization. The portal will also help us more efficiently onboard the 50 to 75 new partners we add each year that keep our portfolio optimally relevant for our customers. An example of the second and third pillars of our strategy is a solution we provided to a 500 location, nonprofit, integrated health network.Having moved its electronic medical record system to the public cloud, the customer was experiencing increasing costs and performance issues. An integrated team of our healthcare sellers and technical solutions architects worked closely with the customer to assess its IT environment and evaluate options. The solution was to move their entire electronic medical records platform, networking storage, software and communication back to an on-premise data center. There were four key reasons why CDW was uniquely qualified to help the customer through this journey.First, because we are technology-agnostic, we were able to invite unbiased device on the pros and cons of public cloud, on-premise and hybrid solutions. Second, our broad portfolio of products and solutions enable us to drop on multiple technologies and brands to create an integrated solution. Third, our seasoned Healthcare team was able to leverage their deep industry experience to develop a compelling best-in-breed solution. Finally, we were able to provide professional services capabilities to implement the solution.This project helped our customer reduce costs and improve performance, and resulted in over $20 million of net sales. We have confidence that our strategy positions us for strong growth, serves us well when confronted with macro channel or partner challenges and leverages our competitive advantages to deliver strong profitability and cash flow. We will continue to make strategic investments to ensure we remain our customers' partner of choice. One important investment we make is in customer-facing coworkers.In the first quarter, we added 55, excluding the approximately 300 customer-facing coworkers from Scalar. We continue to plan to add between 125 to 175 customer-facing coworkers in 2019. Now let me leave you with a few thoughts on the remainder of the year. Clearly, we are off to a great start.Our market outlook for 2019 is generally consistent with our view at the beginning of the year. We continue to expect full-year U.S. IT market growth in the 3% range. Given our strong performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our target for outperforming the market to 300 to 375 basis point on a constant currency organic basis.We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an additional 100 basis points of growth for the year. These expectations recognize our strong 2018 performance and the year-over-year comparisons we face for both client devices and international performance. We expect ongoing but moderating strength in client devices, as well as solid growth in solution. That said, while we are pleased that lead times returned to more normal levels in solutions categories, the potential for chip shortages remains a wildcard.Of course, we will continue to refine our expectations as we move throughout the year. Now let me turn it over to Collin, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Collin? -- Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Chris indicated, our first-quarter results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business that build on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth and return cash to shareholders.Turning to our first-quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4 billion, up 9.7% on a reported basis and 11.5% on an average daily sales basis as we had one fewer selling day. On a constant-currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 12.4%. First-quarter consolidated results included two months of Scalar, which performed in line with expectations.On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales declined 2.9% versus Q4 of 2018, which was approximately 500 basis points better than the average of the prior three years and better than expected. This reflected several factors. Client device growth was stronger than expected, particularly in corporate and small business, as we leveraged our competitive advantages of scale in our distribution centers to help customers navigate through supply constraints in the quarter. In the U.K., the team executed really well, capturing March fiscal year-end buying, notwithstanding Brexit uncertainty, and FX wasn't as much of a headwind as expected.We also benefited from favorable timing. Last year, we shared that lead times had extended in certain categories, such NetComm, which caused our backlog to increase to higher-than-normal levels. In the first quarter, lead times returned to more normal levels, creating a positive flush that we previously had expected to receive throughout the year. In addition, federal benefited from timing as several large projects were delivered earlier than anticipated.In aggregate, favorable timing contributed approximately $60 million to $70 million to Q1 net sales. Gross profit for the quarter increased 11.3% to $672 million. Gross margin expanded 30 basis points, driven by product margin, which continued to benefit from the strength in solution categories, as well as the overlap of client devices shipped to the Department of Defense last year. Strength in software as a service and warranties, which are recognized on a net basis, also contributed to margin expansion.Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Our non-GAAP SG&A, including advertising, increased 11.7%. The increase was primarily driven by sales compensation, which moves in line with gross profit growth, incremental Scalar expenses and investments in the business consistent with our go-forward strategy. Coworker count of 9,434 was up nearly 700 coworkers from March of 2018 with approximately half of the year-over-year increase from Scalar and the other half from organic coworker investments.Roughly two-thirds of the nearly 700 coworkers added were in customer-facing roles. Non-GAAP operating income, which replaces adjusted EBITDA as our internal and external pre-tax operating profit metric, was $287 million, an increase of 10.7%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.3%. Historically, adjusted EBITDA margin was lowest in the first quarter, given that Q1 is a seasonally low sales quarter.We expect quarterly non-GAAP operating income margin to follow similar seasonality as quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $38 million, up 1.8%. This was primarily driven by the interest rate caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to two and three-eights percent and the financing of Scalar, partially offset by savings from the term loan refinancing, which we will overlap beginning Q2.Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 20.2% in the quarter, compared to an effective tax rate of 23.4% last year. This resulted in Q1 tax expense of $39 million, which was flat year over year. The lower GAAP effective tax rate was driven by higher excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation in Q1 of 2019 versus Q1 of 2018 and the one-time benefit related to the Scalar acquisition. Both of these items, along with other tax adjustments consistent with non-GAAP add-backs, are adjusted to derive our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is shown on Slide 12.For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.8%, down 50 basis points, compared to last year's 26.3% rate, primarily due to guidance issued by the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2018 on foreign taxes creditable against global intangible low-taxed income. As you can see on Slide 13, with first-quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $149 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.02, up 25%. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects operating performance, was $185 million in the quarter, up 13.9% over last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.24, up 18.2% from last year.Currency headwinds dampened non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth by approximately 90 basis points in the first quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. As of March 31, our cash and cash equivalents were $285 million, and net debt was $3 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion.As shown on Slide 15, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during the quarter. Our three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, flat from last year and within our annual target range of high teens to low 20s. Free cash flow for the quarter was $303 million, compared to $231 million in Q1 of 2018. Remember, Q1 is a seasonally strong cash flow quarter because sales decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1 and cash tax payments are minimal.The year-over-year increase in free cash flow primarily reflects higher cash profits and mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. For the quarter, we returned $220 million of cash to shareholders, which included $43 million of dividends and $177 million of share repurchases at an average price of nearly $91 per share. Turning to Slide 16. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through returns of capital and strategic investments.In order of priority, first, increased dividends annually. To guide these increases, in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.295 per share on June 11 to shareholders of record as of May 24, up 40% from a year ago. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5 times to 3 times.We ended the quarter at 2.3 times, slightly below the low end of this range. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Scalar is a great example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases.Our capital allocation priorities support our updated 2019 outlook, which you see on Slide 17. As Chris mentioned, we continue to expect U.S. IT market growth of approximately 3%. We now expect net sales growth of 300 to 375 basis points above U.S.IT market growth in constant currency on an organic basis. We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an additional approximately 100 basis points of growth on top of the 300 to 375 basis points. Currency is now expected to represent a 50-basis-point headwind for the full year assuming exchange rates of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2019.We now expect non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth on a constant-currency basis in the 11% to 12% range, which is just above our previous expectation of approximately 10%. Currency headwinds are projected to shave 50 basis points from the constant-currency rate. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering financial targets on an annual basis. Slide 18 provides additional modeling thoughts.We currently expect 2019's first half, second half sales split to be approximately 48.5% first half, 51.5% second half, which is 50 basis points different than historical seasonality of 48% first half, 52% second half. This reflects expected Q2 seasonality below historical levels given the strength of the first quarter, including the impact from federal timing and backlog flush. It also factors in upcoming client device overlaps in corporate, challenging comparisons in the U.K. and a couple of key unknowns such as chip availability and Brexit in the back half of the year.When modeling Q2, please keep in mind that FX headwinds are greater in the first half of the year. We expect second-quarter headwinds to be in line with the 90 basis points we experienced in the first quarter. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range. Total annual depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of $270 million to $275 million.This includes approximately $180 million of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, including a preliminary estimate for Scalar that could change slightly once the purchase accounting is final. Depreciation and amortization expense in SG&A, excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, is expected to be around $85 million. Equity-based compensation is expected to be approximately $5 million to $7 million higher than 2018, primarily driven by the true-up of performance-based plans in Q1. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $165 million to $167 million with the year-over-year growth driven by the caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to two and three-eights percent in the financing of Scalar.Our 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be near the lower end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth approximately 350 to 400 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth is expected to have currency headwinds of 50 basis points, similar to the top line. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of free cash flow can be found on Slide 19.Our free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged to 3.75% to 4.25% of sales. Expectations for capital expenditures, excluding the census, remain unchanged at slightly more than half a point of sales. We expect the cash tax rate to be slightly below 25.5% of pre-tax income adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within the target range of high teens to low 20s.That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. [Operator instructions] Thank you.[Operator instructions] And our first question is from Matt Cabral from Credit Suisse. -- Chris, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the health of the broader demand backdrop, particularly for solutions, which it sounded like it outperformed in the quarter, and if you could just comment about the sustainability of the aged infrastructure refresh that you called out in your prepared remarks. -- Yes. Hi, Matt. It's great to have you back on the call again. I'd be happy to do that.I think we break it down into a number of factors that are impacting the strength in solutions. You really have, looking back, a five to seven-year period, where there's, as you know, an accumulation of what people call technical debt in the traditional data center infrastructure. And whether or not it was budget constraints and customers were extending the useful life of assets or whether it was a cloud or a strategy that our customers were considering, as we talk to our customers now, they really are looking at the new normal, I'll call it, of hybrid-enabled data center. So first of all, old infrastructure, and certainly the upcoming deadline of the Windows end of service for 2008 and SQL Server in January are catalysts for demand.But at the same time, we're getting questions around which way to go, hybrid, cloud, a combination of the two. So you've got a couple of factors. Aged infrastructure and absolute need to upgrade, you've got some deadlines coming up that's driving that. But at the same time, Matt, we've got a lot of conversation around a longer-term road map that implies, I'd say, growth for on-prem, growth for cloud and continuing view into I'll call the on-prem metered model.So the demand continues to feel healthy, as I noted in our remarks, because of the centrality of the data center now to customers as they're using it to drive their businesses. -- Great. And then on the international, I know it's early days, but just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the integration of Scalar and just help us with how you're thinking about the opportunity for further international expansion going forward. -- OK. Well, let me start with Scalar, and I'd say the integration is on target. As you know, from our history, we're very thoughtful about how we do that, very planful -- very focused on our customers first and our coworkers as well. And it feels good.I would say the teams have come together. And sales organizations understand when you bring added benefits to what they can offer their customers to help their customers, and I'd say the sales organizations across both Scalar and CDW have felt that immediately with frankly, some quick wins. Our teams in U.K., the CDW teams are quite excited about the technical resources that Scalar has and Scalar's quite excited about the added portfolio that they can bring to our customers. So very positive there and on target.In terms of further expansion geographically, I'd go back to how we think about growth generally. If it's really valuable to our customers, that's our starting point. It needs to fit into our strategy, and that could include expanding our capabilities, both on the technical side or on the geographic side. So at the end of the day, it's one of those two things.And the value proposition has to be there and the price has to be compelling. So look, we're in the market. I think one of the questions that comes up frequently is, when you're doing on integration, are you not in the market? Are you not looking in the bottom? Is it there? If an opportunity to make sense to help us drive accelerated capabilities faster than building it, we will absolutely look at it, but we'll also want to ensure it's a compelling price.Our next question is from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. -- I'm curious, the healthcare company, or I'm not sure if it's a hospital company you talked about, where they shifted back on-prem from the cloud. I'm trying -- we've heard about that. We're just at Dell World, and it's clearly somewhat of a trend. But what I'm trying to understand is, at this point, how much are customers coming to you and saying, \"Look, we don't know what we're doing.We're not sure of the best route here.\" And then taking a look at their entire data center and making changes. Or is it still so early in terms of the cloud proliferation that we're not really there yet? Again, it sort of goes back to the prior question about how long can this last. I mean, some of the companies we talked to look at it as sort of a multi-year refresh cycle throughout data center and hybrid. So I'm just curious as to your take on it. -- Yes. Hi, Katy. The question that you -- oh is it -- oh, Shannon, I'm sorry. I mixed the name up.Hi, Shannon. I would say that the question that you articulated is precisely the question that our customers are asking us, taking a step back, understanding that they have infrastructure that needs to be updated but also wanting to implement the right capacity, the right capabilities for the future needs of their business or their organization. So it is a road map conversation. What that presents for CDW as an opportunity is the ability to help guide them in the strategy.And when you think about the plethora of choices, including gaining traction in what I'll call the on-premise metered model, and you know some of those providers, you now have legacy on-premise. You have cloud on-prem. You've got on-prem that is metered and as a service payment model, and you've got public cloud. The more choices, the more help the customer needs.And yes, it will be an ongoing long-term road map. You can't just -- they can't -- the customer just can't make the change overnight. -- And from a margin perspective for CDW, how should we think about the benefit to you? I guess, what I'm trying to get at is, is on-prem a higher margin opportunity than shifting to cloud, which I understand is sort of more of a ratable recurring? Just as we think about this playing out over the years, I'm trying to understand how much more sort of margin upside there potentially could be. -- Yes. I'll start, and I'll let Collin jump in. I think the way we think about margin, there are so many things that impacts our margin from not just mixed into solution, but mixed within solution, as you know well. It's what we're selling, when we're selling it, whether it's ratable, whether it's a transaction based -- there's just quite a mix in the solution business that will drive variability, I would say, in the margin. -- Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Shannon, is, building on Chris' comment about there's lot of different kinds of mixes that are going on. I think your intuition is right that you'd expect solutions to have a higher gross margin, but as we've talked about, it also has a higher cost to serve. So if you look at this past quarter, we did have great solutions performance.We had strong gross margin expansion year over year, but you saw the increase in our SG&A, as well reflecting that higher cost to serve. So I think you need to think about that as opposed to the bottom line. -- And even in some of the solutions area, Shannon, we have what I'll call commoditization pricing. So the pricing pressures in the solutions area has come down as well.Our next question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. -- Congrats on the quarter. I guess, first question. How do you know or how did you come to the conclusion that the revenue upside you're seeing is share gains versus just a stronger overall market, given that shrinking lead times and Win 10 upgrades and some of the workaround of aged infrastructure could just as well be a market phenomenon? Then I have a follow-up. -- Hi, Katy. Good to hear from you. I think when we look at the market share rate of growth, at least what we're looking at, and we take a look at how the company performed, we're fairly confident that across the board, we are actually taking share. I mean, when you look at server storage over 20% as an example and other areas relative to what we're seeing in the market, it feels like a fairly robust share gain to us. -- Yes. Katy, it's a Collin. I would say the market didn't feel any different than we thought three months ago. And just building on what Chris said, when you look at the areas where we really had a lot of strength, I'm talking high teens to 20% growth in Government, client device growth and Corporate, server storage and the data center, I just don't think the market's growing at that rate in those areas, and that we assign more of the overperformance to share versus the market. -- OK. That makes sense. And then how should we think about the $60 million to $70 million of earlier deal closings that showed up in the March quarter? Does that come out of the June quarter? And should we be modeling slower revenue growth in June as a result? Or are there other factors that come into play in June and backfill that pull-forward? -- Yes. I'll let Collin take the modeling, but those were really some transaction deals that were much accelerated. And so those come out of the year-to-go performance in our view, and we would not see them replaced. The flush from the lead time is something that's kind of a one-time impact.As a result, we wouldn't expect to see kind of replacement sales in the back end for that. -- Yes, Katy. The way I think about the $60 million to $70 million, and it is a combination of both Federal timing and the NetComm backlog flush. I would have expected the NetComm backlog flush to kind of play out over the course of the year. So some of that's in Q2.Some of it was in the back half of the year. Some of the Federal deal timing, those were things we thought were more likely to go in the second quarter that actually shift in the first. So I think it's a combination of Q2 and year to go. But if you look at the first half, second-half splits we gave, and obviously where Q1 came in, you can get our thoughts on Q2.Our next question's from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. -- I just wanted to start on EPS growth guidance for 2019. You went from roughly 10% to just above 10% and just beat the quarter in Q1 by over 10%. So I'm trying to figure why is there not more flow through. We just got off a competitor call, and they're experiencing similar trends.And is there an aspect of gross margin headwind from a pricing environment getting more tough as growth is more scarce as the year progresses? Is it more investments had increased opex conservatism after a strong Q1? Just any help with the buckets on why not more flow-through as the year progresses. -- Yes, Adam. It's Collin. I think a couple of things are going on. One is the timing impact.So obviously, the timing of the $60 million, $70 million, there's some EPS that goes along with that. Depending on where people were with consensus for the quarter and the year, it's somewhere around 12% to 13%. I think if you take a look at our thoughts on the full year, that would suggest we're flowing through somewhere between $0.08 to $0.11 of that. And so you can think about what's left over is primarily attributable to the timing.Generally speaking, we feel pretty consistent with how we -- about year to go as to how we felt three months ago. -- OK, that's helpful, Collin. And maybe just a question on cash flow. Now within the rule of thumb instead of above the rule of thumb, and the cash cycle's picking up, but maybe we got spoiled, but it's a change. So I'm trying to get more color on why the change.You just had the backlog flush. Are you investing in inventory to offset that flush as the year progresses? Any color would be helpful. -- Yes, sure. I think last quarter, we could have been a little bit clearer on our expectations for the full year. From a free cash flow generation perspective, we expected to be within the 3.75% to 4.25%. The above 4.25% was more of a statement around capital deployment and how we expect to use our cash.And we expect to return more than the 4.25%, and that was because we overdelivered cash flow last year relative to our expectations. So little bit of catch-up there on what I'll call the capital return to shareholders. So I'd say we continue to expect to be within the 3.75% to 4.25% this year. I do think it will be a little volatile as we move throughout the year if you look at our balance sheet.We are carrying some higher-than-normal inventory levels, but we're doing that to assist customers as we work through the supply constrained environment. So again, I think it could be a little bit bumpy from quarter to quarter, but as I look at the full year, I'd expect us to be within the 3.75% to 4.25%.Our next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. -- Just a couple of quick questions from me. One, just regarding your federal business, are you yet seeing any contributions from the senses contracts? And how should we think about how that rolls into the P&L this year? -- Yes, very little at this point, Matt. As we've mentioned in the quarter before, we expected to see 40 basis points of growth this year. We're still working through with the Senses, the timing of the various devices, etc. So we don't have any update to that yet, nothing different from that and just a little bit rolling right now. -- OK. And then regarding the Healthcare business, and you gave some really good examples of customer engagements there. You've had -- it looks like there were several years of very choppy business, and now you're four or five quarters into consistent mid to upper single-digit growth. Is that just a sign that the industry is finally making those investments and moving to sort of the digital world? Or are you also just gaining share within that market, given your skill sets? -- Yes. I think you've got insight well. It's a little bit of both. I think, number one, healthcare organizations, as you know well, when we were in the Affordable Care Act uncertainty world for a couple of years, our healthcare systems, which are the largest portion of our customers in that space, were concerned about their revenue sources.And that caused them to slow down on their spending, notwithstanding aging infrastructure, et cetera. So number one, you've got that off the table, Matt, not as front and center politically. It popped back up sometimes. But with that off the table and more certainty around income streams, the hospitals have decided to start spending And so that's the first part.The second part, to your point, is as they're spending, they're going through the same modernization assessment that many of our customers are, which is, how do we increase productivity? How do we improve customer experience? And that all requires data center modernization and more flexible architectures, etc. And so we're having those kinds of conversations. When we look at the growth rates in healthcare, we do feel confident that we are taking share on top of both of those trends.Our next question is from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. -- Yes. What was the organic growth in the quarter on a constant-currency basis ex Scalar? -- Yes. We didn't provide that, but we did share that Scalar performed in line with expectations. And previously, we said we expected Scalar to contribute about 100 basis points for the full year. So I think that will get you in a general ballpark. -- All right. And with the hardware increase, the 10% increase for the quarter, what was the growth in client devices? And are you seeing any signs of a slowdown there, keeping in mind, obviously, you have the difficult comps? But just wondering if there's any slowness beyond that. -- Yes. We grew client devices double digits in the quarter, and we continue to see healthy demand for client devices. Obviously, there's questions around supply availability, and we have some big overlaps coming up. So while we feel good about the client device business, I would expect the growth rate to moderate as we move throughout the year. -- And then finally, I'm wondering if there's been any change in the competitive landscape, specifically on the solution selling that you're gaining traction with. Are you seeing any emerging competitors there? -- Yes. I would say the -- a stable part of our business is that the competitive landscape is always changing. So you have different types of organizations who pop up on the landscape. We have organizations that we're used to competing with.It's just a heavily competitive environment. And that's just something we're used to. And we control what we can control and face it every day. So I wouldn't say more or less, it's just the continuing high competitive nature of what we do.Our next question's from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. -- Chris, I was hoping you could compare and contrast Scalar with the Kelway acquisition. Kelway has always provided, as I think several years, of revenue upside. And just help me comprise some of these long-terms expectations for what you see in the Canadian market. And then now with the Scalar acquisition, what is your market share in Canada compared with the U.S.? -- OK. Let me take that apart a little bit. I'll start with the back and move forward. The market share in Canada is fairly consistent with our U.S.market share and the U.K., somewhere in the 5% range of the whole market. With Scalar, that might increase it just a little bit. In terms of Scalar versus Kelway, they're highly consistent in the purpose of the acquisitions in terms of bringing value to our customers in areas where our customers had asked for that. So you will remember, international customers wanted less touch points across the globe, and that's what we brought them there; in Canada, customers looking for full suite of portfolio options from single providers across the spectrum of clients, transactions, solutions, et cetera, and also additional expertise in the areas of high-growth solutions, such as security, managed services, infrastructure, et cetera.So both consistent in that way. Differences would be that the U.K. -- CDW U.K. also brought us the capability to support customers across the globe.That's a different capability than we have up in Canada. Canada is not a hub for us supporting across the globe. So both of them are intended to be growth acquisitions. Both of them are not as focused on synergies, if you will.We will get operating synergies up in Canada as we scale that business, but these were not cost plays, they were growth plays intended to be highly consistent with our strategy of bringing more capabilities that our customers were telling us they wanted and needed. Does that help? -- It does. I appreciate that. Just a follow-up, and changing gears here on the government side. Talking about some of the businesses kind of brought forward or are you more a timing item? And does that really like reduce the Government's overall budgets for technology spend during the year? And does that perhaps free up your sales guys and your architect engineers throughout the opportunity to grow additional revenues just on top of that? So instead of just pulling forward the revenue, it just may be a gross add? -- Yes, it's a great question. I wouldn't think of it that way because many of these projects are multi-year projects. And as you know and we described and I know others described, these solutions projects can be very lumpy. Getting the timing of them exactly right is not necessarily easy.So some projects pull up to January, February, March, others that might have pushed into the back of the year from last year, frankly. So I wouldn't think about it as bringing up dollars, I would just think about it as shifting the timing and not freeing up sales time to work elsewhere because they're already working on projects that relate to deliveries later in the year.At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks. -- Thank you for joining us today and for your questions. As always, I want to especially thank all of our 9,400 CDW coworkers for their exceptional efforts and dedication to serving our customers each and every day. They are our true competitive advantage and the heart, soul and reason why we consistently deliver meaningful value to exceed our customers' needs and expectations.

With that, let me turn it back over to Chris. -- Thank you, Beth. Second-quarter results were excellent, with both strong top line growth and profitability. Consolidated net sales were $4.6 billion, up 10.6% above last year, 11.2% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 11.2% to $774 million.Non-GAAP operating income increased 10.7% to $358 million and non-GAAP net income per share increased 15.7% to $1.60 per share. These results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end market, our full suite of offerings that address customer priority across the IT landscape and ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. First, the balance across our customer end market. As you know, we have five years sales channels: corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education.Each of these channels are meaningful businesses generating annual sales of more than $1 billion. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end market, including K-12, higher ed, state and local government and Federal government. In addition, we have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered nearly $2 billion in 2018.These unique sales organizations serve us well when end markets behave differently from each other. Sometimes that occurs because markets are disrupted by macro or external challenges. Sometimes it occurs when customers' behavior differs due to different priorities. This quarter, our double-digit sales increase was driven by excellent results across all five of our U.S.channels, each growing high-single digits or better. U.S. customers remain focused on client devices to meet growing needs from full employment, as well as refresh driven by older equipment, new use cases and new security features. At the same time, customers continued to modernize their IT infrastructure and adopt more flexible architectures.The team did an outstanding job helping customers address these priorities. In corporate, the team delivered just under 9% growth as they successfully addressed ongoing demand for client devices while overlapping last year's strong results. The small business team continued to leverage end market specific offerings and dedicated solution specialists to deliver nearly 15% growth. The government team drove a 17% increase in sales.Federal had another excellent quarter with sales up more than 20%.The team leveraged our distribution centers to meet customer refresh needs and continued to deliver ongoing projects like the Navy CANES loading cloud initiative and newer cybersecurity-related initiatives as they lap the impact of last year's shipping delays. The state and local team delivered high single-digit growth as they helped customers refresh client devices. Education's 9% increase reflected low double-digit growth in K-12 and low single-digit growth in higher ed. K-12 delivered on networking needs and overcame chip constraints to meet ongoing refresh.Higher ed continued to leverage our broad portfolio to help campuses use technology to upgrade and enhance student and teacher experiences. Healthcare was up 14% as the team continued to drive excellent results, helping health systems improve end point access and security, as well as address medical records storage and accessibility needs. Other, which represents our Canadian and U.K. operation, increased 8% on a reported basis.Both markets faced challenging overlaps in local currency. Canadian growth was driven by both organic and Scalar performance. The U.K. team delivered excellent increases in software and services.But as expected, local currency growth slowed on top of last year's more than 25% growth and U.K. was flat year on year. Clearly, second-quarter results demonstrate the power of our balanced portfolio of customer end market. Second-quarter results also demonstrate the power of our second driver of performance, the breadth of our offering.With over 100,000 products, services and solutions for more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. U.S. transactions increased mid-teens, led by high-teen increases in client devices. U.S.Solutions increased mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in net comm hardware, which drove excellent increases in associated services and software. On a net sales basis, headwind increased 11%, software increased 5% and services increased 26%. Hardware performance was fueled by client devices and net comm, both up double digits. Lapping last year's supply constraints, net comm's growth was driven by data center modernization and campus refresh, including investments to support ongoing digital transformation initiatives.On the client side, the team did an exceptional job leveraging our unique ability to provide high-value services like preorders, configuration and staging in a supply constrained environment. Video also increased double digits. It's driven by both displays and digital signage. Performance was lumpy in data center hardware.Both enterprise storage and servers posted mid-single digit decline. Server performance was mixed across channels. Once again, hyperconverged infrastructure posted meaningful double-digit growth. Flash represented nearly one-third of total storage hardware in the quarter, with customer adoption aided by expanded offerings and improved economics.Software net sales increased 5%. As you know, software is becoming a larger component of IT solutions. Success helping customers adopt new technologies and infrastructure refresh drove double-digit growth in network management, storage management and operating system software. Cloud also contributed to this quarter's results with double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit.Growth was driven by productivity, collaboration, mobility and security workload. Services' 26% increase was led by professional services, warranties and configuration. And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making in our part strategy for growth, investments made to ensure we continue to serve our customers' IT needs in this evolving market, whether in a physical, virtual or cloud-based environment in the U.S. or internationally.Our three-part strategy for growth is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; then third, expand our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars work in tandem. Each is crucial to our ability to profitably deliver the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. The first pillar focuses on continuous productivity improvement.This is vital to our ability to achieve our overall strategy. Continuous productivity gains fuel our ability to invest while delivering profitable growth. A key way we do this is through disciplined sales management programs like category penetration goals and book management. Prescriptive programs don't work unless we have that talent in place to execute them.So for CDW, a key way we drive productivity is by hiring and retaining the right talent. This is more critical than ever in today's tight labor market. And we have several innovative programs in place to help ensure we continue to hire, develop and retain the best talent. Our sales residency program is a great example.Launched in November 2016, the program drives increased performance, both through engagement and enablement initiatives. Residency focuses on CDW account managers between five to 24 months' length of service. After completing four months in sales academy, residents are placed on their permanent sales team and assigned to a dedicated resident sales leader. The program includes mandatory formal training across multiple dimensions, all focused on building both technology and sales skills, with a focus on building solution skills early on our seller's career.Results have been excellent to date. Customer spend for residents within 13 to 24 months of service was 40% higher this quarter than in the second quarter of 2016. Solutions, as a percentage of total sales for account managers in the program, are 300 basis points higher than in 2016. At the same time, the attrition rate for account managers was zero to 24 months' length of service and declined nearly 25%.Of course, retaining the right coworkers requires hiring the right coworkers. In this competitive market, we are implementing innovative approaches to ensure we continue to attract targeted talent. We are currently piloting artificial intelligence solutions to identify top talent within an applicant pool. AI tools identify high-potential candidates by finding applicants with characteristics demonstrated by high-performing CDW sales professionals.When there is a high match, recruiters target the candidate for more intense activity. Our AI pilot build on other investments we are making to drive recruiting productivity. Combining texting software to stay in touch with applicants with our collaboration platform to conduct video interviews has helped us hire 35% more highly qualified and diverse candidates year over year. For our entry-level sales role, integrating video interviews into our process resulted in a 25% increase in the number of candidates screened.These are just a few handful of the ways we are investing to hire, train and retain talent. These investments, coupled with the strength of our value proposition, contribute to both seller and customer retention. At the end of the quarter, nearly 30% of our sellers had at least 10 years of CDW experience. Longer-tenured account managers have longer relationships with customers and that has a direct impact on sales.Customers with more than 20 years with us represented just under half of this quarter's spend. Clearly, our investment in our coworkers contribute to our profitable growth. Investments we have made to enhance our solutions and services capabilities, our second and third pillars, are also contributing to our profitable growth. These pillars are designed to ensure we remain relevant to our customers and to our partners.Our acquisition of Canadian solutions provider, Scalar, is a great example of our second and third pillars in action. Scalar has locations across Canada and bring strong capabilities in fast-growing areas like security, cloud, infrastructure and digital transformation, with deep services capabilities. Our investment thesis is straightforward with Scalar: accelerate our solutions capabilities and expand our geographic reach within Canada. Let me share an example of how we are already benefiting from Scalar's solutions expertise.A CDW Canada customer needed to upgrade their security environment. Key to the need was the desire to safeguard how they interacted with their clients. The customer had been with CDW Canada for some time, but we had limited success penetrating their solutions business. Knowing the breadth and scope of the Scalar portfolio, the CDW account manager brought Scalar in on the problem.Scalar's security services team did a deep dive with the customer and developed a comprehensive solution, which included hardware, software and services. The solution centered on a zero-trust security model that utilizes cloud-based firewall virtualization to protect both enterprise and customer-facing environments. Importantly, incorporating Scalar delivered implementation and training services into the solution meant deployment was fast. The solution generated more than CAD 500,000 in product sales and CAD 100,000 in services, great early proof point on the benefit of the technical and services investment made in Scalar.Cloud is another area where you see the benefit of our technical and services investment. Investments made in our cloud practice since its launch in 2011 have enabled the portfolio solutions that span the entire life cycle, from design, migration, integration, consumption management and managed services. Last quarter, we shared an example of how we helped a customer migrate an electronic medical records workload from the cloud back to on-prem solution. This quarter, let's take a look at an example of how our small business team helped a customer move a backup and recovery workload to the cloud.A small, rapidly growing global real estate support business housed their data on-site and needed a fail-safe backup solution with no downtime right away. The customer had a cloud-based pay-as-you-go subscription for test dev but did not have any ongoing cloud application. Their dedicated CDW small business account manager brought in one of our small business technical solutions advisors to help. After assessing the situation, the advisor identified that one of our prepackaged small business solutions bundles was well suited for the customer's need.The bundle included cloud-based recovery with design and migration services, a perfect fit for the customer's needs, including quick implementation. Packaging solutions with services is one of the ways our dedicated small business segment is making solutions more accessible for the customer and easier for the seller to sell. Prior to our investment in dedicated small businesses technical coworkers and development of small business-focused packaged solution, this solution would have required meaningful technical resources and investment of time that would not have met our threshold for profitable growth. Solving key business problems for our sweet spot of customers in today's environment requires the right talent and strong services and solutions capabilities.These capabilities, combined with our competitive advantage of scale, scope and disciplined execution, help drive sustainable profitable growth for us today and in the future. And that leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. Through the first half of the year, we have added approximately 165 customer-facing coworkers, excluding Scalar. We now expect to be at or modestly above the high end of the 125 to 175 full-year range previously shared.As we always do, we will monitor the market and adjust our plan as appropriate. Given first-half market performance, our current view of 2019 U.S. IT market growth remains in line with the expectations we shared last quarter of full year growth of roughly 3%. Reflecting our share gains to date, we now target constant currency organic growth between 400 and 475 basis points above the market.In addition, we continue to look for Scalar to contribute an incremental 100 basis points. As you can see, there's no meaningful change in how we feel about the balance of the year. We continue to expect ongoing but moderating strength in client devices and solid growth and solutions as we overlap last year's second half double-digit growth. The wild card we spoke about last quarter, like Brexit and tariffs, have pushed out but still exist.We'll keep a watchful eye and, as is our practice, update our view as we move through the year. In the meantime, the team will continue to what they do best, out-execute the competition and leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priority. Now let me turn it over to Collin. -- Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Chris indicated, our second-quarter results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business to build on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth and return cash to shareholders.Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.6 billion, up 10.6% on a reported basis and an average daily sales basis. In a constant carry average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 11.2%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 15.2% versus Q1 of 2019.This was modestly below historical seasonality, given the strength of the first quarter, which included the timing benefits from the net comm backlog flush in Federal but stronger than expected driven by one client device growth, which is very strong across the business, with most U.S. channels growing healthy double digits, notwithstanding uncertainty from tariffs and CPU constraints; and two, Public, where we had really strong growth across the three channels. Government was up 17%, even with the Federal timing shift into Q1. Education, where K-12 was up double digits.And healthcare, which was also up double digits. Gross profit for the quarter increased 11.2% to $774 million. Gross margin expanded 10 basis points, driven by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues, including warranties and software-as-a-service, partially offset by year-over-year net sales growth outpacing the year-over-year growth in partner funding. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9.Our non-GAAP SG&A, including advertising, increased 11.7%. The increase was primarily driven by sales compensation, which moves in line with gross profit growth, incremental Scalar expenses, performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals and investments in the business consistent with our Bold Forward strategy, including coworker count. Coworker count of 9,783 was up nearly 870 coworkers from June of 2018, with almost half of the year-over-year increase from Scalar and the remaining from organic coworker investments. Roughly two-thirds of the nearly 870 coworkers added year over year were in customer-facing roles.Non-GAAP operating income was $358 million, an increase of 10.7%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7%. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $41 million, up 8.7%.This was primarily driven by the interest rate caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to 2 three-eighths percent. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 24.7% in the quarter, which is flat compared to last year. This resulted in Q2 tax expense of $65 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation, which is shown on Slide 12.For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.6%, down 40 basis points compared to last year's 26% rate, primarily due to guidance issued by the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2018 on foreign taxes creditable against global intangible low-taxed income. As you can see on Slide 13, second-quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 148 million. GAAP net income per share was $1.33, up 17.9%. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects operating performance, was $238 million in the quarter, up 11.5% over last year.Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.60, up 15.7% from last year. Currency headwinds dampened non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth by approximately 70 basis points in the second quarter. Turning to first-half results on Slides 14 through 17, revenue was $8.6 billion, an increase of 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.1% on an average daily sales basis, as we had one fewer selling day in the first half of 2019. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales were 11% -- 11.8% higher than the prior year.Gross profit was $1.4 billion, up 11.3% and gross profit margin was 16.8%, up 10 basis points. Non-GAAP operating income was $646 million for the first half of 2019, up 10.7%. Net income was $350 million and non-GAAP net income was $423 million, up 12.5%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.84, up 16.8%.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 18. As of June 30th, cash and cash equivalents were $195 million and net debt was $3.1 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.2 billion. As shown on Slide 19, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during the quarter.Our three-month average cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down one day from last year's second quarter and slightly below the low end of our annual target range of high-teens to low 20s. Free cash flow year to date was $407 million compared to $188 million in the first half of 2018. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow primarily reflects higher cash profits and mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. For the quarter, we returned $198 million of cash to shareholders, which included $43 million of dividends and $155 million of share repurchases at an average price of nearly $104 per share.Turning to Slide 20. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through returns of capital and strategic investments. In order of priority, first, increase dividends annually. To guide these increases, in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years.For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.295 per share on September 10 to shareholders of record as of August 26, up 40% from a year ago. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with the targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5 to three times. We ended the quarter at two point three times, slightly below the low end of this range. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions.The acquisition of Scalar is a great example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Our capital allocation priorities support our updated 2019 outlook, which you can see on Slide 21. As Chris mentioned, we continue to expect U.S.IT market growth of approximately 3%. We now expect net sales growth of 400 to 475 basis points above U.S. IT market growth in constant currency on an organic basis. We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an additional approximately 100 basis points of growth on top of the 400 to 475 basis points.Currency is expected to represent a 60 basis point headwind for the full year, assuming year to go exchange rates of $1.20 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. Given year-to-date exchange rates, this implies currency headwinds of roughly 60 basis points in the second half of 2019, with headwinds in the fourth quarter expected to be slightly greater than the third quarter. We expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2019. We now expect non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth on a constant currency basis to be in the low-teens, call it 13%, plus or minus, 50 basis points.This range is 150 basis points above our previous constant currency range of 11 to 12%. Currency headwinds are projected to shave approximately 60 basis points from the constant currency rate. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering financial targets on an annual basis. Slide 22 provides additional modeling thoughts.Based on first-half results and the expectations for the rest of the year, we look for sales in the second half to now be roughly 100 basis points lower than our historical sales, seasonality split of approximately 52% in the second half. We expect a low single-digit increase in sequential average daily sales from Q2 to Q3, which will be a couple hundred basis points below the 3% average of the past three years. Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range.Total annual depreciation and amortization is now expected to be in the range of 265 to $270 million. This includes approximately $180 million of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, including a preliminary estimate for Scalar that could change slightly once the purchase accounting is final. Depreciation and amortization expense in SG&A, excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, is expected to be in the range of 80 to $85 million. Equity-based compensation is expected to be approximately 5 to $7 million higher than 2018.Interest expense is expected to be in the range of 165 to $167 million, with a year-over-year growth driven primarily by the caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to two and three-eighths percent. Our 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be near the lower end of the 25.5 to 26.5% range. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth approximately 350 to 400 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth is expected to have currency headwind of 60 basis points, similar to the top line.Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 23. Our free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged to three and three-quarters to four and four-quarters percent of sales. Expectations for capital expenditures, excluding the census, remain unchanged: It's slightly more than 0.5 point of sales. We expect the cash tax rate to be slightly below 25.5% of pre-tax income adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.We expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within the annual target range of high-teens to low 20s. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Joel to open it up to questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up.Thank you.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. -- Thank you. I wanted to start off in the broader demand environment. So you're continuing to see healthy double-digit growth, but some of your vendor partners are starting to see a little bit of softness, particularly on more solutions-oriented categories. So I guess just wondering if you can talk a little about what you're hearing from your customer base in terms of their budget plans and just what you think may be driving that disconnect. -- Yeah. Matt, look, our -- we're in conversations with our customers. They're still feeling bullish and they're still looking to expand. When you think about our customer base and take a step back and think about some of the exposure that others have that we don't have, things like China, things like consumer, certain other end markets, hyper-scalar is another example, but that are more challenged, that's not what our customer base is facing.And so we've got a broad portfolio, as you know, and we can help our customers wherever their IT priorities are. The other thing I would just say is that in an environment like this, where the economy feels pretty strong and customer sentiment remains strong in our view, our competitive advantages allow us to drive an even bigger share gain and as we -- things like leverage our scale in our distribution centers, as I mentioned. So look, the outlook for the rest of the year is pretty consistent in our view with how we felt at the beginning of the year. Not a lot of data points out there that has given us any reason to foresee it differently.If you look at, as you said, peer results, competitive results, the VAR survey, CIO surveys, economic data, they're stuff that's kind of winding up on both sides of the ledger. And net-net, we still see a 3% market rate of growth and pretty healthy demand from our customers. -- Got it. And then the government was a standout vertical for you in the quarter. Just wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into what drove the strength there and just how we should think about the sustainability of it going forward. -- Yeah. Federal is doing a terrific job across refresh of those agencies that didn't -- were mandated to refresh under the Department of Defense. So we're seeing refresh now in agencies that didn't have that mandate and that's been strong. \u00a0But what I'd really say about the Federal team is they have focused their go-to-market investments over the past several years on solutions capabilities and we're seeing that come to fruition in the types of transactions that they are working on.So if you look at this quarter, they are driving strong results across not just refresh but strategic solutions transactions for cybersecurity, for modernization infrastructure, etc. So -- and those are deals that take a long time to develop and, looking at the pipeline, continue to remain strong. So then we got the go-to-market in place to go after those deals. They've got the trust with the customer that takes a long time to develop.We've got the technology and support to be able to help them with that and expand those. And the other thing that they're doing is they're creating really strong point -- proof of concepts for certain agencies that we're finding we're now able to take that proof of concept and transport them to other agencies that are looking at similar types of problems they're trying to attack, and we have credibility to build it for a different agency.And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Thanks, good morning guys two questions for me as well. I guess first one, if I might try to -- I think your share gains have been in the neighborhood of about 600 basis points in the first half of the year. And that's much better than the historical trend line you've typically talked about. So I'm wondering if you could maybe just touch on what are the levers that are enabling this outsized share gain growth rate in the first half.And what elements of that might be sustainable versus not as you go forward? -- Well, I'll start with that. When you think about order of the year, remember in the first quarter that we wouldn't expect to see repeat in the back half of the year. Certainly, we had a pull forward with some Federal deals, but Federal is doing a really good job. But at the end of the day, when you think about client devices, when you think about that continuing to be strong but moderating, we think about solutions continuing to be solid.But we're also looking at really tough overlaps, Amit. So if you look at the last year, we've got a number of our businesses and practice areas comping double digit on double digit. And so we're quite attuned to that when we think about the back half of the year. -- Got it. That's fair. And then I guess when I think of the gross margins, is there a way for us to think about how much of the benefit you're getting on a year-over-year basis are perhaps from increasing contribution from reoccurring business stream, the revenue streams on a year-over-year basis? And then I guess broadly, is there a way to think about what percent of your gross profit dollars today are recurring in nature and what the trend line of growth rates look like? -- Yeah. I'll start now, but I can't talk a little bit more about the accounting rules. But at a high level, what I would say is the accounting rules for where we sit in the channel are really specific, they're complicated and there's not a one-size-fits-all. So where we sit in as a service and how that's recognized is complicated.What I would say and what's really important is that as our customers are having conversations about transactional, on-prem as a service, other consumption models, we're agnostic to that. So we're having the conversations with them and we're advising them along the way in terms of assessing, designing, implementing, consuming, managing, etc. How that reflects in our financial statement, I'll let Collin talk through. But it's important to recognize that we are part of those conversation and driving -- as our partner's business models change, we are driving what it is that they are bringing to market and bringing to bear with our customers. -- Yeah. Amit, I would say we're traditional pure subscription recurring revenue is still a relatively small percentage of our business. If you look at the amount of revenue that we're recognizing that's booked over time rather than upfront or at a point in time, it's probably around 3% of sales. What I would say, though, is because of the accounting that Chris mentioned, and again, how we participate in this ecosystem, if you look at the percentage of our gross profit that is netted down, it was about 28% in the quarter.So a lot of those things that are getting netted down or things that have a finite term, we're selling a warranty, we're selling software-as-a-service \u2013 software as a service, etc, etc. So I think that can give you some idea of the magnitude of what's flowing through our gross profit in some of those transactional streams. -- Thanks a lot. The rest of the quarter guys.And our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. -- Thank you, good morning. As you highlighted, free cash flow has doubled in the first half of the year. And if you look at historical first-half versus second-half seasonality, it would put you potentially well above the target range for the full year. Can you just talk about what is maybe driving the better first-half seasonality and what might slow free cash flow in the back half of the year? -- Yeah. Sure, Katy. You're right. Q2 is typically a seasonally low free cash flow quarter for us because sales grow sequentially, and we have two tax payments we have to make.This year was unusual. I would say the stars aligned for us from a vendor mix perspective. And that's really what drove the free cash flow favorability in the quarter. I'd expect that will normalize as we move into the back half of the year.We expect us to be within our three and three-quarters and four and four-quarters percent of sales rule of thumb for the full year. -- And then Microsoft expressed the view that Windows 10 upgrades will continue past the January 2020 support expiration, especially for the small and medium business market where you have exposure. Do you tend to agree that you'll continue to see the upgrade cycle in 2020? Or do you think that it's difficult to continue growing the client segment as you annualize the comps from this year? -- Katy, it's Chris. I think it's not unreasonable to think that we will continue to see some of that spill into 2020 into the first quarter, for example, and maybe a little bit beyond. What that looks like over the course of all of 2020, it's hard to predict. But certainly, some of it is going into the front half of the year.And our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open. -- OK, thanks and good morning. I just have two related strategic questions, Chris. In the past, you mentioned being open to a large acquisition I think over $1 billion. On your slides, Scalar is an example and obviously of M&A and is much more smaller than this.So the first question is just kind of update on your thoughts related to executing M&A over 1 billion. I just mentioned this particularly in light of one of your largest competitors making a sizable transaction recently. That deal was arguably more financial transaction where sizable cost synergies could drive it below five times EBITDA, which kind of leads me to my second question. It sounds like CDW's focus is more on capabilities.So just wanted to understand the thought of not pursuing something like an Insight PCM given it would be significantly accretive based on where CDW trades relative to others. -- Yeah. Thanks, Adam. Great question. Yeah, we're still focused on M&A.I think if you look at our track record, Kelway and even the early proof points with Scalar, our discipline around the right target and then our methodical approach to integrating and our focus on getting it right for the customer right off the bat and empowering our coworkers to deliver for the joint customers is leading and has led to really positive success. So the model is working. We are in the market. We're looking constantly.We are proactive. We tend not to be reactive, as you know. But yes, the way we think about it from a strategy perspective is kind of pretty straightforward. two things: Expand our solutions capabilities or extend our services capabilities.Those two things, plus geo expansion, that's essentially how we think about M&A. As far as the notion of a large kind of more financial play, look, we have to look hard -- long and hard at that because of the difficulty of integrating an organization. As I know you know, we take that very seriously. That's why cultural fit leadership is so important when we kick through the things that matter.So that's something we just have to take a look at. But we're really focusing on the capabilities and geographic reach always in the market, but it's got to make sense. -- OK. Maybe just the quick clarification for Collin on financing for an acquisition. I mean is there a scenario where it might make sense to use equity on a larger transaction? Stock valuation is quite healthy and it would still be accretive. -- Yeah. Adam, given where we sit with our leverage profile, we're at two point three times, below the two and a half to three times. I think that gives us plenty of headroom. And if we had to go above that three times and temporarily step out of that range, I think our investors and our rating agencies would give us the flexibility or latitude to do that as long as we showed a clear path of deleveraging in a reasonable amount of time and getting back with them a target range.We've demonstrated throughout our past that if we set a leveraged target, we'll get there. So I think our preference would be to use leverage, but obviously, it will be dependent on the situation. -- Makes sense. And then congrats on the continued strong results.And our next question comes from Param Singh with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. -- Hi, good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to get a sense of your productivity here. If I just look at sales per coworker, it was growing at 1% year over year this quarter, which is a slowdown from the last year quarters. Is that because you've had incremental coworkers coming in from Scalar that you need to integrate and get up on productivity? Or is there another reason behind that? And do you think the addition of coworkers is why you're outperforming your competitors? And then I have a follow-up. -- Param, welcome to the call. Glad you could join. Yes, I would say a couple of things that are driving that. One is Scalar because of the high services mix and the service delivery coworkers that go along with it.The sales per coworker productivity is incomparable to CDW given the different business mix. Also we're in the summer, so there's a little bit of seasonality where we bring in a lot of interns. The summer in this year, we brought in more than the prior year, so that's impacting it. But I think if you look at kind of apples-to-apples organic regular CDW coworkers, you would see productivity levels more in line with historical levels. -- Understood. And then I mean just specifically on the educational segment. It was much stronger in seasonality than you've typically seen in prior years. Is it because the March quarter was weaker in education? Or were there additional wins in the quarter? And would you expect that to persist? -- Yeah. I would describe the K-12 as a really strong quarter. And when you think about the constraints in the marketplace around client devices and the summer months being very important for education to buy and implement those devices, we had a couple of things going on. First, the constraints were more severe in K-12 because of Chromebook and where the Intel place their priority around higher-performing chips.So the team did a really extraordinary job of working with customers, working with our partners around what the options are, when to get things in, etc. And we're able to deliver over the summer months, which is really, really quite impressive. In addition, we've seen some networking positivity. And when you think about e-rate and where that falls throughout the -- any given quarter, it's really bumpy.It never falls in the same quarter, it seems to be, because of some lag or some paperwork issue. But we did see some growth under the e-rate program this quarter as well. So I would just say an all-in-all solid quarter doing -- executing on the priorities that we typically execute on. -- All right. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.And our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Yeah, thanks and good morning. So a question regarding your commentary on U.K. and EMEA region and a somewhat slower growth. Could you give us more color on what you're seeing? Obviously there's some economic concerns across Europe, but we're still obviously in an upgrade cycle from a corporate standpoint.So any help there would be great. -- Yeah. Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. And obviously, we watch it closely.First, I would say that the team has been executing extremely well. When you look at the overlap, double digit on double digit, we're talking meaningful. Last year plus 30%, the year before high double digits. They're executing well.That said, I would say a couple of things. First, the market outside of the U.S. probably feels marginally a little softer, a little more uncertain than it does in the U.S. and we're watching that.We haven't seen in Q2 a different buying behavior from our customers. But you got to believe Brexit is on their mind given that it's 90 days away. And we've got new rhetoric and some new leadership in play. So it's hard to believe that it's not on their mind.But that said, I'll tell you, our referral business continues to be very healthy. Our international, meaning rest of world business outside the U.K. continues to be very healthy. And the team continues to be optimistic in terms of their conversations around customers.So look, with the wild card of Brexit looming, we are just being very cautious. The good news is we've run this tabletop before, before the October 31 extension. Earlier in the year, we worked with customers to map their needs so that we would be prepared to help them. And we've also opened that office in the the Netherlands.And we've got a number customers actually there transacting through the Netherlands. So we're getting more and more confident with our ability to deliver to the same service level agreement. So we're doing everything we can to be prepared. But we can't control what happens in the environments.And we'll just keep, I think, out-executing as the team has been doing. -- OK. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question regarding your census contract. Can you give us an update there in terms of contribution relative to expectations? -- Yeah. Well, census is going well. Contribution relative to expectations hasn't changed. We still expect 40 basis points of revenue growth as a result of census.I would give a shout-out to the team. It's a lot of hard work, a lot of collaboration, not just at CDW but with a number of partners as well. And again, think about the number of devices that we have running through our configuration center at the same time that we've got K-12 busy season. We've got inventory in there under constrained condition, and we're really doing a great job of getting it in and moving it out.So 40 basis points for the year, so far, so good. -- OK. Thanks so much.And our next question comes from Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Yeah, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to touch on a couple of subjects. First up on the client device front. To what extent do you see customers sweating the asset beyond the Windows 10 upgrade dates? And is that yielding a service opportunity for you? -- Yeah. Thanks for the question. We have seen a number of customers -- a very large number of customers now converting to Win 10. And so I don't know that I would see that as an opportunity that there's going to be a number of customers sweating the assets after this conversion.It just doesn't feel that way with the activity we've seen with current customers, what we're hearing from Microsoft, etc. It doesn't feel like the market is going that way. -- Got it. And then Chris, just on this point of Europe, a massive play now but still small in the context of the overall market because there's obviously a huge opportunity to scale up. But I'm wondering whether you think there's a limitation to how far you can go given how important the sales culture is and it's maintaining its integrity? Do you see a natural limitation to the growth? -- Yeah. It's a spot-on question because that sales culture is so important to an acquisition working. I can tell you that we have looked at a number of players. This is a constant rhythm for us, which is meeting with and talking to people.And it's very clear that there are some organizations out there where there's not a fit. But equally, there are organizations where we feel culturally, particularly on the sales side, they could be a really good fit. So, is there a natural limitation? Sure, there is because organizations are all different, but we think that is not impair our ability to solution or a good expansion path at all.And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. -- Good morning. Thanks for the opportunity. Chris, your client devices have been strong for the better part of two years now and it's still Windows 10 refresh or if it's out on full deployment. I kind of feel like it's even more difficult to grow on top of that just because two years into it.Is there a concern or perception that client devices will be slowing down? Or do you still see an opportunity for that to grow? And if so, how? -- Yeah. No, we definitely -- when we look at client device and when we look at the compares over the last couple of years in the quarter, it's going to be tough to grow at those kinds of rate. So we wouldn't expect it. We would expect our client device growth to be at a more muted rate yet healthy because we do have customers who continue to -- who are new refresh cycles frankly or continuing to expand their use of client devices for different things, new use cases, etc.But certainly, we are facing a very difficult comparisons, and we expect that growth to moderate. -- Gotcha. And then if I could ask a more strategic question, following up on the question before regarding acquisitions. Is there a certain area of capabilities that you'd love to be able to either grow internally or to acquire? And same front, geographically -- certain geographic areas that you're more targeted toward expansion than others? -- Yeah. I think when you think about capability, it would be the same area that we frequently talk about. Scalar is a great example. Infrastructure, security, managed services, digital transmission, those are all areas where, when you think about bolstering our current capability, areas we'd look at.In terms of geographic, that's really driven primarily from what -- where our current customers have needs, and that's in our strategy all along. So we look at our U.K. U.S., Canadian customers and where the pipeline is growing and where they're telling us they really could use some help. And there certainly are some places on the continent that makes sense, but there are some places in other areas of the world that make equal sense.And at the same time, we do have smaller presence in a variety of locations. Dubai, for example, in Asia and Singapore and Hong Kong. And we're also focused on bolstering those to ensure that we can deliver on the current needs that our U.K. multinational team have. -- Great. Thank you.I'm not showing any questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks. -- Well, thank you. And let me close by once again thanking our 9,800 coworkers around the globe for their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. They are our true competitive advantage and the heart, soul and reason why we consistently deliver value to exceed our customers' needs and expectations. They are the reason we have and will continue to lead the industry.Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve and repeatedly earn your trust, and thank you for your continued interest in CDW. I also want to send a shout-out to Gary Woodland, winner of this year's U.S. Open Championship. CDW is the official technology partner to the PGA Tour.And Gary has been a terrific CDW technology ambassador since 2014. Gary, we couldn't be more thrilled for you. With that, I'd like to say thanks again. And Collin and I look forward to talking to you next quarter.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Shares have added about 1.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CDW due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen  in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.CDW's fourth-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share surged 34.4% year over year to $1.32 and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20.Solid growth in earnings was driven by a strong economy, healthy employment and a lower tax rate. However, currency headwinds affected earnings growth by 40 basis points (bps).Revenues for the reported quarter came in at $4.08 billion, marking a year-over-year rise of 8.6% and also topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.03 million. Moreover, revenues were up 9% at constant currency (cc).The company's balanced portfolio of customer end-markets, the breadth of its product and solutions pipeline and ongoing execution of its three-part strategy are key growth drivers. However, the currency moved to a headwind of 40 bps in the fourth quarter from a tailwind of 70 bps in the year-ago period.CDW's Corporate's net sales of $1.8 billion registered nearly 14.8% growth on a year-over-year basis. This upside was driven by significant customer demand for client devices, which was backed by strong economic growth and optimal employment levels. During the quarter under review, client devices increased more than 25%. Moreover, double-digit digit growth in Corporate solution sales was a tailwind. Server, storage and NetComm were key growth analysts.Small Business segment's net sales of $363 million increased 17.7% year over year. Sales growth was primarily driven by double-digit growth in transactions and solutions.Coming to Public segment, net sales of $1.4 billion dipped 0.8% from the year-earlier quarter as revenues from Government decreased 11.9% to $546 million with federal service revenues declining in the high-teens. The tough year-over-year comparison that the company has been persistently facing due to the Department of Defense's Windows 10 upgrade in the prior year is a dampener. However, Education sales rose 7.6% to $425 million and net sales to Healthcare customers climbed 7.8% to $443.2 million.Net sales in Other ascended 10.3% to $461.7 million. Other segment comprises the outcomes of the company's Canadian and UK operations. U.K. was up by high teens, driven by strong customer demand for both datacenter and client devices. Canada rose in high single-digits with solutions growth continuing to outpace that of transactions.Moreover, CDW witnessed strong growth across hardware, software and services. Both hardware and software augmented 8% each while Services jumped more than 20%.CDW's gross profit of $694 million increased 13.1% on a year-over-year basis. However, gross margin of 17% expanded 60 basis points (bps) year over year, backed by mix of software-as-a-service, warranties, commission revenues and also product margin.The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $323 million, which improved 8.8% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat year over year at 7.9%.CDW exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $205.8 million compared with $255.1 million at the end of the earlier reported quarter.The company has a long-term debt of $3.18 billion.It generated $905.9 million of cash flow from operational activities during 2018. Free cash flow was $752 million during the same time frame.Last year, the company returned $660 million of cash to shareholders including $139 million o  and $522 million of share repurchases.The company also announced that the board has ramped up share repurchase authorization by $1 billion and cleared 40 cents hike over last year's dividend.CDW anticipates 2019 revenues to grow 200-300 bps more than U.S. IT market's expected growth estimate of 3%. The acquisition of Scalar is envisioned to contribute 100 bps additionally.For 2019, non-GAAP operating income margin is projected in the mid 7% range. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth rate at constant currency is predicted to be 10%. Currency headwind of 60 bps is likely to be an overhang on both revenues and EPS.Fresh estimates followed a downward path over the past two months.At this time, CDW has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.CDW has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Please note that all references to growth rates or dollar amount increases in our remarks today are versus the comparable period in 2017 unless otherwise indicated. In addition, all references to growth rates for hardware, software, and services today represent US net sales only and do not include the results from CDW UK or Canada. Also note that all of 2018 and 2017 net sales amounts are reported under accounting standard ASC 606. The number of selling days were the same for both of the fourth quarter and year-to-date in 2018 and the 2017. All sales growth rate references during the call will use average daily sales unless otherwise indicated.Replay of this webcast will be posted to our website later today, approximately 90 minutes. I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company.With that let me turn the call back over to Chris. -- Thank you Beth. It's a pleasure to discuss CDW's results and the strategic progress with you today. I'm pleased to report that CDW posted another excellent quarter with strong sales and profitability. Fourth quarter results include an 8.6% increase in average daily sales with net sales of $4.1 billion, up 9% in constant currency, an 8.8% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $323 million and a 34.4% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.32. The strong performance contributed to an excellent 2018.For the year, we delivered 9.5% net sales growth with $16.2 billion of net sales, 9.8% adjusted EBITDA growth and 35.1% to non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth. Our ability to deliver the strong fourth quarter and full year performance was the result of three key drivers; a balanced portfolio of customer end markets; the breadth of our products and solutions portfolio; and our ongoing execution against our third-part strategy.Let's take a look at how each of these drivers helped to deliver profitable growth. First, our balance portfolio of customer-end market. As you know, we have five US channels; corporate, which serves customers with co-workers from roughly 250 and up; small business, which serves customers with roughly 20 to 250 co-workers; and healthcare government and education. Within each channel, we have teams further focused on customer end markets and verticals. For example, in government we have several teams focused on serving the Department of Defense and across the billing agencies as well as state and local teams. Each of our US channels generated more than $1.3 billion of net sales in 2018. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered nearly $1.9 billion of net sales in 2018. Our customer end market often at counter-cyclically given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each one. You see the benefit of our diverse customer end market in our fourth quarter results where four of our five channels as well as the UK and Canadian local market increased high-single digits or better.Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter performance. Our corporate team delivered a 15% increase in net sales, strengthening economy with healthy employment continuing to create a significant customer demand for client devices. Our unique ability to meet these needs through a client device growth of over 25% in the quarter. This was on top of last year's high-teens growth. Client devices and video contributed to excellent double-digit transactional growth. At the same time, we continue to leverage our technical capabilities with strong solutions portfolio to help customers modernize their IT infrastructures and adopt more flexible architectures. This drove double-digit solutions growth. Server, Storage and Netcomm were the leading growth categories in Corporate.Small Business delivered an 18% increase. Customers remained optimistic about the economy and their businesses. This clearly impacted their buying this quarter. At the same time, we continue to benefit from the focus we created with a stand-alone segment and investments made in our go-to-market approach. The team delivered double-digit growth in both transactions and solutions. Within Solutions, Netcomm was strong as we helped customers realize the benefits of more flexible architectures.Public high single-digit increases in Healthcare and Education were offset by government which was down 12%. Solid growth in solutions across public drove a mid-teens increase in gross profit. Our government channel results reflect a high-teens decrease in Federal. As we've discussed, the team faced strong comparisons throughout the year as a result of their success in 2017 leading Department of Defense demand for Win 10 devices which had a significant ramp in the fourth quarter of 2017.The federal team once again delivered excellent solutions performance this quarter with growth of over 20% as they helped customers with continuing priorities around modernizing infrastructure and cyber-security. The government shutdown did not have a meaningful impact on our fourth quarter results. State and Local was down low-single digits. The team drove strong growth in software-as-a-service and services supporting infrastructure projects. Both of these moderate top line growth as Software as a Service and certain services are accounted for on a netted down basis. Education increased 8%. K-12 was up mid-single digits, posting a solid quarter on the heels of strong growth in Chromebooks in the third quarter of last year.Our ability to convert demand for client devices drove mid-teens growth. This growth was partially offset by declines in networking which we expected given timing of E-Rate funding letters in Q4 of 2017 versus Q3 of 2018. Higher Education had strong growth in the quarter, up low double-digit. Creating Connected Campus in a secure IT environment remain top priorities for higher Education customers. Success addressing these priorities through solutions to grow nearly twice as fast as transactions, which were up high-single digits. Solutions growth was driven by meaningful increases in Netcomm and security.Healthcare was up nearly 8% as we helped customers modernize their infrastructure to streamline operations and enhance patient experience. This drove solutions growth of over 20% in the quarter. Our international teams continue to deliver strong growth with combined sales up over 10% in US dollars. In local currency, the UK was up high-teens and Canada was up high-single digits. In Canada, solutions growth continue to outpace transactions, benefiting from investments we've made in technical capabilities. Our recently announced acquisition of Scalar Decisions Inc. which I'll speak to in a moment supports our strategic focus and efforts to expand our solutions capabilities. In the UK, we captured strong customer demand for both data center and client devices which drove excellent growth in the quarter. As in the US, customers are evaluating hybrid solutions with interest in both on-premise and cloud-based offerings. US to UK referrals were again up significantly.To-date, we have not seen an impact on-demand from Brexit. We have implemented the contingency plans I mentioned last quarter to address the event agreement of transition plan is not in place by the end of March. We've established a presence on the continent so that we continue to support customers with similar service levels and minimal disruption. This is an action we would've taken anyway given CDW UK success to-date and future growth opportunities supporting our customers with IT needs in the EU. Our results also demonstrate the power of the second driver of performance, our broad portfolio of more than 100,000 products and solutions for more than 1,000 leading and emerging partners.Fourth quarter performance was strong across hardware, software, and services. Hardware and software both increased nearly 8% and services grew in excess of 20%. Solutions grew faster than transactions. We've talked before about the longer sales cycle and the lumpiness of solutions and in this quarter, we saw the positive impact of solutions projects coming to fruition across many of our end markets. In transactions, we continue to capture our share with client device sales up high-single digits on top of last year's growth of more than 20%. Our teams were able to manage through supply constraints in the quarter by leveraging our competitive advantage of scale and use of our distribution centers. In certain products, we did see extended lead times and positive dislocation but we were generally able to meet the customer demand.Hardware solutions growth reflected customers executing on data center and networking projects, driven by the strength and confidence in the economy and each replace aged infrastructure and the desire to take advantage of more efficient and flexible architectures, both on-premise and cloud-based. Results also reflect investments we have made in technical resources. Servers, enterprise storage and the Netcomm all increased double-digit. New architectures are also driving software performance as it becomes a larger component of IT solutions. You can clearly see that in our performance this quarter.Software net sales increased nearly 8% while gross profit increased high-teens. Our top three software growth categories were network management, storage management and security software. Services increased more than 20%, led by professional services, warranties and other services provided to help customers implement integrated solutions. Our ability to provide cloud solutions to customers also contributed to this quarter's strong results. We drove robust double-digit increases in customer spend in gross profit, led by productivity, platform, collaboration, and security workload.Fourth quarter gross margin expanded 60 basis points year-over-year driven by mix. This reflected strong growth in netted down revenue including cloud, software, and services as well as solutions hardware. As you can see, 2018 was a year of excellent financial performance. It was also a year of continued strategic progress, which is the third driver of our performance. For CDW, our strategy starts with our customers. What do they need, how were they evolving and how can we evolve with them to meet their needs. Our customers know that taking advantage of all the productivity and growth benefits that integrated technology solutions can provide is critical for them to achieve their strategic objective, but given limited IT resources and the ever increasing pace of technology change, customers must evaluate their allocation of resources and they needed help making technology decisions, implementing solutions and then managing their technology investments. Our three-part strategy is designed to make sure that customers turn to us for the help they need to make the right decisions for their businesses. Our three-part strategy for growth is to first first acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars intercept with each other. Each enhances our ability to profitably deliver the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future.The first pillar focuses on productivity improvement. We do this through enhanced systems and data, sales productivity initiatives and investments in our brand and marketing. This underpins our ability to achieve our overall strategy. Productivity gains fuel our ability to invest while delivering profitable growth. The second pillar ensures we stay relevant to our customers and to our partners by investing in solutions capabilities that enable us to be that trusted partner for our customers. And our third pillar ensures we have the value-added services capability to deliver many of today's integrated end-to-end solutions. The combination of these three interconnected pillars with our scale and scope creates a powerful differentiation in the market.Let me share a few examples of our strategy and action. The first example is the solution we are bringing to the US Census Bureau. Our services capabilities were one of the key reasons we won the award to provide a Device as a Service Solution for the 2020 US Census, but it was a combination of our service and logistics capabilities with our broad product portfolio and deep partner relationship that enabled the win. We were uniquely positioned to handle the provision of mobile devices and accessories, custom device configuration, wireless services deployment, and secure asset management along with help desk and field support for an end-to-end solution to the field technology required to support this once every 10-year event. We're working closely with the Census Bureau on timing and expect to be in deploying devices into the field later this year. The second example is our acquisition of the Canadian solutions provider, Scalar which closed on February 1st. Scalar brings strong capability in areas such as security, cloud, infrastructure, and digital transformation. Scalar also expands our in-market presence with locations across Canada. Scalar has strong local relationships in nearly 350 co-workers that add deep technical expertise. With little overlap between our customers and theirs, we intend to grow our combined customer relationships and add new dimensions to the work we're already doing for them. And similar to CDW UK, we see a strong cultural fit and customer approach. And like CDW UK, we expect to drive a smart and successful integration.The final example I wanted to share demonstrates how our ability to deliver integrated solutions helps customers to achieve their strategic objectives. Leveraging technology to provide an outstanding customer experience both in-store and online is a competitive imperative for retailers today. While straightforward to articulate, it is extremely complex to cost-effectively and seamlessly deliver an end-to-end solution. We're helping our large retailers do just that through our design and implementation of hyper-converged solutions that will deliver increased performance to pass the availability of the IT infrastructure supporting their 200 stores. This modernized infrastructure will enable them to better serve their customers throughout the shopping experience from checking the availability of a product to picking up online orders to checking out at the store.Clearly, the execution of our three-part strategy contributed to 2018's excellent performance. In addition, our earnings growth benefited from a strong economy, healthy employment and a lower tax rate. We currently and that leads me to our expectations for growth for 2019. We currently expect the US IT market to grow approximately 3%. We expect topline performance to be between 200 basis points to 300 basis points better than the US IT market in constant currency on an organic basis. This excludes the incremental sales growth from the Scalar acquisition. Given our outlook in the market, we currently plan to add between 125 to 175 customer-facing co-workers on top of the approximately 165 added in 2018. For 2019, we expect non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth of approximately 10% on a constant-currency basis with capital allocation contributing to the amplification of operating earnings.To close, I feel good about where we stand today for several reasons. First we have confidence in our strategy, a strategy that positions us for strong growth serves us well when confronted with macro channel or partner challenges and leverages our competitive advantages to deliver strong profitability and cash flow. This confidence in our strategy has led our board to increase our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion and to declare a $0. 40 increase over last year's dividend. Second, the team is executing well against our strategy and we are committed to remaining focused on execution to drive our performance versus the market and strong financial results. Finally, activity in the business feels healthy. Of course, we are mindful of the uncertainty regarding another government shutdown, product availability, Brexit and tariff, we can't control these things, so we will do what we always do. Regardless of the potential outcomes and the impact on IT demand, we will focus on what we can control and hold ourselves accountable to out-growing market. As we always do we will update our views of market growth and hiring as we move through the year.With that let me turn it over to Collin. -- Thank you Chris. Good morning everyone. We delivered another quarter and full year of results consistent with our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow deliver sustained profitable growth and return capital to shareholders. Before I begin I'd like to remind you our results reflected the adoption of ASC 606, providing an apples-to-apples comparison for 2017 and 2018.Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on slide 10. Consolidated net sales were $4.1 billion, an increase of 8.6% on a reported and average daily sales basis compared to last year. In constant currency, consolidated net sales grew 9%. Currency had a 110 basis point swing, moving to a headwind of 40 basis points in Q4 of 2018 from a tailwind of 70 basis points in Q4 2017. As expected, our sequential average daily sales decline of 6.8% was greater than historical seasonality, given the strength in the third quarter. Gross profit for the quarter increased 13.1% to $694 million. Gross margin expanded 60 basis points, driven by mixing into netted down revenues including software-as-a-service, warranties, commission revenue, and other services and product margin which benefited from the strength in solution categories as well as the overlap of client devices shipped to the Department of Defense last year.Turning to SG&A on slide 11. Our adjusted SG&A including advertising increased more than sales. The 17.1% increase was driven by three factors; increased sales compensation which is directly tied to gross profit growth, performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals and the balance of the strategic investments we announced at the beginning of 2018, which were funded by Tax Reform. Our co-worker count of 9,019 was up nearly 300 from the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $323 million, an increase of 8.8% compared to last year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.9%.Reflected on slide 12, interest expense was $37 million, flat compared to the prior year quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate included on slide 13 for the quarter was 22.9% compared to an effective tax rate of negative 5.8% last year. This resulted in Q4 expense of $47 million versus an $11 million benefit last year which reflected the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December of 2017. If you recall the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a positive one-time impact of reducing our deferred tax liability, partially offset by one-time expense related to the foreign income transition tax. With both adjustments nonrecurring, the net benefit was excluded from non-GAAP net income.You see the impact of the change in effective tax rate on Slide 14 where our fourth quarter GAAP net income was $159 million, a decrease of 18% compared to last year. When you apply our non-GAAP effective tax rate to our non-GAAP pre-tax income, we delivered non-GAAP net income of $201 million in the quarter, up 31.5% from last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP add backs including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.7%, down 12.8 percentage points compared to last year's 36.5% rate, primarily due to the lower federal tax rate. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter includes the impact of truing up the full year rate to 25.7%. Our full year tax rate was favorably impacted by recently issued guidance from the IRS on foreign taxes creditable against global intangible low taxed income.As you can see on slide 15, with the fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $152 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.05, down 16.4%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.32, up 34.4% from last year. Currency headwinds had a 40 basis point impact on fourth quarter earnings-per-share growth.Turning to full year results on slide 16 through 19, we exceeded our financial targets for the year. Revenue was $16.2 billion, an increase of 9.5% on a reported and average daily sales basis. On a constant-currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 9.2% compared to the prior year. Full year gross profit was $2.7 billion, up 10.5%. The gross profit margin was 16.7%, up 20 basis points compared to 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion, an increase of 9.8% compared to last year. Full year GAAP net income was $643 million while non-GAAP net income was $794 million, up 31.1% from 2017. Non-GAAP net income per share was $5.17, an increase of 35.1%. Full year currency tailwinds added 30 basis points of growth to non-GAAP net income per share.Turning to the balance sheet on slide 20. As of December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $206 million and net debt was $3 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion and the total net leverage ratio was 2.3 times. The weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding debt at year-end was 4.5%, 20 basis points higher than last year. In 2018, interest expense benefited from the 1.5% caps in place. These caps expired at year-end and were replaced by interest rate caps with a strike price of (inaudible) that hedged the term loan in 2019 and 2020. With the caps in place, we are well positioned to continue to manage the uncertain rate environment. Roughly 96% of our outstanding debt at year-end 2018 was either fixed-rate or hedged.As shown on slide 21, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during the quarter. Our three-month average cash conversion cycle was 19 days, flat from last year's fourth quarter and within our annual target range of high-teens to low 20s. Full year free cash flow was $752 million or 4.6% of sales, 35 basis points above the high-end of our free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of sales. The over delivery primarily reflects higher cash profits and favorable changes in other assets and liabilities. For the year, we returned over $660 million of cash to shareholders, which included $139 million o  and $522 million of share repurchases at an average price of $82.49 per share.Before I discuss our 2019 financial targets and capital priorities, I would like to introduce a new pre-tax profit metric, non-GAAP operating income shown on slide 22. This will replace adjusted EBITDA as our internal and external metric for operating profitability. Our success helping customers adopt flexible consumption models, more solutions delivered as a service such as Device as a Service is the main driver of this change. Some of these solutions may be underpinned by CDW-owned equipment and it is the associated capital expenditures and depreciation that make this new profit metric more meaningful. That is because it captures all costs associated with delivering new solutions including the depreciation and amortization associated with the revenue, which would be excluded from an EBITDA-based metric. We define non-GAAP operating income as GAAP operating income adjusted for the amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation, other nonrecurring or unusual income and expenses. These adjustments are consistent with the corresponding adjustments in non-GAAP net income. We will report non-GAAP operating income in our disclosures beginning in the first quarter.Moving to our thoughts on 2019 starting on slide 23. We continue to target net sales growth of 200 basis points to 300 basis points above US IT market growth in constant currency on an organic basis. As Chris mentioned, we currently expect US IT market growth of approximately 3%. We closed the acquisition of Scalar on February 1 and expect Scalar to contribute an additional approximately 100 basis points of growth on top of the 200 basis points to 300 basis points. Currency is expected to represent a 60 basis point headwind for the full year assuming exchange rates of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. Non-GAAP operating income margin is expected to be in the mid-7% range for 2019. Our capital spending has historically trended around 0.5 point of sales, so our non-GAAP operating income margin is expected to run approximately 50 basis points below our adjusted EBITDA margin. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth on a constant-currency basis is expected to be roughly 10%. Currency headwinds are projected to shave 60 basis points from the constant currency rate. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering these financial targets on an annual basis.Moving to slide 24. Our capital priorities remain the same and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through the returns of capital and strategic investments. In order of priority, first increased dividends annually. To guide these increases in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout ratio of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.295 per share on March 12 to shareholders of record as of February 25, up 40% from a year ago. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5 time to 3 times. We ended 2018 slightly below the low-end of this range. Subsequent to year-end, we financed the Scalar acquisition with that. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Scalar is a great example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through repurchases. To support this priority, our Board has approved an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization. This approval augments the balance remaining on the prior $750 million authorization on which there was $336 million as of December 31. Given 2018's over delivery of free cash flow relative to our 3.75% to 4.25% of sales rule of thumb, we expect to deploy cash above our rule of thumb in 2019.Slide 25 provides additional modeling thoughts. We expect sales in the first half of the year to be slightly below our historical norm of 48% to 49% of full year sales as we have one selling day shifting from Q1 to Q3, keeping in mind that the normal rhythm of our business is for first quarter sales to typically be the lowest dollar amount and sequentially below our fourth quarter. Over the past three years, on an average daily sales basis, the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline has averaged down approximately 8%. We expect this year's first quarter sequential decline to be generally in line with historical seasonality. As I mentioned earlier, annual currency headwinds are expected at a rate of roughly 60 basis points on net sales. The expected headwinds are greater in the first quarter at 120 basis points as we lap stronger pound and Canadian dollar exchange rates.Moving down the P&L. Non-GAAP operating income margin is expected in the mid-7% range. Total annual depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of $270 million to $275 million. This includes approximately $180 million of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets including a preliminary estimate for Scalar that could change slightly once the purchase accounting is final. Depreciation and amortization expense and SG&A excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles is expected to be around $85 million. Equity-based compensation is expected to be in line with 2018. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $165 million to $167 million with the year-over-year growth driven by the caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to (inaudible) in the financing of Scalar. Our 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5%. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth of 350 to 400 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth is expected to have currency headwinds of 60 basis points similar to our top line. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth to be lower than our full year 10% constant currency target as we have one fewer selling day. This is timing as we will recoup the extra day in the third quarter. One fewer selling day adversely impacts first quarter profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. In addition, we expect first quarter currency headwinds of approximately 120 basis points.Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on slide 26. Our post-tax reform free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of sales. Expectations for capital expenditures excluding the Census remain unchanged and slightly more than 0.5 point of sales. We expect the cash tax rate in the 25.5% to 26.5% range of pre-tax income, adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and we no longer have tax related to the cancellation of that income. We expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within the target range of high-teens to low-20s. Finally, the new leasing standard ASU 2016-02 Topic 842 is effective in 2019. There's no impact to the income statement, but the balance sheet will be grossed up for right of use assets and lease liabilities where we are the lessee. Additionally, CDW will be a lessor for the Census devices of service offering with most of the revenue being recognized as lease revenue. Our team is working closely with the United States Census Bureau on timing. We currently expect the Census to account for approximately 40 basis points of 2019 net sales growth, but could see revenue recognition and capital expenditure shift between 2019 and 2020 depending on the final rollout schedule.That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. And we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. -- Yes, thank you and good morning. Just a question regarding your outlook for this year specifically relative to the transactional business and client device where it looks like we're going into year three of a fairly positive refresh cycle both on the network PC side and servers. I know we're up against some deadlines with some Microsoft operating system support changes early next year. So what's your thought on the cycle? Are we in the last innings here? And as you see potentially lower transactional business and it sounds like there's momentum on the solution side. Will we continue to see positive mix helping your gross margin? -- Good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. I think there's a lot in there, so let me just take it piece by piece if I could. So if we take a step back and think about client, you're right. We're seeing really healthy demand there and obviously watching that closely. Challenge to predict what inning we're in and I would say that the data point seem to be indicating that there are more factors impacting client refresh than have traditionally been the case. So for example, we certainly do have the normal life cycle refresh, older client devices out there and some time-sensitive operating system upgrades coming up Win 10 and Win 7 et cetera. But we're also seeing customers seeking competitive advantages through new technologies in this area to elevate productivity obviously and to drive efficiency with their co-workers. So in terms of taking advantage of that, the cycle seems like it's a little different frankly than it has been. Those time compelling events are important and will continue to drive demand, but we're also seeing what I'll say is a little bit of a smoother level of demand across the year. Now that's obviously tied to budget and the ability to have that budget to spend and we're seeing healthy budgets out there. So on the client, I would say we're going to continue to see strong demand, but we are overlapping some healthy growth last year and the year before. So we might see that moderating a little bit. But again continuing on a more consistent basis than really time sensitive.On the solutions side, there's a lot going on there as well. We obviously have some Microsoft end of service coming around in the next year or so and that will drive upgrades in the data center infrastructure, but equally the advances in the technology and innovation is very interesting to customers and we continue to have conversations with them about investing across the full spectrum whether it's on-cloud on-prem et cetera. So I think you're going to see a healthy environment. That said, when we look at 2019, there seem to be more external uncertainties than we had going into 2018 and so our perspective sitting where we are today is that the IT rate of market growth might be a little lower than what we saw in 2018. -- Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up regarding the federal business. You talked about tough comps in Q4 and you still have some tough comps this quarter. You didn't talk about any disruptions or delays relative to the federal shut down. Anything there to share with us? -- Yeah. On the federal shut down which started as you know at the end of last year really no impact to Q4 results. We did have some project slip because orders weren't placed at the end of December and we've obviously missed about a month worth of writing. Now the good news is we had a holiday in there. We're in a period when our customers are really evaluating as opposed to buying quite as much and our teams were frankly on the phone with those customers during the shut down to help them be ready when they get back. So we could see some shift in timing if orders aren't getting out. Now that they're back at working, we could see some shift, but we wouldn't see -- we don't expect that to be business that's lost. We just think projects might shift into Q2. Obviously, with the possibility of another shut down looming, there would be more concern because that could have longer-term effects and it could start to impact the rest of the economy.The other point I do want to make is when you look at our federal business, we have Department of Defense teams and civilian teams I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And if you look at the mix of that business a lower portion of that business is civilian and civilian agencies are the ones that were primarily shut down because of the partial shutdown. And even in for the agencies that were shut down there were some essential workers working and so we tried to take advantage of that as we go through that. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Good morning Katy. -- Sorry. Good morning. Can you talk to whether you think there was any push-out of demand or sorry pull-in of demand around price increases due to tariff-related impacts in segments like networking during the quarter? -- Yeah. Thanks for the question Katy. We did have conversations with customers around that and we reached out to customers frankly proactively to see how we could help, but at the end of the day, we did not feel any significant pull into the fourth quarter as a result of tariff. We just didn't feel it. -- Okay, thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Okay. Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to start on the solutions as a service. It looks like that's a little bit of a change here and hoping that you can talk about how this change could potentially change the competitive environment. Is there advantages that CDW has versus others in terms of scale, balance sheet et cetera versus small competitors? And if you could touch on how we can think about the key metrics as this ticks up. Is it deflationary to revenue growth with similar profit dollars? Thanks. -- Thank you, Adam. Yeah. When we think about as a service generally I'll start with compelling to our customers it's complicated in how you'll see it in our financial results, because of the various ways that it can appear. So if you have software-as-a-service for example that's pretty clear and that's down we have a broad portfolio of software-as-a-service that offer our customers and we are heavily involved in helping them to implement where they see fit. Something like Device as a Service and I went through the Census example. The multiple advantages that we have that all work together frankly in a solution like Device as a Service is what won us the trust of the Census to actually get it done. Now how that looks on the balance sheet and how it looks on the financial statements, I'll have Collin take you through because it is constructed in such a way that it will be reflected in the financials in a certain way. But we've got other Device as a Service deals that are constructed slightly differently and they will show up separately in the financial statements. So let me have Collin just jump in on that one. -- Yeah, sure. Thanks Chris. Adam, as we're taking these offerings to market the one consistent thing is that there is no standard approach to the accounting. All of these deals are being structured differently. In some instances, it may come onto our balance sheet. In other instances, we may lease from someone else and in other instances, it may just simply be a financing transaction where we're bringing in a third-party to arrange financing and then through our financial statements it just looks like a normal product sale, but we did make a decision to move forward to non-GAAP operating income on a go-forward basis so that in those instances where we are putting capital to work that we're including that depreciation expense, which is effectively the cost of goods sold on the offering. We felt that that was the right way to look at it.In terms of how it changes the model I think because it's unclear exactly how all of these are going to be structured, it depends on each individual transaction. The Census is effectively a full revenue transaction. We are not netting down much on that. So I wouldn't expect that as an example to have a muted impact on the top line. I did make some comments on capital expenditures where we expect to be at our regular CapEx excluding the Census. We're not exactly sure when that CapEx will go out depending on the timing of the Census whether it will be later this year or early 2020. But I think the important point is that we don't expect it to change our free cash flow percentage of sales. So whatever that CapEx number is we're still committed to the post-tax reform free cash flow growth of 3.75% to 4.25%. -- Okay. That's helpful. Just as one quick follow-up since adjusted EBITDA margin is going away I want to ask one last question on it. Gross margin has been increasing. I would imagine that this continued to be a trend as the mix toward net seems more secular in nature. Just want you to maybe touch on how we can think about the impact of adjusted EBITDA margin if this continues to occur. I know there are some offsets, but how can we think about drop-through and could we see another level of adjusted EBITDA margin beyond the high-7%s as you continue to match it up? Thanks. -- Yeah. As you know, there are a variety of factors that impact our gross margin. Chris mentioned mix and in mix there are all these other different mix of products, mix of netted down revenues, mix of channels, mix of are you selling newer or more mature technologies. All of those things impact our gross margin. And then I think the other thing to keep in mind is we have a compensation structure that's tied to gross profit dollars and we pay on that and our solutions business does have a higher cost to serve. So not all of that gross margin is going to drop down to EBITDA margin because of our variable cost structure. And so what I would say is that it depends on how all of those things come together over time. Obviously in the fourth quarter of this year we had a confluence of positive factors that caused a very strong increase in that gross margin. We'll see how that plays out over time depending on all of those factors interact with each other. Continuing with EBITDA margin, we had a mid-7%s for a long time and at our Analyst Day 1.5 years ago we did increase our outlook for that from mid-7%s to high-7%s to 8% because of those factors that you mentioned. So we'll see how that plays out over time. -- Thank you and congrats on solid results. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.And our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. -- Thank you very much. I wanted to talk a bit more about the Canadian acquisition. I'm curious is there anything that you expect to leverage from what they're doing that perhaps you can take into CDW? And then vice versa sort of how are you looking at the integration of that asset over the coming year? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. -- Yeah. No. Thanks for asking. We're really excited about Scalar. I would say that this is really an organization with an exceptional fit and when you tick through what we look forward an acquisition that works Scalar really hit all of the boxes. You think about their deep technical expertise in areas that our customers are looking to us for advice and including services capabilities, they add in-market sellers and technical folks with business up and running and they have a great cultural fit as I mentioned before. One of the things that was really interesting to us is of the non-overlapping customer base. So when you think about the value that we can bring to each other's customers immediately, it's pretty attractive. Scalar has been really primarily a solutions focused and based organization and CDW as you might remember in Canada, our transactional business has been very robust and we've been investing in the solutions area for some time. So by bringing those two together, we've got a nice base of customers that we can offer a more of fulsome group of IT solution.In terms of Canada to US, if that was part of the question like we've done across the Board even with the UK where we find opportunity to take best practices in the US or in the local market and bring it back, we certainly will do that. And I think one area you can think about is operating efficiency. So while this acquisition is really all about the growth and bringing value to our customers as we combine the two, we would look to get some good operating efficiency down the road. -- Thank you. And then I'm curious I think you added about 300 co-workers last year and I believe you mentioned you plan to add about 50% of that this year. Is that because you made this acquisition that maybe you're not as aggressive in terms of hiring or is that just the potential for upside if you find the right people? -- Yeah. I think there was a number that I mentioned in my prepared script. It was 350 and that's the Scalar coworkers that are joining our family. We hired -- we brought in about 165 customer-facing co-workers last year and so we're looking to about 125 to 175 this year, so reflecting the same level of confidence in our ability to execute. -- Confusion there. I will give a number on total co-worker count, up about 300. And Chris was referencing just the customer-facing co-worker count. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And just follow-up on Scalar, if could you provide some color the quarter in terms of their margin profile and the impact to the bottom line? -- Keith, we're not going to provide that information. As we said, we don't expect them to be accretive this year, but we would look for them to be accretive next year but we're not going to get into the details of the margin. And frankly it can fluctuate very much like CDW-based on the type and mix of solutions that they're selling at any given point in time during the quarter, but we're excited about the opportunity together and we'll be able to drive overall CDW UK as we bring the operations together. -- Okay. And just as a follow-up question. In terms of the Census project Device as a Service, what happens after the end of the product and the service becomes it comes back to you? Is that an opportunity to sell a product and perhaps have a gain or loss on the product or is there an opportunity to recycle that into another project? -- Well, that's actually part of the full spectrum of everything that's happening in this product. We are not the third party that will be taking those devices back, but another organization will be taking devices back and then through resale benefiting from that, but that's part of the -- from soup to nuts, the entire project includes a repatriation if you will of the devices, by a third-party, not CDW. -- Keith, there is an assumption, because of the accounting on this. There's a residual value that will be assumed than ultimately what that is. There could be a minor variance, but I wouldn't expect it to be material. -- Okay, thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. -- Yes. Just following up on the M&A questions. Are you finding more opportunity in Canada as far as potential from new customers? Do you see that as more as a focus for the M&A or do you see just opportunities widespread geography-wise? -- Yeah. No. I wouldn't say that we find more or less opportunity up in Canada or in the UK or in the US for that matter. I think we have a process where we're always engaged in knowing and looking at what is out in the marketplace and frankly given our institutional knowledge we tend to scout outside what's on the market anyway and we see a lot in the US and we assess a lot, but I think many of you know we're really quite disciplined about an acquisition and we look for something to complement our strategy. The cultural fit is really quite important to us. Is it going to enhance value for our existing and prospective customers and then ultimately at a compelling price. And you know the compression price is quite important to us and when you look in the market, there can be a lot of interesting opportunities but if the price isn't right it's not something that we're going to move forward on if we can build ourselves. -- And I wonder if you could make some comments around your cloud growth in the quarter. If you're seeing any material acceleration as for shifting offsite and any potential cannibalization of your historical offering? -- Yeah. We're not going to give that number this quarter. I think a couple maybe three quarters ago, we let you all know that the customer spend which will be gross sales, gross revenue, customer spend was in the $3 billion area. So it's really I would say is a robust and mature practice with a broad selection. I think the question specifically around seeing growth in the cloud at the expense of on-prem, we have always been for several years now a fan of the hybrid model. And I think our view has always been that the world is going to land in a hybrid place and I do think that's what we're seeing in the market. For us it's opportunity across the board. We're not seeing -- certainly some customers are repatriating back to on-prem for a variety of reasons as you know, but not at the expense of actually moving other workloads to the cloud. So I think we're seeing very balanced assessment by our customers. We're trying to help them understand what's best for them and their particular business, because obviously the different businesses can take advantage of different types of technologies, but strength in both and not one at the expense of the other is what we're feeling. -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks. This is Paul Chang on for Coster. Thanks for taking my question. So just on operating margins, I know you are investing in the sales force and Scalar probably will create some noise, but how should we think about areas where you can see some operating leverage beyond fiscal year '19? Sounds like from the comments you made earlier gross margins should stay in the high-16% range. -- Yeah. Thank you. So our thoughts on 2019 are that our non-GAAP operating income margin will be in the mid-7%. Again I know it's a new metric, but if you think that our CapEx is historical run around 0.5 point of sales you can take 50 basis points and added to that to give you kind of a comparable adjusted EBITDA margin. You know I made some comments earlier about some of the factors that impact our gross margin and how they interact with each other and also we do have a highly variable cost structure. So as the business does grow and we generate more gross profit down the road even if they come from solutions we have additional variable expense that goes along with that. And then secondly, we continue to make investments in the organization in terms of adding customer-facing co-worker's and other investments to ensure that we continue to drive that topline out-performance to market of 200 basis points to 300 basis points. So yeah I've been -- we feel good about our ability to deliver that mid-7% non-GAAP operating income margin and depending on how the market evolves over the next several years, we could potentially update that but for now it's the 7.5%. -- Thank you.Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Chris Leahy for closing remarks. -- Thank you. As we wrap-up the call today I'd like to thank our 9,000 plus coworkers for taking care of our customers every single day and for focusing on our customer's success, thereby ensuring CDW's continuing success.

However, currency headwinds affected earnings growth by 40 basis points (bps).Revenues for the reported quarter came in at $4.08 billion, marking a year-over-year rise of 8.6% and also topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.03 million. Moreover, revenues were up 9% at constant currency (cc).The company's balanced portfolio of customer end-markets, the breadth of its product and solutions pipeline and ongoing execution of its three-part strategy are key growth drivers. However, the currency moved to a headwind of 40 bps in the fourth quarter from a tailwind of 70 bps in the year-ago period.CDW's Corporate's net sales of $1.8 billion registered nearly 14.8% growth on a year-over-year basis. This upside was driven by significant customer demand for client devices, which was backed by strong economic growth and optimal employment levels. During the quarter under review, client devices increased more than 25%. Moreover, double-digit digit growth in Corporate solution sales was a tailwind. Server, storage and NetComm were key growth analysts.Small Business segment's net sales of $363 million increased 17.7% year over year. Sales growth was primarily driven by double-digit growth in transactions and solutions.Coming to Public segment, net sales of $1.4 billion dipped 0.8% from the year-earlier quarter as revenues from Government decreased 11.9% to $546 million with federal service revenues declining in the high-teens. The tough year-over-year comparison that the company has been persistently facing due to the Department of Defense's Windows 10 upgrade in the prior year is a dampener. However, Education sales rose 7.6% to $425 million and net sales to Healthcare customers climbed 7.8% to $443.2 million.Net sales in Other ascended 10.3% to $461.7 million. Other segment comprises the outcomes of the company's Canadian and UK operations. U.K. was up by high teens, driven by strong customer demand for both datacenter and client devices. Canada rose in high single-digits with solutions growth continuing to outpace that of transactions.Moreover, CDW witnessed strong growth across hardware, software and services. Both hardware and software augmented 8% each while Services jumped more than 20%. | CDW's gross profit of $694 million increased 13.1% on a year-over-year basis. However, gross margin of 17% expanded 60 basis points (bps) year over year, backed by mix of software-as-a-service, warranties, commission revenues and also product margin.The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $323 million, which improved 8.8% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat year over year at 7.9%.CDW exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $205.8 million compared with $255.1 million at the end of the earlier reported quarter.The company has a long-term debt of $3.18 billion.It generated $905.9 million of cash flow from operational activities during 2018. Free cash flow was $752 million during the same time frame.Last year, the company returned $660 million of cash to shareholders including $139 million o  and $522 million of share repurchases.The company also announced that the board has ramped up share repurchase authorization by $1 billion and cleared 40 cents hike over last year's dividend.CDW anticipates 2019 revenues to grow 200-300 bps more than U.S. IT market's expected growth estimate of 3%. The acquisition of Scalar is envisioned to contribute 100 bps additionally.For 2019, non-GAAP operating income margin is projected in the mid 7% range. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth rate at constant currency is predicted to be 10%. Currency headwind of 60 bps is likely to be an overhang on both revenues and EPS.CDW currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Twitter, Inc.  , MeetMe, Inc.  and Verint Systems Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth rate for Twitter, MeetME and Verint is projected at 11.5%, 20% and 10%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $89.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $100.00. The standard deviation is $4.795.But the whole reason to look at the  CDW price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDW crossing above that average target price of $97.00/share, investors in CDW have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $97.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

This company, which is in the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This information technology company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6.46%.For the most recent quarter, CDW was expected to pos  of $1.33 per share, but i  ed $1.42 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.77%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.30 per share, while it actually produced $1.38 per share, a surprise of 6.15%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for CDW. In fact, the Zacks (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for CDW. In fact, the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce  . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.CDW has an Earnings ESP of +1.67% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's nex  is expected to be released on February 7, 2019.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making CDW Corp an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of CDW entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $77.02 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of CDW Corp, the RSI reading has hit 27.8 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 30.0. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, CDW's recent annualized dividend of 1.18/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 1.46% based upon the recent $80.58 share price.A bullish investor could look at CDW's 27.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on CDW is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n trading on Thursday, shares of CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW) crossed below their 200 day moving average of $82.61, changing hands as low as $81.06 per share. CDW Corp shares are currently trading down about 3.7% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of CDW shares, versus its 200 day moving average:    Looking at the chart above, CDW's low point in its 52 week range is $66.88 per share, with $96.75 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $80.98.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n recent trading, shares of CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $93.80, changing hands for $95.97/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $87.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $100.00. The standard deviation is $5.63.But the whole reason to look at the  CDW price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDW crossing above that average target price of $93.80/share, investors in CDW have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $93.80 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The FANGs all took part in this relief rally, especially Amazon (+4.86%) and Apple (+3.49%).Meanwhile, the Dow advanced 1.13% (or almost 288 points) to 25,826.43, while the S&P increased 1.09% to 2790.37. The indices are coming off a strong final week of November that saw each of the Big 3 jump by approximately 5%.It's not like the U.S. and China are best friends now, but the meeting in Argentina didn't require any major breakthroughs as far as the market was concerned. All we really needed was some sort of agreement between the two countries that would cool the escalating trade tensions of the past several months. It looks like that's just what we got\u2026temporarily at least.Tariffs on over $200 billion in Chinese goods will stay at 10% for now, instead of rising to 25% as President Trump threatened if nothing productive came out of the meeting. It may still move up to 25% if nothing can be worked out in the 90 days, but that gives the two sides an opening to negotiate. That's pretty much what the market was expecting, which may have been why the morning rally faded a bit into the close.What a great few days this has been for the market! We got good news on two of the major uncertainties that fueled the correction: rising rates and trade. Of course, neither of these issues have been resolved for the long-term, but positive movement on both is a good first step. Most importantly, these recent developments suggest that stocks could end this frustrating year with a rally as we begin the historically strong month of December. Last week, Kevin mentioned that he was holding onto Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) ahead of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference. And it's a good thing he did! The biotech revealed positive results for its trial of Voxelotor as a treatment for children with sickle cell disease. The reaction on Monday was a 47.8% surge in GBT.

However, Corporate solution sales were flat in the quarter as mid-teens growth in two end markets was offset by softness in the other two end markets.Small Business segment net sales of $340 million increased 11.3% year over year.

Revenues from Government increased 8% to $639.3 million with federal service revenues growing in the mid-teens.

The best possible way to evaluate the profitability position of a company is to use financial ratios. In this context, ratio analysis is used to differentiate a profitable company from a loss-making one.Generally, there are four key profitability ratios - gross income ratio, operating income ratio, pre-tax profit margin and net income ratio. Here, we have used the most effective and frequently used profitability ratio - net income ratio.Net income ratio gives us the exact profit level of a company. It reflects the percentage of net income to total sales revenues. Using net income ratio, one can determine a company's capability to meet operating and non-operating expenses with its sales revenues. A higher net income ratio usually implies a company's ability to generate ample sales revenues and successfully manage all business functions.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine.

While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on \"buy high, sell higher.\"Many a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always mean an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.The lower, the better.This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is CDW (CDW). CDW is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 14.90, while its industry has an average P/E of 25.91. Over the last 12 months, CDW's Forward P/E has been as high as 19.02 and as low as 13.89, with a median of 16.19.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is CDW's P/B ratio of 11.28. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 11.49. Over the past 12 months, CDW's P/B has been as high as 13.52 and as low as 10.34, with a median of 12.05.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. CDW has a P/S ratio of 0.76. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.24.Finally, our model also underscores that CDW has a P/CF ratio of 13.78. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. CDW's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 35.93. Over the past 52 weeks, CDW's P/CF has been as high as 15.79 and as low as 12.26, with a median of 14.74.These are just a handful of the figures considered in CDW's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that CDW is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This information technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.2%.Revenues are expected to be $4.24 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For CDW, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.88%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that CDW will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CDW would post earnings of $1.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.38, delivering a surprise of +6.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CDW appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

For the WisdomTree U.S. Multifactor Fund ETF (Symbol: USMF), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $32.18 per unit.With USMF trading at a recent price near $29.11 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.54% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 6 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $78.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $100.00. The standard deviation is $7.503.But the whole reason to look at the  CDW price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDW crossing above that average target price of $89.50/share, investors in CDW have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $89.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Wednesday, shares of CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 26.0, after changing hands as low as $80.79 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 24.3. A bullish investor could look at CDW's 26.0 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Netflix surged nearly 5% after a strong showing at the Emmy's last night and Amazon helped the index with a rise of 1.7%.The Dow is most susceptible to trade issues, so it was most relieved by the tariff news. The index jumped 0.71% today (or nearly 185 points) to 26,247 after snapping a four-day winning streak yesterday.However, most eyes will be on the S&P in the coming days.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $88.81 in the previous session. CDW has gained 27.1% since the start of the year compared to the 14% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 20.9% return for the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry.The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 2, 2018, CDW reported EPS of $1.38 versus consensus estimate of $1.3 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.01%.For the current fiscal year, CDW is expected to post earnings of $4.97 per share on $16.04 billion in revenues. This represents a 29.77% change in EPS on a 5.61% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.42 per share on $16.94 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 9.09% and 5.57%, respectively.CDW may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.CDW has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 15.4X versus its peer group's average of 15.9X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, CDW currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if CDW meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though CDW shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Shares of CDW have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including PERSPECTA INC (PRSP), On Assignment (ASGN), and DXC Technology Company. (DXC), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 38% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CDW, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new June 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $74.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $80.91/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.75% return on the cash commitment, or 10.31% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, and highlighting in green where the $80.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of CDW stock at the current price level of $80.91/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.74% if the stock gets called away at the June 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDW shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDW's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

But in the end, Thursday was pretty much a rerun of Wednesday with tech continuing to rise while the rest fumbled around.The NASDAQ remains the star of Wall Street right now, though it also took a header in the final hour. It finished with a gain of only 0.04% to 7891.8. However, the index now has an 8-session winning streak, which is its longest run of the year. It marks an impressive (though slow) recovery from the stiff pullback after Facebook's quarterly troubles.The rest of the market just ran in place for most of the day before taking that dip at the end. The S&P spent most of its time on positive ground, but ended with a slight loss of 0.14% to 2853.6. But it is still less than 1% away from an all-time high.The Dow had the most pronounced slip, most likely due to trade fears taking the stage again as this strong earnings season moves toward its close. It was still off by only 0.29% to 25,509.2.There was lots of action in the portfolios today, so let's get right to it: The price of oil has stalled a bit recently, which is wreaking havoc with small energy companies like Lonestar (LONE). The stock gave up all of its earnings momentum yesterday and remained weak today. Tracey thinks it's time to say goodbye to what has been an excellent holding in the portfolio. The editor already pulled a triple-digit and a double-digit return out of this name from selling parts of the original position bought back in April. Today she sold the remaining piece for an approximately 70% profit. There's a new editor in town and he wants to make some changes right off the bat. Ryan McQueeney thought it was a good time to get out of Sandy Spring Bancorp (SASR) now that this holding company for the Sandy Spring Bank has dipped to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) after trending downward for about a month. However, the position brings a nice return of nearly 51%. The editor also sold WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (DGRW) because the portfolio already has enough exposure to the hybrid field of growth & income. Plus, he needs room for more buys. This sell brought a profit of 13.2%.The new addition is BG Staffing (BGSF), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) staffing firm that is  amid this incredible labor market. It is already up about 75% in the past year, but Ryan believes it has more room to run. Best of all, the valuation is still affordable and BGSF offers a dividend yield of more than 4.4%. Read the full write up for a lot more on these moves and a personal introduction from your new editor. As you may or may not know, Dave is a  (he just recently  up from Florida for a Chicago visit). So he knows about a company like Advance Auto Parts (AAP) both as an investment and as a customer. The company has a positive Earnings ESP of 4.12% for its quarter coming on Aug 14th before the bell. But the editor was even more impressed with its year-over-year EPS growth over three good reports in a row. Dave expects more of the same coming down the road, so he bought AAP on Thursday with a 12.5% allocation. The portfolio picked up two fresh names on Thursday: Morgan Stanley (MS) and CDW Corp. (CDW). MS is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) financial services giant that beat earnings expectations by 20% last quarter and will report again on Oct. 16. CDW is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) IT products and services company that topped by 6% last time and will be back at the plate on Nov. 11. Both companies also have solid Zacks Style Scores and good Zacks Industry Ranks.John cleared space for these names by selling Packaging Corp. of America (PKG) and Huntsman (HUN), which were stale amid all the trade war concerns. The editor wants the same weight on both sides of these swaps. Therefore, after you sell these names, the allocations in MS and CDW should be a little below 4% each. Get a lot more specifics in the complete commentary. There's not as much data on SendGrid (SEND) as Brian Bolan usually likes to see, but it only went public in November. But this email marketing firm has shown the editor enough to be added to the portfolio. In its recent quarterly report, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 400%. That was better than the previous quarter's 300% positive surprise. The editor sees plenty of customers for the company and expects a solid post-earnings drift higher. Read the complete write-up for more on SEND's earnings history, estimate revisions and valuation. It's a humid 90 degrees here in Chicago as this is being written, so we know all about the importance of air-conditioning during these sweltering summer months. Dave is well aware of it too being based in Florida, but he also knows a way to make some money from it. Aaon (AAON) is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) air-conditioning and heating equipment company that has been on a roll from its May lows through its first and second quarter earnings reports. The editor thinks this momentum can continue, prompting him to buy AAON on Thursday with a 12.5% allocation.

From digitizing retail outlets with automated check-out technology, modernizing payment systems with rigid cybersecurity measures to revolutionizing health care mechanisms and education with credible data-driven insights, we can safely say that the age of technology is here to stay.Moreover, rapid adoption of cloud, AI, Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), wearables, drones and virtual reality/ augmented reality (VR/AR) devices are fuelling massive growth in the space.Further, the accelerated deployment of 5G technology - the next wireless revolution - is likely to enhance opportunities.Hence, we believe investors should get mileage out of yesterday's dip by building position in tech stocks that are now trading at a discount.The immense prospects of the Technology sector will without doubt help Nasdaq and S&P 500 bounce back in the near term. Moreover, by purchasing stocks right after a dip, investors are likely to get a bargain, as the depressed prices do not fully reflect the company's true long-term fundamentals.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 228 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new March 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $76.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $84.06/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $64.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $90.00. The standard deviation is $8.318.But the whole reason to look at the  CDW price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDW crossing above that average target price of $79.78/share, investors in CDW have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $79.78 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The question lingering in investors' minds is whether or not the company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, the company has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company's results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and came in line in the other occasions. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 0.5%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that CDW is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CDW carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, we noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings have remained unchanged over the past 30 days.However, the company is likely to continue reporting top- and bottom-line growth on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter earnings is pegged at 92 cents, which indicates year-over-year growth of 22.7%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $3.46 billion, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter. | For the past few quarters, the company has been expanding its solutions suite and enhancing services capabilities, which is likely to have positively impacted the quarterly results. Moreover, the company's investment strategies to deliver integrated solutions both in and outside of the U.K., along with the international sales team and its international-branded website, will likely have driven its performance.Furthermore, CDW specializes in offering information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Growth in customer channels and continued strategic achievements are a couple of positive factors which are likely to have been conducive to the company's results in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, CDW's robust product portfolio and product refreshes remain positives.Also, the company's exposure in the high-end corporate desktop and digital education implementation space is encouraging. Moreover, its focus on small & medium businesses and customer additions help expand market share.Nonetheless, the company's high debt burden might have weighed on the bottom-line results. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total debt of approximately $3.20 billion (excluding current maturities). Such high-debt levels increase leverage risks and interest costs which might dent the company's profitability.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Seagate Technology PLC  has an Earnings ESP of +3.43% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  .Arrow Electronics, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank of 2.FireEye, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +6.67% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise. Notably, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and came in line with the other two. It has an average earnings surprise of 2.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.CDW specializes in offering information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Growth in customer channels and continued strategic achievements are a couple of positive factors which are likely to drive performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, CDW's robust product portfolio and product refreshes remain positives.Furthermore, for the past few quarters, the company has been expanding its solutions suite and enhancing the services capabilities, which is likely to positively impact the quarterly results. Moreover, the company's investment strategies to deliver integrated solutions both in and outside of the U.K., along with the international sales team and its international-branded website, will likely prove conducive to its performance.Nonetheless, the company's high debt burden might weigh on the bottom-line results. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had total debt of approximately $3.39 billion. Such high-debt levels increase leverage risks and interest costs which may dent the company's profitability. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that CDW is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .CDW currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 98 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of approximately 14%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $3.84 billion, up 10.1% from the year-ago quarter tally.Here are some companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NVIDIA Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +6.87% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see  .Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +6.19% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Akamai Technologies, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.73% and a Zacks Rank #3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new February 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of 15 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $69.23/share today.Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 13% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 90%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDW stock at the current price level of $69.23/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.57% if the stock gets called away at the February 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDW shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDW's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

With this feature, you have the confidence of knowing that if the item you buy is later advertised at a lower price, you can make a claim for the difference.That means if you buy a new computer, and the price drops by $300 two months later, you can make a claim and get a check for the $300 price drop. It's really that easy, provided you have the receipt and an advertisement showing the lower price.As a general rule,  have the best price-protection policies because they offer 90 days of protection and specifically allow claims for limited-quantity sales.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $58.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $75.00. The standard deviation is $5.348.But the whole reason to look at the  CDW price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDW crossing above that average target price of $69.11/share, investors in CDW have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $69.11 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover CDW Corp:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

Among the largest underlying components of VB, in trading today CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW) is down about 0.3%, Diamondback Energy, Inc. (Symbol: FANG) is up about 0.7%, and CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP) is lower by about 0.9%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of VB, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, VB's low point in its 52 week range is $116.49 per share, with $144.41 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $142.44. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["lthough tech stocks have been dominating Wall Street for a good majority of the year, not every company in the sector has found the same success. Indeed, some stocks, such as  (PLUS), are struggling to maintain relevancy in today's ultra-competitive tech environment.ePlus is a provider of IT services and financing. The company provides a variety of solutions aimed at helping clients optimize their IT infrastructure and supply-chain processes, including services related to cloud computing, security, mobility, and datacenter operation.After missing revenue estimates by a sizeable amount in its most recent quarter, ePlus has slumped to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).ePlus reported its fiscal second-quarter earnings results last week. The company posted earnings of $1.27 per share, matching our consensus estimate. However, revenues of $371 million were flat on the year and significantly below our consensus estimate of $414 million.As a result of these relatively weak results, shares of ePlus plummeted more than 20% in the direct aftermath of its report. Since then, the stock has struggled to generate positive momentum, likely because of weakened analyst sentiment.Since its recent report, we have seen slumping earnings estimates for ePlus. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's current-quarter earnings has slipped three cents over the past week. Furthermore, our consensus estimate for the company's upcoming fiscal year has shed a penny over that same timeframe.Additionally, investors might worry about a few other key metrics. For one, ePlus is generating cash flow growth of just 2.7% right now, which is significantly lower than its 14.4% historical average. The company is also operating with a net margin of 3.9%, making it slightly less efficient that its industry's average net margin of 4.3%.While ePlus may be struggling right now, there are still other options for investors looking to add an IT services company to their portfolio right now. For example, industry heavyweights CDW Corporation (CDW) and DXC Technology Company (DXC) are both sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, CDW Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.7. If we focus on the stock's long-term PE trend, the current level puts CDW Corporation's current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint (which is 15.8) over the past three years.Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that CDW Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 17.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for CDW Corporation's stock in the near term too.Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, CDW Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 0.7. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, CDW Corporation is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company's stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.In aggregate, CDW Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CDW a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 13.5, which is slightly better than the industry average of 14.4. Clearly, CDW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Though CDW Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of C. This gives CDW a VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate did not see any earnings momentum in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | Despite this somewhat mixed trend, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above-average performance from the company in the near-term.CDW Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Boasting a decent industry rank (top 29% out of more than 250 industries) and a strong Zacks Rank, the company deserves attention right now. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

Large-cap stocks have been growing on stepped-up global economy, owing to their high international exposure. Small-cap stocks on the other hand are more domestically focused and exhibit higher volatility than their large-cap counterparts.The largest small-cap ETF tracking the Russell 2000 index, iShares Russell 2000 ETF is up 10.7% so far this year, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF is up about 15%.The primary reason for this underperformance can be attributed to investors piling onto blue chips and shunning the small-caps. However, with robust domestic economic growth and rising hopes of President Donald Trump's tax reform, small-cap stocks are expected to perform well.U.S. equities have been rallying owing to multiple factors. GDP increased 3% annually in the July-September period compared with a 3.1% increase in the third quarter. Also, it surpassed expectations of a 2.5% increase (read:  ).Trump is expected to announce his decision on the Federal Reserve chair this week. Markets believe that Trump is expected to choose Fed governor Jerome Powell as Janet Yellen's replacement. Powell is being seen as a dovish candidate who will not steer much from the current Fed policy. Markets widely expect the Fed to hike rates in its December meeting.On Oct 19, the Senate passed a budget of $4 trillion in a 51-49 vote which will allow the Republicans to move ahead with the tax cuts with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote supermajority that is generally required (read:  ).The tax reform is expected to significantly boost earnings. This led to a rally in the stock markets as investors grew more optimistic about Trump delivering on his campaign promises. Moreover, it will significantly boost the performance of small-caps owing to their domestic focus.However, the markets are worried about the tax cuts rolling in gradually, instead of an immediate cut. This will be contrary to Trump's wishes and markets' expectation of an immediate cut.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. small-cap equities.This fund seeks to provide exposure to small cap U.S. companies and tracks the Russell 2000 index.It has AUM of $43.6 billion and charges a fee of 20 basis points a year.

Notably, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.16%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.07 per share, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $4 billion indicates around 7.9% growth from the prior-year quarter.CDW specializes in offering information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers, primarily in the United Statesand Canada. Growth in customer channels and consistent strategic achievements are a couple of positive factors that are likely to drive performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, CDW's robust product portfolio and product refreshes are positives.The company's approach to capture market share from existing and new customers, expand its solutions suite and enhance our services capabilities are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.

In select cases, approval may take longer, with the decision coming in a letter by snail mail seven to 10 days after applying.Here's what you should do immediately after getting approved for a credit card.If the card offer included promotional benefits -- 0% APRs, sign-up bonuses, or other perks -- take notice of the terms and conditions of the offer.If the card offers a sign-up bonus, be sure to read the fine print as it relates to the minimum spending requirements. Most  require that cardholders spend at least $1,000 in the first 90 days after account opening to qualify for a $200 cash bonus, for example. These bonuses can be lucrative, but note that the spending requirement is based on when the account is  , not when you receive your card in the mail. You can get clarification on the timeline with a quick message to customer support. It would be unfortunate to fail to meet the minimum spending requirement by a few days, given just how big sign-up bonuses can be. (The  in the Fool.com database is currently worth $625 of travel.)Cardholders who applied for a  or balance transfers should pay attention to the details of the promotion. In some cases,  allow for fee-free balance transfers when amounts are transferred in the first 45 days after account opening, so it's in your interest to act quickly and transfer any balances as soon as you can. Again, speaking to customer service can be helpful in determining the cut-off day for specific perks, and when the 0% promo APR will revert to a card's standard interest rate.Knowing what to do after getting approved for a credit card ensures you get all the benefits of having a card.

To avoid interest on your purchases, you'll need to ensure that you pay at least the \"statement balance\" each month.Note that the statement balance is not the \"minimum payment\" amount. The minimum payment is just the amount you have to pay to avoid a delinquency on your credit report. If you pay only the minimum payment, you'll incur interest charges on your account. Pay the statement balance, which should be greater than, or equal to, the minimum payment each month.If you fail to pay the statement balance in any given month, you can expect to pay interest on two months of balances before getting back into your credit card company's good graces. It all has to do with the complicated way in which a credit card's  works.Credit card rewards programs are not created equally. Some  are very lucrative when points or miles are redeemed for travel, but most travel programs pay out at a discounted rate  .To this end, it's also helpful to understand how points, miles, or cash can be accumulated fastest. Some cards offer bonus rewards in rotating categories, but only if you enroll in the program each quarter by logging online. Others have bonus categories that pay out a higher rewards rate on certain types of spending (  , restaurants,  , and so on), and thus you should be mindful of which cards offer the beefiest rewards on any given type of spending.Credit cards often come with a number of perks that get hidden in the fine print. These features include additional insurance protection for car rentals, travel insurance, or purchase protection, which refunds the difference if a product you purchase is advertised at a lower price in the future.Two of my favorite perks:There are a few best practices to consider when using your new credit card. In particular, it's important to always pay your bill on time. While late payments don't hurt your credit score unless they're more than 30 days late, late payment fees can add up to $30 or more, in addition to penalty interest rates that can top 29% per year.Even if you pay on time, a credit card can harm your credit score if you keep a high balance. For this reason, it's important to keep your balances to less than 30% of your credit limit. So if you have a $1,000 limit, try to keep the balance lower than $300. A higher credit utilization ratio will result in a lower credit score, which can make it harder to qualify for other loans or cards in the future.Responsibility goes a long way toward ensuring that a  is an asset, not a liability. Those who pay on time and in full, and who use their card just as they would cash or debit, get all of the benefits of credit without paying a dime in interest or fees. That should be the goal -- get the rewards that credit cards offer without paying a dime to your card company in interest or finance charges. Increasing your credit score above 800 will put you in rare company. So rare that only 1 in 9 Americans can claim they're members of this elite club. But contrary to popular belief, racking up a high credit score is a lot easier than you may have imagined following 5 simple, disciplined strategies. You'll find a full rundown of each inside our  .

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $58.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $75.00. The standard deviation is $4.901.But the whole reason to look at the  CDW price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDW crossing above that average target price of $68.56/share, investors in CDW have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $68.56 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

For the First Trust Technology AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FXL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $49.92 per unit.With FXL trading at a recent price near $44.63 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.86% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FXL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Match Group Inc (Symbol: MTCH), SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (Symbol: SSNC), and CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW).

In order to capitalize on the trends, Unisys is rationalizing its services and solution portfolio by shifting its offerings to cloud-based and software-as-a-service delivery models. Unisys continued its transition to a more asset-lite business model, which resulted in reduced CapEx needs and improved cash flow. The company successfully executed its vertical go-to-market strategy, including hiring leaders of key sectors. The company is also concentrating on business opportunities in fewer, more profitable sectors in the IT marketplace.Furthermore, Unisys is focusing its resources and investments in four targeted, high-potential market areas, including security (IT security and physical security), data center transformation and outsourcing services, end-user outsourcing and support services, and applications modernization and outsourcing services. As it seeks to keep up with the evolution in the IT industry, the company's services unit looks set to take advantage of growth prospects in higher-margin services. Unisys has secured quite a few contracts in these segments recently that should propel its top-line growth in the coming quarters.In addition, Unisys has been restructuring its business to improve profitability. This restructuring strategy includes selling non-core businesses and revamping its sales strategy while investing in a few higher-growth areas such as outsourcing. We expect the company to continue with its cost-control initiatives and put greater effort toward sales growth, as it strives to overcome its operational weaknesses. Unisys is focusing more on building specialized industry skills and resources required to win industry-specific project opportunities. The company is investing heavily in developing a team dedicated to pursuing growth opportunities for application-managed services both for existing and new clients. These application-based managed services capability will enable Unisys to more effectively pursue long-term application outsourcing opportunities, associated application modernization and implementation project work.However, Unisys has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry, with an average loss of 15.1% in the last three months against a 13.0% gain for the latter. It faces stiff competition in the information services and technology marketplace from consulting and other professional services firms, systems integrators, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. Consequently, Unisys has to continually invest in new technologies that act as value drivers and can provide a hedge against stiff competition. These incremental investments increase operating expenses, thus squeezing margins and negatively impacting profitability.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include CDW Corporation  , EPAM Systems, Inc.  and MAM Software Group, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .CDW Corporation has topped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.9%.EPAM Systems has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 20%. It surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.2%.MAM Software Group has topped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 92.9%.Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new August 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.05. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $58.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $62.81/share today.Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDW stock at the current price level of $62.81/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.00% if the stock gets called away at the August 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDW shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDW's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

And as you'll see in the highlights section below, Dave said in  that this drop provides one of the better buying opportunities in a while.The other two major indices dipped along with the NASDAQ, but the concern was with technology stocks. Therefore, though slipping momentarily into negative territory, the Dow recovered nicely to advance 0.39% for another new high of 21796.6. The S&P also had a nice rebound but still declined 0.10% to 2475.4. Tomorrow could be a big day for the market as Q2 GDP is released in the morning. Also, it looks like Amazon's numbers after the bell today were disappointing, so that could have an impact as well.It was a busy day in the portfolios with several editors taking some big profits off the table.

It's been a winner for the portfolio, though it has recently slipped to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Jeremy decided that this was a good time to sell half of the position and take a 13.5% profit. He'll watch to see what the other half does from here.In other moves, shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) have slipped to the $130 level despite beating on both the top and bottom lines in its latest report. This has \"Zacks Counterstrike\" written all over it, especially since it has now dropped into Jeremy's beloved Fibonacci long scenario. The editor thinks this best-in-breed casino is worth more than $145, so he bought it today with a 7% allocation. WYNN has already been a winner for the portfolio when it was sold for 12.7% back in June. Furthermore, Jeremy also doubled down on his Thor Industries (THO) position with an extra 5% allocation. Read the complete write up for more. Sometimes you just get lucky. There's no way to sugar coat the recent earnings report from Penn Gaming (PENN); it was a bad showing with a big miss and a lowered guidance. Steve expected the stock to plunge by 10% or maybe even 20%. But the stock only dropped by about 2%. The editor's first instinct was to only sell half, but the surprising response convinced him to sell the whole thing and take a more than 11% profit. Phew! Steve also decided to sell some of Aaron's (AAN) ahead of its earnings report for a 9.6% return. He's holding onto a 6.1% allocation in case the company continues to impress with its turnaround efforts. The portfolio had a trio of moves on Thursday. Here they are:\u2022 Landstar (LSTR) is getting pounded today despite a positive beat last night. Kevin believes the move is way overdone, but he sees an opportunity now that the plunge has decimated the short side of yesterday's bull call spread. He decided to leg out of the spread by buying to close the Oct. 95.00 Call and taking an 82% profit. The editor still likes LSTR and has no problem keeping the long call for the eventual move back up.\u2022 CDW (CDW): Kevin still likes this stock, but it has a negative Earnings ESP heading into next week's report on Thursday (8/3). So he decided to remove the bull call spreads by selling to close the two Sept 60.00 Calls AND buying to close the two Sept 65.00 Calls. The spreads brought a gain of 38%.\u2022 AbbVie (ABBV): This is a volatile stock that reports earnings tomorrow. If they miss, then the Nov 70.00 Call would get crushed. However, a smaller risk profile would limit the loss, but still make money if it beats. Therefore, the editor sold to close the Nov call for a 21% gain and then bought to open an Aug. 72.50 Call.Learn a lot more about these moves in the complete commentary. -- John Blank -- Dave BartosiakAll the Best, Jim GiaquintoAll the Best,Jim GiaquintoRecommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.

A cash dividend payment of $0.16 per share is scheduled to be paid on June 12, 2017. Shareholders who purchased CDW prior to the ex-dividend date are eligible for the cash dividend payment. This marks the 3rd quarter that CDW has paid the same dividend. At the current stock price of $57.09, the dividend yield is 1.12%.The previous trading day's last sale of CDW was $57.09, representing a -6.41% decrease from the 52 week high of $61 and a 46.8% increase over the 52 week low of $38.89.CDW is a part of the Consumer Services sector, which includes companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (  ) and Liberty Interactive Corporation (  ). CDW's current earnings per share, an indicator of a company's profitability, is $2.44. Zacks  reports CDW's forecasted earnings growth in 2017 as 9.86%, compared to an industry average of 15.9%.For more information on the declaration, record and payment dates, visit the  page. Our  has the full list of stocks that have an ex-dividend today.The following ETF(s) have CDW as a top-10 holding:The top-performing ETF of this group is VBR with an decrease of -1.6% over the last 100 days.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $48.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $71.00. The standard deviation is $8.724.But the whole reason to look at the  CDW price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CDW crossing above that average target price of $61.12/share, investors in CDW have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $61.12 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover CDW Corp:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

Among the largest underlying components of VBR, in trading today CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW) is up about 0.9%, Teleflex Incorporated (Symbol: TFX) is up about 0.5%, and Steel Dynamics Inc.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of VBR, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, VBR's low point in its 52 week range is $99.17 per share, with $126.68 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $122.19. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 5/23/17, Core Mark Holding Co Inc (Symbol: CORE), CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW), and Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 6.58%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.85%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.CDW specializes in offering information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers, primarily in the U.S. and Canada.Growth in customer channels and consistent strategic achievements are a couple of positive factors which are anticipated to drive the company's performance in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Additionally, CDW's robust product portfolio and product refreshes are positives.The company's exposure in the high-end corporate desktop and digital education implementation space is encouraging. Moreover, CDW's focus on small & medium businesses and customer additions help in expanding its market share.However, a highly-leveraged balance sheet, competition from Insight Enterprises Inc.  and PC Connection, Inc., and pricing pressure remain headwinds. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that CDW will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . CDW carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AMTEK Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.79% and a Zacks Rank #2.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Here is a synopsis of all three stocks: :The market put together one heck of a run the last several trading days. We've seen a breakout on the small caps and the NASDAQ to new all-time highs. But the high beta stocks aren't the only ones benefiting from the recent movement. The risk-on behavior has helped money flows to emerging markets and commodities. Today's  is a stock that lies at the intersection of these two attractive areas of the financial world. (NYSE:  -  )  is the leading global ethanol and sugar company in terms of production with low-cost, large-scale and integrated operations in Brazil. Their production is based on sugarcane, a competitive and viable feedstock for ethanol, sugar and energy because of its low production cost and high energy efficiency ratio relative to other ethanol sources, such as corn and sugarbeet.The company is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in an industry that ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. A big reason for the rank is the bullish move in earnings estimates for the current year. Just ninety days ago, analysts were expecting $1.11 in profits for Cosan. Revisions of these current year numbers have now pushed our Zacks Consensus Estimate from $1.11 to $2.05. Next year's Zacks Consensus has increased from $1.95 to $2.40 over that same period.Shares of Cosan have underperformed the Agriculture Products Industry so far this year. While the Industry is up 11.7% shares of Cosan have only added 2.4%. That may sound like a negative for the stocks but really that shows its potential to catch up with the rest of the industry. :Sometimes I write a  article on a stock we basically all agree is going down the tubes. Other times, I write one and I get all sorts of hate speech because, well, we don't all agree. Now I'm not here to come out and tell you that today's pick is going to drop to zero. What I am going to do is tell you it is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and you should do a little more digging before loading the boat.I was actually surprised to see  (NASDAQ:  -  )  as a Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell). For those of you who don't know, CDW Corporation provides information technology (IT) solutions to business, government, education, and healthcare organizations in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The company offers discrete hardware and software products, as well as integrated IT solutions, including mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization, and collaboration.Let me be clear here, things have been going fine over at CDW. However, analysts have been very silent about them recently. The last earnings estimate revision the company has seen took place sixty days ago. And that revision was to the downside where an analyst dropped their estimate for the current quarter down to 69 cents from 71 cents. While many other companies out there have seen estimates revised to the upside, the silence regarding CDW is what's troubling.Although critics will say that Apple (NASDAQ:  -  ) has lost some of its luster over the past few years, you better believe that investors will be paying attention when the world's largest publicly-traded company releases its fiscal second-quarter financial results in next week.The technology behemoth has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street so far this year, and shares are up nearly 12% in just the last 12 weeks. Of course, if Apple wants to continue that momentum, it will have to deliver another solid quarterly earnings report on May 2.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $3.36 per share and revenues of $78.4 billion, easily topping the respective consensus estimates of $3.22 and $76.9 billion. Total iPhone unit sales grew 5% to about 78.3 million in the all-important holiday quarter, and Services revenue-the segment that includes the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple Pay-surged 18%.So what's in store for Apple this quarter? Well, Apple guided for revenue between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, and our current consensus estimates call for revenue of $52.61 billion and earnings of $2.01 per share.Of course, earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be looking at when Apple reports. Check out these three additional things to expect:According to our consensus estimate, which compiles figures from 19 independent analysts, iPhone unit sales are expected to come in at 51.82 million this quarter. This is a slight uptick from the 51.2 million units sold in the year-ago quarter, and it should be encouraging to see continued growth in this segment after a brief stretch of slumping sales. Apple sold about 78.3 million iPhones in the previous quarter, which marked growth of about 5%.Last year, Apple reported sales of $12.49 billion in the Greater China region. However, based on the estimates of four analysts, our consensus estimate calls for sales of $11.41 billion in the region this quarter. China is Apple's second-largest market behind the Americas, but Chinese regulators have made operations more difficult for outside services that directly compete with the country's domestic offerings. Add these conditions to the uncertainty that has surrounded the Chinese economy recently, and it's easy to see why Apple might struggle in the region.As mentioned before, the growth of Apple's Services unit was one of the most impressive parts of its last report. This quarter, our consensus estimate-based on 20 separate estimates-calls for Services revenue of $6.78 billion this quarter. This would represent growth of 13.2% from last year's Q2 total of $5.99 billion. At least part of these gains can be attributed to the insane growth of Apple Music, the company's music streaming service that  has more than 40 million users.Every day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform (Bull) or underperform (Bear) the markets over the next 3-6 months.Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Instead, only 138,000 jobs were created last month according to the BLS, instead of the 185,000 expected. The prior month was revised lower too.But the market really didn't care.F or the second consecutive session, each of the major indices closed at record highs. The S&P climbed 0.37% to 2439.1, while the Dow was up 0.29% to 21,206.3 and the NASDAQ advanced 0.94% to 6305.8. This was a short week due to the Memorial Day holiday on Monday, and the first two sessions were pretty somber. But the market really caught fire on the back half.

The new buys are:\u2022 AquaVenture (WAAS) is a small-cap water company that went public in October 2016 but is down 30% year-to-date. Analysts feel that the stock is undervalued, as do a couple insiders (including the CEO) who bought shares over the past two weeks as a show of confidence.\u2022 CDK Global (CDK) is a dealer management system (DMS) company for the automotive sector that's in a transformation period right now. The CEO bought shares last week, possibly as a sign of confidence after the CFO resigned. With earnings expected to grow about 40% this fiscal year, Tracey says that CDK has  .\u2022 Weight Watchers (WTW) had a strong first quarter report thanks in large part to the collaboration with Oprah. Earnings are expected to rise 31% this year. A director bought twice since the earnings report, which is a really bullish sign since shares of WTW are at its highs rather than pulling back.The full commentary has A LOT more on all of today's moves. Shares of Athene Holding Ltd. (ATH) have dipped 10% after getting up to $55 on a strong earnings announcement. Steve thinks this selloff is overdone and that fair value is about $60 for this financial services and insurance firm. Plus, it is a Zacks Rank #2 from a highly-ranked industry with a Zacks VGM Score of B. Therefore, he added ATH to the portfolio on Friday. If the company can put together another solid quarter, the editor wouldn't be surprised to see this name get up to $70. Get more specifics in the write-up. Tech is STILL leading this market higher, and Kevin is ready to get back into RISK-ON mode again. On Friday, the editor returned to Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), a small-cap fiber optic networking products company that's on its way to becoming a mid-cap. Kevin is willing to ride the volatile waves with AAOI since he expects the stock to reach $100 by December\u2026and will be adding on any dips below $70. The portfolio will take a 7% allocation. Read the full write-up for a lot more on this pick. The portfolio added two sets of bull call spreads on Friday. First up, homebuilder Lennar (LEN) is breaking out of a bullish flagging pattern, and Kevin thinks this Zacks Rank #2 will eventually challenge its all-time high of $69. So the editor bought to open 2 Nov 52.50 Calls AND sold to open 2 Nov 57.50 Calls.Meanwhile, Kevin thinks a breakout is coming for IT company CDW (CDW), which has an upside breakout point around $61. The editor wants to be part of this move, so he bought to open 2 Sept. 60.00 Calls AND sold to open 2 Sept 65.00 Calls. Read the full writeup for more on both of these spreads. Tracey likes the container companies right now because this cyclical space seems ready for an uptrend amid strong global growth. For example, Triton (TRTN) blew past the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its first quarter report, and is expected to grow earnings by 174% in 2017 thanks in part to its merger with TAL. It also has low P/E and P/B ratios, along with a juicy dividend that yielding 6.2%. Due to all these factors, the editor feels that TRTN would be a good addition to the portfolio.

For those of you who don't know, CDW Corporation provides information technology (IT) solutions to business, government, education, and healthcare organizations in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The company offers discrete hardware and software products, as well as integrated IT solutions, including mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization, and collaboration.Let me be clear here, things have been going fine over at CDW. However, analysts have been very silent about them recently. The last earnings estimate revision the company has seen took place sixty days ago. And that revision was to the downside where an analyst dropped their estimate for the current quarter down to 69 cents from 71 cents. While many other companies out there have seen estimates revised to the upside, the silence regarding CDW is what's troubling.The stock has performed brilliantly YTD. The IT Services Industry ranks in the Top 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. YTD the industry is up 7.1%. Shares of CDW are outperforming the industry, up 13.3% so far this year. Other stocks in the same industry include Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks  and Shares of CDW are a bit overbought here with the Commodity Channel Index up at 166. Here just shy of $60 it's stalled out near its 52-week high for the second time this year. There is still a bullish trend line intact which was tested in mid-April. CDW will be reporting earnings before the market opens on May 3 rd . Analysts are expecting 71 cents EPS on $3.24 billion.Beyond our Bear Stock of the Day, today's list of 220 Zacks Rank #5 Strong Sells demand even more urgent attention. If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List, they should be removed immediately. Many appear to be sound investments but, since 1988, such stocks have actually performed more than 6X worse than the S&P 500.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

To some extent, this level compares unfavorably with what the industry witnessed over the last one year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 15.55 and is towards its higher end of the valuation range over this period. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/E perspective.The company also reported mixed fourth-quarter 2016 results wherein the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line surpassed the same.Furthermore, CDW has a highly leveraged balance sheet. The company had a total debt position (long and short) of $3.234 billion at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 (ended Dec 31, 2016). The company exited fiscal 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of $263.7 million, compared with $37.6 million in fiscal 2015. Net debt (i.e debt minus cash and cash equivalents) for fiscal 2016 came in at $2.97 billion. Since CDW has net debt available on its balance sheet, it will be difficult for the company to pursue strategic acquisitions, investment in growth initiatives and distribution to shareholders. Thus, it had to constantly generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt.Adding to the woes, the stock carries a VGM Score of \"C.\" Notably, the Zacks VGM Style Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum, across the board. Stocks with a VGM Style Score of 'A' or 'B' and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), have even better returns, on average, than the individual components, as it considers three times as many items that are correlated to future stocks returns.Also, competition from Insight Enterprises Inc.  and PC Connection, Inc.  , and pricing pressure remain headwinds.We expect the aforementioned factors to hurt the company's near-term profitability. Hence, we recommend investors to stay away from CDW shares until the Zacks Rank, VGM score and price improve.A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Seagate Technology plc  , carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Seagate has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 8.17%.If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

The company builds more secure organizations by creating visibility into clients' business operations.The company has a  (Value, Growth, Momentum) Score of 'A'. Per the value metric, Unisys is currently undervalued when compared with the industry. It holds a Value Score of 'A' which indicates that it is a good pick for value investors. The company currently has a Growth Score of 'A'. The company's estimates for the current year increased from $1.86 to $1.87 per share. Recent price changes and earnings estimate revisions indicate that this is a good stock for momentum investors as it has a Momentum Score of 'B'.The company is currently trading at a PE of 7.43x compared with the industry's PE of 18.20x. This indicates that the company's shares are undervalued compared with the industry and is expected to witness growth in the near future.Unisys intends to boost its top line and bottom line in the near term on the back of disciplined financial focus, appropriate implementation of ongoing vertical go-to-market strategy and unique product offerings. Notably, during fourth-quarter 2016, the company inked several contracts. All these deals would likely fortify its business in the quarters ahead.Unisys has been restructuring its business to improve profitability. The restructuring strategy includes selling non-core businesses and revamping its sales strategy along with investing in a few higher-growth areas such as outsourcing. Unisys saved approximately $205 million in 2016 through restructuring initiatives, exceeding its original target of $200 million. We expect the company to continue with its cost-control initiatives and put greater effort toward sales growth, as it strives to overcome its operational weaknesses. Unisys is focusing more on building specialized industry skills and resources required to win industry-specific project opportunities. The company is investing heavily in developing a team dedicated to pursuing growth opportunities for application-managed services, both for existing and new clients. These application-based managed services capability will enable Unisys to more effectively pursue long-term application outsourcing opportunities, as well as associated application modernization and implementation project work.The company underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry, with an average loss of 2% in the last 30 days compared with 0.6% decline of the latter. It remains focused on its strategic investments in high-potential products and services, to drive growth and boost results, going forward.Unisys currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, CDW Corp. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.82, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.33. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, CDW Corp.'s current PE level puts it above its midpoint (which stands at 15.33) over the past three years, with the number having been particularly volatile over the last one year.We should also point out that CDW Corp. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 16.07, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for CDW Corp. stock in the near term too.An often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn't take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company's management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company's stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, CDW Corp.'s P/CF ratio of 13.80 is significantly lower than the Zacks classified IT Services industry's average of 25.63, which indicates that the stock is largely undervalued in this respect.In aggregate, CDW Corp. currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'B', putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CDW Corp. a decent choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for CDW Corp. is just 2.01, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.24. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/S ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 0.63, which is far better than the industry average of 2.48. Clearly, CDW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Though CDW Corp. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'D' and a Momentum score of 'D'. This gives CDW a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'C'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's earnings estimates have been decidedly bullish. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and no downward revision in the same time period.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate as well, as the current quarter consensus estimate has improved 5.9% in the last sixty days, while the full year estimate has also moved north by 5.9% over the same time frame.You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | This bullish trend might be why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.CDW Corp. is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, with a strong industry rank (Top 15% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #2, the stock looks attractive at current valuations.In fact, over the last three years, the Zacks categorized IT Services industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:A good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the strong Zacks Rank, positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in CDW Corp. So we believe that value investors should consider investing in CDW Corp., as it is trading at an attractive valuation.In addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?Our experts cover all kinds of trades\u2026 from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

The information technology industry is presently undergoing a transition phase, forging new disruptive trends in cloud mobility, big data, social computing and increasing awareness of cyber security. In order to capitalize on the trends, Unisys is rationalizing its services and solution portfolio by shifting its offerings to cloud-based and software-as-a-service delivery models.Unisys is also concentrating on business opportunities in fewer, more profitable sectors in the IT marketplace. To drive future growth, the company is focusing its resources and investments in four targeted, high-potential market areas, including security (IT security and physical security), data center transformation and outsourcing services, end-user outsourcing and support services, and applications modernization and outsourcing services.

Following the release, the stock has declined significantly. To some investors, choosing the stock may appear to be a no-brainer because right after an earnings release, a company is almost always on investors' radar. While better-than-expected results make the stock a good pick, lower-than-expected results dampen investors' spirit. So, the period following earnings releases is often marked by high market activity.Palo Alto Networks reported its quarterly numbers after the market closed on Feb 28, following which its shares have plunged approximately 25% so far. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also fell short of the guidance range, primarily due to weak go-to-market execution. | Furthermore, the decelerating revenue growth trend makes investors slightly cautious about Palo Alto's near-term performance. Notably, the company has witnessed over 50% growth in quarterly revenues for nearly two years except in the past two quarters. During first- and second-quarter fiscal 2017, the year-over-year growth rates were 34% and 26.3%, respectively.Moreover, Palo Alto's revenue growth guidance range of 17-20% for third-quarter fiscal 2017 has increased concerns about its growth prospects. Additionally, the company's billings growth rate of 22% during fiscal second quarter was also much lower than the previous two quarters' growth rates of 33% and 45%.Notably, in the year so far, the stock has been down roughly 8.4%, underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 5.3%.In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2017 witnessed downward revisions. Four of the six analysts covering the stock revised their estimates downward for fiscal third quarter, while five of the seven analysts have made downward estimate revision for fiscal 2017.For fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 42 cents per share, wider than the loss of 29 cents projected 30 days ago. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is currently pegged at a loss of $1.28 cents per share compared with a loss of $1.04 projected 30 days ago.Though near-term prospects of Palo Alto Networks look gloomy, we believe that the company's consistent product refreshes and acquisitions synergies will boost revenues over the long run. Also, customer wins, along with expansion of the existing customer base, are other positives. The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure, which, we believe will prove to be a primary growth factor.Currently, Palo Alto Networks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some stocks in the IT-Services space worth considering are CDW Corporation  , Computer Task Group, Inc.  and Wix.com Ltd.  , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see  .CDW has witnessed upward estimate revisions in the last 30 days.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 6 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $47.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $58.00. The standard deviation is $4.764.But the whole reason to look at the  CDW price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new September 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $47.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $51.98/share today.Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.40% return on the cash commitment, or 8.46% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.25. If an investor was to purchase shares of CDW stock at the current price level of $51.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.14% if the stock gets called away at the September 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDW shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDW's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.33% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.78% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 25%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $51.98) to be 23%.

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, CDW Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.94. This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.84. If we focus on the stock's long-term PE trend, the current level puts CDW Corporation's current PE ratio above its midpoint of 15.08 over the past three years.However, the stock's PE compares favorably with the Zacks classified Computer & Technology sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.25. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that CDW Corporation has a forward PE of a little less - 16.43 - so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for CDW Corporation stock in the near term too. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, CDW Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 0.58. This is way lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 2.84 right now, indicating significant room for an upside move.An often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn't take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company's management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company's stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, CDW Corporation's P/CF ratio of 13.06 is considerably lower than the Zacks classified IT - Services industry average of 25.75, which indicates that the stock is significantly undervalued in this respect.In aggregate, CDW Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'A', putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CDW Corporation a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for CDW Corporation is 2.05, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 2.06. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Clearly, CDW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Though CDW Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'A' and a Momentum score of 'C'. This gives AAPL a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'A'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 1.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen by 1.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.CDW Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past two years, the IT - Services industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 6 different analyst targets contributing to that average for CDW Corp, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $46.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $50.00.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["e are in the thick of the second-quarter earnings season, with as many as 1000 companies, including 116 S&P 500 members, scheduled to post their financial numbers this week.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new September 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of 90 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $29.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.98/share today.Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 21% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 83%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDW stock at the current price level of $37.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.77% if the stock gets called away at the September 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDW shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDW's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%.

A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, CDW's recent annualized dividend of 0.43/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 1.19% based upon the recent $36.22 share price.A bullish investor could look at CDW's 28.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Notably, the company has executed 21 acquisitions over the last ten years.Watts Water's acquisition strategy mainly aims at acquiring businesses that manufacture preferred brand name or specified products that address water quality, water conservation, water safety, water flow control, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) and related complementary markets.

Buyers in that offering made a considerable investment into the company, expecting that their investment would go up over the course of time and based on early trading on Thursday, the stock is now 11.2% above the offering price. It should be noted that investors at the secondary have collected $0.07/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently up 11.4% on their purchase from a total return basis.Investors who did not participate in the offering but would be a buyer of CDW at a cheaper price, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the June 2016 put at the $35 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 90 cents. That would result in a cost basis of $34.10 per share before broker commissions in the scenario where the contract is exercised. If the contract is never exercised, the put seller would still keep the premium, which represents a 2.6% return against the $35.00 purchase commitment, or a 4.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Secondaries can often present buying opportunities for bullish investors interested in purchasing shares, because the sudden extra supply of stock tends to require that the offering be priced at an attractive discount to where the stock had previously been trading before the offering announcement. That can also introduce near-term volatility which improves the premiums a put seller can achieve. Selling a put does not give an investor access to CDW's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. The chart below shows the one year performance of CDW shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, CDW's low point in its 52 week range is $32.25 per share, with $46.92 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $42.71.The current annualized dividend paid by CDW Corp is $0.43/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend has an upcoming ex-date of 11/23/2015. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for CDW, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 1.0% annualized yield is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, CDW makes up 2.81% of the Guru Index ETF (Symbol: GURU) which is trading lower by about 0.7% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["echnology giant,  has won a contract from one of the largest financial institutions of Norway, DNB Bank, for transforming the latter's application landscape.

These moves, once believed to be strategic, are now being considered ineffective as SunEdison does not have the financial strength to fund the projects. The acquisitions have taken a toll on the company's balance sheet with total outstanding debt nearly doubling to $10.7 billion at the end of second-quarter 2015 from $5.4 billion a year ago.This resulted in a massive increase in interest expenses. In the first half of 2015, the company spent $302 million on interest expenses compared with $160 million in the comparable year-ago period. Apart from this, the company has been incurring losses due to higher operating expenses.Due to increased costs, the company posted adjusted loss of $216 million or 74 cents per share in the second quarter. In the first quarter, the company incurred non-GAAP net loss of $64.2 million or 25 cents. We expect these factors to continue to hurt SunEdison's third-quarter results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that SunEdison will beat earnings this quarter.

Earnings ESP for SunEdison is -11.29%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 69 cents per share which is wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 62 cents.

Despite the persistent macro uncertainty, the company seems positive backed by a healthy security market, strong product line-up, deal wins and investment plans which should boost results in the to-be-reported quarter.FireEye's previous quarterly results show that it is gaining from the increasing demand for cyber security. Notably, the company has been witnessing a higher number of large deal signings over the past few quarters which should positively impact third-quarter results.With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, which has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, while making it all the more necessary for the organizations to enforce data security measures.Furthermore, since the beginning of 2015, numerous data breaches at high-profile business houses and government agencies prompted the need to impose tighter security measures, which in turn boosted the demand for cyber security products. Per Gartner, worldwide spending on IT security in 2014 was about $70 billion and is likely to reach $76.9 billion in 2015.Additionally, in the first half of 2015, FireEye and VISA  collaborated to create tools and services to protect against cyber attacks.

The exponential increase in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals have compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors.Cloud computing consists of the entire gamut of computing intelligence required to carry out day-to-day operations by companies and professionals. Thus other than the hardware, all the supporting technology involved in creating, storing, retrieving, transporting, protecting, sorting, processing, analyzing and presenting information from multiple sources and formats, which when available from a shared (private) or public pool, could be referred to as cloud computing.Cloud service providers therefore help organizations to store data and applications remotely in this pool, which can be accessed from anywhere, anytime via the Internet. Given its scope and advantages (cost, scaling, convenience, etc), the demand for cloud computing software and applications will continue to increase.According to Centaur Partners, the Software-as-a-Service and cloud-based business applications are likely to grow from $13.5 billion in 2013 to $32.8 billion in 2016, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5%. Moreover, Computerworld forecasts that 42% IT decision makers are planning to increase cloud computing budget in 2015.

Initiatives such as these are also likely to have a positive impact on the upcoming results.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity's ACA dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind for the company in the long run.However, stiff competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing competitors such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  , Oracle Corporation and SAP SE remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paylocity is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

The company currently provides its services to 42,000 businesses in over 124 countries worldwide. With such a huge client base, the company is expected to post impressive earnings numbers in the third quarter.The company had reported encouraging second-quarter results, with the top line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though the company posted a loss, the reported figure was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.MINDBODY's gross margin for the second quarter was 64.4%, up from 57.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year growth in gross margin was primarily due to a higher revenue base.Furthermore, significant investments in growth areas for improving implementation timelines, particularly for web and mobile applications products, will boost profitability going forward. This is likely to be reflected on the company's third-quarter earnings as well.Our proven model does not conclusively show that MINDBODY is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below. The Earnings ESP for MINDBODY is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 27 cents per share. MINDBODY has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks with (Zacks Rank #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some other companies, which are worth considering, as our model shows that they have the right combination of these two elements:CDW Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2CenturyLink, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank #2CyberArk Software, Ltd.  has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and a Zacks Rank #2Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company's significant exposure to high-end corporate desktop and digital education implementation also remains a positive.We believe that the company's strong position at medium to large businesses, focus on small & medium businesses and customer additions to increase market share are encouraging.

The company reported encouraging second quarter results, with the top line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though the company posted a loss, it was narrower than the consensus mark.During the second quarter, Zillow's top line grew on a year-over-year basis primarily due to the Trulia acquisition. Also, a 29% surge in Marketplace revenues and a 15% jump in Display revenues drove the quarter's results.We believe that strong traffic growth, frequent product launches and the growing Agent business are positives, going forward. In particular, product launches like Zillow Real Estate and Zillow Digs App for Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPhone and iPad are positives.Moreover, the Trulia acquisition will not only make Zillow the number one online real estate information provider in the U.S., but also help it to compete against Move Inc., which has now been acquired by News Corp.Apart from acquisitions, Zillow entered into several partnerships with real estate listing companies and real estate brokers to enhance its product portfolio.

These moves, once believed to be strategic, are now being considered ineffective as SunEdison does not have the financial strength to fund the projects. The acquisitions have taken a toll on the company's balance sheet with total outstanding debt nearly doubling to $10.7 billion at the end of second-quarter 2015 from $5.4 billion a year ago.This resulted in a massive increase in interest expenses. In the first half of 2015, the company spent $302 million on interest expenses compared with $160 million in the comparable year-ago period. Apart from this, the company has been incurring losses from the semiconductor business and higher operating expenses.Due to increased costs, the company posted adjusted loss of $216 million or 74 cents per share in the second quarter. In the first quarter, the company incurred non-GAAP net loss of $64.2 million or 25 cents. We expect these factors to continue to hurt SunEdison's third-quarter results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that SunEdison will beat earnings this quarter.

Despite the persistent macro uncertainty, the company seems positive on the back of a healthy security market, strong product line-up, deal wins and investment plans which should boost results in the to-be-reported quarter.Earlier results show that AVG Technologies is gaining from the rising demand for cyber security. Notably, the company has been witnessing a higher number of large deal signings over the past few quarters which should positively impact third-quarter results.With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy. While BYOD has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, it has become all the more necessary for companies to enforce stringent data security measures.Furthermore, since the beginning of 2015, numerous data breaches at high-profile business houses and government agencies prompted the need to impose tighter security measures, which in turn boosted the demand for cyber security products. Per Gartner, worldwide spending on IT security in 2014 was about $70 billion and is likely to reach $76.9 billion in 2015.Additionally, AVG Technologies closed a number of acquisitions so far this year, the biggest being Location Labs. The synergies from these acquisitions are expected to act as a tailwind for the company.However, an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressure from Symantec Corporation  and currency headwinds are likely to have a negative impact on the third-quarter results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that AVG Technologies will beat estimates this quarter.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all spilled more than 8%.On the other hand, like I showed you back in late August,  . And the new numbers rolling in still show a growing economy as employers hire more workers and consumers load up on homes and cars.In other words, this downturn has little to do with the U.S. economy. And that means there are plenty of companies - and stocks - that are bucking the market trend.You just have to know how to peer through the \"noise\" and pick them.And today, I'm going to show you five  that sailed peacefully through the third-quarter sell-off.But there are still loads of reasons to be optimistic about the\nU.S. economy - and about your ability to pick good investments.I'm well aware that Wall Street is worried about the U.S. Federal Reserve's intent to raise interest rates by the end of the year - and you bet I know that China's growth has cooled.But there are still loads of reasons to be optimistic about the U.S. economy - and about your ability to pick good investments.Let's start with the macro view.The U.S. Department of Commerce says the economy entered the third quarter on a strong note. Last week, the agency revised its GDP estimates upward to show seasonally adjusted growth of 3.9%.The revised forecast comes as we continue to see strength in two of the economy's more important sectors - housing and autos.Commerce Department officials say sales of new single-family homes ran at an annual pace of 552,000 in August. That's the strongest showing in 7.5 years and represented a 22% annual gain.On top of that, the auto industry said September sales came in at an annual rate of 18 million cars and light-duty trucks. The industry is now on pace to achieve its highest sales since 2000.But consumers aren't just buying autos and homes. They're also picking up smartphones, tablets, laptops, Wi-Fi routers, set-top boxes, and digital cameras - and their insurance companies are picking up the tab for plenty of prescription drugs and medical devices.Given these economic trends, it should be no surprise that several tech stocks absolutely crushed it in the otherwise dreary third quarter.Take a look\u2026While I remain upbeat about biotech for the long haul, the sector was down 18% in the quarter as measured by the bellwether iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (Nasdaq: IBB). Much of the carnage occurred just a couple of weeks ago after leading Democrats criticized high drug prices.But The Medicines Co. (Nasdaq: MDCO) soared some 44% in the seven sessions ended Sept. 2 after the mid-cap leader reported that a new drug it's developing, called ALN-PCSsc, improved \"bad\" cholesterol levels by 83% in early clinical trials.That prompted Jeffries to upgrade the stock on Aug. 28 to a \"Buy,\" which helped MDCO hold onto most of those gains (it's up 32.7% for the entire quarter).Founded in Southern California in 1979, Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI) is one of the world's leading publishers of computer games. It has been coming on strong over the last two years with a series of winning titles that take advantage of the upgrade cycle for gaming consoles.Activision boasts winning titles for both Xbox from Microsoft Inc. (Nasdaq: MSFT) and PlayStation from Sony Corp. (NYSE ADR: SNE). This helps explain why the stock is up 84% in the past two years - and 27.6% in the quarter.The third quarter was so successful because investors anticipated surging sales for the holiday shopping season. Activision will release the latest installment in its popular \"Call of Duty\" game series Nov. 6.CDW Corp. (Nasdaq: CDW) benefited from three main catalysts in the quarter, during which it gained 19.2%.First, the information technology (  ) sales and service firm has little exposure to China. Second, in mid-July, it reported a 25% annual earnings increase. And third, there's a tech upgrade cycle among businesses, particularly healthcare firms that need to improve their tech systems to meet the reporting requirements of Obamacare.Besides healthcare, CDW's 250,000 clients span the spectrum of business sectors as well as education and government.Motorola Solutions Inc. (NYSE: MSI), a mobile communications and infrastructure firm, is closing in on its fifth anniversary as an independent company following its January 2011 spin-off from Motorola Inc.It's benefiting from increased sales of two-way radios, cellular communications, and networking gear for public agencies and first responders. Part of that stems from a years-long national program to upgrade wireless communications for public safety agencies in the aftermath of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina.In August, private equity firm Silver Lake said it will invest up to $1 billion in Motorola Solutions to help fund the company's growth. The company, which saw gains of 19.3% in the quarter, recently announced a new Wi-Fi-enabled radio and a smartwatch.Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG, GOOGL) outperformed the market - gaining 18% in the quarter - for several reasons.At the top of the list is a  , including a new parent company called Alphabet Inc. With the corporate facelift, Google's futuristic projects - including driverless cars and space exploration - will be housed in separate companies under the Alphabet umbrella.Google also announced second-quarter earnings gains of 38%. During a conference call with analysts, new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat wowed Wall Street with her emphasis on cost control.And the company named a new CEO for Google, Sundar Pichai, who will run the core businesses: the Android operating system, the mammoth search operation, and YouTube.The huge gains these five tech stocks racked up over the past three months proves that if you focus on finding the right stocks, you can make money in good times and bad. .

The revenue forecast is expected to be in the range of $166-$168 million. Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be between ($0.03) to $0.02 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and loss are pegged at $171 million and 15 cents per share, respectively.Stratasys' soft revenue guidance reflects unfavorable currency exchange rate and weak performance at its MakerBot business.The company revealed that revenues from its MakerBot business have plunged 57% on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter mainly due to overall market weakness coupled with continuous weakness related to the restructuring of its business.Additionally, some customers are delaying their purchases owing to the current economic conditions. In the 3D printer business, majority of customers have gravitated toward the lower-priced uPrint, which may affect the company's margins in the to-be-reported quarter and beyond.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Stratasys is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Definite terms of the offering, including the interest rate and exact principal amount, will be dependent on market conditions prevailing at the time of pricing.The net proceeds generated from the offering will be employed toward general corporate purposes. This may include savings and funding cost reduction initiatives, obligations under defined benefit plans and investments in services and technologies. Also, the issuance will build up liquidity, which will be needed to fund the cash expenses of Unisys' $300 million restructuring program, including a significant reduction in workforce that will result in huge cash severance payments.Leading credit rating agency Moody's rated the new senior secured notes at Ba2. Ba2 is a speculative grade rating and indicates the presence of substantial credit risk.Following the closing of the new offering, Moody's anticipates to upgrade Unisys' existing 6.25% senior notes due 2017 to Ba2 from B1. The upgrade shall reflect the fact that the existing notes, which were unsecured, will share the collateral package backing the new notes.The collateral package consists of a first lien on the company's domestic assets, but excludes the senior secured revolver's collateral of cash and accounts receivable, and a pledge of stock on direct foreign subsidiaries. This will be enhanced by a second lien on the revolver's collateral.Moody's affirmed Unisys' Corporate Family Rating of B1, but the outlook remained negative. The rating and negative outlook reflect Unisys' significant underfunded pension liability, modest free cash flow and its huge ongoing operating restructuring program, which comes with considerable execution risks.Unisys currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The closing price represents a robust one-year return of 28.5% and a year-to-date return of 14.6%.Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is roughly 1,154K. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has a market cap of $6.56B and a long-term expected growth rate of 8%Some of the optimism related to CDW shares may be attributed to the company's encouraging second-quarter of 2015 results announced on Aug 3. Shares of the company moved up 4.5% since the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, wherein both the top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.CDW's second-quarter revenues not only increased 6.7% year over year to $3.31 billion, but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.24 billion. The year-over-year improvement was attributed to better-than-expected growth in the U.S. IT market and customer channels coupled with constant strategic achievements.The company's second-quarter adjusted earnings (excluding amortization of intangibles and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation expenses) of 78 cents per share also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, earnings were up 20%.Moreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive. It currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. CDW currently trades at a forward P/E of 13.83x as against the industry group average of 26.60x.Additionally, CDW's enriched product portfolio and product refreshes continue to drive growth. The company's significant exposure to high-end corporate desktop and digital education implementation also remains a positive.We believe that the company's strong position at medium to large businesses, focus on small & medium businesses and customer additions to increase market share are encouraging. The company's effort to pay off debt is a positive.However, a highly leveraged balance sheet, pricing pressure and competition from Insight Enterprises Inc.  , Apple Inc.  and PC Connection, Inc.  remain headwinds.Over the last 60 days, two out of four estimates for fiscal 2015 were revised upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2015 increased 5.7% to $2.80 over the same time frame.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Inovalon's share price gained almost 2.4% to close at $21.69 following the news.Inovalon's cloud-based data analytics platform will help Wellcare identify loopholes in its services. The platform is capable of processing huge amount of data in almost real-time, which will help Wellcare provide better quality service to its members.Clinical and quality outcomes have gained significant importance in Medicare Advantage, managed Medicaid, Commercial, accountable care organizations (ACOs) and other value-based programs. The Inovalon-Wellspace collaboration reflects growing number of cloud-based data analysis providers in the healthcare space.Of late, Inovalon's solutions are also being picked by IT giants like Hewlett Packard  apart from health plan providers like the Independent Health Association and FamilyCare Health.Meanwhile, Independent Health Association (IHA), one of the highest ranking health plans in the U.S., extended its relationship with Inovalon to develop solutions focused on disease and comorbidity data. These solutions will help IHA gain clarity on disease conditions and comorbidity progression.Inovalon also recently extended its business ties with FamilyCare Health. Under the extended arrangement, Inovalon's solutions will help in providing patient disease insight, risk score accuracy, financial performance and regulatory data compliance for FamilyCare Health's Medicare Advantage members.In July this year, Inovalon and H-P joined forces to offer analytics solution to State of Georgia Department of Community Health's (DCH) Medicaid and PeachCare for Kids programs.We believe that these partnerships with existing as well as new clients will continue to drive Inovalon's revenues. In the second quarter of 2015 (ended Jun 30), the company's revenues increased $16.6 million or 17% year over year. Of this, 57% came from new clients while extended contracts contributed the remaining.Management at Inovalon noted that the average time frame for existing clients to request additional services has trimmed down to 7.4 months in the first half of 2015 from 16 months in the year-ago period. This clearly hints at the growing popularity of Inovalon's solutions among its existing customer base.In a separate development, Inovalon completed the acquisition of advisory services and business intelligence (BI) solutions provider Avalere Health. The buyout has helped Inovalon add approximately 200 pharma/life sciences clients in the broader healthcare space.

Another week brings another edition of the biggest breakout stocks to buy. These breakouts are happening in Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks that have a Momentum Style Score of \"A\" or \"B.\" What does that mean? That means these stocks have had earnings estimate revisions to the upside recently. Analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on these stocks and the market is beginning to notice.Let's face it, the average investor doesn't have the access to data, research and reports that a covering analysts does at the big Wall Street firms. Wouldn't you love to be a fly on the wall in some of those offices? Well since we're not the NSA or some other covert spy agency the best we can do is read what those analysts put out. At Zacks, we've got a time-tested strategy to best the market that's based on the earnings estimate revisions of these analysts. That's a pretty smart way to figure out what Wall Street is thinking and put yourself ahead of the curve.Armed with that knowledge we look for a specific type of chart pattern. What we want to see is a market that's reacting to these recent earnings estimate revisions. The change in the attitude on the street should change investor's perceptions of the stocks. This change in perception should lead to a different concept of fair value for the stock. By looking for breakouts, we're finding stocks where price action in probing higher in search of a new fair value. We don't need to know exactly where that level is, we just need to make sure we're strapped up for the ride.Don't worry about all that heavy lifting. Every week I put it together for you right here. Today I've got five fantastic stock ideas for you to take a look at. They are on the move, backed by the sound logic and historical performance of the Zacks Rank.Axcelis Technologies is a leading producer of ion implantation equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors. The company also produces dry strip, photostabilization and rapid thermal processing equipment, which is used in semiconductor manufacturing primarily before and after the ion implantation process.The recent breakout for ACLS burst through a downward channel that took shares from $3.20 to $2.70. The bullish behavior leapfrogged the 21-day moving average as the CCI broke through the zero line. The probe higher to $3.40 has pulled back to the May high and it looks like ACLS is poised for the next leg higher.Comfort Systems USA, Inc. is a national provider of comprehensive heating, ventilation and air conditioning installation, maintenance, repair and replacement services. They operate primarily in the commercial and industrial HVAC markets, and perform most of their services within manufacturing plants, office buildings, retail centers, apartment complexes, and healthcare, education and government facilities.Comfort Systems shares have been on a steady incline for most of the year. The latest earnings beat is what's propelled them to the $30 level. Volumes have increased and it looks like the buyers are stepping in on this short term dip from the highs.CDW Corporation offers information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers primarily in the United States and Canada. Its hardware products comprise network communications, notebooks/mobile devices, data storage, video monitors, printers, desktops and servers as well as NetComm products. The company's software services include licensing, licensing management, software solutions and services.An extended consolidation earlier in the year saw lots of volume go out between $36 and$39. During the springtime shares broke down from the top of that range all the way to $33. Then the buyers stepped in, pushing CDW over the 21-day moving average. As expected there was a bit of resistance at the top of the previous range but it looks like buyers are making an assault on $40.CubeSmart is a self-administered and self-managed real estate company focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of self-storage facilities in the United States. Its self-storage facilities are designed to offer storage space for residential and commercial customers.For a good six months shares of Cube were locked between $22.50 and $25. Recently the top of the trading range has broken as shares entered a bullish trend supported by the 21-day moving average. For two months now it's been slowly and steadily breaking to new highs. Stops can be placed just south of the 21-day.Service Corp. is the largest provider of funeral and cemetery services in the world. The funeral and cemetery operations consist of the Company's funeral service locations, cemeteries and related businesses. The financial services operations represent a combination of the Company's insurance operations primarily related to the funding of prearranged funeral contracts and a lending subsidiary, which previously provided capital financing for independent funeral home and cemetery operations.This chart looks very similar to Cube in that there was a tight trading range that got broken to the upside recently. But shares of Service Corp have been in a sustained uptrend much longer than Cube. The CCI continues to bounce at bullish levels further confirming the trend.These top breakout stocks to buy are pushing higher to fresh highs nearly every day. You can hop on for a quick profit while these stocks look for a new fair value. With the Zacks Rank you've got the momentum of the analysts on Wall Street, with the chart you have price momentum, and with me you get all the momentum stock strategy.Zacks \"Profit from the Pros\" e-mail newsletter provides highlights of the latest analysis from Zacks Equity Research.  .

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .To term the third quarter of 2015 as a bloodbath for stocks would not be too off the mark. The robust gains on the final day of the quarter -- Sep 30 -- were ironic, as third quarter performance happened to be the worst quarter since 2011.The nosedive in the financial markets was not confined to the US, but markets across the globe faced a thumping at regular intervals. However, a major reason for the global plunge was growth fears emerging out of the second biggest economy, China.In the third quarter, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq slumped 7.6%, 7% and 7.4%, respectively. The Dow registered its third-consecutive quarter of losses and S&P 500 slumped for the second straight quarter. Though July saw modest gains, markets were walloped in August with benchmarks losing at least 6.3%. September was not kind either toward investors, leading to the first quarter in 2015 when all three benchmarks ended in the red.The Dow was the weakest among fellow benchmarks in July, but its 1.5% loss in September was the least compared to S&P 500 and Nasdaq's losses of 2.7% and 3.4%. Had markets not registered its consolation gains on the final day of the quarter, the losses would have looked even more concerning.A key factor of the third quarter has been market volatility. Markets witnessed extreme fluctuations and  . The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) proves the year's market volatility. VIX scaled to a high of 40.74 on Aug 24, skyrocketing 45.3%. VIX had dropped to this dangerous range during the 2008 financial crisis and also in Aug 2011 when Congress and President Obama were struggling over the debt-ceiling crisis. After a decline of 27.8% in July, the VIX had shot up nearly 135% in a turbulent August.VIX's multi-year high coincided with the rout that markets suffered in late August. The Dow had entered correction territory on Aug 21, after declining 10.1% from its record high in May. The blue-chip index witnessed the first correction after 1,326 calendar days.Combined with the record losses on Aug 24, the S&P 500 also entered the correction territory, while the Dow declined to an 18-month closing low. On Aug 25, the S&P 500 was down 12.4% from its peak. Meanwhile, over 253 S&P 500 stocks had lost over 20% from their peaks, according to S&P Capital IQ.Among the 10 S&P 500 industry, only Utilities sector finished in the green in third quarter. Its 3-month gain was 2.3%. The biggest loser was the Energy sector and was closely followed by Materials sector. They lost 19.9% and 19%, respectively.It was not only the US markets that made investors feel the worst financial pain in four years, but the sell off was widespread in the global markets. In fact much of the blame must be put on China growth worries, which intensified global concerns and led to the rout.The market rout has dragged China's key benchmark down to 3K level now. The Shanghai Composite Index had crossed the 5K level in early June. Looking at the other key economies, Japan's Nikkei has slumped 14.5% in the Jul-Sep period, while FTSE 100 has nosedived over 7% and Germany's DAX plunged 11.7%.  was hardly a catalyst to counter the negative factors affecting global markets.China disappointed markets following drop in profits of Chinese industrial companies, lower-than-expected investment and factory output, dismal manufacturing data, significant trade gap and decline in foreign exchange reserves among other dismal reports. Asian Development Bank's (ADB) weak economic outlook for China also dented investor sentiment.Let's find out how the key economic events unfolded on month by month basis.Markets managed to register gains in July despite weak earnings and international growth concerns. China's equity markets underwent a significant downturn, heightening investor concerns. Meanwhile,  remained southbound, leading to losses for the sector. According to the \"advance\" estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the second quarter GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.3%, short of expectations of 2.7% growth. However, this was more than the revised 0.6% growth in the first quarter. A total of 223,000 jobs were added in June, lower than the consensus estimate of 227,000. The tally was less than May's downwardly revised job number of 254,000. Unemployment rate came in at 5.3% in June, its lowest level in over seven years. The unemployment rate was narrower than the consensus estimate of 5.4%. Both the ISM Manufacturing and Services indexes increased more than expected. PPI increased beyond expectations and the CPI also increased, boosting the annual rate of inflation for the first time this year. Industrial production also increased. Overall, housing data released in July indicated a healthy pace of growth. However, retail sales declined 0.3% in June. The FOMC's two-day policy meeting gave no clear indication on the timing of the first rate hike. Nonetheless, the door for a September rate hike was kept open. However, in a testimony before Congress, Fed chair Janet Yellen said she expects the U.S. economy to strengthen and the central bank to hike interest rates \"at some point this year.\" After much heartburn for investors, Greece reached an agreement with its lenders on a bailout deal during the middle of July. Among other terms of the agreement, Greece needs to broaden its tax structure and improve long-term sustainability of pension schemes. : Chinese government agencies' efforts to curb the selloff were not very successful. The slump in China's equity market plagued investors through July. During a trading day in July, the Shanghai Composite had tanked 8.6%, recording its worst one-day slide since Feb 2007. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said China Securities Finance Corp. will buy more small-cap stocks to stabilize the market. The CSRC vowed to prevent \"systematic risks\" by purchasing more shares. As the measures failed, the Shanghai Composite slumped 15% over the month of July.Markets experienced a turbulent month, weighed down by concerns about China and uncertainty over the timing of a rate hike. Benchmarks also closed in the red following the yuan's devaluation. A slump in oil prices also weighed on energy stocks before a rebound in prices late in the month. The Dow recorded its biggest monthly decline in more than five years. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq registered their steepest monthly losses since May 2012. According to the second estimate, GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.7%, more than the consensus estimate of an increase by 3.2%. This rise in second quarter GDP was more than the first quarters' increase in real GDP of 0.6%. The U.S. economy created a total of 215,000 jobs in July. The tally was less than June's upwardly revised job numbers of 231,000. However, the unemployment rate in July remained unchanged from June's seven-year low rate of 5.3%. Positive economic data in August included factory orders, ISM services index and durable orders and retail sales. Industrial production increased 0.6% in July, the largest increase in eight months. However, ISM Manufacturing Index, construction spending and personal consumption were disappointing. Inflation continued to remain a cause for concern. The housing industry continued to pick up pace, as evident from the numbers released in the month. The oil slide continued for most of the month before staging a dramatic rebound in the last week. Price of WTI crude oil had dropped to $39 a barrel for the first time since Feb 2009. Brent crude oil fell below the $43 mark for the first time since Mar 2009. However in the last week, Brent crude prices posted its largest one day percentage gain since Dec 31, 2008.Oil prices drew strength after short sellers started buying oil companies, banking on upbeat GDP data. Crude futures logged a monthly gain of 4% in August, settling at $49.20 per barrel - their highest point in almost 6 weeks. Minutes of the FOMC meeting held on Jul 28 and 29 revealed that the majority of policymakers \"judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they noted that conditions were approaching that point.\" Separately, several market watchers had opined that a September rate hike was unlikely. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer commented that a September rate hike was \"pretty strong\" before China devalued its currency. The largest devaluation of the yuan in nearly 20 years triggered a worldwide decline in stocks. All three U.S. benchmarks fell by at least 1%. European stocks also felt the heat. Germany stocks were hit the hardest, with the benchmark DAX 30 falling 2.4%. Also, dismal data aggravated losses for China stocks which weighed on investor sentiment in the U.S. China's main stock index moved into the red for the year, while it plunged almost 38% from its peak in mid-June. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) decided to cut interest rates for the fifth time since November.Markets experienced another difficult month, weighed down by the familiar concerns surrounding China, oil prices as well as soft domestic economic data. Most domestic economic numbers were a cause for concern except for GDP data and the unemployment rate. While uncertainty about the timing of a rate hike dominated in the first half, eventually the Fed stayed away from hiking rates. According to \"third estimate\", the economy grew at a pace of 3.9%, higher than the consensus estimate and previously projected growth of 3.7%.Separately, the U.S. economy created a total of 173,000 jobs in August, less than the consensus estimate of 216,000. This also marked the slowest increase in job creations since March. However, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in August, its lowest level since Apr 2008. The ISM Manufacturing Index, construction spending, factory orders and capacity utilization, industrial production all came in below expectations. Industrial production declined 0.4% instead of expectations of a 0.2% decline. PPI remained flat while CPI moved south. Durable orders contracted by 2%, instead of expectations of a 2.2% fall. Housing data was largely disappointing, indicating uneven growth across regions and rising prices which were deterring homebuyers. Chinese government's provided reassurances that it would work toward boosting its sluggish economy. But the flood of poor economic numbers continued. China's fixed-asset investment growth was the weakest in about 15 years. Profits in Chinese industrial companies dropped 8.8% from the year-ago level in August. Oil prices fell significantly after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) trimmed its WTI crude oil price projections for 2015 and 2016. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts lowered their oil price forecast through next year. A 2-week winning streak ended on Sep 11 as prices lost over 3% for the week. Dismal data from China also weighed on prices. WTI prices, based on the front-month contracts, lost 8.4% for the month and were 24% lower for the quarter. Biotech companies were under pressure even before Hillary Clinton made her far reaching comments on the sector. However, the slump intensified after U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said she will lay out a plan to restrict \"price gouging\" in the specialty drugs market. iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) registered a weekly loss of 13.2% for the week ending Sep 25, witnessing its worst weekly performance in seven years. : The  is what was prominent ahead of the September's FOMC meeting. Eventually, the FOMC cited weak global growth scenario and low inflation rate as the main reasons behind their decision to not hike rates in September. The Fed continues to wait for \"further improvement in the labor market\" and inflation to \"rise to 2% in the medium term.\" Separately, though the Fed raised its outlook for economic growth for this year, it trimmed projections for 2016 and 2017.However, Yellen later indicated that the lift-off option is very much on the table later this year. She was also optimistic about the US economy. She added: \"Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently anticipate that achieving these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter.\"Amid the gloom, there are certain top Zacks Rank stocks that have done exceedingly well and negated broader markets' concerns.I ran a screen on  for companies with the following parameters:(  ): (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here:  )Here are the top 5 stocks that made it through this screen: (  ) provides aircraft leasing and lease management services.

These breakouts are happening in Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks that have a Momentum Style Score of \"A\" or \"B.\" What does that mean? That means these stocks have had earnings estimate revisions to the upside recently. Analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on these stocks and the market is beginning to notice.Let's face it, the average investor doesn't have the access to data, research and reports that a covering analysts does at the big Wall Street firms. Wouldn't you love to be a fly on the wall in some of those offices? Well since we're not the NSA or some other covert spy agency the best we can do is read what those analysts put out. At Zacks, we've got a time-tested strategy to best the market that's based on the earnings estimate revisions of these analysts. That's a pretty smart way to figure out what Wall Street is thinking and put yourself ahead of the curve.Armed with that knowledge we look for a specific type of chart pattern. What we want to see is a market that's reacting to these recent earnings estimate revisions. The change in the attitude on the street should change investor's perceptions of the stocks. This change in perception should lead to a different concept of fair value for the stock. By looking for breakouts, we're finding stocks where price action in probing higher in search of a new fair value. We don't need to know exactly where that level is, we just need to make sure we're strapped up for the ride.Don't worry about all that heavy lifting. Every week I put it together for you right here. Today I've got five fantastic stock ideas for you to take a look at. They are on the move, backed by the sound logic and historical performance of the Zacks Rank.Axcelis Technologies is a leading producer of ion implantation equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors. The company also produces dry strip, photostabilization and rapid thermal processing equipment, which is used in semiconductor manufacturing primarily before and after the ion implantation processThe recent breakout for ACLS burst through a downward channel that took shares from $3.20 to $2.70. The bullish behavior leapfrogged the 21-day moving average as the CCI broke through the zero line. The probe higher to $3.40 has pulled back to the May high and it looks like ACLS is poised for the next leg higher.Comfort Systems USA, Inc. is a national provider of comprehensive heating, ventilation and air conditioning installation, maintenance, repair and replacement services. They operate primarily in the commercial and industrial HVAC markets, and perform most of their services within manufacturing plants, office buildings, retail centers, apartment complexes, and healthcare, education and government facilities.Comfort Systems shares have been on a steady incline for most of the year. The latest earnings beat is what's propelled them to the $30 level. Volumes have increased and it looks like the buyers are stepping in on this short term dip from the highs.CDW Corporation offers information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers primarily in the United States and Canada. Its hardware products comprise network communications, notebooks/mobile devices, data storage, video monitors, printers, desktops and servers as well as NetComm products. The company's software services include licensing, licensing management, software solutions and services.An extended consolidation earlier in the year saw lots of volume go out between $36 and$39. During the springtime shares broke down from the top of that range all the way to $33. Then the buyers stepped in, pushing CDW over the 21-day moving average. As expected there was a bit of resistance at the top of the previous range but it looks like buyers are making an assault on $40.CubeSmart is a self-administered and self-managed real estate company focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of self storage facilities in the United States. Its self storage facilities are designed to offer storage space for residential and commercial customers.For a good six months shares of Cube were locked between $22.50 and $25. Recently the top of the trading range has broken as shares entered a bullish trend supported by the 21-day moving average. For two months now it's been slowly and steadily breaking to new highs. Stops can be placed just south of the 21-day.Service Corp. is the largest provider of funeral and cemetery services in the world. The funeral and cemetery operations consist of the Company's funeral service locations, cemeteries and related businesses. The financial services operations represent a combination of the Company's insurance operations primarily related to the funding of prearranged funeral contracts and a lending subsidiary, which previously provided capital financing for independent funeral home and cemetery operations.This chart looks very similar to Cube in that there was a tight trading range that got broken to the upside recently. But shares of Service Corp have been in a sustained uptrend much longer than Cube. The CCI continues to bounce at bullish levels further confirming the trend.These top breakout stocks to buy are pushing higher to fresh highs nearly every day. You can hop on for a quick profit while these stocks look for a new fair value. With the Zacks Rank you've got the momentum of the analysts on Wall Street, with the chart you have price momentum, and with me you get all the momentum stock strategy.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $39.77/share today.Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.97% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDW shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDW's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

The adjusted earnings (with stock-based compensation adjustments) of 2 cents per share for the quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Total revenue for first-quarter fiscal 2016 was $196.9 million, up 5.5% year over year driven by significant contribution from the acquisition of LiveRamp and continued onboarding momentum.

There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for value-oriented investors, but today let's focus on  (  ) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous reasons why this is the case, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CDW's status as a solid value stock below:One of the most underrated ratios for value investors is the price/forward sales metric. This ratio shows investors how much they are paying for each dollar of revenues generated. In other words, a lower number is better here while a price to sales ratio of 1 means that you are paying one dollar for each dollar in sales.With a P/S ratio of 0.54, CDW investors are paying 54 cents in stock price for each dollar of revenue generated by the company. Compare this to the industry average of 3.33, and it is safe to say that CDW is undervalued compared to many of its peers on this important metric.Easily one of the most popular readings for value investors, the forward PE ratio shows us the current price of a stock divided by the full year earnings. Generally speaking, value investors like to see this ratio below 20, though it can vary by industry.Right now, CDW has a forward PE of just 14.07, which means that investors are paying $14.07 for each dollar in expected CDW Corporation earnings this year. Compared to the industry at large this is pretty favorable as the overall space has an average PE of 31.14 in comparison.The solid value ratios outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, but we should also note that the earnings estimate revisions have been trending in a positive direction as well. Analysts who follow CDW stock have been raising their estimates for the company lately, meaning that the EPS picture is looking a bit more favorably for CDW Corporation now.Over the past 30 days 2 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing a ratio of 2 upward estimate revisions compared to no downward for the next year time frame too. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as 30 days ago CDW was expected to post earnings of $2.65 per share for the full year though today it looks to have EPS of $2.80 for the full year.For the reasons detailed above, investors shouldn't be surprised to read that we have CDW as a stock with a Value Score of 'A' and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). So if you are a value investor, definitely keep CDW on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned for gains in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of CDW Corp (Symbol: CDW), the market cap is now $6.63B, versus CONSOL Energy Inc (Symbol: CNX) at $6.56B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CDW vs. CNX:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, CDW is up about 0.1%, while CNX is up about 0.8% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) saw a big move last session, as the company's shares fell by nearly 8% on the day.

The deal will give SAIC access to classified contracts with the Air Force, the National Reconnaissance Office and many intelligence agencies, and will augment the company's federal clientele.Scitor, owned by private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP, has a remarkable reputation in the intelligence community, with most of its employees holding high-level security clearances with the government.The deal makes sense as the business models and cultures of the two companies are consistent with each other, with low capital requirements, similar services portfolios, and stable cash flows.The acquisition, which SAIC will fund through cash on hand and increased borrowings, is expected to be accretive to its EPS in the first year, excluding amortization of intangibles and $15 million in transaction costs. The deal will add $600 million in additional revenues, pushing SAIC's total revenues to $4.5 billion, with earnings of $321 million. Also, SAIC expects to unlock a minimum of $20 million in annual pre-tax cost savings.Restricted spending by the U.S. government, particularly in the areas of defense and security, has taken a toll on companies that depend on government servicing contracts. The SAIC-Scitor deal is a part of industry-wide consolidation, as companies seek to chase new markets via the inorganic growth route. For instance, Chantilly-based Engility completed its $1.3 billion buyout of TASC last week.In 2013, the former SAIC spun off its services arm and rebranded itself Leidos Holdings, Inc.  to eliminate government organizational conflict of interests.

Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their 'first' profit, and explains why they are ones to watch.This week, I'm going to focus on the Price to Sales ratio for finding great stocks at great values.The Price to Sales ratio is a great valuation metric. And given the recent run-up in stocks, value, to me, is becoming more and more important.In fact, aside from the Zacks Rank, if I could only use one item to screen and pick stocks with, this item would be the one.Let's first start with a definition.The Price to Sales ratio is simply: Price divided by SalesIf the Price to Sales ratio is 1, that means you're paying $1 for every $1 of sales the company makes.A price to sales ratio of 2 means you're paying $2 for every $1 of sales the company makes.As you might have guessed, the lower the Price the Sales ratio, the better.A price to Sales ratio of .5 means you're paying 50 cents for every $1 of sales the company makes.And paying less than a dollar for a dollar's worth of something is a good bargain.One of the reasons I like the Price to Sales ratio is because it looks at sales rather than earnings, like the P/E ratio does.And sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement than earnings.Secondly, I'd be hard pressed to find a screen where adding the Price to Sales ratio didn't improve it.For me, I prefer to look for stocks with a Price to Sales ratio under 1. Although, I'm willing to go up to 4, depending on the industry.But in my testing, those with a Price to Sales ratio of 1 or less produced the best returns.

The initiative was undertaken as part of the company's \"Renew and New\" strategy. However, due to broader market fundamentals, shares lost 0.7% in the last trading session.Panaya's large-scale software management suite, with its innovative automation solutions and artificial intelligence, perfectly complements Infosys' strategic requirements. The company's Cloud Quality software is well-positioned to automate multiple service lines of Infosys through its flexible SaaS model.Given Infosys' extensive global reach, Panaya's management considers it a prudent choice for their automation software. Currently, Infosys boasts a customer base stretched across 50 countries, and the latest venture is expected to further improve its customer value through timely delivery of services and simplified business operations. Hence, this strategic move is likely to drive Infosys' position as a global leader in the application services market.Also, the acquisition of Panaya would help Infosys lower operational costs, effectively mitigate risks and reduce service delivery time. In a nutshell, Panaya's software will benefit Infosys in manifold ways, from improving productivity to enhancing its competitiveness.Infosys shares a high brand value in the global technology, consultancy, outsourcing and services market. The company's \"Renew and New\" strategy aims at augmenting the productivity of its trading service. As part of it, the latest acquisition reflects Infosys' restructuring attempts to effectively differentiate its service lines. Management is positive that the deal will drive long-term growth for the company, as Panaya's automation technology will free valuable human resources, enabling them to focus on more productive aspects.

A cash dividend payment of $0.0675 per share is scheduled to be paid on March 10, 2015. Shareholders who purchased CDW prior to the ex-dividend date are eligible for the cash dividend payment. This represents an 58.82% increase over the same period a year ago.The previous trading day's last sale of CDW was $37.79, representing a -1% decrease from the 52 week high of $38.17 and a 56.8% increase over the 52 week low of $24.10.CDW is a part of the Consumer Services sector, which includes companies such as Amazon.com, Inc.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new April 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of 30 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $38.05/share today.Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 82%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.86% return on the cash commitment, or 6.14% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, and highlighting in green where the $35.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of 55 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of CDW stock at the current price level of $38.05/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.57% if the stock gets called away at the April 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CDW shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for CDW Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CDW's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.45% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.35% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 25%.

Since then, CoStar has invested about $80 million to update the site's technology. In its attempt to create a new-generation Internet listing service, CoStar has had over 400,000 rental properties researched and photographed, and has even chartered airplanes to review cities in search of information on new construction.The company has earmarked $100 million for an aggressive consumer marketing campaign for the site that will be unveiled next month. The campaign will star actor Jeff Goldblum as a quirky Silicon Valley executive publicizing the new Apartments.com as a game-changer for the space.CoStar's move is well timed as recent data shows that the share of U.S. citizens who rent rather than own property has steadily been increasing. Consequently, landlords are coughing up more dollars to advertise their property online. Per Kip Cassino of Borrell Associates Inc., a firm that tracks advertising spend, landlords will shell out around $1.5 billion for advertising online this year, compared with just $630 million last year.Sure enough, competition is intensifying in the fragmented industry as rental sites scramble to rake in the marketing dollars. Apartments.com will have to conquer sites like ForRent.com, Apartment Guide, Rent.com, ApartmentFinder.com, and Seattle-based Zillow, a fast-growing competitor. Zillow is also eyeing the top spot in the space, as evidenced by its recent acquisition of Trulia, further boosting its growing rentals business.However, whether Apartments.com can generate enough revenues to justify CoStar's heavy spending on the site remains a matter of concern for investors. Apart from competition, there are substantial risks inherent in executing the company's strategies, which could potentially impair CoStar's profitability. CoStar will release its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 today, after the market closes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter currently stands at 73 cents per share.CoStar presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

The stock then set more new highs on Tuesday and Wednesday.CDW is North America's largest IT solutions provider, with about a 5% share of the highly fragmented market. It sells over 100,000 tech products from more than 1,000 brands, such asApple (  ),Cisco Systems (  ),Hewlett-Packard (  ),IBM (  ) andMicrosoft (MSFT).CDW serves roughly 250,000 business, government, education and health care customers.It's a leading U.S. sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and software publishers, whose products it sells or includes in its own solutions. CDW's offerings include hardware (such as notebooks and mobile devices), and network communications and software products (such as operating systems and network management). It also provides integrated IT solutions in areas such as mobility, security, data center optimization and cloud computing.CDW has delivered healthy results since its June 2013  , with double-digit profit gains in all but one quarter. Its stock has risen 123% from its IPO price of 17, and so far this year it's up about 8%.Why the enthusiasm?\"This is an extremely high quality company that operates with amazing consistency, capital efficiency and that still has small market share,\" Raymond James analyst Brian Alexander told IBD. \"So ultimately you're getting a very good company at a reasonable price with predictable results in a growth market, with room for upward earnings revisions as they refinance high-cost debt.\"CDW's fourth-quarter earnings rose 9% to 59 cents a share, ahead of analyst views for 54 cents in a poll by Thomson Reuters. Sales lifted 12% to $3.05 billion, topping forecasts for $2.96 billion.\"Since the IPO, their financials have been coming in ahead of consensus estimates,\" said Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Jayson Noland.Analysts expect 2015 earnings to rise 14% to $2.71 a share following a 30% surge in 2014. They see earnings increasing 11% in 2016.CDW operates two segments. One is corporate, which includes small, medium-sized and large businesses and primarily consists of private-sector customers. The second is its public segment, comprised of government agencies and education and health care institutions.\"The fourth quarter was driven more by the resurgence in public sector spending and consistent growth in corporate spending,\" Alexander said. \"The growth was more skewed toward data center solutions, storage, networking and security.\"He says that was a change from the prior three quarters, which were driven more by products such as Chromebooks and \"a big PC cycle.\"CDW's public sector sales grew 18% vs. a year earlier to $1.169 billion in the fourth quarter. That outpaced the 8.9% gain in corporate sales. Public sector results were led by a more than 30% increase in sales to government customers and a more than 20% gain in education sales, the company said.CDW benefited from continued growth in sales to K-12 customers, reflecting increased sales of notebooks/mobile devices to support standardized digital testing requirements, said CDW CEO Thomas Richards on the conference call.The corporate-sector results reflected high-single-digit increases in sales to small, medium and large business customers.By category, hardware was up 15%, services were up 12% and software was down just over 1%. Notebooks and mobile devices growth continued strong in the quarter, driven by continued growth in sales to education customers serving the kindergarten-to-12th-grade niche, reflecting increased sales of notebooks/mobile devices to support standardized digital testing requirements, Richards said on the conference call.\"The quarter was balanced between transactional offerings like PCs and data center solutions like servers and storage,\" said Noland. \"CDW continues to see profitability on the gross margin side.\"CDW's far-flung product and service offerings include helping customers select, procure and integrate mobile security software, hardware devices such as smartphones, tablets and notebooks, and cellular wireless activation systems.It also assesses customers' security needs and provides them threat-prevention tools to protect their networks, servers and applications.Its data center optimization solutions consist of offerings such as physical server consolidation and data storage management.Alexander says CDW has been a market-share leader since the company's inception.\"The secret sauce that makes CDW special is that the company consists of a lot of variables that are hard for its competitors to replicate -- including recruiting, training, culture, product breath and engineering talent,\" he said. \"It's a whole combination of things they do that most (tech product resellers) only do some of.\"Another strength is CDW's scale, he says, which is \"unparalleled\" in the industry.\"CDW also has expertise in individual tech areas that allows them to have a much richer conversation with customers,\" he said.CEO Richards is upbeat about the company's prospects: \"Given our current view of economic growth, we are looking for 3% to 4% growth for the U.S. IT market and currently look to achieve our medium-term annual target of exceeding market growth by 200 basis points to 300 basis points. We expect moderation in client device demand both from refresh slowing and the winding down in common core (curriculum) activity (digital testing requirements) as spring of 2015 testing is implemented.\"He expects the federal category's performance to be more \"normal\" this year. And he sees \"solution categories\" continuing the momentum they saw in the second half of 2014 into 2015.Noland is also optimistic about the outlook for CDW. He expects it and other large resellers to continue to take share.\"Whatever IT spending is in the U.S. and Canada, these guys will grow at some premium to that,\" he said, adding the climate for IT spending is good.\"The U.S. is one of the most healthy major markets in the world,\" Noland said. \"The U.S. economy is good and has improved a lot. It looks like it will be a strong year and IT spending is correlated.\"CDW is in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CDW options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $28.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CDW, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $34.65/share today.Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 13% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 76%.

If an investor was to purchase shares of CDW stock at the current price level of $34.65/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $35.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.80% if the stock gets called away at the September 18th expiration (before broker commissions).

And given the recent run-up in stocks, value, to me, is becoming more and more important.In fact, aside from the Zacks Rank, if I could only use one item to screen and pick stocks with, this item would be the one.Let's first start with a definition.The Price to Sales ratio is simply: Price divided by SalesIf the Price to Sales ratio is 1, that means you're paying $1 for every $1 of sales the company makes.A price to sales ratio of 2 means you're paying $2 for every $1 of sales the company makes.As you might have guessed, the lower the Price the Sales ratio, the better.A price to Sales ratio of .5 means you're paying 50 cents for every $1 of sales the company makes.And paying less than a dollar for a dollar's worth of something is a good bargain.One of the reasons I like the Price to Sales ratio is because it looks at sales rather than earnings, like the P/E ratio does.And sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement than earnings.Secondly, I'd be hard pressed to find a screen where adding the Price to Sales ratio didn't improve it.For me, I prefer to look for stocks with a Price to Sales ratio under 1. Although, I'm willing to go up to 4, depending on the industry.But in my testing, as the illustration below shows, those with a Price to Sales ratio of 1 or less produced the best returns. Between 1 and 2 also outperformed pretty significantly. But once you got over 4, the odds were against you.Average Annual Return: 17.8%But the best way to use it, I've found, is to find stocks with a Price to Sales ratio below the median for its Industry.And that's what we'll be focusing on in this week's screen.\u2022 (Above market growth rates.)\u2022 (Positive EPS Surprise)\u2022 (Positive Sales Surprise)\u2022 (Only stocks with a Zacks Rank of a Strong Buy or Buy get through.)\u2022 (Valuations that are lower than their Industry.)\u2022 \u2022 Here are 5 stocks from this week's list: Kroger(P/S = 0.28) CDW Corp.(P/S = 0.50) Amedisys(P/S = 0.72) Hawaiian Holdings(P/S = 0.55) Sykes Enterprises(P/S = 0.76)Sign up now for your 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard and get the rest of the stocks on this list.

It tops the S&P 500's 10.02%. And it beats 91% of large-cap blend funds tracked by Morningstar.In the same-length period prior to Sullivan's taking charge, the fund's 5.32% average annual gain lagged the S&P 500 and 88% of its large-cap blend peers.Sullivan credits his outperformance to an appetite for both growth and value stocks. Also, he targets three types of stocks: ones he's followed for years, those pushed up and down by smart money, and special situations. And he focuses on valuation.In addition, he applies lessons learned from his mentor and former boss, former Fidelity Investments superstar Peter Lynch, who ran the now-$16.7 billion Magellan Fund when it sat atop the fund world with strong performance and rapid growth.Putnam Investors Fund assets peaked at $16.2 billion in August 2000 and shrank to a low of $1.2 billion by September 2011.

I grew up a New York Mets fan because the Dodgers had just moved to L.A. We hate the Yankees. I would relish your mentioning my accent. You have a flexible style, right? You invest in both growth and value stocks. I'm the core manager here at Putnam. Investors Fund is a mix of value and growth. So is my Multi-Cap Core Fund (with $109 million in assets), which is four years old. It's the same style, but even more flexible, because it can go up and down the market-cap spectrum. Investors Fund must have at least 75% of its securities in large caps. Multi-Cap cannot have more than 75% in any one category -- large, mid or small cap. Stylewise, they're the same. And what are the three types of stocks that Investors Fund buys? I call the first bucket my legacy stocks. They're large caps that I researched earlier in my career or even recently. It was in-depth research. Then I gave each one three minutes of research every week for five, 10, 30 years. I refined my understanding of what factors move each stock up or down. That helps me understand when to make a move. It's my most boring bucket but the most important to me.The second bucket has to do with smart money. The main factor is insider buying. I follow that closely and have for many years.In the early to mid-1980s, when I worked for Peter Lynch, it was the No. 1 factor that he deferred to when looking for the right timing to buy a stock. What was your role at Fidelity? In 1985, I was doing research on European chemical stocks like BASF, Imperial Chemical and (Holland's) Akzo Nobel. Big stocks. It was important for Magellan to look for big, liquid stocks.It was also much harder to follow insider transactions. You had to check SEC filings on paper. And they could be six to eight weeks old. The rules were looser about when insiders had to file.Sarbanes-Oxley moved it to a 48-hour rule. And now you can watch the information flow in on the Internet in real time.It doesn't tell me what to buy, but it gives me ideas.The third bucket is special situations. One of the most common are follow-on stock offerings. They used to be called secondary offerings. It might be filed at 4 o'clock on a typical day. XYZ company is doing a follow-on. And you've got 45 minutes to decide if you want to play it or not. They'd file at 4:15 and close their books at 5 p.m. What's a recent one you did? The latest wasHD Supply (  ), which was part ofHome Depot (  ). (Former CEO) Bob Nardelli started building a distributor of big equipment. They IPO'd it after he left. I bought on the  , and they did a secondary offering. I put in offers below the asking price. How often does that work? CDW (  ) is a technology distributor. They sell to midsize companies that don't have big IT departments. They went public last year. Please specify that I still own it but I sold a lot of it.I was maybe the first institutional investor to meet with them. They were never fast-growing. The underwriter was asking 22, maybe 24. I said, \"I want to buy a lot at 18.\" The underwriter said, \"Maybe you missed the (detail) that we're selling at 24.\" I said, \"No, I didn't miss it. I like it at 18, not 24.\" At 18 it was trading at 12 times earnings. At 18 times earnings it's not warranted.Anyway, they went on a road show, had difficulty getting an audience because a lot of guys thought it was overpriced. After two weeks, they came back and said 18 would work. I said, \"OK, but now I only want it at 17.\" They went public at 17. Since then, they've met their meager expectations. As they did, they grabbed a larger audience (of investors). The stock has slowly migrated to 30-ish. That's a great special situation. You like to buy stocks on price weakness. Give me an example, please. Buying on weakness was an old Peter Lynch rule.I boughtSouthwest Airlines (  ) two, 2-1/2 years ago, when it was (trading around 8 or 9).The rest of the airlines were doing well. They charge for everything. But Southwest didn't, so it got depressed. It was selling below the replacement costs of all their airplanes. I figured it had to climb. And they could always start charging (for individual services like baggage). I loaded up as much as I could. It's gone to around 34. You've added to yourApple (  ) stake. Why? I started buying Apple again in the June quarter. It had pulled back from its highs. I took it to my biggest position.A year and a half or two years ago, both Apple andGoogle (GOOGL) went to 700. Then they separated. Apple pulled back. Google shot up. When everyone fell in love with Google, I used it as a source of funds. Apple had hair on it because it hadn't come out with anything new. Now it's coming through again. But it's not expensive on earnings. It's a quasi-value name with meaningful growth. Celgene (CELG) is trending up again. Did investors decide this biotech was oversold? This was one of several large biotechs that I started positioning in more than three years ago. They looked like value names with growth. Now their pipelines are still meaningful. They've got good top- and bottom-line growth. Big pharmaceutical firms don't have that. And on a P-E-to-growth basis, it's still attractive. It's been stronger since the (Q1) sell-off than some biotechs likeBiogen (BIIB) andGilead (GILD). I added to Celgene during the weakness (earlier in) the year. Facebook (FB) has had a nice run-up since mid-2013. Is it still attractive? I'm underweight now. (My weighting is) less than 50 basis points. It's had a good move. It's the place where the eyeballs are. They were slow to get their mobile application to work. But they've done that. It's still a growth story. But it's trading at 40 times next year's (estimated) earnings, so at this point I'm neutral. I don't want to (make my position) bigger unless the stock pulls back. What's your thesis forCBRE Group (CBG)? They're a play on a commercial real estate rebound. They're not expensive.They're big brokers, maybe the biggest. They manage big office buildings. It's been a dead area, but it's coming back. Nonresidential construction is coming back, and occupancy rates are getting better. We've got them earning $1.70 (per share) this year and $1.80 next year. They're not a fancy name. They're a bit of a sleeper. Gilead's earnings per share growth has exploded. Is Sovaldi, its hepatitis C treatment, the entire story? The real attraction is more than that. They've got drugs for liver and heart disease. And a good platform for AIDS. But the real nice thing is that this stock is inexpensive on earnings. They're expected to earn $8 a share this year and $9.50 next year.That's very attractive: 11-1/2 times next year's earnings on a company growing in the teens. And we're fans of their whole pipeline. IsSpirit Airlines' (SAVE) driver its no-frills approach? Yes, their no-frills approach is their key.The interesting thing is that they're not targeted as competition by larger airlines, which is important. It avoids a price war.The larger airlines see them as an ultralow-cost carrier. When they go into a new market, they actually expand the market. Big competitors see that. They get people to fly who don't normally: college students, people on tight budgets, people who don't mind flying at midnight, people who don't mind being charged for extra bags or maybe overhead compartments.When will the airlines go after each other to get market share? They're not doing it now. The old managements (that engaged in price wars) have disappeared. Airline bankruptcies are fresh in (airlines managers') heads. Where is railcar-makerTrinity Industries (TRN) in its economic cycle? Its cycle still continues to work. We're only halfway through.They make all kinds of railroad cars. One of the most interesting on margin is cars that carry sand for fracking. The typical well takes 75 to 80 rail cars of this stuff.Trinity is one of the few players in this business.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.CDW reported better-than-expected first-quarter results based on higher demand from the education and government sectors. Product refreshes and digital education implementation drove PC sales in the quarter.We believe that the improving IT spending trend will help CDW post better results going forward. Also, the company's strong position at medium to large businesses, focus on small & medium businesses and customer additions to grow market share are encouraging. The company's effort to pay off debt also remains a positive factor.However, competition from Insight Enterprises Inc.

A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 to surpass earnings estimates.

Titled FICO Identity Resolution Engine 3.6, the software is an updated version of the technology acquired by the company when it bought identity resolution services provider, Infoglide Software Corporation in April 2013.With sophisticated crime spreading its tentacles into the financial sector, FICO Identity Resolution Engine adds a critical element in solving organized crime. It helps to uncover the true identities of people or activities via link analysis. Link analysis evaluates widespread company and third-party data as well as personal attributes, revealing relationships between suspicious persons and events that might have gone undetected.The updated software integrates entity resolution with social network analytics, enabling government agencies, banks and insurance companies to improve their screening process and detect non-obvious relationships. It analyzes disparate data without normalizing it. Additionally, Fair Isaac's library of pre-built network analytics ensures that the data does not have to be moved to any proprietary database.This process has many potential implications in cyber security, including detection of insider fraud, exposing criminal rings and money laundering schemes, and even uncovering terrorist networks. The software finds an apt application in insurance claims and banking frauds, where it can discern hidden patterns and common aspects in multiple crimes, thus exposing criminal masterminds. Per a major U.S. insurer, integrating social network analysis detected 15-20% more fraudulent claims than using predictive analytics alone.FICO Identity Resolution Engine 3.6 software offers a unique blend of capabilities - identity resolution, high-performance detection analytics, complicated linking algorithms, and data visualization. It is compatible with Fair Isaac's existing applications such as FICO Falcon Fraud Platform, FICO Application Fraud Manager and FICO Insurance Fraud Manager and is a popular software add-on.With operations in over 90 countries, Fair Isaac helps organizations in superior strategic decision-making processes that drive higher levels of growth, profitability and customer satisfaction.

Wednesday had the most IPOs price below their original range in a single day since June 9, 1998, when five of seven deals priced below their range. However, unlike the five June 9, 1998 deals, which showed lackluster returns across the board in their first day of trading (average loss of 2%), four of the five deals that cut their valuations on Wednesday produced positive returns (average gain of 5%) in their first day of trading. Aratana Therapeutics (  ), which traded up 38%, had the best first-day performance of the group. Despite the strong returns, none of the companies that priced on Wednesday have traded up to their original ranges, indicating that, even with the market's rebound this week, investors are still turned off by the original valuations proposed by these companies.\n  \nAratana, which focuses on developing medications for cats and dogs based on therapies for humans, postponed its offering last week before slashing its proposed valuation by 46% to complete the deal.

Tremor's reduced valuation came in the wake of disappointing returns from fellow advertising technology IPOs Marin Software (MRIN, -27% since its IPO) and Millennial Media (MM, -33%).

The week's most prominent IPO, Coty (  ), faltered though, and the third scheduled deal, Aratana Therapeutics (  ) was delayed. Nine more IPOs, including a billion dollar offering from the industrial distributor HD Supply (  ), were packed onto the  , pushing the number of deals expected for the rest of the month to 14. With 48 deals already priced, the second quarter  for the first time since 2000.\n  \n Coty, a fragrance and cosmetics company with several globally recognized brands, raised $1.0 billion in the largest consumer IPO since Arcos Dorados' $1.3 billion IPO in 2011. Despite the superior returns (more than 30% on average) of global beauty companies over the past year, Coty fell 1% on its first day. It broke a streak, dating to November 2012, of five highly successful consumer IPOs (RH, NCLH, PF, FWM and SEAS), which have gained 69% on average (worst is 26%), with all rising more than 10% on their first days. Possible contributors to Coty's poor performance were its slow growth (2% year-to-date, excluding changes in currency rates) and its struggles with acquisitions, including a $930 million purchase of Philosophy in 2010 that was written down by $515 million less than two years later.Gigamon gains 49% on first day Gigamon, by contrast, kept alive an even better streak for technology IPOs, becoming the sixth straight (after DATA, MKTO, ECOM, LITB and TXTR) to jump more than 20% on the first day of trading. The data traffic management company's first-day gain of 49% was the fifth best of 2013. Gigamon has been growing rapidly, increasing sales by 58% in the first quarter. Although it has invested heavily in sales and marketing (48% of sales in the first quarter), it has also been profitable since 2006, and its heavy repeat business has created substantial visibility.\n  \n Formerly the professional services division of Home Depot, HD Supply was acquired in 2007 for $8.5 million in an LBO by Bain Capital, The Carlyle Group (CG) and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. It operates 600 locations in the US and Canada and booked revenue of $2.1 billion in the first quarter. The product of another 2007 LBO, CDW (  ) was acquired by Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity for $7.3 billion. A second Carlyle-backed company, GDC Technology (GDCT), was the second company from China, after LightInTheBox (LITB; +79%), to launch a US IPO this year.Gogo (GOGO) serves nine of the ten WiFi-equipped airlines in North America and has grown rapidly since 2010 (57% CAGR). Silvercrest Asset Management (SAMG) previously set terms in October 2012 but its initial pricing date fell in one of 2012's worst weeks for IPOs, when three of four deals (including Silvercrest) postponed and the fourth, Ruckus Wireless (RKUS), fell 18% on its first day. Luxoft Holding (LXFT) is being carved out of IBS Group and is hoping to duplicate the success of its fellow Russian IT services provider EPAM Systems (EPAM), which is up 108% since its February 2012 IPO. Finally, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) is looking to take advantage of a hot market for biotechs.

Though it was a strong week for pricings, six of the ten deals slashed their valuations in order to complete their offerings, and all five deals that priced on Wednesday did so below their original range, the most deals to price below the range in a single day since June 9, 1998. Last week's top performing deal came from fast-casual restaurant Noodles & Company, which gained 104% on its first day of trading, the best first-day gain since Splunk jumped 109% in April 2012. Last week's activity brought June's IPO total up to 18, and the 2Q13 total up to 61, the most IPOs in a quarter since the 70 in 4Q07 (  ). No deals set terms last week, but six companies submitted initial filings, including Neiman Marcus (NMNM.RC), Burlington Coat Factory (BH.RC) and CBS's outdoor advertising division (COA.RC).\n  \nTen deals price, but market volatility pushes valuations downLast week was only the third week since 2007 to have ten or more IPO pricings, but six of those ten had to price below their proposed ranges in order to complete their offerings. The valuation pressure may have reflected the heightened volatility in the markets. In the previous week and again last Monday, the VIX volatility index closed above 20 for the first time in 2013. Although HD Supply (  ) raised $957 million in the fourth largest IPO of 2013 (behind ZTS, VOYA, and COTY), it had to reduce its IPO price to $18, 23% below the proposed midpoint of its original $22 to $25 range. CDW (  ), a leading reseller of IT products and solutions and last week's second largest deal, raised $395 million, after retreating from its original $20 to $23 price range to a $17 IPO price. One company, GDC Technology (GDCT), postponed its offering, as questions over the remaining market for its digital cinema servers overshadowed a track record of fast growth.Noodles & Company delivered last week's top return, gaining 104% in its market debut. The fast-casual restaurant chain, led by former Chipotle executives, priced its shares at $18, well above its original range of $13 to $15. It recorded the best first-day gain since Splunk (SPLK) gained 109% on its first day of trading in April 2012.\n  \n *Deal size is RC estimate. In the wake of last week's pricings and in anticipation of the fourth of July holiday,  have decreased going into July. However, the IPO pipeline has remained active, and six new companies submitted initial filings last week. Two high profile national retailers, Neiman Marcus and Burlington Coat Factory, submitted initial filings; both are backed by large PE firms (Warburg Pincus and TPG control Neiman Marcus, while Bain Capital owns Burlington Coat Factory) that acquired the companies in the pre-recession leveraged buyout boom. While Neiman Marcus filed with a proposed deal size of $100 million, the figure is likely just a placeholder, and we estimate that the IPO will raise at least $750 million. Other notable new filers include CBS Outdoor Americas, a spin-off of CBS Corporation's (  ) North & South American outdoor advertising business unit, SFX Entertainment (SFXE), the largest producer of live electronic music events founded by media mogul Robert Sillerman, Marlin Midstream Partners (FISH), which owns and operates midstream natural gas assets, and Ardmore Shipping (ASC), which provides seaborne transportation of petroleum products and chemicals.IPO market snapshot The 92 IPOs in 2013 have raised $20.6 billion and produced an average return of 22%.
