The novel coronavirus was beginning to manifest as a serious problem in February, but it wasn't apparent that an economic lockdown was going to happen, or how extensive it would be.\u00a0I recently decided to part ways with my final shares of Booking Holdings -- at least for now. A confluence of factors weighed on my decision, but ultimately I think this tech giant will underperform the market for a while after it rallied since the worst of the market crash in March.An empty hammock on a tropical beach is a sad reality in too many parts of the world right now. Image source: Getty Images.When Booking Holdings reported on its final quarter of 2019 and provided an initial outlook for 2020, China and other parts of Asia were bearing the full brunt of the COVID-19 fight. That was already factored into the first-quarter outlook, when Booking called for at least an 8% year-over-year decrease in gross travel bookings, a 3% decrease in revenue, and a 14% decrease in adjusted earnings per share. But as the pandemic spread, the results in Q1 were far worse than expected.\u00a0Gross travel bookings (the value of services booked, net of cancellations, with one of the company's sites, including Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda, and KAYAK) got cut in half in the first quarter, leading to big drops in the top and bottom lines.\u00a0Gross travel bookings$12.4 billion$25.4 billion(51%)Revenue$2.29 billion$2.84 billion(19%)Adjusted net income$156 million$508 million(69%)Data source: Booking Holdings.The travel industry has been among those hardest hit by the pandemic, and it's unclear how long economic activity therein will remain muted. But I think it will last longer than Booking's stock price seems to imply. The company didn't provide any guidance when it reported first-quarter results in early May, except that it believes it will be just fine in the long run. (I agree, but that's not the issue here.)As for the stock itself, shares briefly tanked nearly 45% in March, but have rebounded and are now sitting on just a 15% decline for 2020 to date. A really fast rebound in global travel is being implied, but I'm unsure -- and so is management. CEO Glenn Fogel had this to say on the  on May 7:\u00a0On a smaller, but somewhat positive note, we are seeing some stability in our newly booked room night growth trends. We hope that this is the beginning of the road back to recovery, but it's certainly too early to say with certainty. Some governments have seen progress in limiting or reducing the pandemic. They have slowly begun to reopen their economies and we have seen new bookings, primarily for domestic travel, although still at very low levels. Some or many of these reservations may ultimately be canceled, but we believe it does show that travel for essential business and personal reasons will slowly return as society makes progress against the pandemic. And as travel returns, we expect to see improvement in our revenue.\u00a0Still, with Q1 gross bookings falling by half, and a possible bottom only just beginning to be apparent in May, Q2 could be just as rough. Ongoing uncertainty no longer appears priced into Booking Holdings shares.Granted, a lot has changed in the month since Booking's Q1 report. China, along with the rest of Asia, is already on the road to recovery, and the U.S. and Europe are in the early stages of opening up. But still, it's going to take time for travel to rebound, and it's unclear just how soon things will ramp back up, with remote work and video conferencing looking primed to replace a lot of in-person meetings.\u00a0Booking stock trades for 19.3 times trailing-12-month free cash flow (revenue less cash operating and capital expenses), a figure that is bound to get worse as quarterly results for the rest of 2020 start to lap results from 2019, when travel was still firing on all cylinders. The upside for the stock at this particular juncture looks limited. Plus, Booking has been a market underperformer now for three years. It's been a volatile ride ending nowhere, and the company's transition from high-growth technologist to  has begun to look less than graceful -- especially considering all the cash used in share repurchases over that span of time that haven't done much other than keep the stock treading water. Simply put, there have been far better places to invest over the last three years, and given the rally now priced in, now seemed like the time to part ways for the moment.\u00a0Data by .I am a value investor at heart, but Booking Holdings just doesn't look like a value to me. When would I consider purchasing again? When the price drops. It's clear that Booking and the rest of the travel industry may be in the early stages of picking up the pieces post-pandemic, but if I'm going to purchase a recovery stock, I'd like to purchase it with a recovery price tag attached.About $1,200 a share -- where it was in March during the worst of the downturn -- would be fantastic. Granted, that may not be a realistic expectation, so if there was about a 20% pullback (bringing the share price down to $1,400 to $1,500), which would put a valuation of about 15.0 to 16.0 times price to free cash flow, I'd be interested again. Or if solid evidence emerges that travel activity is indeed coming back with a vengeance, I might change my mind and purchase again without requiring a significant pullback in price.\u00a0But at this point, Booking doesn't quite fit the bill for me with the premium valuation and uncertain outlook for the rest of 2020.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But investors have slowly warmed to the travel portal in the months since, with shares climbing 10.7% in May, according to data from\u00a0.The reason for the stock slide early in the year was clear:  and hotel demand has been all but wiped out by the pandemic, and as those businesses have fallen, so too have companies that serve the travel industry, including Booking Holdings.The company early in May reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.77 per share, well below the $6.10 consensus, as room nights booked during the period decreased 43% year over year. Booking Holdings had already withdrawn full-year guidance before the release but used the earnings report to lay out the steps it was taking to weather the storm.Image source: Getty Images.\"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted our company and the entire travel industry,\" CEO Glenn Fogel said in a statement. \"Looking forward, due to the value of our platform, our highly variable cost structure and strong liquidity, I am confident that we will emerge from this crisis in a position of strength that will allow us to extend our leadership role in the industry.\"Booking in April raised $750 million in convertible senior notes to help pad its liquidity. Although the results were grim, the report added to investor confidence that the company has the wherewithal to survive through the downturn and remain an industry leader once it is over.In the near term, there isn't much Booking Holdings can do. The company is inescapably tied to the travel industry, and travel has been hit hard by the pandemic. If the global economy is in the recession once the pandemic is resolved, it's going to take a while to recover. Even in the best-case scenario, airlines are expecting it to take years to return to pre-pandemic volumes.The good news is, I believe travel will eventually recover. And Booking Holdings remains a best-of-breed portal for consumers looking to go places.

Hotel chains like  (NYSE:) are down by roughly one third. Cruise lines and casinos have also been hammered.Running a web site doesn\u2019t carry the cost structure of an airline or hotel, but Expedia wasn\u2019t blowing up the track before the pandemic.

Theme parks and resorts were forced to close to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Movie production ground to a halt, cruise ships were docked, and retail stores were shuttered, affecting almost every money-making segment across Disney's vast entertainment enterprise. Even worse for investors, some of these issues could persist for months before returning to normal.Yet all is not lost for the House of Mouse. Its streaming service, Disney+, debuted in November to rave reviews and quickly attracted a huge following. By early May, the platform had amassed more than 54 million subscribers. This puts Disney+ on track to achieve its 2024 goal of 60 million to 90 million subscribers sometime later this year and potentially reach profitability years ahead of schedule.\u00a0Hulu has also experienced an uptick in paying customers as well, to 32 million, up 27% compared to the prior-year quarter.Additionally, media networks, Disney's most profitable segment, held up remarkably well during the pandemic, with revenue up 28% year over year, the result of higher affiliate revenue from its cable operations and broadcast networks. As a result, total revenue grew 21%, while operating income slumped 37% during the first quarter.\u00a0Disney stock is selling for a discount of 18% compared to its pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, analysts see the company's revenue edging down this year, before resuming its growth in 2021. Don't get me wrong.

The company was forced to close the majority of its stores in China, then across the world.Yet Starbucks faced the challenges head-on, suspending share repurchases, cutting discretionary spending, and deferring certain capital expenditures. Beyond that, the locations that remained open became hubs for takeout and delivery orders, which helped minimize the damage to the coffee purveyor's business.\u00a0While the company's second-quarter results were nothing to write home about, they were far better than many investors feared. Comparable store sales slumped 10%, causing net revenue to fall 5% year over year, while EPS declined 47%. But the coffee cup was also half full, as the company continued to generate a profit, even in the face of a significant global disruption. The third quarter won't be pretty either. Having faced the brunt of the COVID-19 closures, it will likely be worse than Q2.\u00a0Yet look out several years, and the investing thesis for Starbucks remains firmly intact. People simply aren't going to give up their caffeine addiction and their daily cup of Joe. States are beginning to ease their stay-at-home restrictions and once consumers begin to venture out, they'll be eager to get back to their daily routine, which will no doubt include a stop at their friendly neighborhood Starbucks.Analysts expect the company's revenue to decline by 10% this year, but return to growth in 2021.

Over the past couple of months, the company has faced one of the toughest travel periods in its history. Leisure travel was among the industries hit hardest by the pandemic, particularly given Booking's focus on international travel destinations. The news gets worse, as the travel industry may be among the last to recover as consumers slowly emerge from government-imposed lockdowns.Booking took immediate steps to conserve cash and increase liquidity, halting stock buybacks, slashing marketing spending, cutting non-essential costs, and implementing a hiring freeze. Additionally, many of the top execs voted to forego their salaries until things stabilized.Booking's latest financial results tell the tale. During the first quarter, gross travel bookings -- which includes taxes and fees and is net of cancellations -- declined by 51% year over year. This resulted in revenue that slumped 19%, and pushed the company's bottom line into the loss column. The company was profitable on a  (adjusted) basis, but the results were even more dismal, with EPS declining 66%.But as consumers begin the long road to economic recovery, and their  returns, there will be plenty of pent up demand for travel. During the first-quarter earnings conference, CEO Glenn Fogel said: \"While the virus' impact on travel is unprecedented, I am confident that this crisis will eventually end and people will travel again. Travel is fundamental to who we are.\" He went on to say Booking was positioning itself \"to capture travel demand when it returns so we can emerge from this crisis on strong footing and extend our leadership position.\"While the next couple of quarters could be difficult, Booking Holdings has faced existential crises before, including the Great Recession.

Thank you for really contributing so much content for this week's podcast.So I looked at your tweets and your emails and I thought about what you've learned from this podcast. And what I started to do, and you can't really see it at home, because we're just an audio podcast, this isn't a video, but I started to get out my scissor -- we're going back to first grade here -- my scissors, little paste, post-it notes, and I start to bucket up, because I started seeing some recurring lessons. And certain ones that a lot of you have said back to me you learned from our podcast. And so, I began to bucket them up.And what I've done here is I've created 10 little buckets. And I say \"little,\" because each of them I'm going to just spend about one minute on. I'm going to go down the top 10, maybe, greatest hits that you feel like you've learned from me and our podcast. And that's going to be just the next section of this week's podcast. I'm going to go fairly rapid-fire through these points; I hope you'll appreciate it. Since a lot of you have learned them from me here, I don't have to illustrate them very much, I'm just kind of saying back to you what you're saying you already know. But it's worth going over each of these 10 about a minute each.And then the rest of this podcast this week, it's just going to be some longer form stories from those of you who wrote in. And anybody who pays much attention to the next 10 minutes will see some of these lessons recur in the beautiful and inspirational notes that will form the back-half of this week's podcast.So, I say, without further ado, let's get started.Alright. What have you learned from me? No. 1, winners win.Yep, this one came through loud and clear. I think I had more people saying this back to me than any other single lesson. So, I thought I should lead off with it. Buy winners, winners keep on winning, said @Hdgs_ @benstubbens. \"Happy Birthday! Winners win.\" You even said it twice in your three lessons you've learned from me. @RazorRockJoe. \"Key lessons that should not be taken lightly, winners win.\" When Mark Mariotti, \"Add to your winners, winners win.\"The list goes on of those who feel the same way I do. And it's not to say, by the way, that every winner always wins, or that every loser never becomes a winner, or that every winner never becomes a loser. Certainly, the world is dynamic. But betting on the lead jockeys, finding the real winners in our society, who do, in my experience, whether it's in sports or investing in business or in life, they tend to just keep on winning. One of the best places you and I can put our money is on the winners.Lesson No. 2, I guess, we could broadly call this something like, don't sell, hold on, never sell. @paul_essen, you wrote, \"Let your winners run high,\" and you point out  as a recent example. And yeah, that reminds me. Trait No. 1 of the  investor, rule No. 1, let your winners run high.\"Happy birthday from Sydney Australia!\" said Andrew Wyles, and he said, \"Stay with your winners.\" @RazorRockJoe added, \"Be focused on the long-term, that's the greatest secret of all; tend not to sell.\" Even if you can't manage never to sell, tend not to sell, let your winners run.Alright. Lesson No. 3, and let's call this one something like \"market cap divided by possible.\" I put a lot of emphasis on market cap in , not just in this podcast for five years, but certainly for the 20 years or so that preceded it through my writings and stock picking on . I want you to know the market cap, I think you know that, we created a game show around it, I'm looking forward to playing that in June once again. So, market cap is important, but it's also important to think, whatever the value or market cap of a company is today, let's say it's a $4 billion stock, again, you take all the shares of that company, multiply it by the share price that gives you the market cap. And let's just pretend it goes to $4 billion. Ask yourself, how large could you see that growing in 10 or 20 years?Now, if it's a very small, niche company, you might not see it grow too much more than $6 to $8 billion over the next 10 years. In other words, you might only see 50% to a 100% upside. But what about the $4 billion companies that could go up 100X in value? Could you see that market cap of $4 billion one day, go to $400 billion? I've seen that happen, if you're a longtime investor then you have too. And so, yes, Burt Buffett @OracleOfEncino, market cap size in relation to future expected returns fluctuates, don't worry about entry price. Yeah, don't over focus on that. And Mark Mariotti, you said, \"Don't pay too much attention to valuation, most of the time, cheap is cheap for a reason.\" So, yes, we're looking for usually more expensive stocks but at early stages of growth where we can see great stuff ahead.Alright. Lesson No. 4, this one's pretty much straight, chapter and verse, I've said it a lot in the past, I'll say it a lot in the future, \"Stocks always go down faster than they go up, but they always go up more than they go down.\" That's true of the market overall, the stock market, and that's also true of individual companies. You'll find that the market itself, as we saw earlier this year, can sell off quite fast. In fact, that was, by many accounts, the fastest, biggest sell-off in history. And you tend not to see days or weeks where the market goes up by that much, but it's really important to remember that over the long-term, the only term that counts, the market goes up. And it goes up way more than it ever goes down. That's why in the lower-left, for any market history graph you're looking at, in the lower-left you'll see that starting date, maybe it's 30 years ago or a 100 years ago, and then look where the line goes from the lower-left to the upper-right, and that's because stocks always go up more than they go down.Alright. Lesson No. 5, \"Add to your winners.\" Add to your winners over and over again as they keep winning, pull the weeds and water the flowers, get rid of the laggards and feed the growers. Add to your winners. And sure enough, that's also one of the traits of the  Investor, in fact, it's trait No. 2, I hope many of you know this byheart already, but trait No. 2 of the  investor is add up, don't double down.So much money, so much good money has been thrown after bad by people who buy a stock. And they might have had good reasoning in the first place, and maybe they were right temporarily, but for whatever reason, maybe they got it wrong or maybe the world got it wrong or the company blew up, the stock started going down. And they think, well, if I liked it at $12, I'm sure I'll buy some more stock here at $8. Or if the stock goes from $12 to $6, they'll think, OK, time to double down. I could double up my money the same initial investment I made at $12, I get twice as many shares at $6. And you know how the sad story can end, as they disconsolately look at their massive losses as they were adding on the way down.I don't have enough confidence in myself or any investment thesis or the world at large, I don't have that fixed confidence to believe in most cases that as a stock starts dropping, especially if it's a very large drop that I have it right that the world has it wrong, and that that company will come back. It's beautiful when it happens. And certainly, companies with balance sheets, right, companies with cash that have some strength and resilience because they don't have much debt and they have a lot of cash, so they have time to recreate themselves. But many companies don't, and many investors have made huge mistakes throwing good money after bad. That's why we add up, add to our winners, as you well know, because this is lesson No. 5, not double down.Okay, I'm getting distracted by many sermons and many rants around these points, when I said I was just going to say them back to you quickly, so let's move quickly through six to 10.No. 6, I would summarize under a book title, it was the second book that my brother Tom and I wrote. It was called . We'd written , which was published early in 1996. And Simon & Schuster, our publisher, said, hey, guys, what about another book from you? And this time let's make it about personal finance. So, the first one is about stocks and the stock market, that speaks to some people, what about speaking to money that speaks to more people than that. So, we wrote the book, .And Lisa Wharton you wrote well here, you said, \"What I've learned from David, buy and hold quality companies and miracles will happen. Thank you so much for changing my life. I used to think one of the few ways to go up on the economic ladder was to get a Harvard MBA, now investing with The Motley Fool is another.\" That's very kind of you to say, Lisa, but what you're speaking to there is that you and I don't need an MBA and we don't need a Harvard degree. Those are beautiful things, I certainly won't gainsay anybody's Harvard degree or their business masters, but I will say a lot of the investment world, it seems to me, predicates itself on the idea that they need to do it, because they're the experts, you and I could not figure it out, we need to give our money over to them, often overpaying them for their management, because it's too complicated for you and for me. And I disagree, I know my brother Tom disagrees. I think everybody who works at our company and so many among our hundreds of thousands of members worldwide know, in their own hearts, that you can do this if you want to. Why? Because you have more than you think.And I thought Mark Woodburn spoke to this really well in a note he wrote me, he said, \"David, have a wonderful birthday. I've been a  and s member for several years. I'm so grateful for your insight. Given my lack of financial education growing up, you and The Motley Fool team have been one of my main financial mentors. I had the pleasure of buying lunch for a very successful growth-oriented financial advisor in our area who said about you, \"If you've been listening and reading David Gardner's philosophy and strategy on investing and growth, and tech companies that are changing the world, then you understand way more than most financial advisors in our area.\" Mark closes, \"Thanks for opening my eyes to the incredible opportunity we have to invest in great leaders and great companies and to become financially independent doing so. It feels like I've been given one of the best gifts on Earth.\"Well that's really a lovely note from you, Mark, but in both Mark's note and in Lisa's note, you hear people saying, \"You can do this.\" And we believe that firmly, your hobbies, your own profession, your life lessons are leading you, and can lead you to some of your best stock market selections. A stock that you might recognize as great before I ever do, almost any good stock I've ever picked, somebody has bought well before I did and they were probably a Motley Fool member. So, there are constant lessons all around me seeing people act on their hunches based on their wisdom, their experience and when they show resilience and know how to invest, when they practice those six traits of a  investor, I've already covered a couple of them, you sure enough can and may well grow rich. I certainly trust it will happen over time.The purpose of The Motley Fool is to make the world smarter, happier and richer, all three, never one without the other two. But it's really important for me to convey to each of you, my listeners, that you have more than you think. And make sure you're making the best use of your gifts and your power.Alright, investment lesson No. 7, thing that you've learned from this podcast No. 7. Make your portfolio reflect your best vision for our future. And I heard that loud and clear from a few of you who remember that it's not just a ticker symbol or a balance sheet that you're investing in, it's actually a real living, breathing entity, it's having life breathed into it every day by humans, that's the employees that are powering most of the great companies in the world. Yes, increasingly there can be some AI and robots as well. And I certainly welcome our AI and robot overseers; I hope that they will add further value to the investment that you and I make.But really, investment into the stock market is investment into real companies, and thinking about what are the companies that you hope will thrive, that you believe will thrive as the future gets better. And putting your money there is critical.Lesson No. 8, articulated pretty well by JP @carforsp on . JP you said, \"One of your winners can make up for all of your losers put together.\" And sure enough that is true. Now, it's not going to be true in every scenario, in every person's portfolio, but if you look at my stock advisor or s scorecards and you look at the single best pick on those long-term scorecards, you're going to see that the amount of money made 40X or 100X in value and then you compare that to all the worst losers on that scorecard and you'll see it pretty much wipes just about all of them, if not, all of them out. And that's just one big winner.Now, I know any longtime listener of this podcast already knows, we're not just shooting for one lucky big winner. Every stock that we pick, we're picking thinking we'll beat the market, hoping it will beat the market, very aware that we could be completely wrong about that stock. And part of being diversified is we can be wrong and be OK. That's very important to investing successfully as well. But it's also important to know that rebalancing your portfolio toward the losers, not letting your winners run, not allowing your big winners to cancel out all of your mistakes. A lot of people don't give themselves the benefit of a big win, because they keep chopping it off or rebalancing to their losers.So, yes, I love my winners and in part I love them, because they truly, if you're doing investing right, if you know how to do this right, your big winners should wipe out all of your mistakes and leave profit on the table. And isn't that a great thing, I wish that were true of other aspects of my life for years. Wouldn't it be great if just one great act cancelled out every sin you've ever committed? I sure wish that were true in other areas of your life, but certainly it is true if you're investing Foolishly.Alright. What you've learned from me thing No. 9. \"There's a difference between buying into companies that are going up and buying into quality businesses that are going up,\" Ben Stubbens says. And @JosephAParker on Twitter simply quotes me, \"I try to find excellence, buy excellence and add to excellence over time. I sell mediocrity, that's how I invest.\"And thank you for quoting me Joseph A. Parker. Yeah, excellence, always be asking yourself, what is the excellent and get your money there. I don't spend a lot of time looking for bargains or flipping over stones hoping to find a piece of gold. More often than not, when I flip over stones [laughs] in the real world, I find potato bugs or worms, and I'm not that interested in those, [laughs] those don't feel excellent to me. Nope. I would much rather aim my gaze not at my feet, casting over rocks and pebbles, hoping to find a piece of gold. I'd rather cast my eyes up at the skies and ask what is great. Excelsior -- ever higher. What are the excellent things in our world and in our society and can we spend more time with those, can we, when possible, through the stock market, invest in those things? I try to find excellence, buy excellence and add to excellence over time. I sell mediocrity. That's how I invest.And finally, thing you've learned for me No. 10, lead a more interesting life. It's an occasional mini-sermon, [laughs] I deliver on the podcast. I think I did this again recently. Warren Kiesel @wkiesel on Twitter, you're reminding me of it. \"To become a better investor, live a more interesting life.\"Lead a more interesting life. A lot of people think that to become a better investor involves technical stuff, like, reading deeper into the footnotes of a 10-K or understanding better some technologies, you study a new industry. And those things are important, and I certainly love learning and I hope that you're getting to learn through this podcast how better to think about a balance sheet or the risk of a company or a new technology. But really in my experience, the best gains, not just for your portfolio, but indeed for your life, are going to be based on your own personal efforts toward self-improvement, toward betterment. And in my experience, a lot of that is getting out there in this world and trying some new things, meeting new people and seeing the great riches that those things have in store for you and your portfolio.Now, as we close this section of the podcast, I'll say, I'm very aware that during this COVID-19 era, it's not quite as easy as it maybe was before to get out there in the world and try new things and meet new people, but darn it! It still is. And even if you're having to do it virtually with your web browser, more so than you did six months ago, this too shall pass and it'll be easier to get back out and learn from the world at large soon enough.But really this lesson is about for all-time, right? In any context you can always learn something new, you can always, I think, lead a more interesting life if that's your focus, and I think it should be.Alright. So, there they are, at least ten things that [laughs] many of you learned from me and from this podcast. They were a lot more, but I just tried to bucket up the ones that were most obvious. Again, for longtime listeners, you may already be saying, yeah, I know a lot of these. But you know what's interesting to me? A lot of people don't know a lot of these.And I think that might be because I'm focused on breaking the rules, that's the focus of my investing and a lot of my work is I love to find conventional wisdom when it's wrong, if I can find conventional wisdom; if a lot of people are going through the motions and it turns out that that's not the right way to think about something or there's a better way to do something, well, for you and for me as s, we can break those rules. And that's where so much of the real value can be created in life.So, for the rest of the podcast now, I'm just going to share with you some longer form notes, letters of inspiration from my fellow Fools and you're going to see some of the themes that we just covered recur.And I want to lead off with this one from Ryan Hasty because he makes an important point that I want to double-underline after I finish reading it. Thank you for this note, Ryan. You said, \"Happy Birthday to David Gardner! I'm a member of and s and I'm writing from Albury, New South Wales, Australia. I've got two things I'd love to share from my time gleaming gold nuggets from David Gardner. Personally, I feel the best advice from David is the advice that makes you think differently to all of the advice, suggesting you need to turn over rocks to find $0.70 dollars.\"And then Ryan goes on, \"Two points here. Point No. 1, top dog and first mover. This is a good indicator for a buy. Those who win, will keep winning. Those that are first to innovate often keep innovating over long periods in ways that are unseen at the time of purchase. While this isn't always a sure thing ... \" Ryan writes, \" ... it's a good indicator of future success.\"And then the second point he wants to make is that a high valuation is a good indicator for a buy sign, this is the market telling you that many believe in the future success of this group. Interestingly, it will also scare many investors away because it may be sitting higher than people feel comfortable buying into, even though there's agreement on the company's quality. Fool on! Regards, Ryan Hasty.\"Well, I wanted to underline one particular point that runs through Ryan's not right there, and that is, to go back to rule breaking again, where our thinking differs from the rest of the world. I recently had an opportunity to retake the Myers-Briggs personality test. This is the step two version which goes on a little longer and asks you questions to go a little deeper. And then the analysis about your personality comes back with some more metrics.So, I discovered that while I generally fit the ENTJ, that is probably me, and some of you will instantly recognize these letters and understand what that means, and others will be wondering what I'm talking about, and I'm certainly not going to summarize Myers-Briggs right now. But while I fairly closely conform to the standard profile of someone who is an ENTJ, there are a few outliers for me, and the biggest one where my line zigged when others like me zag, was under the concept of communality, I discovered.And commonality basically means, do you tend to agree and conform to those who have your same mindset. And as it turns out, I don't. I have this odd movement in my graph line that has me going strongly away from those who otherwise would think like me; anti-communality, if you will. And I think this is what I've been trying to convey to you about s and what Ryan says. \"Personally ... \" he said \" ... I feel the best advice from David is the advice that makes you think differently to all the other advice out there.\" And you think about Steve Jobs' \"Think Different,\" and you think about  and its branding around that. And, well, a lot of that might just be marketing. I also think [laughs] it's great advice for a lot of us, especially those of us who are going to call ourselves s in life.So, I'm here to celebrate \"think different.\" Not for its own sake, but specifically when it adds tremendous value to the world. Almost any great business was generally started when somebody had an Aha! moment and pursued a dream. Dream it, build it. And the best of them end up becoming public market companies that you and I can buy shares in, and then the best of those are the ones that multiply in value over the years. And I submit to you, in most cases, they were doing something different, they were businesses that broke the rules, they looked at how Goliath had the world set up so that Goliath is always going to win, and the Davids out there came in and said, you know what, let's do it differently or let's use a new technology, let's solve an old problem in new ways, let's create a new possibility. Thinking differently is really where so much innovation starts. And when it flourishes, well, darn it! Those are some of the best investments you and I can make. So, thank you for that point, Ryan, and for celebrating the anti-communal spirit.Alright. The next story I wanted to share was from Rich Smith. Rich you said, \"Dear David, Happy Foolish Birthday! As a devoted listener for over five years now, I can easily attest that you've succeeded in making me smarter, happier and richer.\" Well, Rich, that makes me really happy. Thank you very much for sharing that. \"Well, I can relate to the cover letter you read last week.\" And Rich is referring to the wonderful campfire story No. 3 from last week's podcast. \"A moving note about the concept of being raised to be poor.\" Certainly something, if you didn't get to hear that, I would suggest you go back and listen to campfire story No. 3, you can skip the other three; No. 1, No. 2 and No. 4, those are mine, but the No. 3 one from a listener, I think, really, clearly moved a number of you. And it moved me as well, which is why I wanted to share it.But Rich is alluding to that, when he says, \"I too was raised in such a way where I was unable to reach my full financial potential. My parents are debt averse, which was a great way to start my adult life, but it left me lacking in the area of growing and employing my capital wisely. I appreciated the work ethic and personal responsibility I learned up in a small farm in Ohio, but that's not a life I aspire to.\" Rich writes. \"It was about six years ago, I came across  ... \" That's our book by that title, \" ... and ever since then it's reset my trajectory. The books, audiobooks, podcasts and two  shareholder meetings I've attended have truly enriched my life and contributed to making me smarter, happier and richer.\"And then Rich closes with, \"Additionally, my eyes have been opened to the fact that business can have a conscience. And I strive to bring some consciousness and foolishness to my office every day, not only have you improved my life, but also my family's life. The impact you and The Motley Fool have had on me and my family will literally be felt for generations. It's my goal to continually pay it forward and to do the same for others. Happy Birthday once again, David, and Fool on?\"Well thank you so much for that Rich. that is really inspiring.And the next note I wanted to share is from my biggest fan. Yep, Joan, you're back, and thank you very much for taking the time to write in. And I thought you hit on a really good point. So, I want to share this from you. You said, \"Hi, David, Happy Birthday! I hope you have a wonderful birthday, get to enjoy and relax with your family. I've learned a lot from you over the years, but I'm going to share with you one important thing I learned. And that is, it's OK to be wrong and we need to own up to our mistakes. It's evident in everything that you do ... \" Joan writes, \" ... for example, your stock reviews were not only talking about the ones that have done well or you're always sharing your past mistakes in your stories. The most important lesson I got out of this is that you own up to the mistakes that you made and you learn from them moving forward.\"And thank you very much for that. I hope I'm worthy of that. I aspire to that, I'll say that. But even if I can't always nail it 100% myself, I want my listeners to hear that. And certainly, as I shared earlier this month in my Old, New, Borrowed and Blue episode talking about Warren Bennis' four lessons of self-knowledge. One of them very simply stated, \"Accept responsibility, blame no one.\" Those are great words to live by and I hear you saying that back to me here, Joan.It's the ability to rise above our ego, accept and review our mistakes, that's what sets us apart, can make you a great person and a leader. Now, she goes on to say, \"I have another response to that latest campfire stories episode. I too was raised to be poor, and I'm grateful that my parents did, because now I understand the value of money and wealth. I have a friend whom I've finally convinced to start investing several years back. He too grew up and was raised to be poor. We talked a lot about the reasons behind why he resisted investing for so long. His perspectives were coming from mistrust of capitalism in the financial world due to bad feelings around money.\"And by the way, I think a lot of people have some sense of that or feelings in that way. In my experience, I encounter a lot of people who do -- and we would all say, this is not reading from her note now, but me just speaking to you, we would all say, rightly so, there certainly have been egregious examples of greed, selfishness, abuse, all kinds of bad stuff in the name of capitalism. But to think that that is what capitalism is or that that's all the capitalism is, I think, misses the vast majority of the picture. I do think, if it bleeds, it leads.I think, even the financial media tends to lead with the Enrons and forget about great stores like , which is a wonderful, multigenerational trucking company, doesn't really have unionized workers, because people feel so well-treated by Old Dominion that they don't feel a need to rise up against their employer. I love businesses that treat their employees well in a way that people would say why would we want to unionize. We all understand reasons why unionization can make sense. But anyway, these are just talking to what capitalism is and it's a many splendored thing with some faults too.Anyway, to continue on with your note, Joan. \"A lot of people associate money with greed.\" She says, \"I've been trying to convince some of my co-workers to invest and change their attitude around money by putting out that while money isn't everything, financial independence will allow us to give back to the world more, the hardest discussion for me so far was trying to convince someone to invest when he or she thinks that capitalism is evil. It's hard to defend against giant companies who often make headlines, their top executives earn a lot of money while lower-level workers aren't treated fairly as well. If the company doesn't pay taxes because it's getting such a tax break from a government.\"She goes on to say, \"I've not known any CEO or Co-Founder of any company, but maybe you could speak a little bit from your perspective.\" Well, I think I already did. She concludes, \"I tried however to refocus my friend on what kind of impact such companies have contributed to improve our way of life. I also encouraged them to look into the concept of conscious capitalism. I hope every company operates with that concept in mind. As more and more of these companies grow and the concept becomes more widely practiced, it'll help eliminate the bad connotation around the word \"capitalism,\" people will then open up more to investing, to create long-lasting wealth for themselves. I'm sorry for ranting ... \" she concludes, \" ... the subject has been [laughs] on my mind. The subject of discussion for a long time. In conclusion, thank you for being who you are, consistently staying positive. I too believe in the positive force that moves the world forward. Please continue to do what you do, wish you the best birthday, etc., sincerely, Joan.\" My biggest fan.Well, thank you. And I'm resisting the urge to say too much further, because I don't really need to editorialize around these notes, and I really wanted them to speak for themselves. So, thank you for those sentiments so far, Ryan, Rich and Joan.Alright. The next story, the fourth one that I'm reading out. This one's from Edward Ruger, love this note, I got a few others like it. This kind of continues talking about positivity, but I especially appreciate it because it comes from a Senior in college. So, thank you for writing in, Edward.\"Hi, David, first of all Happy Birthday! Thank you for all you've done to continue to make me and countless others smarter, happier and richer.\" And thank you for that, Ed. \"My name is Ed. I'm a senior in college. I'm studying geology. Soon I will be entering the real world, yikes! I've been an investment nut since I was 12-years-old when my mom told me to take advantage of the many free resources at The Motley Fool for ways to save my $2 a week allowance. At a young age, I learned financial discipline from The Fool and I opened a custodial brokerage account where I could save my allowance, put it into stocks. And this is where  comes in. Despite having taken full advantage of all the information you all provide for over half of my life now, I only first started listening to this podcast and, I believe, the whole allotment of Motley Fool podcasts last summer. Since then,  has become my Wednesday afternoon tradition.\"\"In the past few weeks, I've found sanctuary from the barrage of breaking news in the massive backlog of episodes of this podcast. Despite being about something as ephemeral as the stock market, there are many truths in each episode that allow them to be timeless. Not only have I learned to become a better businessman through investing and , but a better scientist and an optimist. I've learned traits of positive company culture, how to succeed on Kickstarter and that some people \"own the water.\" And I think longtime listeners will know who Ed is referring to there. And if not, just google it, \"Motley Fool, I own the water\".\"Anyway, Ed concludes,  has pushed me to take the occasional leap of faith and view the world around me with a lens of optimism, I finally bit the bullet on  this past Summer, and again this Fall, and again in February, in thirds, of course,\" Ed notes. Boy! This is chapter and verse foolishness, Ed. I love it. Some of my favorite employees here at The Fool were people who are much younger than I am, but they grew up with The Motley Fool, people like David Kretzmann, who came out of this podcast and co-created the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum with me spontaneously one podcast. But similarly, David, to my recollection, got started investing at the age of 12 with The Motley Fool, with his dad.And so, to think that you're steeped in just your early 20s in this kind of thinking in these kinds of stocks, I just love hearing that you've now fully bought your position in Twilio over time. It just makes me so happy, but you said, \"Why? Because I believed in their mission.

Bob, you're writing from British Columbia. Thank you so much for this note. \"Happy Birthday, David! I myself have a birthday coming up on May 23.\" Well, Happy Birthday this week to you, Sir. \"I recently discovered, I'm exactly one week younger than you are, [laughs] as I was also born in 1966. I've been a longtime fan and Fool. I have three of your books. I've been a member since 2007, member of  , a couple of other services. It was a real pleasure to have met you, Tom, Jim Mueller, David Kretzmann and Morgan Housel at FoolFest 2015 in Alexandria, Virginia. I had planned to make the journey East again this year for FoolFest 2020, but alas, that will have to wait.\"Yep, we recently announced, [laughs] it's going to be not in-person, just like every other conference this Spring and Summer, but instead virtual. But I hope it'll still be a pretty great FoolFest.Anyway, Bob goes on, \"I've been interested in investing from the first days I started earning money. I'm a Canadian, which, I believe, has made becoming a Fool even more important. Higher fees on retail investment products, limited industries to invest in here in Canada and a currency fluctuating dramatically versus the U.S. dollar create different investing challenges in our fine country. I wanted to thank you today for providing me with excellence, not just in investing but also in principles and perspectives for life. Through the help of The Motley Fool and Warren Buffett, I'm now living the life of financial freedom, some would say, \"retirement\" but that word does not seem fitting for me. I've long believed, the key to a successful life is to keep learning, and luckily my interest in investing and learning has led me to financial freedom where I can learn even more.\"\"I grew up on the beautiful West Coast of Canada on Vancouver Island. My employment took me to the Greater Toronto area for 19 years, and due to investing, I was able to move back to British Columbia and the Okanagan Valley a few years ago. As I kept learning from you and others in the investing world, I developed my own continuum instead of the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum.\"\"Let me explain. As a lifelong investor, like you, I've lived through some big market adjustments. The dot-com market adjustment was painful, as I was invested in many of the building blocks for the internet that flamed out, like, Nortel or JDS Uniphase. After this period, I turned to Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway as a safe spot to buy shares to keep investing. Eventually I turned my attention back to David Gardner recommended Motley Fool companies through . Companies like Apple, , , ['] Priceline among the most successful. The GFC recession of 2008-2009 turned out to be great timing, of course, if you kept investing. A strong Canadian dollar helped me buy more shares of many great companies at great prices, which I still have today.\" And Bob cites  and Netflix as two of his largest positions.\"My lifelong investing journey has led me to think of my portfolio with a \"Buffett-Gardner Continuum.\" This continuum helps me think about portfolio risk and finding good companies. Investing with Buffett and Berkshire has been effective over the last 20 years. It's my biggest position. However, you've taught us Fools to invest in your best vision of the future. Living through market adjustments of the past has in effect using this continuum makes investing in the future more comfortable for me. Evolving down the \"Buffett-Gardner Continuum\" to companies of the future has really paid off with the pandemic taking over the world. At present, it also reminds me of a quote you've used from F. Scott Fitzgerald, \"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and retain the ability to function.\" Warren Buffett and Dave Gardner have two different styles of investing, tapping into both of them has been very effective.\"\"One of the great Warren Buffett quotes ... \" Bob starts to conclude, \"It's better to hang out with people better than you, pick associates whose behavior is better than yours, and you'll drift in that direction.\" And I didn't know that is a Buffett quote, that's a great one, it sounds a lot like James Clear and what he was saying a few weeks ago on this podcast as well.Anyway, Bob says, \"I've been listening to more of your rule breaking podcasts lately. I equate this to hanging out with the best, not only in the investing world, but as an individual.\" That's too kind, thank you, Bob. \"I recently discovered the David Gardner quote \"I like to invest in excellence.\" Yep, I think I pounded that one home earlier this hour. \"This is my new mental framework, invest in excellence. I consider spending time with you, David, and your podcasts an excellent investment of my time. I not only learn fantastic investing behavior and insights but also great principles and perspective for life. Another one of your quotes resonates with me. \"If you want to be a more interesting person, lead a more interesting life.\" Thank you, David, for providing excellence, making me a better investor with a better temperament, helping me to become a more interesting person overall. Warren Buffett has had a huge influence on the investing world, and in life, David Gardner is a fantastic complement to the investing legend. Happy Birthday! And thank you.\" Well, those words are a birthday present, and certainly too kind, Bob. Thank you.\"I'm really glad of our past association that we met five years ago at FoolFest, I'm sorry that we can't spend time directly with each other at FoolFest this year. I'm thinking about you, though, in beautiful British Columbia and it puts a smile on my face, and I want to say again, Happy Birthday to you, Sir, this week.\"You know, I try to always back load my stories so they get better and better. I try to backload my points so that they get better in many of my podcasts, I hope that's going to be true here as we close out with these last couple.This great note from James Chen is next. James, you wrote, \"Dear, David, Happy Birthday! What I learned from The Motley Fool and you, specifically, cannot possibly be summed up in just three points, but I'll do my best. To give you an idea of just how transformative The Motley Fool has been to me, I was exposed to The Motley Fool, and specifically, the  podcast, four years ago, and bought my first stock in April 2016. Fast forward to 2020, not only has my own portfolio thrived almost 30% annualized at time of writing, I've been able to help numerous people among my friends and families to do the same, started teaching personal finance and investing at my local church and even launched my own investment fund.\" Wow! That is quite four years, [laughs] James.\"Reflecting on these amazing four years, here are the top three things I learned from David Gardner? I'm intentionally referring to you now in the third person just in case this is read on air.\" Yes, you know that I'm a little bit sheepish about referring to myself in third person, I made quite a deal about that in last year's What have you learned from David Gardner show. If anybody wants to hear me make jokes about how professional athletes often refer to themselves in the third person and how I think that's funny and how I try not to do it myself, you can definitely listen one year ago to me with a mini-rant on that topic.Anyway, James, you go on. \"No. 1, winners win. Finding and holding on to excellence is a lot more important than finding bargains or minimizing mistakes. While David has demonstrated this principle over-and-over again in his recommendations, my own experience only reinforced this concept. When I first started in 2016, I established positions in ,  and . A few months in, I became concerned about their valuations ... \" Note he said, a few months in. \" ... sold all three for a small gain to concentrate in another investment which I thought was trading at more of a \"bargain,\" while that other investment ultimately did well, it does not even begin to approach the kind of returns that these three companies have generated since then, four- to five-baggers each.\" That means they're up 4X to 5X in value each, for those who are not rocking the bagger language that I regularly use on , swiped from Peter Lynch, one of my investing heroes when he first started characterizing a stock that goes up 10X in value as a ten-bagger, kind of, riffing on baseball a little bit there.Anyway, that's amazing that you found Veeva, Match Group and ServiceNow that early, James. Great lesson to learn. And thank you for sharing this back.\"Moreover,  was already a ten-bagger ... \" James writes, \" ... by the time I first established a position. To this day, it remains one of the best performers in my portfolio. Of course, how can I not mention Shopify, which I was fortunate enough to own since 2016? Just when I think this company can't go any higher, it continues to defy even my most optimistic expectations. I'm now so fully convinced winners win that I even have my own paraphrase for this concept, \"Find a bargain and it rewards you once, but find excellence and it will reward you for years, if not decades to come.\"\" That's a signature phrase from James Chen.Alright. \"Point No. 2, humility and accountability. David Gardner's colleagues at The Motley Fool have demonstrated that nice guys don't finish last. [laughs] From keeping score of his past recommendations, to embracing the tenets of conscious capitalism, David embodies the kind of business leader that we as investors should look for when evaluating the management of companies we want to invest in. Without humility and accountability, we cannot learn and grow, nor can we truly inspire others to be at their best for a common mission. I don't think it's at all a coincidence that some of my best investments ... \" James writes \" ... are also run by leaders who exhibit such qualities, whether it's Tobi L\u00fctke from Shopify or Eric Yuan from .\"\"Related to this, humility also means that we're willing to admit that we could be wrong. No matter how confident we may feel about a particular investment, by simply acknowledging that we could be wrong and always keeping a diversified portfolio, we can avoid devastating losses and ensure that we are victorious in the long-run.\"Boy! Do I want to just keep underlining a lot of the things that you're saying? [laughs] That's a really important point that you just made. James, thank you for articulating it so well.Your third and final point, \"Live a fun life. I often joke [laughs] that David Gardner proves that a successful and responsible adult can and should play games. After all, nobody can deny that he's been very successful nor is he shy to disclose his late-night gaming endeavors. David often says that one of the most effective ways to become a better investor is to lead a more interesting life, and I couldn't agree more. By exposing myself to different experiences, and sometimes even forcing myself to go out of my comfort zone, my life and thinking have been greatly enriched. It's also allowed me to meet new people or deepen my existing relationships, many unsurprisingly are now involved in one way or another in my investment and business endeavors. In fact ... \" James concludes, \" ... it was exactly this willingness to expose myself to new experiences that four years ago, at the prompting of my brother, also called David ... \" shout-out to David Chen, \" ... that I started to learn about stock investing and listen to the  podcasts. Happy Birthday again! James Chen.\"Thank you, James.And the last correspondent that I'll share with you this week; and before I do this, I want to thank everybody for writing in, obviously, I couldn't share all the stories, all your notes, all the lessons, a lot of them though or consonance, so even if I didn't get to feature you this week, I hope you heard some of your own story or some of your own lessons in what I've shared over the course of this hour together. And Jason Pete-Myer I mentioned you a couple of weeks ago on Old, New, Borrowed and Blue because you liked the idea of more positive news. I was talking [laughs] some about my experience at the Columbia School of Journalism way back when. So, I mentioned you there and so your note here picks up by saying, you just listened to that episode. \"Thank you so much for the shout-out. How cool to hear my name read aloud ... \" Jason says, \" ... on my favorite podcast of all time and perfect pronunciation of my last name, Pete-Myer, I shared the podcast with my fianc\u00e9e Andrea immediately, and that made our day.\" Well, that makes my day; I'm so glad to hear that.\"Thank you so much for being a Tom Wolfe in your replies to your Foolish listeners ... \" Jason writes. Another allusion that I won't cover but regular listeners may remember my Tom Wolfe story. \" .... the replies and interactions with listeners make for such a fun and entertaining show.\" And I'll just add again, boy! Hasn't that been true of this week?\"What have you learned from David Gardner? Well, your request is both the easiest and the hardest question for Fools to answer. It's easy, since there are many great lessons that you've taught us Fools since the  podcast began, but that's also what makes the question challenging, as there are many great lessons. So, how's a Fool to choose? Well, my thought ... \" Jason says, \" ... was to summarize what I believe is the essence of David Gardner's investment philosophy. It happens to be those same words mentioned in my previous email to you, and those words are, \"the future.\" And so, to perhaps break the rules and provide my answer in a unique way, attached is an MP3 audio clip that I saved a few years back from one of your lessons. I have that audio clip saved to an Apple Note with some of your best investment ideas that I read on a regular basis.\"Wow! That's awesome! Thank you so much, James. And well, an MP3 audio file, I'm flattered. Thank you very much, Jason. And you know what? I do want to tell one final story before we finish. So, I'm going to ask my talented producer, Rick Engdahl, to -- right as I conclude my final story -- to play the clip, it's just a 20-seconder, I see, that Jason has as his big takeaway from what you've learned from me in this podcast. So, that's what's actually going to end this week's podcast. Thank you for our dramatic ending, Jason.But I did want to tell one final story in passing, you know, I was listening back to last year's What Have You Learned show, on my birthday week. And I had an experience that week that feels just as interesting and fresh to me today. I told the story on last year's show and I'm going to just tell you the story and the lesson once again to close. So, shall we?My birthday was last week and I was driving from where I'd spent my day to supper that night. It was a gorgeous evening here in Washington DC, for those of you who know our climate, the Mid-Atlantic in general perhaps, but maybe especially Washington DC, there's a wonderful three weeks or so each year where Spring is sprung and yet the heat, the humidity and the gnats aren't out yet. The Washington Nationals may be out -- and keep in mind I was writing this last year when indeed baseball was happening and it ended up being quite a season for The Washington Nationals, as they won the World Championship, but anyway to go back to the story -- The Washington Nationals may be out, but I'm talking about the gnats, would start to swarm around us like clouds through most of the Summer. And it was one of those nights last week on my birthday. And I got in my .My driver had, I'm going to say, it was a Russian accent. I'm quietly on my own, I noticed he had the windows up, but it was about 5:30 PM and I wanted to drink in the evening air, so I put my window down, and we got started. And about four minutes in, he just reflexively rolled my window up.So, I'm just sort of sitting there, I'm a generally pretty non-confrontational person, so in my mind, the driver wasn't comfortable or didn't want me to have my window up, he probably had air conditioning and maybe he was thinking economically. I'm not really sure what he was thinking other than he wasn't thinking what I was thinking and that made me sad as he put my window back up. So, I sat there for about five minutes and I stewed about it a little bit. I noticed that the air in the car was not particularly pleasant, it wasn't really air conditioning. I think he had the air going, but not the AC on. And I was just sitting there thinking, it looks so beautiful outside. Should I do it?I decided I'm going to do it. I'm going to ask him if I can roll my window down. Now, I know many of you are like, of course, you can roll your window down, it's Uber, they're there to serve you. It's your window temporarily while you're in his car. And yet, that's just not how I roll, as I mentioned, I'm pretty non-confrontational, but I decided I'm going to ask him directly. So, I said, \"Hey, do you mind if I roll my window down?\" And he said back to me, in so many words. \"Thank you so much for asking me to do that. In fact, I'm getting a little sick right now and the air in the car would not have been good for me.\"And what I realized from that conversation was that we were both creating together a small dystopia. He misunderstood my intentions, I misunderstood his, we both found out the wicked witch was dead, all hail Dorothy, we both wanted the window down. And as I told my kids later that night, it's important in life not only to let others know what you like and not make assumptions about what they're thinking, but sometimes you may be surprised that the other person was thinking exactly the same thing that you were. And yet, if I had not reached out, if I just sat there and stewed for another 25 minutes, missing a gorgeous evening in the nation's capital, I would have been living in a dystopia of our own collective creation.Now, I'm sure many of my seasoned, wise and knowledgeable listeners already knew that. That's maybe not something that you had to learn from David Gardner, but perhaps for a few of you, maybe I've given you a nudge.Well, I look forward to being with you next week. Thank you all for the beautiful notes and thoughts that you graced me with and that I got to share back this week with you.

A car rental bellwether just  over the weekend.\u00a0Online travel specialists aren't tethered to a single brand or even industry niche, but those models are naturally taking it on the chin.   -- the world's second-largest online travel portal with $11.7 billion in trailing-12-month revenue -- entered the holiday weekend trading 46% below its previous high.

Revenue  in the first quarter, and that was with travel happening largely as usual through a good chunk of the first three months of the year. It bears pointing out that Booking Holdings is a global player. Priceline, Kayak, and OpenTable lean mostly on stateside travelers, but its namesake Booking.com hub is a bigger force in Europe and Agoda is a juggernaut in Asia. Some overseas travel markets cooled before the U.S. during the quarter, but it all points to a grim near-term prognosis.\u00a0Gross travel bookings during the quarter actually plummeted 51% in the first quarter, and there's no reason to think that things will get better anytime soon. What makes one particular online travel portal so special? What makes it so resilient when just about every travel-related stock in the investing universe has shed roughly half of its value, if not more? Booking Holdings isn't coated with Teflon. It's coated in jet fuel and hotel bed sheets, with a Hertz bankruptcy filing in the rental's glove compartment. Yes, Priceline also operates RentalCars.com.Analysts are concerned. They see revenue at Booking Holdings declining 29% in 2020. Earnings are expected to be cut by more than half. This isn't a knock on Booking Holdings. It can't single-handedly convince people to travel for leisure anytime soon -- even if a global recession wasn't percolating. It can't sway businesses to embrace corporate travel with the same aplomb now that we all know what can be done remotely. There will also be a shakeout among travel providers, and that will limit what Booking Holdings or any portal can offer.\u00a0This isn't just Booking Holdings taking a big step back. Analysts see Expedia, Trivago, and TripAdvisor taking a 25% to 34% hit on the top line this year. However, those stocks got buzzcuts. Booking Holdings still has a full mullet.\u00a0It's probably worth noting that Booking Holdings wasn't doing so great even before the pandemic smackdown.\u00a0You have to go back more than a year to find the last time that Booking.com posted double-digit revenue growth, and that was with an expanding global economy. How is it going to fare in this contracting global economy?If you believe that travel will bounce back with the same fervor as before, then why buy Booking Holdings when Expedia would have to nearly double -- or TripAdvisor and Trivago would have to more than triple -- to get back to earlier highs?

United recently decided that it would boost its scheduled capacity for July travel, and although that will still leave it 75% below where it was in July 2019, that's a big improvement from the 90% year-over-year cuts that United made for May and June air schedules. when the coronavirus pandemic began, and that leaves plenty of room for the stock to rebound if things get back to anything close to the precrisis normal. Value investors tend to be more averse to the big risk involved with turnaround plays of the magnitude of the , and there's still plenty of uncertainty in the space. Nevertheless, United has a lot to gain from renewed interest in air travel, and shareholders hope that the positive trends will continue.The optimism in airline stocks also carried over to broader online travel portal companies. Booking Holdings picked up nearly 5%, while smaller players like  and  weighed in with gains of 8% and 13%, respectively.At first glance, it might seem like Booking is picking up steam for the same reasons as United and airline stocks.

The stock has now recovered to within 20% of its previous high after having been down as much as 45%. That seems like a huge rebound given the continuing uncertainty surrounding the industry. Moreover, Booking was already seeing growth slow down even the coronavirus crisis hit.All that adds up to some nervousness about whether the gain in travel stocks is justified given what we're seeing in the industry.

Overhead costs including salaries still ate into profits, and its Adjusted  results swung from a 21.4 million euro profit a year ago to a 0.6 million euro loss. It also recorded a 20.7.6 million goodwill impairment charge, leading to an unadjusted net loss of 214.3 million euros. The company warned that second-quarter results would be significantly worse than the first quarter's, and said that revenue loss bottomed out at 95% year-over-year in the last week of March and remained that way through April, though it has seen a modest recovery since then as European countries have begun to reopen.The company is making a number of significant changes to adapt to the crisis, and it was frank about what it expected in the near future -- which holds implications for\u00a0 and\u00a0 , Trivago's two biggest bidding partners, as well as other players in the industry.Image source: Trivago.With COVID-19 remaining a threat even as countries begin to reopen their economies, Trivago has begun to see a shift to local and domestic travel rather than international vacations. Consumers are looking to escape from cities and go to more rural areas. CEO Axel Hefer noted that in Germany, where Trivago is based, trips from German cities to the German coast and mountains were becoming more common compared to trips to Mediterranean beach destinations in countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece, which Trivago would usually be more likely to see this time of year.As it expects the trend towards local travel to persist for the near-to-medium term, Trivago is adapting its product to inspire short-term trips that can be planned spontaneously. CEO Axel Hefer said on the  that traditionally Trivago's product had worked best for travelers who knew what they were looking for, but with travel demand having changed drastically, it's changing the way it attracts customers. CFO Matthias Tillman said in an interview that the new product would launch in July and would offer things like top-ten destinations within 200 miles to engage travelers and present them with options that they may not have been previously considering.In line with the trend in local travel, the company also expect cars trips to predominate over airplane trips for the foreseeable future, which spells bad news for an already battered industry, though it could help some smaller and independent hotels and overlooked regional travel destinations.In recent years, one of Trivago's most important strategic initiatives has been building up its inventory of alternative accommodations from sites like Airbnb, VRBO, and Homeaway to offer travelers a more diverse array of lodging options, which has been important as Airbnb has disrupted the traditional hotel industry. Trivago grew the number of alternative accommodation units available from 250,000 in Q3 2017 to 2.3 million in Q3 2019, and that diversification could be paying off now.On the , Hefer said that there was no shift from hotels to apartments in Q1, but in April a trend in searches began to move more toward apartments -- though it was on low volume, so the company doesn't necessarily assume that will be a long-term trend. Nonetheless, the shift toward apartments and home rentals could owe to the fact that so many people's lives have been uprooted by the crisis and people are looking for long-term rentals while they have to adjust to temporary changes, whether that's kids being out of school or adults working from home.That could point to an earlier recovery for home rental sites like Airbnb and\u00a0Expedia-owned VRBO and Homeaway than for hotel chains and accommodations more dependent on business travel, a segment that looks set to be a laggard in the travel recovery.Though there is still a lot of uncertainty around the pandemic and the economic recovery, Trivago struck a cautious tone on near-term recovery. The company said full-year revenue would be down by more than 50% in 2020, and it would have a significant Adjusted EBITDA loss. For 2021, it also expected revenue below pre-crisis levels.Commenting on a broader economic recovery, management said in its shareholder letter:\u00a0While some European countries have taken first steps back toward normality with some relaxations to the existing\u00a0shutdown, we believe a cautious and gradual approach will be important to avoid a \"second wave\" of infections.\u00a0Rebuilding in strides, a safe travel experience and our customers' trust in traveling should be the main objective of\u00a0our industry for the months to come.As a result, we expect to experience only slowly recovering volumes, which will be depressed by the economic\u00a0impact of the crisis, limited and restricted leisure offerings in destination and the only gradual return of perceived\u00a0safety in traveling.Because of safety concerns and its economic sensitivity, travel may be the last industry to bounce back from the crisis, and it is unlikely to make a full recovery while the virus is a risk.Trivago isn't standing still during the crisis. The company is introducing new ad products like sponsored listings and display ads to better engage advertisers and consumers, and it's cutting costs, with layoffs expected to reduce personnel and related costs by 20 million euros in 2021. With its variable cost structure -- it spends the vast majority of its revenue on marketing -- Trivago is nimble enough to survive the crisis, and Hefer expected the company to emerge as a more efficient organization, saying, \"We are using the time of low travel activity to fundamentally improve our value proposition both toward our users and our advertisers and leave the crisis stronger than we entered.\"There will be a significant shakeout in the travel industry during the crisis, but Trivago is less at risk than companies with high fixed costs like hotel chains and airlines, and that could be a crucial advantage over the coming months.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With so few planes in the air, the need for employees like pilots, flight attendants, and mechanics is at a low. One report suggested that  out of its workforce of roughly 25,000. Yet because of the conditions on the loans and grants that United and its peers took from the federal government, laying off those unneeded workers isn't an option until September at the earliest.Strangely enough, one recent United incident highlighted what you might think would be the last problem airlines are facing right now: overcrowding.  of a fully packed cross-country United flight highlighted the challenges of trying to operate the few flights for which there's still ample demand.A viable vaccine is United's best bet for returning to business as usual.

Until it does, United is likely to see continued reluctance to fly the friendly skies from a wide swath of prospective passengers.Similarly, shares of hotel-related companies were higher on Monday.

Revenue per available room in Marriott's most recent quarterly report was down 20% in North America and 30% internationally, and the plunge in April was much worse at roughly 90%.Yet even if Marriott can get its own operations back to full speed, it still has some hurdles to overcome. With so many luxury high-end hotel properties, Marriott is susceptible to a pullback from travelers who are trying to economize on travel expenses. Even once people start traveling again, a recession could push them to less expensive alternatives to Marriott properties.The Nasdaq has tended to outperform the broader market during the coronavirus crisis, largely because of the tech companies that are capitalizing on providing solutions to the resulting economic disruptions.

The vaccine is now proceeding to Phase 2 clinical trials with the FDA, and with it, the chances that we'll be able to prevent future outbreaks of the disease increase markedly.If and when that happens, investors seem to be thinking, people may decide that it's safe to travel again -- to reserve flights on airlines, to book hotels at vacation destinations, and to rent cars to drive around once they get there.All of this makes sense logically. The question is whether consumers will respond logically to the discovery and dissemination of a vaccine, and how long it will take for things to get back to \"normal\" after they do so.Right now, the situation for the travel industry, and the OTAs, looks pretty bleak.

The COVID-19 pandemic has upended life as we know it, causing unprecedented border closures, curbs on traveling, and the shutdown of shopping malls, factories, and food outlets. Many countries are still struggling to contain the coronavirus, and the tragedy is both a human one and an economic one.Booking's share price has plunged 33% year to date, and it seems the fall was justified. The company's first-quarter 2020 earnings report showed gross travel bookings plunged 51% year over year, while room nights booked (for hotels) declined by 43% over the same period.\u00a0Leisure travel is a  expense for many. The question now is whether Booking Holdings stock remains a buy despite the strong headwinds and lingering uncertainty.Image source: Getty Images.The pandemic has resulted in severe demand destruction within the travel and tourism industry. Airlines, cruise ships, and hotels have witnessed plummeting sales and are the hardest-hit industries. As Booking's core business is tied to airline, hotel, and meal reservations, it will undoubtedly experience a significant and adverse effect within the second quarter.Some of this negative effect is already showing -- newly booked room night reservations, excluding the effects of cancellations, plunged by over 85% in April 2020 compared to the same period last year. Management continues to see severely reduced travel and restaurant reservation bookings for the foreseeable future.To add to Booking's troubles, another three million people filed for unemployment last week, resulting in more than 33 million jobless claims being filed in the last seven weeks alone. The unemployment rate is set to soar to a level unseen since the Great Depression. This grim statistic means that even fewer people will have the propensity and capacity to spend on a vacation, further adding to the company's woes.The fall in revenue isn't the company's only challenge. With increased volatility in financial markets and financial difficulties faced by travel service providers and restaurant partners, these factors may result in the company's various partners being unable to settle the amounts they owe promptly.\u00a0The company has increased its provision for expected credit losses on receivables. If a wide swath of these service providers goes under due to the pandemic, it will result in further losses and also a worrying lack of cash inflow, just at a time when Booking needs it the most.Booking ended the quarter with around $9.2 billion of cash and short-term investments, while total debt (including convertible debt) stood at $8.5 billion. With revenue falling off a cliff, the company will also surely report a significant loss and suffer from negative operating cash flows. Investors may be worried as to whether the company may , given that the crisis has yet to abate and there is seemingly no news regarding the lifting of travel restrictions around the world.Fortunately, CFO David Goulden  in the recent  that the company had amended its revolving credit facility to substitute a minimum liquidity covenant that was due in 2021. A convertible note offering was also completed on April 8 that raised $4.1 billion in capital. This pushes up the total cash and investments balance to around $14.3 billion, of which $12 billion remains highly liquid. Total debt also increased to the tune of around $13 billion, of which $4 billion matures before the end of 2022.The company looks deceptively cheap at this point, trading at just 17 times trailing earnings. However, with revenue potentially falling 85% or more due to the pandemic, Booking will almost surely see significant levels of losses for the current fiscal year.Due to the uncertain and evolving nature of the pandemic, it may take an extended period before air travel and tourism regain normalcy, if ever. Booking may continue to suffer from adverse effects even after lockdowns are lifted, as no one knows how the post-pandemic landscape will look. There may even be structural changes for the affected industries that may alter the competitive dynamics or customer behavior for the foreseeable future.At this point, Booking feels like a potential value trap. While it may seem cheap as its share price has been battered down, I feel that more pain has yet to come.

Of course, we've got a couple of stocks we're watching this coming week. Joining me, as always, it's Certified Financial Planner, Berkshire Hathaway meeting know-it-all, I guess I could say, Matt Frankel. Matt, what's going on? I hope not much. I was supposed to be in Omaha this past weekend. We all know what happened with that. I ordered some of the meeting tchotchkes that they normally sell there, like a pair of socks with Buffett's face on them and stuff like that. So, I'll at least feel like I was there. Yeah, I had the good fortune to go to the meeting, it must have been seven years ago now or so; seven or eight years ago. And it obviously was in Omaha at the arena. And we were lucky, we got the press passes, so you get to go in there and sit up in the top row there, kind of, looking down on the entire meeting. It's really kind of overwhelming to see how many people this meeting attracts year-in and year-out. Calling it Woodstock for capitalists, I think is pretty apropos. Everybody is really excited to be there.It's not just the meeting, it's everything leading up to the meeting. Nights before we went to Gorat's for dinner one night, we had the steak there. And now they've incorporated, I guess, what, that 5K run or whatever. So, they really are building this up to cater to an audience. That I think this is certainly going to extend well beyond the years where Charlie and Warren are running the show here. I mean, it really speaks to the culture they've built there. Yeah.

At next year's meeting, Buffett will be 90 and Munger will be 97, so. [laughs] Yeah. And speaking of that, you know, the age factor. Obviously, Warren was there, Charlie wasn't there this year. And Warren certainly made sure everybody knew that he was feeling OK and he just wasn't there. I thought it was pretty neat to hear that Charlie Munger has figured out how to use  and he's zooming into some Berkshire meetings and helping get some stuff done just through the Zoom platform; that was pretty cool to see. Yeah, I'm wondering if just him being in the highest-risk group for the virus has anything to do with him not traveling. It's a distinct possibility. I mean, at 96, that's the exact group that doesn't want to get this. That is an at-risk population, that's the one that really needs to make sure they stay out of harm's way for sure.

Matt, you wrote a great article there talking about earnings and more.So, let's just open the discussion up here with the numbers first for the business. Let's look at the quarterly performance for the business, look at how Berkshire Hathaway as a company is doing. What stood out to you in the performance metrics, especially given the current situation? Well, the headline numbers, first of all, don't really matter in Berkshire's case. Berkshire reported a loss of almost $50 billion for the quarter, but the company didn't actually lose that money, that's just the performance of its stock portfolio by March 31.So, the better numbers, operating profit, meaning how Berkshire's actual operating businesses, like, GEICO, etc., did. Operating profit increased by 6% from last year. So, the operating businesses are OK. It's really important to note that just the declines in earnings and that giant loss I just mentioned are just due to unrealized profits and losses in the stock portfolio. Yeah. And it's worth noting, Berkshire is a very insurance-heavy business. I mean, let's look beyond just its stock portfolio. I mean, when you talk about those wholly owned businesses, the two biggest, if I'm not mistaken, are Burlington Northern Santa Fe and GEICO. I think Burlington Northern actually is a little bit bigger, but for all intents and purposes, they're basically the same size. But I mean, that gives you an idea, beyond the stock portfolio, of the actual fundamentals of this business. I mean, this is an insurance business for the most part it seems.Yeah, Berkshire focuses on insurance; the railroad you said is a massive business; they also have their energy business, which is a huge component of it; I know they own a bunch of utility companies, which is a big Buffett favorite. And then a bunch of other kinds of smaller -- I say smaller, but I'm talking about, like, Duracell and Dairy Queen. And so, these aren't tiny businesses, and there's about 60 of them altogether right now. So, those are doing OK as a whole.Some of them, like, obviously, the Berkshire's furniture stores are generally closed right now, so. Like, things like that. But for the most part, his businesses are pretty recession proof. And including this crash, which is decimating recession-proof businesses even, a lot of them are doing just fine, like, GEICO, you know, they're giving everybody a 15% refund on their auto insurance premiums. But I got to think that their exposure is declining by more than 15% because no one's driving. Yeah, I would imagine that's a good way to look at it. I mean, it's certainly a nice way for businesses -- I mean, GEICO certainly isn't the only one doing that, but we're seeing a lot of insurance companies passing those savings along, and that's great to see. But to your point there, I mean, insurance, we look at as being, generally speaking, fairly recession-resistant. I mean, I don't think anything is really recession-proof, but insurance is a pretty reliable revenue stream, right? Whether it's homeowners or auto or life, whatever it may be, insurance is one of those things, this is a pretty reliable revenue stream. Which even when you look forward and you see the uncertainty in the insurance space. We talked about this with , of course, a couple of weeks ago, I guess. Plenty of uncertainty there as far as claims for this and otherwise. But still, insurance is a pretty stable business and I think that's going to make investors feel pretty good.Now, when we talk about Berkshire Hathaway, we talk about these wholly owned businesses, the culture that they've built, we also talk about the investments that Buffett and Munger make and their deputies there, Todd and Ted, they are really good at investing. And we looked at them as sort of our North Star for a lot of reasons there.It was a little bit surprising to me, for all of the talking and the action and the opportunities that we saw come up here over the past several weeks here, given the coronavirus situation, it really does look like Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway have been holding off on really putting a lot of that money to work, haven't they? Yeah, this really, really shocked me when I saw the numbers. Their cash hoard has actually grown, now it's at a new record, $137 billion. So, it looks like they did buy some stocks. The number goes up for other reasons, for example, the other operating businesses generate some money that gets thrown into the cash pile. That doesn't mean they sold stocks. But it looks like they bought about $3 billion worth of stock, just looking at the cost basis of the entire portfolio at the end of the year and then again on March 31. So, it looks like they bought about $3 billion. We'll find out what they bought in a couple of weeks, but I got to say, I was disappointed at this.The big thesis for owning Berkshire as opposed to a more exciting growth stock is that Warren Buffett and his team are really good at putting money to work at the right times. And so far anyway, again, this only covers through March 31, but so far it doesn't look like that's really happened. Now, why do you think that might be? Do you feel like maybe, given the chain of command there, I mean, it does seem like they give Todd and Ted pretty much, I don't want to say full autonomy, but it sure does feel like they have a lot of freedom to just kind of do what they really feel like is best at any given point in time. What do you feel like, is the trepidation more of a process thing or do you think -- like, I've seen all over , everybody talking about Buffett not buying stocks, building up that cash hoard.Given the exposure Berkshire Hathaway has to such a cross-section of the economy, perhaps they see more pain to come, what do you think it is? Do you think it's a process thing or do you think maybe they're thinking there's another shoe to drop? Well, I mean, one thing Buffett and Munger both said is that they wanted to preserve their cash; in case anything bad happens, they want to have tons of cash. There's nothing that could happen that you need $137 billion for it. So, I buy that excuse for the first $40 billion or $50 billion of it.However, I'm not saying Buffett sees another shoe to drop here, but I don't think he's convinced that the opportunities are going to be over any time soon. I mean, right now, the market is still pretty down in the dumps. And like I said that only covered through March 31, so he could have been buying stuff in April and he could buy stuff in May as the dust settles.And everyone always talks about his financial crisis investments, and I know you were going to bring that one up in a minute. But the  investment -- Well, yeah, jump into that for a minute, because we all looked at that at the time and thought, Bank of America was, kind of, just getting out of that whole mortgage-backed security crisis there, you know, nasty acquisition, really just almost basically write that thing to zero, was that Countrywide? I mean, it didn't seem like, it just kind of left a bad taste in your mouth. It took a little while for that play out. Yeah, definitely. And I mean, the thing that really people should remember, if you're disappointed about Berkshire's non-investment right now, as I kind of am, keep the timetable of that in mind. The Bank of America investment, even now, essentially quadrupled Buffett's money. He put in $5 billion, ended up with over $20 billion right now. So, it quadrupled, but keep the timetable in mind. He didn't even make that investment until 2011. Meanwhile, the financial crisis was 2008 to 2009. So, a lot of these companies are going to be hurt for a while.And he mentioned the Fed's action. The Fed and the government have just been injecting money into businesses and the economy right now. So, a lot of businesses aren't knocking on the door yet, needing money or needing funding or anything like that, because they're getting it from the government. That's not going to last forever. So, I see kind of a longer tail to trickle of businesses running into capital problems as this plays out. We'll see how much the government keeps doing. I don't know if they're going to pass a $2 trillion spending bill every few weeks to keep this thing going. [laughs] Well, I'd argue that if they intend on keeping things shutdown, they better just plan on keeping this as a revolving door, because as long as they want to keep things shut down, they're going to have to keep that spigot open. I agree. My worry is that they're going to let everything reopen, you know, two, three, four whatever months from now and then demand isn't going to come back 100% right away and that's what you're going to see some businesses start to hurt, and that's when Buffett's phone might ring. And that's a good point there. I mean, I think we've talked about the two-sided nature of the recovery, whenever we see this recovery start to materialize. It is going to be a slow chug, it's not going to be something where you just open the doors and everybody's back out and at 'em. And we've seen a great example there, whether you agree or disagree with states reopening their economies and at least giving restaurants, for example, the opportunity to get their businesses back open. It's not saying you have to, it's saying there's the option, you have that option to do that if you want. If you feel like you can do it in a safe fashion, and we're certainly seeing some do it, but we're seeing plenty saying, you know what? I think I'd rather feel a little bit better just hang on for a little while longer, seeing how this plays out. So, I mean, I think it all speaks to it will be a slow recovery, it's not going to be something that just happens overnight. That's true. And South Carolina just opened its restaurants today for outdoor seating. Oh, wow! Yeah, well, see? I mean that's -- And a lot of places are being smart about it, they're like, blocking off half the parking lot and putting big tents up and putting tables under them. [laughs] So, they're being smart. We're seeing a lot of great innovation, you know, we're seeing a lot of great innovation. And my mom and dad are down in Georgia, there they see both sides of it as well. I mean, it's a frustrating time, but by the same token you give people at least the choice to try something and you start to see some neat innovation there and new ways of doing things. And whether it's a restaurant or the doctor's office, we're certainly seeing innovation in all sorts of areas of the economy now.I wanted to ask you about buybacks. We've seen Buffett's buyback philosophy evolve over time. I mean, they had that, I think, 1.2X book, sort of, measuring stick that they've always been using, they may kind of open it up to their discretion, have they been buying back much of their own stock lately? Uh! That's another one. [laughs] You're bringing up all the bad stuff, Jason. Well, we'll get to some good stuff -- [laughs] Berkshire spent $1.7 billion thereabouts on buybacks during the quarter, which is high compared to some recent quarters, but it's you know, 0.4% of their outstanding shares. Not doing big buybacks, and not just the amount of the buybacks, it's the timing that's been frustrating. Just to name the biggest part of the buyback, they spent a little over $1 billion in late-February, at an average price of $214, the company is currently trading for $177. Toward the end of March, Berkshire was trading in the $160s at one point, actually below book value, you mentioned the 1.2 multiple; they actually went below book value for a period. And the company didn't buy any at that time.So, that's what's frustrating, and Buffett addressed this during the meeting. And the way he explained it, and it makes sense to some degree, is that they look at a snapshot in time and whether or not shares are trading for more or less than their intrinsic value. At the bottom of the collapse, the stock price had been down 40% or whatever or the stock portfolio that Berkshire owns. And, yes, while Berkshire's stock price had declined, so did the value of the assets it represents. And it didn't represent that much of a discount to the assets as it might have appeared. It's not just Berkshire stock price, it's the stock price relative to the asset value as they're hitting the buyback button. I do get that, I mean, that does make sense, that does make sense, I do get it. I guess, it goes to show that even the great ones, it's still not always so cut-and-dry, and it's a marathon, not a sprint too. I think that's something that's always worth remembering. Your Bank of America point there, I think was really good one, in that, you see something there but we can never really nail down the actual time and that's why we take patience in that long view into such account [...] And like you said, the government's -- and I agree with you that as long as they're going to keep things shut down, the government will throw money at this thing. The fear is, you know, after this is over -- and same thing during the financial crisis with the big stimulus packages that came in '08 and '09, did you hear about any stimulus packages in 2010 when people were still going into foreclosure and things like that? No.So, you're going to have this, kind of, long-tailed problem that people are going to start running out of money after this is over because demand is not going to come up right away and there's no more government help coming. So, Buffett said the phone is not ringing yet, there's a good reason for it, people don't need money or companies don't need money, and if they do, they're getting it from the government and at much better terms than Buffett would give them, I promise you that. I would imagine. [laughs] Buffett usually wants, for a great investment opportunity, Buffett wants 6% to 7% return on capital. And that's for a fantastic opportunity. If he's taking risk, he wants even more than that. And right now, I think the CARES Act alone is worth what, 1% interest with a lot of it forgivable? Yeah, Buffett it's not going to give any of that.So, as long as the government funding is available, it makes sense that there wouldn't be any big opportunities. I wish he would have put more money in the stock portfolio. I get why there's no acquisition opportunities, but I wish he would have put more of that money to work in stocks, especially when great companies like  were, like, down in the dumpster in the past month or so. It's a good point. OK, Matt, I don't mean to harp on the bad news here, but we have to address really the elephant in the room here, and that is the airlines. This is one where, I'd imagine airlines probably built a pretty firm stance on whether you think airlines are a good investment or not, but the bottom-line is that Berkshire has, I think, liquidated their full positions in their four major airline investments that they had. And that was , , Southwest and . They announced on Saturday, they've dumped those shares and are moving on to greener pastures.Now, I don't hold that against them at all. I mean, I've certainly always sided on the one, I don't want to invest in airlines, just generally speaking I'm not a big fan and I've talked about why before.Now, I personally think there's a great lesson here for investors. I think this is one of these times where we can still glean lessons from the old man here. And I think being able to look at a situation and change your mind when the facts change, admit that, hey, maybe you got it wrong and move forward. I mean, there's an opportunity cost to hanging on there, to see if this thing bounces back. And I think it's probably reasonable to assume that airlines aren't going to bounce back in a quick fashion regardless of the recovery timeline. But what was your take there? I mean, that was, I don't know, did you feel like those were good investments from the beginning? Or, I don't know, he seems so conflicted on airlines. I don't know if they were good investors from the beginning. I mean, this is an unprecedented situation, no one could have seen it coming. This just completely changes the dynamics of a thousand different stocks, not just the airlines, but having said that, I don't necessarily think that the airlines are a bad long-term investor right now. I mean, some of them are in bad shape, like, American, for example, I think, is in pretty terrible shape, but there are some good, long-term risk-reward profiles there.The Buffett quote that this really reminds me of is the one that says, \"it's better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\" And right now, airlines are fair businesses selling at wonderful prices, at best. So, Buffett doesn't like fair business at wonderful prices, so it makes sense that he would keep trying to pull out that capital and set it aside for when there are some wonderful businesses to buy at fair prices. It's, kind of ,where I think it's heads out with this. It's not that he doesn't think that United Airways is going to be worth more in 10 years than it is today, it's not that he doesn't think that, it's that he doesn't know enough to make that call at this point. And he's not willing to roll the dice with his investors' money. Yeah. And I think that makes sense. I think a lot of us probably look at this and think that the airlines are going to be dealing with a tougher situation than a lot. They're not going to go away, but, yeah, just, I don't know, airlines have always struck me as, sort of, commodity-like, in that, people are just ultimately trying to get from point A. to point B. and they want to do it for a cheap price. They're historically poorly run in terms of capital. I think we talked about one on one of the other shows where they spent, like, what, 94%, 96% of their money on buybacks over the past few years, like, that's terrible. [laughs] It is. And especially given the capital nature of those businesses. The heavy capital nature of those businesses. I mean, yeah, I do feel like that's one where you really want to build up that rainy-day fund. You want to have an exceptional rainy-day fund, because you got to figure that rainy-day is coming every once in a while. Right. It's like, I don't think stocks are a bad place to put your money, but if I spend 95% of what I make on the stock market, it wouldn't leave a whole lot of cushion if I needed money for anything else, so. [laughs] No. Which is why we tell people not to do that, Matt. [laughs][laughs] Right. There's a reason that airlines have been bankrupt a few times before, and that Buffett stayed away from them for so long, there's a reason for it, but I don't know, this just threw a wrench in his plans. Yeah, I mean not the greatest investment, but I look at it from the glass half-full perspective. I just think this is a great lesson for younger investors to takeaway, is that, when the facts change, be willing to change your mind. And I think that gets easier the older you get, but there's always a little hubris there, you never really want to admit you got it wrong. And you can make the argument, oh, you hang on to those shares, just give it time, it'll come back. Maybe, maybe not, you know, there's an opportunity cost to hanging on to those shares, you could put that money to work elsewhere. And I bet you, they probably are thinking very long and hard about that right now as well.The quote that you noted there earlier, the quote that just made me think of, was you hear from him and Sir Richard Branson, \"You want to be a millionaire? Start with $1 billion and launch a new airline.\" You know that seems to be about how that market works out.OK. Matt, before we wrap up the discussion here on Berkshire, I think everyone is always thinking about this going into the meeting and thinking about it probably even more as the meeting wraps up, where do we stand on the succession question, is there any more clarity there or we still, kind of like, just more or less guessing? Not really. I mean, the decision to have Greg Abel sitting in the chair next to him, instead of Munger, instead of some of the other candidates -- I think Abel is the younger of the two of the Vice Chairman, I'm not 100%, I'm pretty sure he's the younger of the two. The two stock pickers are not in the mix. Ted and Todd are going to be the stock pickers, they're not going to be the CEO. And I imagine, they probably wouldn't want to be. They probably got their dream jobs [...] what they can do. [laughs] Right. They don't want to run Berkshire, they want to run some of its investments. So, in my opinion this is going to be Abel, but either of the two Vice Chairman would do just fine in the role. They've been with Berkshire for a while.I mean, Abel has been with Berkshire through '99. He's been there 20 years, he's trusted. [laughs] Like, no one else has ever sat in that chair next to Warren Buffett during Berkshire's meetings. So, for him to be the first ... Well, it's good to know that he's willing and able. [laughs] I see what you did there. [laughs] All right. OK. Well, before we wrap up the show, of course, we want to jump into our ones to watch. Stocks that we've got on our radar here for the coming week. Matt, I'll let you take it here, what is the stock you are watching this week? Well, I mentioned that there are some opportunities long-term in the airlines. I'm watching Southwest Airlines, I've been a fan for a while, I've been thinking of buying shares at these lower prices. And not that I like to go against Buffett, but I don't think he sold Southwest because he thinks it's a terrible business.I like it for two reasons. One, it's the best capital position of any of the four major airlines, meaning that they have the liquidity for a more extended shutdown than any of the other three. And two, they're pretty much exclusively dependent on domestic business, which I think, domestic air travel is going to come back a lot quicker than international travel. I think that's probably a fair assumption; I think that's a fair assumption. So, yeah, like American and Delta, their international routes are going to be shut down for the foreseeable future. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin just said this morning that he didn't see international travel really making a rebound anytime soon, but it's a great time to explore America. Yeah, it's a big country with a lot of cool stuff and probably a good time to keep  on your radar as well. But Booking.com is not the stock I'm going with, actually the one I'm keeping on my radar this week is PayPal. PayPal earnings come out on May 6, so on Wednesday.Ultimately, just looking at all of the usual suspects, in regard to the report, total accounts, money flowing through the networks, how Venmo is doing. There was a really good interview recently through  with CEO Dan Schulman, who just talked about how this period of time has accelerated the move toward digital payments and what they're doing there with PayPal and other networks like Stripe and  and what not. So, just really looking for, just sort of, a status update with how the company is doing, I'm sure they're doing really well. And I remain a very happy shareholder, but we will find out this week.But that's going to do it for us this week, Matt. I appreciate you taking the time out to give us the lowdown on what happened with the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting this year. And fingers crossed for you, my man. I think that you'll be able to get to it next year, and I know that if you do, you're going to love it. Yeah, hopefully, we'll be having this conversation with me [laughs] at the arena or in a hotel room somewhere in Omaha next year. Maybe I'll buy a ticket and come out there and join you. It's always worth the trip. It's a fun event. Just stay six feet away. [laughs] Will do.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. April is nearly over. A lovely month, many years, for those of us in the Northern hemisphere. An unforgettable month, this particular year. In the midst of a global pandemic, the stock market rarely has better months. The  up 12% for April as I speak. And, of course, many of our  stocks are up way more than that. 5 Stocks for the Coronavirus, anyone? I picked those earlier this month and wow! We've never seen a Five-Stock Sampler zing like that one has zinged or zung. And so, we're left to think back on April, what to make of it?That seems as appropriate a time as any to have a mailbag episode. Your questions, my best answers, only on this week's .Welcome back on This is the fifth Wednesday of April, so it's been a long month and a long month for this podcast. We usually don't have five weeks of  in a given month, but we do in April 2020. We started this month with James Clear; boy! That seems like a long time ago, and yet, it's very still fresh on my mind, I hope you enjoyed my interview with the author of the wonderful book .I'll say for my own part, I started to jog the day after I talked to James. I was starting a new habit of my own, I've managed to keep that up with the old Couch to 5K [C25K] app throughout the month of April. So, trying to get in a little bit better shape here before I turn 54 next month. So, that was a good new habit for me. But yeah, James Clear really speaking to us about the power of our habits, the good ones and the bad ones, and trying to get more of the former and less of the latter. And techniques in order to do that. And James, it was great to be with you and I look forward to having you on sometime in the future.And the week following Atomic Habits, it was April 8, 5 Stocks for the Coronavirus. I mentioned those at the top. The stock market is up 4.8% since I picked those five stocks on April 8. I'm taping this show 20 days later, that's right, we record on Tuesday afternoons. So, in 20 days, those 5 Stocks for the Coronavirus are up 25.6% against the market's 4.8%. If you want to round that, we're up 21% if you want to round those, less than three weeks later, as I speak to you here this week on . So, it has been a remarkable performance, all five of those stocks beating the market.The worst of them, , up 10%. The best of them, , up 37%. But all five of them up double-digits, pounding the market. It wasn't easy to be buying stocks on April 8 of 2020, I hope some of you were, I know some of you do. In fact, we'll be talking a little bit about that later in this mailbag.What a wonderful discipline it is to have a regular repeating approach to investing, where you mechanically dollar-cost average your salary or lump sums into the market in good times and in bad. And looking backwards, you'll notice that it probably didn't feel great, some of the best entry points you'll ever get as an investor, those times didn't feel great, and April 2020 would have been one of them. So, that first week or so of April, nobody liked stocks very much, it didn't feel great for me to have to pick five at the time, but boy! Just a few weeks later, am I happy to see their performance.Now, I'm the first to say, we're not going to over-celebrate three weeks of performance, we'll see where the market is in three months or, more important, three years, that's how long we track these samplers. So, I'll look forward to seeing how 5 Stocks for the Coronavirus looks once Coronavirus is, mercifully, done.But as I've sometimes said in the past, short-term performance does count in the sense that if we're talking about baseball, which I sure hope does come back in 2020, I don't know if it is, but there's no substitute if you're playing a nine-inning game for getting something like a 7:1 lead after one or two innings. So, usually a good indicator of winning later is winning early, but we will see.And then, over the last two weeks, two weeks ago, it was  taking over the podcast with Buck Hartzell and Robert Brokamp. And then, last week we reviewed three past Five-Stock Samplers. After all, if you're going to pick them, you should be reviewing them. I don't just mean on our podcast, I mean for you, yourself. And frankly, for all those pundits out there on television or in financial newsletters, I think, everybody should be reviewing performance. That should be paramount for all of us at the end of the day. I often subscribe to this idea, it is about results. And so, I was pleased to present those results of the past three years of April stock samplers on last week's podcast.Well, that was then and this is now. And as I got together my eight points for this week's podcast, I started noticing a theme running a little bit through them, which is reminding me of the mailbag I did in January of 2019. Now, if you're a regular listener, you know we do a mailbag every month and they might start to run together in your mind, they sometimes do for me, but I do remember, in particular, the January 2019 mailbag, because investors will remember the fourth quarter of 2018, and oh, my golly! What a bad quarter that was for stocks. I remember my portfolio was down 20% or so in just one quarter, which feels a lot worse than how my portfolio has done in the last quarter or so, ironically.And so, as we started January 2019, I said, it's time for a little chicken soup on this podcast. Do you remember those chicken soup books? Chicken soup for the soul and stories told in a long-running book series, kind of, like the dummies books, but they were the chicken soup books, and they were just inspirational stories for different types of people or different occasions and so, I believe my talented producer, Rick Engdahl, called the January mailbag Chicken Soup for a Fool and that's, kind of, how this one feels for me in April 2020.I think we all benefit from encouragement in good times and in bad, but especially in bad. And so, a number of the points that I've gotten and that I get to share with you this week are going to be from people telling inspirational stories. And it's my pleasure to share your stories out with our increasingly large Motley Fool listenership.Well, most of our mailbags over the last couple of years, I'd like to start with some hot takes from . I'm going to do that to start this one, but first let me just mention upfront that this is also a month where I like to go back and reflect on how this podcast is doing. So, if you haven't already, I hope you'll subscribe to  on iTunes and  or Google Play, you can follow us on Twitter at @RBIPodcast. You can follow me on Twitter, if you like, @DavidGFool, but finally, I hope you'll give us a review. Throw me some stars.Looking back on this month, what jumped out to you for good or for bad? I'd like to hear your constructive criticism just like I like to hear your praise. Let us know how we're doing, I read every comment. So, leave a review for  on your favorite podcast distributor site of choice; iTunes is the one I look at.Alright. So, some hot takes from Twitter, this one from @levi_wardell. Levi, you say, \"I thoroughly enjoyed the dividend investing podcast. My question about dividends, why don't companies tie their dividend to a certain portion of profits? If profits are down, so is the dividend payment; if profits vanish, so does the dividend. Thanks.\"Well, thank you for that, Levi. And the short answer is that companies' results vary too much from one year to the next for them to make a certain portion of their profits that year in dividends. You know, an important part of dividends and Dividend Aristocrats, we talked about that earlier this month, I'll be talking about them a little later this show, an important element is that consistency, people who want dividend payments, kind of, rely on them being consistent and maybe slightly increasing from one year to the next. So, if companies were to make a certain portion of their profits, which fly up and down from one year to the next, and 2020 is going to be a great example of that. If companies tied their dividends to profits, they would lose that consistency and a lot of investors.Thank you for that, Levi. Next one up, this one comes from @New49. \"So proud that my 12-year-old son woke up this morning explaining he reread The Motley Fool Investment Guide for Teens and tabbed our pages that he wanted to discuss. Changing family history!\"Well, that one made me really happy. I know Rick and our whole team loved reading that. Thank you very much @New49. To think that you're changing your family history by getting your kids to think at earlier ages about the importance of investing and finding great companies, boy! That makes me really glad we started The Motley Fool 27 years ago. And since I'm about to turn 54 next month, when I deduct 27, I still only get to 27. So, I'm delighted to know @New49 that you are working with a 12-year-old. Congratulations to you both.The next one comes from @Christian_Belko. \"@RBIPodcast was happy to donate to the effort for The Motley Fool today. Was able to use some money from the proceeds of e-meringue to help cover the cost. \ud83d\ude09 Seriously though, great job and I enjoy being a part of a worthwhile cause! #FoolOn.\"Well, thank you very much, Christian. For those who may not know, The Motley Fool, instead of doing an April Fool's joke, which we've done every year for the past 26 years as a company on our website. And many of you will remember stories back in the day, e-meringue, one of our better April Fools jokes of all time. Anyway, this year we thought that wasn't the most appropriate thing we could do, so instead our company decided, my brother Tom and I decided on behalf of our company, to donate $1 million from The Motley Fool's balance sheet. Real cash straight out to New York City. And a number of you listened, watched and joined in. Christian Belko, you're obviously one of them.Yes, tens of thousands of dollars also came in from Motley Fool listeners and members to help supplement our investment in New York, our donation. Christian, thank you so much for joining in with us.And how about just one more, this one from @TheNoCubeZone. This might have been my favorite tweet that went out supporting this podcast or mentioning us in the last month. In March, @TheNoCubeZone said, \"We are shouting out some of our favorite content creators that we draw inspiration from. Follow this thread for the list, don't forget to check out episode 3 on The New [No] (sic) Cube Zone!\" Now, I'm happy to promote The No Cube Zone, which I take to be a podcast about board games, supporting people who are content creators and designers and part of the board game scene.And I was delighted that on day 27, as The No Cube Zone shouted out some of its favorite content creators, they found our podcast. This is what they wrote, \"Day 27: going a bit off the board game content creators, but stay with me here. @TheMotleyFool has a series of podcasts I found because  podcast was interviewing Rob Daviau.\" Now, Rob Daviau is a game designer of great repute. Rob was on this podcast about three or four years ago. I love that The No Cube Zone listened in and found us that way. They go on with this tweet. \"I started listening to the  podcast because of it and really liked it. I now listen to  and @MotleyFoolMoney along with the  podcast I enjoy, because they make news and stocks fun but are also very informative. If you haven't checked them out, I would recommend any of these!\"So, boy! @TheNoCubeZone, did that make me happy to think there is that kind of crossover between the board gaming world and the world of investing and that the  podcast is bringing those together. I don't know that that would make sense for any other podcast, so I kind of feel like this is a hapax legomenon moment for this podcast. Anyway, great to hear that shout-out and thank you so much.Alright. Well, without further ado, eight items this month.  item No. 1, this one comes from Bill Davis. \"David, thank you for using my question in the podcast and then going on to devote a full episode to dividend investing. I found it very interesting, I hope that other listeners did also. As you noted in the mailbag episode, when you read my January 24 question.\"And I should mention that, yes, just a few months ago, Bill was on the January mailbag where he asked for dividend investing, we turned it into a poll and that ended up bringing Buck Hartzell and Robert Brokamp on the show to talk dividends, two weeks ago. So, here we have the progenitor -- I'll return to Bill's note in a sec -- but this is just a reminder that, yeah, you really do drive the content for the show, especially the mailbag. So, when I hear from you that you'd like us to do more of this or less of that, it truly influences what we do from one week or month to the next. So, Bill, great job getting us talking dividends.You go on to say, well, you said, \"Dividend investing is outside the usual  territory ... \" Bill says, \" ... I knew that but submitted the question nevertheless, mainly because the  podcast sometimes seems like a good space to address the storytelling and narrative aspects of investing, gives us a chance to see how the narrative of a company's life gives expression to the company's philosophy or strategy and their problem solving.\" I really like this thinking, Bill. \"Obviously a strong company that takes a turn and falls out of Dividend Aristocrat status, they've had a rather dramatic story that can give us broader insights into how other, even non-dividend companies craft their own business approach. So, the question was intended to drive in that direction.\" Bill writes, \"I'm sorry, if it was less than clear, but I'm grateful for the episode we got out of it. Thank you very much. Sending big love and gratitude to everyone at The Fool. Your mission to make the world smarter, happier and richer is certainly touching and helping me in my life. Then again, you're also helping to educate, amuse and enrich me. I hope you will all continue to be safe and healthy. Sincerely yours, Bill Davis.\"Well, Bill, thank you. Thank you, of course, for those kind words. And, yes, you know The Motley Fool's purpose, you articulated it very well, not just with your words at the end, but indeed with your action, which was to lean-in, listen, give us some feedback, give us a topic and something that a lot of people enjoy. In fact, there are a few more mailbag items about dividends, so this clearly touched a nerve in a good way, and Bill, that's because of you. So, thank you very much for that effort.I also appreciate your point about how we can learn from the stories of these companies and it helps us learn more about investing overall. I remember, one of the points that you wanted us to tease out, and I think Buck did a good job with this, you wanted us to talk about those fallen Aristocrats. So, Buck Hartzell was talking some about , and in an earlier era, , the generals, companies that have fallen, because in a lot of ways they just fail to innovate. They got big and slow. They were lumbering around as businesses and they weren't able to move with the changing times, and that ultimately undermined their dividends which they had to cut or get rid of.So, these are good examples and reminders of us, I think anyway for me as a , the power of innovation and continuing to innovate. That research and development budget, R&D as a percent of revenues, these are all things that really do matter. And even though it feels like innovation would be removed or divorced from dividends, in fact, it's what gives rise to those companies' abilities to pay their dividends. So, Bill, thank you again for inspiring that episode earlier this month, Dividends on .Alright. item No. 2, yeah, let's stick with dividends. This one's from Davor Baros, it might be Barrosh depending on which nationality Davor you sport, but anyway, thank you for this. Now, you said, \"Hello, David, there's definitely some truth in the saying, \"the best way to learn about a topic is to teach it to someone else.\" With this downturn in the market, I've been telling my brother to get some dividend yielding stocks at a discount. I was telling him that by buying now, he will be locking a higher dividend percent yield forever. However, over time I became unsure of my argument. What is the proper Foolish way of thinking? And if the temporary yield percent increase should be considered when deciding to buy?\"Then Davor gives an example, he said, \"If you have a stock typically costing, let's say, $100 a share and it's giving you $2.50 a share or 2.5% dividend yield, during this crash, let's say, the stock goes down to a $50 stock price, so that same yield $2.50 as a percentage of $50,\" this is basic math, some of us can do this in our heads, some of us you need me to give you the answer, we're here to serve all kinds here. \"That same yield is now 5%. So, presuming the company keeps that same payout, do I consider that 5% dividend return forever, even if the stock goes up?\" So, are you locking in that dividend yield forever, in so many words, Davor is asking, \"Help me stay Foolish in my thinking.\"Well, sure, I'm happy to give you a couple of pointers here on dividends, Davor. First of all, the dividend yield is ever fluctuating. So, from one day to the next, from one month to the next, if you have a same dividend payout, in your example $2.50 a share, well, as that stock moves up and down from $100 to $50 back to $75, the dividend yield is always changing. When you bought the stock, that day, that moment, you did, kind of, lock-in, assuming that the dividend is secure, an interest rate, a dividend rate of return, a yield on your investment. But certainly, if the stock goes back from $50 to $100 and your brother buys more shares there, he's only getting a 2.5% yield at that moment.Of course, prices aren't the only thing that change, dividends themselves change. And we talked about Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have distinguished themselves by paying bigger dividends from one year to the next over long periods of time. So, that's going to change your yield as well. So, no, I wouldn't say you're ever locking in a permanent yield or interest rate of return on owning that stock forever. When you buy a stock it's ever changing. It is certainly true at the moment that you bought it over the year ahead from that moment, you'll be getting something like that rate of return as a dividend, but things are going to keep changing.And last thing I'll say here is, a lot of people invest in these companies because they like to take the dividend they're paid and make it a reinvestment right back into the stock itself. So, rather than use the income, if you don't need the income, a lot of people like to DRIP, as they say, a Dividend Reinvestment Plan; that's a pretty bad acronym, DRIP for Dividend Reinvestment Plans. But a lot of people who love their dividends just like to buy more shares of that company and keep investing in it over time. So, that's a great way to make your yield really count and your money grow over time too.Anyway, I hope that's fairly straightforward, Davor, and congratulations on getting your brother thinking about these things and I hope I've liberated you to realize it's not about a permanent locked-in rate of return forever.Alright.  item No. 3. Now, this is from somebody whose name I recognize, because I have seen [...] on Investor Island, our mobile game, in fact, he is one of the most accomplished and best players of Investor Island and helped us test it early on. So, your #AtLastPlaceLenny, a real misnomer. Len, by no means are you anywhere near last place, humble and perhaps Foolish on your account to refer to yourself that way. But let me share your note, I really love this.So, \"Hello, David, my name is Len. I've been a  for about a year. I'm a listener of all The Motley Fool podcasts, I really enjoy them. I've learned so much, I read your book, listened to you for several years before I finally moved a large section of my RRSP from mutual funds to a direct investing account.\"Now, for those who would not recognize that acronym, I can't even break it down for you without googling it, which I'm not going to do, because I want to keep moving this week. But I can tell you that [Brans] Len is a Canadian, because the Canadians have their RRSPs.Anyway, going from mutual funds to a direct investing account. For Len that was about two years ago. He says, \"I initially focused on Canadian dividend funds -- speaking of dividends -- I was 42 years old and wanted to start to build a portfolio that would be income for me when I retire. It made sense to me to own companies that are paying me. I've been meaning to write to you for a while now just to share my story even if it wasn't read on air. I think you emit such a welcoming aura that people just want to connect, so that's what I'm doing.\"Len goes on to ask a question about tracking dividends on his spreadsheet, not that interesting for a mailbag, but, Len, I want you to know, I'm going to have somebody follow-up directly with you by email to answer that question. I just wanted to share your story.So, you go on to say, \"I never felt like I was a , I always viewed myself as a dividend guy and pretty conservative. However, your positive outlook with your view on business and the world as a whole just resonates with me. The dividends I own mostly are all in the red, partly because of the new environment we're in ... \" Well, I certainly understand that, \" ... but mostly because I pick stocks that had high yields. Well, the yields were a little too high, those stocks dropped when they cut their dividends.\" Len says, \"I'm left holding the bag, but I'm practicing patience and hoping they come back.\"And I'll just insert that we can imagine many of the Canadian companies are going to be natural resources companies, oil, mining, these kinds of companies dominate a lot of the Canadian economy, especially the dividend payers, and yeah, a lot of those companies are hurting right now and I'm sorry to hear that.Len goes on, \"I also used a couple of hot tips from a friend of a friend, I've lost in those cases as well. So, a year ago I thought enough was enough. I decided I would purchase your  services. Part of me felt you deserved to get something from me as I was using all your free tools to help me learn as much as I could about the markets. Most of my winners are stock picks you have made. When the COVID-19 was just bubbling out in early February, I went back to work in the oil and gas industry and I am in the Bay of Bengal off the coast of India.\" And that's where Len is presently writing from. He goes on, \"I am into week 11 as I write this, I normally only do 4- to 6-week trips. The end is not in sight for me as India is in total lockdown. International travel is very limited, I'm nowhere near an International Airport. So, what I've been doing to keep me sane is buying a small amount of stocks each Monday. I don't care if the price is going up or coming down, I have a list of your , I pick my favorite on that Monday and I deploy a small amount of my cash to that stock. It's truly the calmest I have ever been when buying stocks.\"I just love hearing that, Len.\"I normally would be scared and waiting for the right price. This approach has taken all the anxiety out of the equation. Unfortunately, my broker does charge me $10 a trade, so my cost basis on such a small amount, generally $500, is 2%. I plan to call him when I get home, try to get that down lower. Now, Canada hasn't caught on to no fee trading. Anyway, in conclusion ... \" Len writes \" ... I also plan to start up accounts for my 14- and 9-year-old daughters, hoping to start wealth for them at an early age, maybe spark an interest in them that I wish I had many years ago.\"\"I've always been a spreadsheet enthusiast, I love tracking and estimating my wealth when I retire. I've always said, if I were to have dinner with three celebrities, I would pick Ellen DeGeneres, Dwayne Johnson and you. [laughs] I consider you a celebrity even if you do not.\" Well, I do not. I certainly can't class myself with Ellen DeGeneres or Dwayne Johnson, I think, in any way, shape or form, except perhaps, in your mind, Len, and I'm very flattered by that. \"I like positive people,\" he says. \"I think that could make for some very fun conversation. Boy! That would be a great supper. Thank you for helping me begin to achieve what I hope to be a very rewarding portfolio, and for being a positive influence and all your products and advice. Take care! Len.\"Who notes in his postscript, he's just outside the top ten on Investor Island, wondering if he's played any of the analysts that he's gotten to meet through Motley Fool Live in recent weeks. He says, \"You should get your staff to post somewhere on your website what handle they're using. Love the game.\"Well, thank you very much for that, Len. You know, this was a delightful  item to share. In particular, Len, I think about how far removed you are from your family and your normal life, so I wish you the very best. I think about your family and your daughters who'd probably love to have their dad home, but I also think about the effort you're going to make when you do get home to start getting them more engaged on this topic and to think about your own engagement over the last year, it's really inspiring. And to think that you're just mechanically making those purchases over time into some of the best companies of our time. And I know you've made some pretty good investments over the last few weeks, and I think that's going to become very evident, if not already, in the coming years. So, Lenny [...] I wish you the very best, and for me you'll never be Last Place Lenny.Alright. item No. 4. Well, thank you very much, Caroline, for this wonderful note, how could I not share this one? This is admittedly pretty frivolous relative to the last few. But you start with \"Board games until 4:00 AM, you're my hero \ud83d\ude0a. I'm often up at that hour too, but everyone else is sound asleep.\" Caroline writes. \"If you don't mind my asking, who do you get to stay up until 4:00 AM with you to\"Listening to you on Motley Fool Live TV right now. Would have called in, and only have audio so can't ask this question in the Q&A. Thanks, Caroline.\" And she helps me by saying, \"You pronounce it the way Neil Diamond does.\" So. Yeah, I know I nailed that sweet Caroline. \"On lockdown ... \" she writes, \" ... in NYC.\"Well, this is a pretty quick answer for me, Caroline. I have over the course of my life cultivated friends who love two things. One, board games; and two, staying up at night. So, yes, I have a small cadre of friends that will hang out with me, not often till 4:00 AM. The reason you're writing in about that is, because I think I just mentioned it aloud on this podcast a few weeks ago that I was a little tired that particular week, because I had stayed up till, presumably 4:00 AM, playing board games.The reason I can't even remember for sure is because that's not unusual for me, that might happen a couple of times a month, especially it seems like during these last eight weeks, I've played a lot of board games now with friends and family. My family members tend to go to sleep around midnight. It takes a special friend or two to keep duking it out with me well past midnight. So, yes, not typical for me, although, Caroline, I realize it is very idiosyncratic among most of the adult population. Happy to number you in my company.I want to mention for you, in passing, one of my favorite words in the English language, you know, I keep a list of my 20 or 25 favorite words, this is on it, part of the reason I love this word is A. it's very obscure and B. it's very personal, maybe you'll like it as well, lucubration or lucubrate, verb, which means; my recollection, I'm not looking at dictionary right now, but it means to work late at night by candlelight, to lucubrate. So, if you think about Lucs, light, the Latin root, that's where lucubrate comes from. So, yeah, what a great word, to lucubrate, to work late at night by candlelight.In my case, a lot of that work is -- I like to say -- \"all work and no play would make David a dull boy.\" So, lucubration. My favorite form of it, playing board games until about 4:00 AM. Thanks for the note, Caroline.I should mention, she's referencing something that has been a remarkable development on our website over the past month. My brother Tom, our CEO, challenged us to do 24 hours of continuous programming using  as a platform on our website, for our members. And we did that several weeks ago, we went from 9:00 AM all the way through to 9:00 AM the next day using some of our friends and resources at Motley Fool Germany, Motley Fool Japan. But mostly, a lot of our analysts, people that you may have gotten to know as writers or analysts over the years. If you're a member, I hope you've already found . But boy! Have I enjoyed both being on it and appearing on a semi-regular basis, but also getting to see people like Morgan Housel at night or my brother Tom interviewing CEOs. So, this has been a wonderful development for us, April 2020, we would not have started this were it not for COVID-19, and yet, once COVID-19 is a distant memory, I have a feeling Motley Fool Live might still be going.It's been a great development for members and a great reason to join as a member, because you basically now have a new TV cable channel, it's just on our website and it's for you. We typically do programming, weekdays from 9:00 AM through to 9:00 PM. You can listen to it in the background, it's very interactive, it's often question-driven. So, just like I'm answering your questions on this mailbag, one hour a month through this podcast. Well, we're doing that every day it seems for members at .Alright.  item No. 5. This one from Andy Spiewak. Andy writes, \"Greetings from a fellow former resident of Southborough.\" And Andy I believe you're referring to Southborough, Massachusetts. That is where I went to prep school, it was a boarding school. So, I spent three years of my life as a teenager, sleeping in or around Southborough, Massachusetts. My alma mater is St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts. Andy, perhaps you are a fellow grad or at least a former Southborough resident. So, little shout-out back in the hood to Southborough, Mass.Andy goes on, \"I hope you're doing well in these tough times.\" Well, thank you, Andy. I'm happy to say I and my immediate family members and friends are, for the most part, I have heard of a few friends who've gotten COVID-19, in every case have recovered from it. So, very lucky to be able to say that. I hope that's true of you and yours as well.You go on, \"My question is regarding your recommended strategy for investing into expensive stocks which cost more than my biweekly contribution into my brokerage account. For example ... \" Andy says, \" ... if I'm putting $200 a paycheck into my brokerage, but would like to invest in something like  or Google [] of course, Amazon trades over $2,000 a share. So, if you're putting aside $200 every paycheck, you have to wait 10 paychecks or so before you could buy a share.\" Andy goes on, \"It would take months to be able to save up enough to get a share, and during this time-period I wouldn't be invested every two weeks as you typically recommend. So, would you buy cheaper stocks and sell them once you have enough for one share of the more expensive stock or would you leave the cash uninvested? I know this is becoming much less of an issue with fractional shares becoming more prevalent, but wanted to see if you had some ideas and the best way to handle this situation?\"Andy, great question. Yes, as you know, increasingly brokerages are offering fractional shares. So, if you don't already have a broker who does this, and my broker, , doesn't do this yet but they've committed to doing so, I think, in 2020. Increasingly, this is the thing all of us should be able to avail ourselves of. And if you really are intent on this, you could certainly move your money to a broker that does have this feature today. There's nothing set in stone that says you can't change where your account resides. But with all that said, if you like your broker and you just can't buy fractional shares right now, I don't think there's any reason you have to buy Amazon or any of the companies that have big share prices. There are lots of great companies, stocks that I regularly recommend in Motley Fool  and Motley Fool  that are $200 a share or less. So, I'm probably a bigger fan of regular consistent investing and just getting into great stocks, than I am of waiting 10 paychecks just to buy one share of a stock like Amazon, if in fact you cannot use fractional share purchases through your broker.That doesn't mean, by the way, that I favor small-price stocks, you know that I don't like penny stocks at all. And certainly, a lot of the stocks that I recommend typically are trading somewhere between $20 and let's say $100 a share, but that gives any member of Motley Fool  or Motley Fool  dozens of different great companies to become a part-owner of, if you find that the amount that you're saving per paycheck can't buy you a share of a bigger company.So, again, I think there are lots of paths, lots of ways to approach investing. Typically, I love the fractional share buy. So, you can buy any stock, Amazon, sure, Alphabet, or a stock like , which is a recent Motley Fool  purchase that's a much cheaper price per share. In the end, it's not about the price per share of stocks, I know you know this Andy, but I want to make sure all of our listeners do. I try to pretend, with Warren Buffett, that every stock is priced at $100 per share, just do that in your mind. Okay, now which one do you want to buy? So, it becomes about the company, not about the share price.Alright,  item No. 6. This one comes from PT Lathrop or Lathrope. PT, you write. \"Hi, David, I applied for a position with The Fool. I'm deeply honored to say I was considered; I did not get the position YET, but I have been invited to join the next group of freelancers in the onboarding and orientation. I was told in the interview that, both, you and Tom read my cover letter. It's from the heart, and if you'd like to read it during this month's mailbag, I think it can give a spark to all who are in or out of work. As always, PT.\"Well, PT, you sent a couple of good notes in and a question or two that I'm not going to speak to this week, but I did want to share your cover letter, because I thought it was great. And sure enough, my brother Tom and I did, as our team let you know, read it and we enjoyed it. And so, now let me share it on .PT wrote in this cover letter: \"Why do we invest? For our children and grandchildren, because we love and celebrate ownership, to manifest our best vision of the future? Yes, and a hundred other reasons besides. How do we invest? How do we invest better? We build and foster a community, a culture and brand, a brand that is a community, a community that is a brand. This community -- he's referring to The Motley Fool community -- always together, always motley, strives to educate, amuze and enrich the world around it and aim higher. It makes the world smarter, happier and richer, its power is in its culture and approach, purpose-driven, it is unconfined by tradition, norms and expectations. Make a mobile gaming app, cast pods, caps newsletters, MFAM Fool you and Fool me, anything to help our purpose be.\"Well, that first paragraph is just riffing on a bunch of the topics and concepts that's like, the greatest hits, looking back at , this podcast, over the last five years and a lot of the things that we talk about. Purpose-driven companies, the power of culture, certainly, motley and what's your motley and making the world smarter, happier and richer. Really appreciate all of those, PT.And I'm skipping down to the meat of this. Although, you had some more great catch phrases in there, like, \"we invest our dollars to see our best vision of the future,\" but really now we get to who you are. \"For the past decade ... \" you write, \" ... I've given my time to the National Park Service, a purpose-driven organization tasked with protecting whales, sheep, dinosaur bones and battlefields for the enjoyment of future generations. Time is a funny thing .... \" PT writes, \" ... you can give it, but you can never receive it. Even when others give you their time, you still end up with less. I'm proud of the work I do and do not need a new position, I think it's time for me to consider diversifying my time portfolio. That is, I still have plenty of time capital to allocate and I have some causes, some purposes on my watchlist. I'm ready to back up the truck and put on the clothes of The Motley Fool.\"Your final paragraph, wonderful, it reads, \"And in no way would I be turning my back on my current mission, a world that is smarter, happier and richer is likely a world that is also more supportive and more caring to our public lands and to our fellow species. I'm applying specifically for an editorial position. I write for work and for fun. Modern park rangers spend little time rescuing bears.\" I guess that makes sense, but, oh, my gosh, the scales are now falling from my eyes, PT, [laughs] it does make sense though. \"Modern park rangers spend little time rescuing bears; we spend a lot of time cultivating brand and inviting others into our mission through various media. I've attached two writing samples, one about , as requested, another published in  about Isle Royale National Park. My background is a peculiar one to join the financial services industry, but I know you'll find me to be contagiously creative, energetic, purpose-driven, team-oriented, willing to fail, willing to fix, eager to help, always learning. Fool on!\" And PT put a little jester cap icon on that cover letter as well.Well, PT, it was my pleasure to share that. Definitely kind of a chicken soup moment for this week's podcast and this month. You know, the cover letter has often been an important thing that we look at to distinguish candidates who apply for The Motley Fool. We have a lot of open positions today,  is a way to see what are the list of positions. PT has certainly done that; I'm sharing this out with everybody who's listening right now. And, yeah, I'm often told by our people team that some of our best applicants are our podcast listeners. Why? Because you really know us pretty well, you know our brand and our purpose, you often have a history with The Motley Fool and that's going to put you in a much better position than somebody who's just clicked us randomly on LinkedIn and forwarded their resume.So, while this sounds like didn't lead directly to that first position, PT, it sounds like you're being onboarded as a contract writer and that makes me very happy.But most of all, I just wanted to share out the motley array of different backgrounds. Yeah, we're very open to park rangers writing for us at The Motley Fool. That's true of so many of us. Of course, my brother Tom and I started the company as English majors. There's no presumption you need to have an MBA or have been a finance major. Really, there's just a hope that you have a heart for investing and a heart for the world, and that you have a brain, that you have a lot of intellectual curiosity and that you can truly help make our membership smarter, happier and richer, whether we're trying to do that every week through this podcast or through so many articles written by so many contractors worldwide every day for The Fool. PT, it sounds like you'll shortly be joining our ranks. Thanks for sharing.Alright. Well, two more this week, and  item No. 7 comes from Avery Pemberton-Smith. And, Avery, while we've never met, I just, I have to believe you're British. I mean, how could you be named Avery Pemberton-Smith and not be from the United Kingdom. Now, I could be wrong but I'm just going to guess that.Alright this one reads, \"Dear David, and fellow Fools, I was thinking about companies that have been outperforming over time, particularly, the FAANG stocks, and that's spelled this time F-A-A-N-G stocks or is it ... \" Avery writes, \" ... or is it F-A-A-A-N now, I'm really not too sure. And though I am still a fan, I think this acronym is beginning to show its age. It may be time for a new acronym, a new collection of technology companies transforming our era. With that I bring you ... \"And I'm going to pause it right there, we're going to go to Avery's list, his new acronym in a minute, but let me first say that this is a subject near-and-dear to my heart. Now, longer time listeners may be able to remember their way back to July 11 of 2018, I really enjoyed doing that podcast that day, it's entitled A  looks at FAANG Stocks. Now, I highly recommend, I think this is going to be one of those that stands the test of time, that particular week's podcast, because I have a lot of fun with language, I always will, on any podcast that I do, as somebody who loves the language and looks very carefully and scrutinizes what words we're using, the diction that we're choosing to talk about our world, our investing world, or stocks or whatever it is, what words are you choosing to use. So, anytime somebody starts rocking an acronym around a certain number of stocks, that's going to arouse some interest for me.But in particular, I found myself a little cynical about this phrase FAANG stocks. And in fact, in that podcast I use an acronym to make the six points that I make in that podcast, and I'm having a lot of fun back then, because at that point people said, well, Microsoft should also be included in that august group. So, people were starting to suggest it should be F-A-A-N-M-G. And I was asking aloud, perhaps rhetorically, \"How do we pronounce that?\" And I decided, it should also just be called FAANG with the silent \"M.\" So, it was really already getting silly almost two years ago, in my mind, but I used F-A-A-N-M-G, to make six points each starting with the letter.And point No. 3, which was the \"second A\" for those keeping score at home, was about acronyms themselves and how revealing, I think, they can be about our thought processes. In fact, I'm on our site, , where you can go for past Motley Fool podcasts and find transcripts of them, especially, if you're willing to scroll sometimes well back into the past. And so, I'm literally reading the transcript of that podcast, that day's podcast. And I said, the first thing that acronyms reveal to me is, since we can't keep the acronym constant, [laughs] probably the system is more dynamic, and less zero-sum than most of us would be led to believe. And a little later I say, the key point here is that acronyms reveal, they reveal that we really can put our arms around any given set of companies because we'd be excluding others when the letters don't fit or the numbers start changing.The big joke I was making two years ago was how well Priceline had performed at that time. Priceline, a \"P.\" And I was saying actually, PNNA is the new FANG. That was my hashtag I was rocking on social media that month to confuse people. Everyone was like, \"Well, what's PNNA, what's the P?\" Well, Priceline had well outperformed companies, like , which was one of the As, depending on our timeframe even Amazon was well outperforming , which is a great stock. So, even the FANG stocks themselves had been exceeded, in my mind, by a very prominent company, Priceline, which had a big market cap and just wasn't included in somebody's initial silly acronym that they invented for hot stocks everyone should be talking about.And, in fact, at the time Priceline was changing its name. Today you'll know it as . I hope you're a shareholder, it's been one of my better performers over the years, it's up 57X for  members who have held it for almost two decades. Now, it's been a monster. But I was saying, well, maybe BNNA is the new PNNA, because Priceline is about to become Booking Holdings.One other thing I said at the time was that another thing acronyms are real for me, just my own opinion here, I can't back it up with data, it's just pure intuition, but I'm going to submit to you that I think that most of the people who actually frame things up in this way, you know, who say things like FANG stocks, who search the internet for the phrase \"FANG stocks\" or listen for it in articles or on television, I'm going to submit to you that most of the people who frame things up this way don't actually have very good returns or results in those stocks themselves. Because in my experience people who start acronym-ising up a basket of stocks probably are there to trade it or talk about it or see what's hot, I doubt that they have preexisting positions in those companies, in our case, measured in decades, and we've owned all of them for a long time.So, in my experience, people who are on the hunt for FANG stocks probably themselves, I hope this doesn't sound too [...] but probably themselves don't really have real positions or intend to have them in those stocks.Alright. So, a brief rant. It's always fun for me to go back and think about a past podcast about two years ago now, what I was saying back then about FANG stocks, now let's return to the present day once again. And so, I just want to read, again, what Avery was saying, because he said, \"And though I'm still a fan, I think this acronym is beginning [laughs] to show its age.\" You say, Avery, it may be time for a new acronym, and so here you go, you've got the next one for us. It is five stocks, five letters, this is your opinion I'll read it out for our listener base: , , Amazon, Roku and Zoom.Now, anybody who was listening carefully and was playing the acronym game, probably can realize that spells STARZ. STARZ reminds you of that old cable channel, in fact, that was a previous stock pick of mine in Motley Fool , merged with , hasn't been a great performer ever since then, but stars STARZ. And certainly, if we're looking to create a relevant, modern-day acronym, I think that STARZ, Avery, is every bit as good as FANG or BNNA or PNNA or anything else.In fact, each of those companies is an active recommendation of mine, and some have been very recent, like Zoom, and some were among my first stock picks ever made on the internet, like Amazon. But I like each of those companies, so how could I not be a big fan of STARZ?Well, Avery, concludes, I say this with vigor as though I had found these shining gems myself, but in actuality, it was The Motley Fool that led me to these STARZ for that I'm eternally grateful from the bottom of my heart. Thank you, Avery Pemberton-Smith. Thank you, Avery.You close with, \"If my unconventional spelling of STARZ is off-putting in any way, please note that Zoom and  are interchangeable.\"Well, Slack is not actually one of my active stock picks, although it's a company I admire, but I think even the postscript reminds us that the world is too dynamic for some steady state acronym that should guide our dollars in the most optimal way. So, that's why I love what we do in Motley Fool  and Motley Fool , every single month we have another pick or two for you that's a new idea. We also have our , five or 10 stocks from our existing base within  or within , five or 10 stocks that we favor over the next three plus years. They're not new picks, they are old pics that we like just as much now.And then, of course, we have our starter stocks which are being released for both services this month as well; something of particular interest to newer members. So, I much prefer having a universe of coverage, a scorecard of great companies, and not trying to be silly with my letters. The silliest I ever get with my letters, really, is when I pick an arbitrary letter like the letter \"T\" and name an entire Five-Stock Sampler Stocks That Got Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with PF, which stands for Fool, well, spelled unconventionally. So, yes, we certainly have fun with it, but I wouldn't spend a lot of time acronym-izing my way to stock market glory.And I'm a little cynical, I have to admit in closing, not with you, Avery, I love what you've done there, but with people who seriously walk about and talk about FANG stocks. I have to admit, I'm looking at you askance.Which brings me this week to my final  item, which is No. 8. And, Mark Alderman, thanks for this note. \"David, I was elated and humbled when you read my last note and named it an \"Epic.\" It was June 26 mailbag .\" That was the title of that month's mailbag. Thank you, Mark, for that.\"I come to you with another story that I think is worth writing to you about. Again, it's not short, but also ... \" say Mark, \" ... it's not terribly long.\" Side note: This story fits on one page of printed paper. Now, occasionally I'm getting notes that are running two or three pages long. It's very rare that I'm going to share those on mailbag, so for some of my correspondence, first of all, thank you, any time you write a heartfelt note of several pages, but realize it's probably not going to make the mailbag, because, hey, I like to do six, seven, eight items and it's hard to fit long stories into a mailbag format.Anyway, Mark is also a good example to us, because he is a return visitor on the mailbag. He tells good stories pretty succinctly. And, Mark, I love this one. So, Mark says, \"I often talk to my friends about investing. And while trying not to be too pushy, I tell them they can take control of their money and invest themselves; they don't have to pay someone else to do it for them, and it's a lot more fun. I have had friends go as far as open a brokerage account, but never fund it. They're hesitant to take that next step.\"Mark goes on, \"Then there's my friend Derek. Derek was eager to learn and jumped right in. He started in January and we met a few times to discuss the basic Fool principles, such as, buying great companies and holding on to them, not being afraid to buy at their all-time highs, etc. I also mentioned to listen to as much of The Fool podcasts as he could and take the time to learn. Well, he jumped right in. He started by listening to podcasts, reading some articles, opened a brokerage, funded it and bought some stocks. And then, COVID-19 happened. He immediately lost money. And while he was a bit taken aback, he remained positive, was smart and methodical, and most importantly, he stayed calm. Even though he was in the red, he already saw what the possibilities could be when you pick great companies, such as, Shopify, , , and so many others. Instead of panicking and selling everything when the market drops substantially, he bought more. He added to his winners, didn't sell other companies that were beaten down, because he still believed in them and his reasons for buying them hadn't changed, and he continues to do so.\"\"To sum up, even during this \"down time\" he is up 17%. Needless to say, he cannot wait to experience a bull market. [laughs] He listens to The Fool podcast, follows analysts on Twitter, reads a lot, continues to enjoy the ride of investing and learning. And while his ultimate goal is to provide more opportunities for his beautiful wife, Erica, and three young children, Michael, Ruby and Viviana, he's having a blast learning about businesses and taking control of what he invests in.\"Mark concludes, \"I think this is an important message. While I have loved it, it's difficult to convince others that they too can do it themselves; even in a volatile market like this. It's awesome to see my friend having success and I know it will only get better and I just wish more would take that next step so they, too, could experience the greatest builder of wealth. Once again, I cannot thank you and your team enough for the encouragement and help while Derek and I invest on. The Zoom Videos ... \" that's speaking to our Motley Fool Live channel which I mentioned earlier, \" ... and all the extra information you guys are providing during COVID-19 has been amazing, please keep them coming, hopefully, we will see you at Fool Fest in the future.\" That's our annual member gathering, it's going virtual this year, understandably. \"Hope everyone at The Fool and their families are safe and healthy during this time. Invest on! and Fool on! Mark Alderman.\"Well, Mark to you and yours, invest on! and Fool on! as well. To Derek and his family, one of our newest investors investing in such an amazing time and doing it exactly right. I say to you, Sir, invest on! and Fool on! And, of course, to the dozens and dozens and thousands of listeners listening into Motley Fool podcasts every week, I say to you all as well, here at the end of April 2020, you've just lived through something pretty amazing, it's going to continue, we'll stay in it together, keep learning together and I hope, keep making the best decisions for your capital and mine.

The stock market continues to rally in the face of grim economic news. On Friday, data showed the U.S. unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April as employers cut 20.5 million jobs during the month. Recent surveys of manufacturing, services, and business investment activity all showed tumbling figures. But U.S. stock indexes all closed the week with solid gains. As always, investors are looking to the future, and the economic data reflects conditions as they were last week, last month, or last quarter.Those focused on the recovery believe that the worst is already behind us and are moving to price in better data ahead. And trillions of dollars of monetary and fiscal policy stimulus have provided powerful tailwinds to both that recovery and risk assets, such as stocks.Regardless of the jobs data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 455 points, or 1.9%, on Friday. The S&P 500 rose 1.7% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index, more sensitive to upturns and plunges in the economy, added 3.5%.Several companies this week have started to talk up their reopening plans, and others have said they are already seeing improving conditions in their businesses. Uber Technologies (ticker: UBER) said on Thursday evening that its ride-hailing bookings were well off their lowest levels of the crisis. Shares jumped 5.7% on Friday.\n                Walt Disney (DIS) sold out tickets for its soon-to-be reopened Shanghai Disneyland in minutes, suggesting that consumers in the world\u2019s second-largest economy are eager to get back to enjoying life, and are willing to spend money. The theme park will initially be limited to one-third capacity to allow for physical distancing.Disney also plans to reopen a shopping and entertainment complex adjacent to Disney World in Florida before the end of May. The stock closed up 3.4% on Friday.Apple (AAPL) said Friday that it would reopen stores in four U.S. states beginning next week. Its Chinese retail locations have been open for several weeks. Shares climbed 2.4%.\n                Boeing (BA) shares rose 3.7% after the company announced that the factory where it makes the 737 MAX jet will restart production later this month. Even Booking Holdings (BKNG) said it was seeing signs of stabilizing reservations, though it warned that the road to recovery for the travel industry was a long one. Amtrak plans to reinstate some service\u2014including Acela trains\u2014starting June 1.The tangible signs of progress may be pulling some previously skeptical investors into the market.\u201cAlthough our short-term \u2018trading\u2019 model suggests the S&P 500 remains a bit ahead of itself, from a long term asset allocation and business cycle perspective our view remains to buy on pullbacks,\u201d wrote Michael Darda, chief economist and market strategist at MKM Partners, on Friday. \u201cRecent client conversations suggest a high level of skepticism over both current market levels and recovery prospects (which is probably bullish from a contrarian perspective).\u201dAs throughout the coronavirus crisis, the level of uncertainty remains high and the potential pitfalls are numerous. Chief among them is the risk of a second wave of coronavirus cases emerging just as stay-at-home orders are lifted, necessitating another lockdown. Consumers may be slow to return to their pre-crisis spending habits. And the recovery may simply take much longer than optimists expect. Restarting a business and rehiring employees requires much more time and effort than shutting down on a governor\u2019s order.There are plenty of factors that could slam stocks after the market\u2019s recent rapid gains, but weeks-old economic indicators won\u2019t be the ones to slow the rally.\n                Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com\n            The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ikon search string for individual stock moves: The Day Ahead newsletter: The Morning News Call newsletter: Wall Street was set to jump at the open on Friday as an easing in U.S.-China friction added to optimism from data showing the U.S. economy lost fewer jobs in April than feared due to the coronavirus crisis.At 9:13 ET, Dow e-minis  were up 1.19% at 24,126.

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Millennials are one of the largest generations in history, and yet they continue to get a bad rap for either being fiscally irresponsible or for failing to keep certain industries alive as their parents did.\u00a0However, , Generation Y is expected to receive $30 trillion in wealth over the next couple of decades, and this transfer of wealth is going to transform many industries that will benefit from their increased spending power.\u00a0While many tend to point to millennials\u2019 focus on experiences, it\u2019s also true that they like many of the same things that baby boomers and Gen Xers before them did.The companies that will win in the next 10-20 years are those that reprioritize around Generation Y. By embracing new technology to provide affordable products in a customized manner, companies can benefit from the spending habits of millennials. Now obviously, since many of these companies are experiential, they\u2019ve taken a massive hit with the rise of the novel coronavirus, but we\u2019re looking at the long term here. These companies will certainly be around for a while, so if you have the stomach for a long wait many of these stocks are trading at a discount.\u00a0CB Insights has identified 12 industries that should benefit from Gen Y. Here are seven stocks to buy from seven of those industries identified as winners.\u00a0\u00a0 Source: Shutterstock\n\tMillennials are driving the growth in camping, literally and figuratively. In 2018, almost 80 million Americans went camping, many of them millennials.\u00a0\u201c[In 2018], 56% of all new campers were millennials (up from 51% in 2017), and 41% of total reported campers were millennials,\u201d according to the CB Insights report. \u201cPart of millennials\u2019 enthusiasm for camping springs from the fact that many of them are .\u201dMillennials are looking for relatively inexpensive forms of relaxation. Many are opting for recreational vehicles rather than good old fashioned camping in a tent.\u00a0One company that continues to benefit from the millennials\u2019 attraction to camping is Thor Industries (NYSE:), which manufactures trailers and motor coaches under many different brand names including Air Stream, the classic silver trailer that Americans know and love.\u00a0In 2018, , the second-largest number since the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association\u2019s been tracking sales. Only 2017 was better.\u00a0To meet the demand of younger campers, Airstream offers the Nest, a compact trailer that costs just $46,000 to buy, making the open road a more cost-effective alternative to buying a cabin or staying at a five-star hotel on every vacation.\u00a0Source: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com\n\tYou can call millennials a lot of things but don\u2019t call them lazy.\u00a0According to CB Insights\u2019 report, 76% of millennials exercise at least once a week, more than Gen Xers at 70% and boomers at 64%. Millennials are dropping close to $7 billion each year on gym memberships, double what Gen Xers and boomers do.\u00a0Naturally, you\u2019d think I\u2019d recommend a fitness club chain such as Planet Fitness (NYSE:), whose stock\u2019s done well since going public in 2015.\u00a0However, the capital requirements of fitness facilities make them terrible investments when the economy sours.So, I\u2019d rather bet on a company like Lululemon (NASDAQ:), that\u2019s making sure millennials not only are dressed to perform while exercising, but they look good doing it.\u00a0With the company expecting double-digit earnings gains each year until at least 2023, the sky is the limit for LULU stock.\u00a0Source: Shutterstock\n\tWhile it can be stereotyping to say all millennials thrive on experiences rather than buying stuff, they do indeed like to travel.\u00a0\u201cAn Airbnb study from 2016 showed that many millennials prioritize saving for their next trip over paying off debts or saving to purchase their first home,\u201d CB Insights report stated. \u201cAnother found that 21% of millennials would accept a lower salary if it meant they could travel more frequently.\u201d\u00a0However, just because they want to travel, doesn\u2019t mean they want to do it in the same manner as their parents.\u00a0Therefore, for travel companies to be successful, they\u2019ve got to provide a combination of unique experiences, budget prices, and excellent customer service; three things that aren\u2019t easy to deliver.Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:), which used to be known as Priceline, increased its roster of available homes and apartments on its Booking.com website in 2018 by  to 1.75 million. By 2019, Booking.com\u2019s hotel portfolio increased by just 10% to 436,000.\u00a0This year, however, , as people who are traveling are rethinking the money-savings the sharing service provides in favor of established brands with professional cleaning staffs.The push toward a pre-pay business model where alternative accommodations are paid for ahead of time as opposed to at the time of hotel stay, is in large part being driven by the millennial desire to stay somewhere more authentic or local.While it makes Booking\u2019s business a little trickier, it\u2019s the wave of the future, and much better for cash flow.\u00a0\u00a0Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com\n\tIf you want to please millennials and you operate in the restaurant industry, you\u2019ve got to be fast because Gen Y is always on the go.\u00a0According to the CB Insights report, 40% of millennials eat on the go, significantly higher than either Gen Xers at 26% and boomers at 19%. Not only that, but millennials want a good deal with that tasty burger to go.\u00a0One of the biggest trends in the restaurant industry at the moment is plant-based meat, also known as Meat 2.0. Shake Shack (NYSE:) is one of the fast-casual dining establishments to jump on meatless burgers.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s sold the Shroom Burger for years, a fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese and served on a bun. That said, it still hasn\u2019t embraced the Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:) movement as other concepts have.But it\u2019s working on it.\u00a0\u201cI think we\u2019re going to keep an eye on that, but the meat substitute is not as interesting to us right now,\u201d Shake Shack CMO Jay Livingston  Ad Age in August. \u201cWe\u2019re really interested in creating, like a veggie experience that people are super excited about. We\u2019re kind of figuring out what that might look like right now.Business is good at Shake Shack.\u00a0Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\tOn the one hand, the fact that millennials love coffee is excellent news for Starbucks (Nasdaq:), whose U.S. stores had seen several quarters of slower than average same-store sales growth.\u00a0On the other hand, millennials are predisposed to try boutique coffee roasters, which Starbucks is not.\u00a0\u201cI would say that we\u2019re firing on all cylinders from an operating performance perspective with the focus and discipline necessary to drive growth at scale for a company like Starbucks and our long-term double-digit EPS growth model is fully intact,\u201d CFO Pat Grismer  recently while speaking at the Goldman Sachs\u2019 Global Retailing Conference.\u00a0Starbucks made $2 billion in share repurchases last fiscal year instead of this year to deliver on its promise of share repurchases delivering . Of course, and again, the pandemic has put a dent in that plan.While SBUX stock might get knocked around from time to time, it\u2019s operationally one of the best companies in America.\u00a0Oh, and millennials love their cold drinks.\u00a0Source: DenisMArt / Shutterstock.com\n\tThe global frozen food market is projected to grow to $290 billion by 2021.\u00a0Two stats suggest that millennials are driving a frozen food renaissance: First, millennials spent 9% more on frozen foods per trip to the grocery store in 2017 than other demographics. Furthermore, frozen food sales in the U.S. in 2018 grew for the first time in five years, thanks in large part to millennials.\u00a0Frozen foods meet the millennial desire to eat healthy, fast, and relatively inexpensively.\u00a0One company that\u2019s benefiting from the resurgence in both frozen foods and plant-based meats is Kellogg (NYSE:), the company better known for Special K and Frosted Flakes.\u00a0However, between its Eggo and Morningstar Farms brands, Kellogg\u2019s managed to increase frozen sales by  in the second quarter ended June 29, only 50 basis points less than its snacks division, which counts Pringles and Pop-Tarts amongst its brands.\u00a0Last year the company introduced Incogmeato by MorningStar brands, a portfolio of products that are both ready-to-cook and frozen including a plant-based burger and Chik\u2019n tenders and nuggets.\u00a0\u201cWe know that about three-fourths of Americans are open to plant-based eating, yet only 1 in 4 actually purchase a plant-based alternative,\u201d  Sara Young, General Manager, MorningStar Farms, Plant-Based Proteins. \u201cWe know the number one barrier to trying plant-based protein is taste. These consumers are still seeking the amazing taste, texture, and sizzling qualities of meat but want a better alternative for themselves and the planet.\u201dThey\u2019re expected to be available in the next few months.\u00a0\u00a0Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\tMillennials have the highest student loan debt of any previous generation. Combine this with the fact the cost of living is rising faster than it has in the past decade, and it\u2019s no wonder millennials are willing to try personal finance apps that help them save money that they can use to pay down debt.\u201cOne of the most popular verticals for personal finance tech is banking. In one survey, 71% of millennials said that they would rather go to the dentist than listen to what a bank has to tell them \u2014 a sentiment-driven largely by poor customer service and poor technological integration,\u201d stated the CB Insights report on millennials.However, rather than recommend a bank that uses technology, I\u2019m going to suggest Intuit (NASDAQ:), the granddaddy of fintech companies.\u00a0Most investors are probably familiar with Intuit\u2019s main products: QuickBooks and TurboTax. The former focused on small businesses and the latter on taxpayers of all sizes. In fiscal 2019, it generated  in free cash flow from $6.8 billion in revenue. I love companies that grow their free cash flow each year by double digits.\u00a0Intuit does this by investing in R&D. In fiscal 2019, it spent  on new products and innovation, approximately 18% of its annual revenue. It plans to spend most of this money improving its existing products.\u00a0One free Intuit product that millennials use quite frequently is , and while other apps get higher ratings, the fact that a $69 billion company develops it ought to be comforting to most.Long term you can\u2019t go wrong with INTU.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The following are today's upgrades for Validea's  model based on the published strategy of .

For more details on this strategy, About John Neff: While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as \"relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative.\" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.About Validea: Validea is an investment research service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Amazon said it expected to have just break-even profit in the second quarter as it plans to invest $4 billion in coronavirus-related costs in the period. Apple, meanwhile, declined to provide guidance for the first time since 2003, citing \"a lack of visibility and certainty in the near term.\"\u00a0Meanwhile, President Donald Trump also threatened to slap a new round of tariffs on China as retaliation for the coronavirus, which could further destabilize the global economy at a vulnerable time.The  has been one of the most directly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and sector stocks have adopted a \"risk-on/risk-off\" behavior in recent weeks, swinging higher on good news and lower on bad news. Today, investors ran from the sector again.As of 12:01 p.m. EDT, Eldorado was down 12.9%, OneSpaWorld shares were off 11.4%, Tripadvisor had given up 7.9%, and Expedia had slipped 5.3%. At the same time, the\u00a0was down 2.9%.Image source: Getty Images.Reno-based casino operator Eldorado Resorts has been clobbered by the coronavirus-related shutdowns, much like the rest of the gambling industry as the stock has fallen more than 70% since the sell-off began in February. Eldorado may be particularly vulnerable to the disruption as it is in the middle of a with\u00a0, which is looking increasingly strained with casinos shut down and the effects of the pandemic lasting longer than many had hoped. Last night,\u00a0, another stakeholder in the deal, said in its earnings release that Eldorado continues to move forward to get regulatory approval for the deal. Shareholders, on the other hand, may be getting cold feet.\u00a0It's hard think of a company that's worse-positioned for the coronavirus pandemic than OneSpaWorld Holdings. The company operates health and wellness centers on cruise ships, meaning it's not only exposed to the risk in the cruise industry, but also the risk of personal contact in activities like massage, hair care, and personal fitness. Even if the cruise industry sets sail again, customers may be reluctant to use its services. Yesterday, the stock \u00a0as the company got a $75 million investment from Steiner Leisure, its biggest shareholder. While that infusion solves its liquidity problems for now, the future still looks bleak for the company.Tripadvisor shares have been volatile in recent days as the company said earlier in the week that it would lay off a quarter of its staff as CEO Steve Kaufer said that the business had been severely impacted by the pandemic. The travel-recommendation site depends on advertisers and with much of the travel industry shut down, hotels and tourism companies aren't buying ads. The company was already struggling to grow before COVID-19 hit, and the pandemic will only make its turnaround plans more difficult.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Expedia, one of the two biggest online travel agencies in the world along with\u00a0, slid along with the macro news. Last week, Expedia raised $3.2 billion in private equity investments\u00a0and offered another $2 billion in debt, giving it sufficient cash to stay afloat during the crisis, but CEO Barry Diller has been blunt about the pandemic, saying that the company's revenue has gone to virtually zero in recent weeks and that its goal was to conserve cash and survive.\u00a0Today, President Trump's stay-at-home guidelines expire, and a number of states, including Texas, took steps to reopen their economies, allowing non-essential businesses to open their doors. That would appear to be a step in the right direction for the travel industry, but the threat of the virus isn't going away anytime soon, and the economic impact of the pandemic is likely to weigh on travel even when it does. Leaders from companies like\u00a0and\u00a0in the airline industry expect it to take two to three years for air travel to recover, meaning losses for travel operators are likely in the interim.A number of these companies will report earnings next week, giving investors their first look at the impact of the coronavirus. The numbers are likely to be eye-opening.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Well, thanks so much for asking me, Alison. I'm so excited to be here with you guys today. And you are coming to us from a Carolina, I believe, but I don't remember which one. Absolutely. I'm coming from the northern-most of the two Carolinas. And we have some great contributors just South of the border, so I'm not going to say anything pejorative about South Carolina, but I will extol the virtues of North Carolina. I'm coming to you from Raleigh, which is the capital city. That's great. And, Asit, how did you come to be a writer for The Motley Fool? Interestingly enough, there was a short-lived blog network, I think is the name, The Motley Fool Blog Networks. So this was one of Motley Fool's many interesting projects. And I wrote an article. [laughs] That's putting it so nicely. We do have so many, we have a bit of ADD when it comes to projects, but yes. Yeah, I found that out in my many years of contributing, there's no lack for new projects. And that's a great thing, that is a strength of The Fool. I should say all-in-all, it's a really awesome strength of The Motley Fool, but that was my hook, and I wrote some articles for that, and eventually got asked to write some more, moved over to what we call . So if you read articles on Motley Fool's home website, maybe you'll see some of my writing there, but that was my starting. This was 2011. So I'm going on many years now with The Motley Fool. Well, Bro, you're going to kick it off by taking the first question here, and it comes from Herb. \"I am still working for my current employer and am under 59.5 years old. Through the CARES Act, am I able to make a withdrawal from my 403(b) and then repay the amount into a traditional IRA without having to pay income tax? Would the amount need to be under the max contribution level of $6,000?\" Well, let's start by reminding folks how the CARES Act affected retirement account distribution. So you can withdraw up to $100,000 combined from your employer-sponsored account or IRA's and avoid the 10% early-distribution penalty, but not taxes. But you're only able to do that if you suffered some kind of economic hardship related to the coronavirus. So technically, this option isn't available to everybody. Now, once you take the money out, you still owe the taxes. However, if you get it back in the account within three years, you don't have to pay the taxes. The problem is, if you don't get it back before Dec. 31 of this year, you will owe taxes, but then if you get the money in, just amend your tax return and you'll get the taxes back.But based on my reading of the bill, money generally has to go into the same type of account that you took the money from. So I don't think what Herb is suggesting will work. I don't think you can take the money out of your employer account and put it into an IRA.That said, there may be one other possibility, and that's if his plan permits an in-service distribution: It essentially lets you roll money out of your 401(k) or 403(b) while you are still working. It's perfectly legal to do that, but the plan has to allow it. So just talk to someone who's knowledgeable in your HR department or one of the customer service reps for the folks who administer the 403(b) to see if that's allowed. If it's allowed, it's generally not allowed until you reach 59.5, but you can lower the age if you want. In fact, we on the 401(k) committee here at The Fool just voted today on whether we want to lower the age on ours. Don't know what the result is yet, but so it's perfectly possible. If your plan doesn't allow it, ask the HR department if they'll allow it, and maybe they will. All right, let's move on to the next question, comes from Colin. \"I did some number crunching and found that if I invested in only the top 10 holdings of the  over the past five years, I would have seen a return of around a 145%, while the fund as a whole saw a return of only 12.5% over the same five years. I realized these holdings likely change often during this lifetime, so it isn't a perfect measure. Why not make a basket of individual stocks from the top holdings of a desired index fund? You lose out in diversification, but a portfolio of 10 to 20 stocks spread across different industries is generally considered diversified anyways.\" So Colin, you are correct that holdings of an index fund change over time, and this is sort of the magic of hindsight. The formula you put out here looks awesome, that if you had grabbed these top holdings and held them for five years, you have this phenomenal return. But what's going on with these indexes is that most of them that follow the S&P 500 index are capitalization weighted indexes. So the strong get stronger and they replace the weak in these funds that follow indexes. But it's hard to predict what's going to happen in real time.I went back and did some digging. I looked at year-end 2013, which will give you about five years of performance. And yes, in that year, end index of the S&P 500,  was present, Google [] was present, and  was present in the top 10 holdings. But there was no , there was no . And in addition, I found clunkers like , , and . [laughs] So in the ETFs or mutual funds that follow these indexes, they have to consistently rebalance.So what I said at the outset that the strong get stronger. As a company gets popular in the market and its market capitalization rises, it moves into that top 10 of a fund's holdings. But that's ever changing, and it's really hard to predict today. If we simply bought those top 10 holdings today, they might look a lot different in five years. Now, the ETFs and mutual funds will account for that by their rebalancing, but you or I might see the performance of the Amazons and Microsofts and Facebooks whittled down by other companies that are in that top 10. And that's the effect of trying to replicate the performance. It's really hard to do and keep that moving.But let's not throw this idea out with the bathwater, I actually like it very much, and I think you're onto something. And that is that the top 10 holdings of a broad index, or maybe even a specialized index that you like and are familiar with, that's a great place to look for investment ideas. And sure, can you create your own sort of ETFs now that we have commission-free trading and fractional trading? Maybe even look at several funds that you're interested in and pull a few ideas from each. I think it's a wonderful idea. So do that maybe instead of trying to just buy those 10 that look good today and hold those for five years.You could just evaluate each one individually, and that will give you some kind of backstop [laughs] to just blindly using this formula. But the idea overall is a smart one in terms of identifying good stocks to build your own basket. Yeah, and I wrote an article in January looking back to the top 10 holdings of the S&P 500 over the years. And just a couple of highlights, that when you look at 1980, 7 of the top 10 stocks were oil companies, which since then probably has not fared so well, certainly over the last several years. And then if you look at 1999, top three were Microsoft, GE and . Microsoft peaked in '99 and didn't exceed that peak again until 2016. GE, the peak at 2000 was worth $60 a share, now it's $6 a share. Cisco peaked in 2000 at $80, now at $43. And then, also among the top 10 were, like, Lucent and America Online. So I love Asit's description of basically, strong get stronger, but the weak get weaker. And by owning the index fund, you eventually own more and more of the stocks that are doing better and better. All right. Next question comes from Bill. \"As I listen to the  dividend episode, it occurred to me that this could offer a good strategy for getting started with stock investing. If someone had a chunk of money that they wanted to get started with but weren't sure how much ongoing month-to-month ability they would have to add to their investments, they might start with some strong dividend payers or funds to help with diversification. Then, they could use the stream of the dividends as the income stream to help them add to and broaden their investments.\" So Bill is reacting to the fact that I, along with my colleague, Buck Hartzell, were on the  podcast recently talking about dividends. And I certainly think that dividends are an underappreciated aspect of owning stocks. I like that people like the idea that they're getting some cash and not reliant on the prices. After all, prices go up and down, pretty unpredictable, whereas if you have a diversified portfolio of dividend payers, you can pretty much count on that income stream. About once a decade, there is a significant disruption, and that disruption is happening now for us, but it's been pretty consistent and growing actually pretty spectacularly since 2009.And I think if you're trying to convince a newer investor to invest in stocks, I think it is pretty compelling to say, like, these days you can get a diversified portfolio that yields 2.5%, much more than you're getting some cash, more than you're getting some treasuries. So even if the prices go up and down, you're still going to, over the long term, hopefully earn more than you earn in cash.By the way, one of only two times since the 50s when stocks yield more than bonds. Since the 50s, bonds have always yielded more. The last time that stocks yielded more was March of 2009, which was right at the beginning of the next great bull market. So it's pretty extraordinary.The trade-off is that I do think it's important to realize that dividends are not a free lunch. When you have a company that has a certain value and then it pays out millions of dollars of its cash in a dividend, it's not worth as much, so the price does come down a bit. But that said, for people who like the idea of just buying a few stocks or dividend-focused ETFs, have more cash coming in to buy more stocks, I think it's a perfectly fine argument.If you're interested in finding stocks that have a history of paying growing dividends, there's an index known as the , which leads us to our very next question. All right, here we go, it comes from Christian. \"It seems that being crowned \"Dividend Aristocrat\" gives stocks a significant boost due to the many funds ETFs that necessarily will buy into significant positions of those stocks. Do you like the idea of investing in a basket of those upcoming anticipated Dividend Aristocrats, anticipating the bump in share prices when the big funds jump in, if, when they're actually deemed official Dividend Aristocrats? If so, I'm wondering about the easiest way to invest in upcoming likely Dividend Aristocrats. A low-cost mutual fund or ETF would be great, but I'm not aware of one yet.\" So Christian, I'm not aware of one either. I looked around, poked around to see if there is indeed a fund that is anticipated Dividend Aristocrats ETF, but I didn't find it. The idea is interesting. I will say that the effects of being added to a Dividend Aristocrat fund isn't quite the same as the effect of being added to, say, the S&P 500 index. You do get a bump when you hit that 25th year, but it's just not as large. And one of the reasons is, most of these stocks -- and let's parse out that definition of Dividend Aristocrat. It really refers to companies that are already in the S&P 500 and have paid a dividend out for at least 25 years consecutively and have simultaneously increased that dividend for at least 25 years consecutively. So these are already companies with broad exposure, they're widely followed, they're in most of the indexes that try to cover the market and thereby they're in the ETF that you can buy.So you do get a bump, but in terms of -- is this a strategy that might really gain you some more juice long term over simply identifying these companies? It's hard to say. As Robert mentioned, when a company issues its dividend, it has to have its share price readjusted over the next few trading days because it's distributing out some of that market capitalization to shareholders. And over time, maybe that effect just, sort of, converges with the normal effect the stock would have in the market from investors recognizing its earnings potential.But generally speaking, the idea is pretty sound to me because, look, in the process of doing this, you're identifying a company that may have increased its dividend, I don't know, 22, 23, 24 years running, and is a company that's an S&P component. You could do this with small caps too though; it doesn't have to necessarily be an S&P 500 company. So my take is to do the work of finding these types of companies that have consistently increased their dividends, they've shared their retained earnings with shareholders, they're obviously, probably growing their operating cash flows. That's a strong potential indicator of market share and market capitalization growth over the long term. You're typically looking at, sort of, mature, more stable companies, though. These aren't necessarily going to be the hottest growth stocks in the market, but I really like the idea in terms of helping you identify stocks that will serve a balanced portfolio over the long term.Now, a caveat, a big caveat, a once-in-a-lifetime caveat. What about COVID-19? We're going to see this year some Dividend Aristocrats probably fall off the wagon. There's no way out of it. If you have to choose between keeping the lights on and keeping people on payroll and keeping your Dividend Aristocrat status, I think most companies are going to choose the really critical things they need to survive in advance today. So this is also going to happen to companies that are on their way to Dividend Aristocrat status.My advice is, if you're seeing this happen, is just go to the company's financials, read conference call transcripts, try to get a handle on what the plan is. Many companies you'll find, especially the bigger ones, the ones who are more equipped to hit the capital markets for more debt, to issue shares, they will probably be OK, and it'll be a one-time blip. Unless we have another pandemic. I'm not ready for that. I'm not ready either. [laughs] So looking at these companies one-by-one on a case-by-case basis will help you, because some of them might actually get tripped up and they might not look so attractive even if they've increased dividends for 20, 22 years, etc. But I do like the principles here in this question, it can lead you to some nice finds for your portfolio. All right. Next question comes from Michael. \"Is the length you will be in your home the only thing to consider when refinancing a mortgage? If I refinance a 30-year mortgage I've been paying for a number of years, doesn't the amortization curve for the new loan work against me? Let's suppose I refinance after paying a mortgage for seven years. I've not really started paying a significant amount of the loan's principal, so in effect, I'm paying rent.\"Oh, everyone hates that paying rent, don't they, Bro? [laughs] They do. So Michael is raising a pretty interesting point. So when you start out paying a mortgage, mostly payment does go to interest. It's not exactly like paying rent, because some does go to principle and you benefit if the price of the house goes up, but I see what he's saying.So let's put some numbers on this. So according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the size of a new mortgage these days is around $313,000. Assuming a 30-year mortgage at a rate of 3.4%, that monthly payment is going to be $1,388. With your first payment, only $500 is going to principal, so 36% is going to principal; the rest is just to interest. After seven years, that only moves up to 46%. So even after being in the house for seven years, most of it's still going to interest. You don't get to that point where the payment is half principal, half interest till almost 10 years. And that depends an awful lot on the interest rate. So if it were a 4% 30-year mortgage, the point at which you get half principal, half interest is almost 13 years. If it's a 5% mortgage, you don't reach that half principal, half interest till more than 16 years.So Michael is making a good point. When you refinance, you reset that payment schedule going back to where a larger percentage of your payment is just going to interest. Considering all the numbers involved, including how much you have to pay to refinance, because there are up-front costs, the bottom line is, to determine whether you should refinance, you need a good calculator. There's one on , there's a good one on Bankrate. There're actually several good ones on a site run by the mortgage professor, a guy named Jack Guttentag, it's MTGProfessor.com, which I think is a fascinating site, because it's been run by this guy forever. He's 96 years old and he's still actively blogging. He's a professor at Wharton.So you're going to factor in all these things: up-front costs, whether you're going to make additional payments. And you figure out how -- you have to make some sort of an estimate how long you're going to be in the house and then figure out -- was it worth it? Not only in terms of the savings that you realize but how much of a loan you still have to pay-off at the end of it.And many of the calculators used will default to showing you, like, how much you saved after 30 years, but nobody stays in the same house for 30 years. So you have to assume, like, what if I move in 7 years, what if I move in 10 years, what if I move in 5, and then make the decision whether refinancing makes sense. All right, next question comes from Sandy: \"On a recent podcast, Bro mentioned that bond funds might not hold up as well as expected if they contain bonds that were just barely investment grade and are now no longer as high quality. Consequently, any money we want to keep absolutely safe in the next one to three years would be better off in cash. I'm wondering about the model portfolios for those in retirement. Are you considering decreasing the recommended amount allotted to bond funds and recommending cash instead? Are you considering recommending different bond funds?\"Oh, Bro, on the spot! What are you going to do? [laughs] Well, let's start with the bond funds. So bond funds change value every day, depending on movements in interest rates and the credit quality of the bonds in the fund. Over the past several years, one of the fastest-growing segments of the bond universe was corporate debt rated BBB. That's just a notch above junk territory. Now, some of those bonds are being downgraded to junk status, they're being called actually so-called fallen angels. And when that happens, they drop in value. And some recent examples is the debt from , , the , they've all been downgraded to junk.So if you're investing in a bond fund for safety, it does make sense to take a look at what's in your bond fund to make sure that there's not too much of this debt that's either in junk territory or could be junk territory. You would do that by just entering the ticker [on] .com, click on the portfolio tab, and you could see how the fund breaks up by different ratings.As for  model portfolios, they're all index ETF, so the main bond holding is the , but despite its name, it doesn't actually own the whole total bond market. There's no junk bonds, a very few municipals, no Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, otherwise known as TIPS. If you look at the current holding, 18% of it is BBB rated, so that is a significant portion in that point right above junk, but because so much of the rest of the fund is in AAA rated, that means treasuries or other bonds backed by Uncle Sam, it's pretty safe. So I'm pretty comfortable having it in the  model portfolios, as in my own portfolio, because I follow the  model portfolios with some of my own money.Another risk with bond funds is, at some point, if and when rates do go up, the values of bond funds will go down. No one expects that to happen anytime soon, but it is a risk, which is why I say any money you need in the next few years should be invested in cash. And if you actually visit the  model portfolios page on the website, you would see a little asterisk there next to bonds saying that, depending on your situation, bonds may not be the best choice for your nonstock money. I just wanted to make one quick comment about that. I can't stress this enough what Bro is illustrating, the difference between investment grade, which is like a seal of approval in the credit markets, and junk status, as he points out. It's just one notch. [laughs] So it really helps to do just that to be familiar with the holdings in a fund, to look at those and understand how much is, sort of, higher investment grade and how much is borderline. Because, you know, it's always mystified me: One day you are investment grade, and there's no middle ground, you go from investment grade to junk by that one notch. Next question comes from Alex. \"I am 29 and currently invest most of my retirement savings in a . Would you recommend beginning to invest a majority, 50% to 75%, of my savings in a tech sector ETF, such as , VGT? The thought being, for someone in their 20s, who has an investing horizon of 30 to 40 years, that the technology sector, in particular, is likely to beat the market as a whole between now and, say, 2050. This seems like a good strategy given how critical technology appears to be for our future. But investing this heavily in a sector ETF cuts against conventional advice. So I wanted to get your thoughts.\" So Alex, my first thought is congratulations. You are a wise 29-year-old. I wish I had your brain when I was 29, because most of us at that age aren't really thinking in terms of 30 and 40 years ahead and how they're investing retirement savings. So bully for you!Information technology is a very likely candidate to have a long run of success as a thematic investment. I want to return to something we were talking about earlier in the show and make it a little more specific. I believe that index funds are actually rigged, but in the investors' favor, in a legal way. And I believe that ETFs, which are indexed to a broad-based tech index, are rigged in the younger investors favor. And what I mean by that is, Bro was talking earlier about how indexes are representative of the economy. Certain sectors over time become more representative than others, that's why  no longer represents the vanguard of our technology, it's why  and Maytag may still be household names, but they're not leading the S&P 500.And your idea is pretty correct, in that if you had to choose a sector -- maybe healthcare would compete with that -- that's going to have this 30- to 40-year time horizon, it's a good choice to choose information technology. As some companies that we're familiar with today lose their effect in the economy, indexes will simply remove them, and they will add new members which represent new wealth creation, new value creation in the markets.I want to say something about your comment on conventional advice. Conventional advice says, \"Hey, just follow the broader market in one fund. Why not just buy an index fund which tracks the ETF? Why not buy just one ETF that tracks, say, the S&P 500 index, the broader market?\" Well, if you do that, you are actually exposed to something called market risk, which is what it sounds like. It's the risk that the whole market could go down. I don't know, maybe there's a geopolitical event or a pandemic something that [...] all stock. Nah! That will never happen.[laughs] When is that going to happen? Just put your funds in that one ETF and forget about it. We did not have mutual funds or ETFs in the 1960s. I think we may have had a few mutual funds in the late 60s. There was a bear market from 1968, I think, which lasted 14 years, if memory serves correctly. Not that I lived through all of that, but from studying the markets. On an inflation adjusted return, in those 14 years, if you had just invested in the market, if we had ETFs at that time, you would have lost about 50% of your money, and it took some 23 years for the market to come back to the level it hit in 1968.So I'm not so sure that conventional advice is all that great. And you can prevent some of the hurt from market risk by doing just what you're suggesting. As for the percentages, that's up to you, but it doesn't hurt to go into a little bit of a sector-based investing theme. In my estimation, have both, have some in the total market and have some in a really good idea like this. Do you think it's important that if you're going to go for a sector and choose an ETF, to look at what's into that ETF to make sure it represents what you're looking for? So Alex suggested the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, VGT. So I want you all to think about what would be among the top holdings for that ETF, think of which companies, ladadadada. Okay, here are the top 10: Microsoft, Apple, , , , Cisco, , ,  and . So my first guess is, you are probably surprised that Visa and Mastercard are there. And secondly, you're probably surprised that you don't see any Amazon, no Facebook, no Google, because they fall under other sectors. So when you look for doing this type of investing, make sure you're getting an ETF that really is investing in the type of companies you're interested in. All right. Next question comes from Blue Max. \"I'm 55 years old and late to investing and saving for my retirement. I had around $70,000 in a taxable account down to $48,000. Thank you, corona. I never started a retirement account as I've been self-employed for the past 25 years. I know, Bro, big mistake, but what can I say? My question is, with only $6,000 a year allowed to be deposited into an IRA, what other options are there to save for retirement to maximize tax benefits? If I put the maximum in an IRA every year and I continue to work for another 20 years and I assume a very generous 10% annual return, that will be just under $500,000, probably not enough to retire on. So would someone in my position be forced to also put money away in a taxable account? Thank you in advance and keep making me smile every week. Get some.\" [laughs] [laughs] Just so people know, whenever people send in their questions, they often say very nice things about us, and I usually take them out, because I feel like it's too self-promotional, but when he included \"get some\" I had to keep that in. [laughs] [laughs] And for those who don't know, that comes from when we learned from a listener that it's very funny to listen to the show at half speed, and then we listened to the show at half speed on the show. Now, it's like right now, because we then listened to ourselves listening to the show listening at half speed. Anyway, and then at the end of it I punctuated by saying \"get some,\" but at half speed, and so I sound very, very intoxicated, and it's hilarious. So thank you, Blue Max, for making me laugh. Yes. So to get back to Blue Max's question. So it's never too late to start. I know people say that, but I really do believe it, certainly in your mid-50s. So good for you for getting on top of this. Let's start with that $6,000, which is the annual contribution limit for IRAs. The good news is that for workers 50 and older, you can contribute another $1,000 on top of that. But I have even more good news for you. As a self-employed person, you can open up your own 401(k) called a \"solo 401(k)\" or a \"one-participant 401(k).\" And the contribution limits are much higher than an IRA: $19,500 for the younger folks, $26,000 for 50 and older. But because you are also the employer, you could put more money on top of that. It's sort of, like, you're in charge of the match. So you could put in a profit-sharing contribution on top of that. So if you have a relationship with an accountant or a financial services firm, ask them about that, and they'll provide all the details.The other good thing that you're doing is that you're planning to work for another 20 years to age 75. The longer you work, the less you need to have saved for retirement, because No. 1, you'll receive a bigger Social Security, because you're delaying taking that benefit. But also, frankly, you're retiring later in life, so your retirement is going to be short. So you don't have to fund as many years.Presently, there's no benefit to delaying beyond 70. So you could start taking it at 70, if you're going to keep working, but then, rather than spending that money, just keep investing it. So you can actually use Social Security to boost your retirement savings for that last five years. One caveat to this is that something like a quarter of people retire sooner than they expect due to health reasons. So don't count on being able to work to 75, but hopefully you'll be able to do that.But I think, assuming that you start maxing out a solo 401(k) now and you really are able to work for another 20 years, I think you're going to be in decent shape. But to find out for sure, you might want to hire a fee-only financial planner to do a retirement analysis for you, which I think just about everyone in their 50s should do and certainly everyone should do right before they retire. Next question comes from David. \"I'm a member, and I started buying stocks when the market started to fall at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I've been buying shares of stock at least once a week when I get paid, but I'm a little frightened off from buying stocks like Amazon or Alphabet, because the share price is so enormous, at least to me. I'm a small investor, and the price of one share of Amazon is more money than I have in the six stocks I own. Is it OK to buy into a company that trades for around $2,200, if I can only afford a few hundred dollars' worth of the stock, or should I stay with the cheaper-priced stocks?\" Well, thankfully, David, now you don't have to choose. And I like this question. There's another project that I work on in The Fool where we take questions, and I'm seeing so many questions about this topic. And I think some of the confusion stems from what happened last year. So let's just rewind to fall of last year, when one of the largest brokerages in the United States, , announced that it was doing away with commissions. And that produced, sort of, a tidal wave through the industry. Suddenly, everybody and his brother who ran a brokerage house had to also drop commissions. And there was no distinction between discount brokerages and traditional brokerages. I mean, those differences have been narrowing anyway over the years. So this was a really great thing for investors. It means that we will get more yield out of our investments, because they will not be so trimmed down by commissions, but it also precipitated some of this race to offer fractional shares.Schwab announced shortly, after it was dropping its commissions, that it would begin to provide investors with fractional trading. Meaning thereby, you could invest by dollar amount. So let's say you only had $100, but you wanted to buy Amazon, symbol AMZN. Schwab was promising to its customers that you'll be able to do just that.Now, another big brokerage , which is widely, sort of, ubiquitous brokerage as well, they are also going to offer the same. But there's a hitch, in that these two companies are right now under a merger agreement. So they're going to merge at some point this year. And I don't think either one of them -- I checked a couple of weeks ago -- I don't think either one of them has yet offered fractional share trading. I think it's now going to happen after their mergers, my best guess.However, there are a number of places you can go to invest fractionally. Just to mention a few,  does offer the service. The only hitch there is that once you open an account with Fidelity, if you're trying to trade through their web interface, you can't buy fractional shares. You have to download the app on your phone and select dollars and plug in the amount for the symbol you want, but it will let you buy those shares of Amazon even if you got $1 that you want to put into Amazon.com or  or , which is another ticker with a big price, even . You can buy those now with just a few bucks.Just to mention a couple of others, which aren't traditional brokerage houses. Many listeners will be familiar with Robinhood, the app that is very popular with millennial and younger investors. It's well known for already offering fractional trading. A company called M1 Finance does the same. And something that I really love is called Stockpile, and that's an investment app that's geared toward younger investors. Actually, it's geared toward the kids in all of us. It's got a really nice interface, it's very spiffy, makes it fun to invest. And you can have your kids involved in fractional trading by using this service. You'll have to open a custodial account for them in order for them to do this, but I like that very much.So to sum, I think fractional share trading with this whole movement to do away with commissions is such a powerful tool for the retail investor. And it allows you to equal weight your ideas and you're not held prisoner by share price any longer. Our next question comes from Aaron. \"I'm 30 years old, my wife is 29. We make $223,000 a year combined and max out both our Roth 401(k)s and my Roth IRA. After marrying my beautiful wife, I found out our income was above the threshold allowing us to make direct Roth IRA contributions. I then learned about the backdoor Roth conversion. My understanding of the backdoor Roth is that if I put $6,000 in a traditional IRA, which has already been taxed by my employer via payroll and income taxes, I then convert that money into a Roth about a week after it has been deposited into my traditional IRA.\"\"However, I am receiving conflicting guidance from my tax professional versus the financial planner. My tax professional told me, since the money was already taxed by my employer, when I make the conversion, I only have to report the gains on the conversions as taxable, not the base $6,000 conversion. However, a financial planner told me this was incorrect. He explained that I needed to report the $6,000 conversion as income. Basically, he was telling me I should be getting double-taxed on this money and that I needed to stop these conversions now and submit amendments to my taxes. Can you clarify?\"Bro, whose side are you going to come down on here? Judge Bro, now presiding. [laughs] I'll start with a general rule of thumb. If there's a debate about taxes between an accountant and a financial planner, go with the accountant. So I'm a Certified Financial Planner. I took a class in taxes. I had to pass the test, but I know nothing compared to the average accountant. Plus, on a practical level, accountants who've been in the business for a while have filed literally hundreds of tax returns, whereas most financial planners don't do their clients' tax returns, and many don't even do their own returns. So when it comes to taxes, go with the accountant.That said, not every accountant is perfect, and I see that you're getting conflicting advice from professionals. So I understand why you'd want to know what the answer is.So when you make a backdoor Roth, you first make a contribution to a nondeductible traditional IRA, and you report it on your taxes using Form 8606, which is specifically for nondeductible IRAs. So as Aaron points out, it's made with after-tax money. And when you take out the nondeductible IRA contributions, whether it's through a conversion or just making a regular withdrawal, you don't pay taxes on that. You only owe taxes on the gains earned by those contributions. Now, after you do the conversion, you will get a tax document, it's called a 1099-R, from your broker at the end of the year, which you use to report the conversion of your tax return. So the financial planner is right that you have to report it, but you'll only owe taxes to the extent that the amount listed on the 1099-R exceeds the amount on the Form 8606.If you don't have any other traditional IRAs, a backdoor Roth is really easy. Just talk to your accountant or even call your broker, because they've been doing this a lot. They'll walk you through it. But as long as you don't have any other traditional IRAs, you shouldn't owe much of any taxes. Once he's brought up a second form, I think I just, kind of, fell asleep for a little bit, just, not fell asleep, but it's just once you start talking about the number of forms conflicting with each other, then I'm just like, shut down. I just don't even, no, done.Okay. Well, someone will hold my hand, is basically what you're saying, if I want to do it. Yes. Great. All right. Next question comes from George. \"Can you talk about preferred stocks and your opinion on them with regards to adding them to a purely income portfolio?\" Sure. I'm an opinionated guy, [laughs] so I have an opinion on this question. But I'm not going to get into a deeper view of preferred stocks, or we'd be here for another hour. But I will just say just a couple of features about preferred stocks versus common. They tend to have higher dividend yields, they don't typically have voting rights, but they do have preferences in dividends. So a company, if it's got preferred stock out there, it's got to make sure it can pay that first.They tend to have preference in liquidation. If a company goes bankrupt, the claims of the preferred stockholders are higher up in the food chain versus the claims of common stockholders. They can often be convertible to common stock. And they can be callable, company can call them back and more or less retire those. So it's just a general refresher on what a preferred stock is.Now, as for this idea, I'm assuming that we were looking at a mix of dividend stocks, maybe some dividend ETFs, maybe some bonds or bonds ETFs when George refers to an income portfolio. So what preferred stocks can do in many cases, it's one of the few ways where you can increase the yield on a portfolio without really messing with the beta of your portfolio. And by beta, I simply mean the volatility of your portfolio compared to that big, broad measure of the S&P 500 index, which is said to have a beta of 1.0. So if the stocks you own are more volatile as a group than the S&P 500, your beta coefficient is over 1.0. If it's below 1.0, then your basket of stocks is less volatile.For the income investor, it's sort of important, because you're not really as concerned with growth as much as having a stable basket doesn't change a lot and keeps returning those cash flows to you. Preferred stocks, in general, tend to be less volatile than common stocks for some of the reasons I listed at the beginning of this answer. They're a different animal. But we should put out the caveat that, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a lot of preferred stocks acting almost as volatile [laughs] as common stocks. And the reason simply is that preferred stock shareholders got a little worried about companies' ability to pay their coupons. And actually, the dividend of a preferred stock is often referred to, like, a bond as a coupon. But that's simply all it is, it's just the dividend payment.People got worried that maybe the companies won't be able to honor their obligations, so we saw a lot of volatility. That should be a rare event. I don't know how often we'll see that. I read somewhere that stocks hadn't been this volatile since maybe 2008, preferred stocks.So it's a good idea to add some in, I believe. In general, you won't be immune from volatility. It seems like we have these once-in-a lifetime events more and more, as we're only 12 years removed from the Great Recession. But on the whole, it's a pretty solid idea, because as I said, you can lower the volatility of your overall portfolio, you can collect a slightly higher dividend yield than you might otherwise. So I say go for it. Just like everything else, be balanced in your approach. Yeah, when I hear people ask about preferred stocks, they're often asking as a replacement for bonds, because preferred stocks do yield much more than bonds. And I would just emphasize what Asit just said and it is that, with preferred, you do get some volatility. So one of the largest preferred ETFs is the , the ticker is PFF. At one point this year, it was down 33%. Since then, it has rebounded, being down just 9%, but in 2008, it was down more than 20%.So I think having some preferreds in your portfolio is fine, but just know that they can be just as volatile as stocks, so they're not really necessarily an apples-to-apples replacement for bonds. Next question comes from John. \"I know the gist of the wash-sale rule, that you can't sell a stock within 30 days before or after you buy stock and harvest the loss for tax purposes. However, is that based on the quantity of stocks bought? For example, if I sold 10 stocks and 20 days later my dividend reinvestment bought 0.5 stocks, are all of my 10 stocks washed, or just 0.5? And can I take a loss on the other 9.5?\" I like how John points out the before-and-after aspect, because most of the time when the wash-sale rule is discussed, it goes something like this, someone will say, like, \"If I sell a stock for a loss, I can't buy it back for 30 days if I want to use the loss on my tax return.\" But you also can't buy it 30 days before the sale, so that is important to know.In John's case, it sounds like he sold just some of the shares of a stock he owns and then he received dividends from the shares he still owned. And since he had signed up for dividend reinvestment, he automatically bought another half a share. So he unintentionally bought within 30 days. To answer his question, he can still use the loss on the 9.5 shares on his tax return, but not for that half a share that he bought within those 30 days. But he's not completely out of luck. The disallowed loss will be added to the cost basis of that half a share, which means he'll have a lower capital gain when he eventually does sell, assuming of course, he makes a profit. All right. And our last question comes from Dan. \"Does any of the recent legislation extend the deadline for contributing to an IRA or 401(k) to the new filing deadline, or did money still have to be deposited by April 15?\" So here are all the new retirement and tax-related deadlines in light of all the ways the government is trying to help Americans cope with the corona crisis. So let's start with 401(k)s and most other employer-sponsored plans. For most people, no changes. You have to make contributions in the same calendar year. So the deadline was and is Dec. 31. However, if you check out the FAQ on the IRS website about this point, they will highlight that there are some exceptions depending on when a company files its taxes. So check with your plan provider.As far as IRAs, the deadline to file and pay federal taxes has been moved to July 15, and that is also now the deadline to contribute to an IRA for 2019. That same applies for health savings accounts.The deadline for paying estimated federal taxes for the first and second quarters of 2020 has also been moved to July 15. Finally, most states have also moved their deadlines to July 15, but not all, including our home state of Virginia. So make sure to check your state's deadlines for filing returns, paying the actual money, and paying quarterly estimates. All right. That's it, you guys. Wow! 13 questions. It's time then to head to the other mailbag, where we share the things that you shared with us. So I want to say thank you to Randy, who sent in some virtual postcards. He also suggested a way for me to introduce Robert Brokamp. So I'll do his suggestion at the next show. Ooh! What's it going to be?Randy also offered his advice, including budgeting and talking to his spouse for any item purchase of over $100, and also suggested going to your state's unclaimed property site to see if you have any money left outstanding for you. So I did a search in Virginia, and apparently  Power and  owe me some money. So it's like online couch cushions. Motorola, wow! Yeah, I know. I wonder what that's about. Anyway. Hope you're getting interest on that money. [laughs] Motorola. [laughs] Yeah, right. I also want to say thanks to Rich, who sent a lovely virtual postcard from Paris and also suggested a holiday tradition. Instead of an elf on the shelf, why not have a jester-the-investor, who visits families during the month of April to help with financial investing fitness? Bro, you have to love that idea. I do. Peter. I want to thank Peter, who took Rick Engdahl's advice and sent some lovely virtual postcards of photos he took in Edmund Babler State Park in St. Louis, practicing some social distancing. Brent also took Rick's advice. I think maybe we thanked Brent already, but we'll do it again. He took some very artsy photos of his cat looking thoughtful out of a rainy window, titled \"Quarantine blues.\"Vicki sent in her submission of her husband cutting firewood in Wisconsin. Rick, so many people took your advice about taking pictures. Amazing what boredom will do. [laughs] Isn't it? And Dale wrote in to let us know that Andy Cross looks a lot like Tony Stark, and it's funny that you never see the two in the same place at the same time. Hmm...?Bro, did you have a letter you wanted to share? Well, I'd like to thank Bill for sending in his family holiday tradition. They all get together to watch , a very underappreciated special, a special, features some kazoo music. Thank you, Bill. Is this one that you knew about, Bro? Oh, I did know about it, but it's not very well known. I don't even know if they make it on the -- you know, a lot of those specials will come through every year, but I haven't seen it on TV, but I might have the DVD. [laughs] Now, if you can just find a DVD player to play it. All right. Well, let's head to our closing parting advice of something that will hopefully give joy to our listeners during this time of pandemic-ness. Asit, do you want to go first? Yes. So I have three suggestions of things to do in the pandemic. The first is teabag ball. This is a game I invented when I was really bored. Take a tea bag, clip off the string, and take the cup you'd normally drink the tea out of, put it on a wooden table about five or six feet from you, and pretend you're making the game-winning free throw. It'll keep you occupied for hours.Second. I am really getting into watching foreign comedies, but focus on one particular country. I drag my family to see, in the house, [laughs] so I drag them from the four corners of the house to see a Turkish film called , which is, sort of, not a literal translation, but it means \"my goodness,\" and I'm focusing on Turkey. Turkish comedies are really wonderful. This is spelt E-Y-Y-V-A-H, and then, E-Y-V-A-H. I don't know why the second Eyvah is spelled differently. But focus on one country, you'll take yourself to another environment, and watch comedies just from that country.And last one, I know so many people are doing Zooming with friends and family. So some friends of ours, we're going to put on a, sort of, weekly call with our family and theirs. And I'm asking everyone to do a one-liner at the beginning of the call. I lifted this one from my  feed. I think this was actually from Selena. If you follow Selena Maranjian on Twitter, longtime Fool, she has a lot of hilarious stuff. I don't know where she finds the time, but it's an endless stream of witticisms and jokes. So here's my one-liner from our first call. \"You mean, a shrimp fried this rice?\" [laughs] Zing. Those are the jokes. Those are my three things. That's great. Who wants to go next? So this probably won't bring you joy, but if you, like me, choose to mentally escape the difficulties of these troubled times by learning about things that are even worse, then I recommend a newish podcast series called . This is a very detailed, 15-episode series, about that crazy time when we, here in the DC area, feared gas stations and white vans, even though it turned out that they didn't drive a white van. The series features all kinds of interviews with many of the original investigators and journalists and witnesses involved with the case. If you have just a moderate interest in the case, the series might run a bit too long, but I find it rather interesting and, to be honest, chilling having lived through that.I don't know, Alison, were you living in the DC area during that time? I was, yeah, I had lived here before 9/11, the day before 9/11. And then, yeah, so then I was here for the DC sniper, which was crazy. It was a crazy time to be living in DC. They were telling you to always walk in a serpent -- never walk in a straight line down the sidewalk, always walk serpentine. So we were doing that and -- ... gas stations were hanging up tarps to prevent people from being seen while they're putting in their gas. Everyone who owned a white van was stopped at least three times by cops at some point in that five- to six-week period. It was insane. So my suggestion is a follow-up on a previous. So I assume that our listeners are going to be doing all of these things that we suggest, right? So at this point they're out taking pictures, they have a new puppy and, obviously, from the very first time we did this, they're playing the ukulele and they've been playing it for several weeks now, right? And they probably have a handful of songs down.So I'm going to suggest you take your ukulele to the next level and you write a song. If you're not a songwriter, become a songwriter. And here's the tip, here's how you do it. First, you take a song that you know and like, but a simple song, you know, something, I don't know, Jimmy Buffett or something like that, something that has a nice simple verse-chorus pattern, something that's familiar. You take the words and you throw them away and you write new words to the same tune, right?You have the rhythm down, you have the tune down, you already know how to play it on the ukulele. Write new words of the same tune about whatever it is you want to say. And when you're done, then you take those words and you put a whole new tune to it that you make up. See, because you already have the words at that point, you know how it goes. That's how you get into the art of songwriting. It's like reverse Weird Al. It is kind of like doing a parody. The first time, it feels like you're doing this parody, and maybe you do a parody. That's cool too. But if you take it to the next step and you just, OK, now I got the words and they fit this pattern, it's familiar. Now, I can write a new tune to that song. And you know, you can even use the same chords on your ukulele. So my suggestion is a creativity tip. Hey, Rick, if anyone wanted to hear your songs that you have written, are you on some, sort of, public, sort of, thing? Like a  or something like that? Oh, yeah. Why, yes, Bro, I do in fact have songs on Spotify. You just go to Spotify, I assume, and search for my band name, which is Sense of Wonder, and it's my wife and I as a duo, and it's a brand new album, it came out just in 2007. [laughs] But it's still good. It's still good. I have the actual CD. Oh, yes, I'm so proud of it. I'll tell you what, I did my own solo CD prior to that in 1997. So every 10 years or so. [...] with great album. Yeah. My solo album is not on Spotify, and never will be anywhere in public if I can avoid getting it there. So I'm not proud of that one, but the one I did with my wife ... ... wow! So go write a song, says Rick Engdahl. You'll be so happy you did. I'm super proud. Write a song, but write more songs before you record them. [laughs] And marry somebody more talented than yourself [...]. Yeah, I love her voice. All right. Okay. So to me, this is not a great -- I don't know, it's fine, it's fine. All right, so do you happen to be one of the lucky few who has some money burning a hole in your pocket and maybe there's someone in your life who is having a bad day and you want to make them feel better? Well, head to Cameo, where you can find 5 major celebrities and 5,000 minor celebrities who are all willing to record a personal message in video form and send it to someone you love.So Cameo is crazy. Basically for, like, $40, I found Kevin McDonald from  and he recorded a, I don't know, it felt like, two, three minutes, but it was probably like a one- or two-minute message to my best friends from high school who are big fans of . And then, the text response I got from my best friend was just a lot of the letters \"O\" and then some swear words, but like, happy swear words. So anyway.Again, for $40, it was a price I was willing to pay to bring some joy to a couple of my high school friends' lives. And you can find other celebrities on there, especially if they've been on a reality show in the last 10 years or sports ball players, and I don't know, Cameo, it's funny, it's weird, you can get Steve Guttenberg, I don't know. Don't send me Cameos. [laughs] Or someone from , right? Yeah. No, our boss of the communications department, she sent us a message from Jerry from , saying, \"congratulations on completing your project.\" And so that was really -- it was actually really amazing to see Jerry from giving us some mad talk, it was fantastic, so. Jerry is quite awesome. He is quite awesome. So anyway, Cameo. Check it out or don't, whatever, I don't care. We're all just trying to survive. Anyway.All right. Well, that's the show. Also, I want to thank you so much for joining us from the Northerner Carolina. This show is edited singer songwriter-ly by Rick Engdahl. For Robert Brokamp, I'm Alison Southwick.

With air travel at a near-standstill, most people are staying home, and hotels just aren't getting booked. That's bad news for online travel specialist , especially given its emphasis on international destinations. The company's stock is down more than 30% year to date, badly underperforming the broader stock market.This isn't the first time that Booking Holdings has had to recover from an existential crisis. During the dot-com bust, the company then known as Priceline.com found itself having to struggle to survive. But survive it did, and in the years that followed, Booking Holdings became one of the most successful stocks of the 21st century. Now, Booking Holdings once again will have to prove how resilient it can be in the face of adversity. data by .Booking Holdings is a rare example of a company that came close to failing before becoming a . The travel specialist's innovative approach to helping customers book hotel rooms and airplane tickets made it a big winner during the dot-com boom, but by 2003, the company's stock was hugging the bottom of the charts. Booking resorted to a reverse split to boost its share price, and it became one of the few companies to beat the odds and not only stay in business but thrive following that move.After that near-death experience, Booking knew that it needed to sustain a competitive advantage. It decided to focus more on international hotel bookings than its rivals, with Priceline's purchase of Booking.com creating the basis for the company's current name. The strategic decision gave Booking Holdings a first-mover advantage overseas that it retains to this day.Image source: Booking Holdings.Coming into 2020, some investors were already worried about . In the fourth quarter of 2019, gains in gross travel bookings came in at just 6%, with earnings and revenue both climbing 4% year over year.That was before the coronavirus outbreak happened, and now,  and the entire online travel industry are larger than ever. Border closures have made international travel nearly impossible, and travel bans are forcing airlines to reduce their operations dramatically. That leaves the online travel service without customers to serve. Moreover, if the economic impacts of the pandemic are as bad as many fear, then even once travel opens up again, fewer people will be able to afford it. That points to even further slowdowns for Booking Holdings growth in the future.The about-face in travel activity has forced investors to . The company said in early April that it has enough cash to make it through the end of 2021, although if conditions weaken further, that date could come sooner. To generate more cash, Booking sold off some of its stake in China's . It also turned to the credit market to sell $4 billion in notes with maturities five to 10 years into the future. That should give Booking some time for industry conditions to improve.Investors currently believe that Booking Holdings could see its earnings get cut in half in 2020 compared to 2019 levels. That would put even the company's reduced stock price at about 26 times earnings, which looks like a rich valuation for a company facing future growth challenges.However, those following the stock believe that Booking will bounce back quickly, recovering to near 2019 earnings levels by 2021. That's far from certain, but if the pandemic ends up leaving consumers with pent-up travel demand that they can afford to satisfy following the end of travel bans, then today's share-price levels for Booking will look cheap in hindsight. Those willing to take that risk could find Booking Holdings to be a good buy right now, but it's not the best pick for more conservative investors who prefer .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The net effect of all these gyrations, though, is that two months after the market first melt down, the S&P 500 still sits 16% below its high. \u00a0And if you want to, there's still time to buy.Image source: Getty Images.Although \"16% below the high\" means many stocks are no longer in bear market territory, there are still some pretty incredible bargains to be had. Let's start with   -- currently trading 33% below its January 1, 2020 price.The company formerly known as Priceline.com, Booking Holdings has moved far beyond its \"name your own price\" roots to become the biggest name in travel-related bookings (flights, hotels, and rental cars). Last year, Booking Holdings recorded more than $15 billion in travel-related revenue, and nearly $4.9 billion in profits (says ). That's bigger -- and more profitable -- than  and  -- combined.Now admittedly, the  pandemic has thrown Booking's business into turmoil temporarily, to the extent that the company had to  for first quarter earnings last month. No one's flying much of anywhere these days, nor booking hotels or reserving rental cars either. Analysts forecast that even if economies begin to reopen later this year, Booking is looking at a nearly 30% reduction in revenues this year -- and more than a 70% decline in profits.But even so, economies will reopen eventually, and business will get back to normal for Booking Holdings. By the time that happens, a lot of the company's smaller competitors -- companies lacking Booking Holdings' $7.3 billion in cash reserves, may have been driven out of business, and Booking Holdings could emerge stronger than ever before.Is it a smart move to buy a bank in the ? A lot of people think not, and that's why online bank holding company   stock has lost 50% of its market capitalization since the year began.In a way, they may be right to worry. After all, just last week  a 12% decline in revenue and a big net loss for its first fiscal quarter of the year, as the bank reserved more than $900 million to pay for anticipated losses on its loan portfolio from borrowers hurt by the Great Shutdown.But here's the thing: At a mere 5.5 times trailing earnings, Ally's share price bakes in a lot of bad news already. Yes, the charge to earnings hit profits in the first quarter, and perhaps the second quarter won't be much better. But in the long term, Ally has proven itself capable of being a very profitable operation -- and I have to think that the longer coronavirus stay-at-home orders remain in effect, the more popular online banking is going to become, which would be a plus for Ally's business, both during and after the pandemic passes.What's more, while Ally has suspended share repurchases to conserve cash, it is continuing to  -- which to my mind, at 5.3%, is big enough to justify the stock's current valuation all on its own. If Ally grows earnings even just a little (over the next five years, analysts expect it to grow by a lot -- 10% annually), the stock's a screaming bargain at today's prices . \u00a0Of course, if you want to snag a stock at a bargain price that will set you up for life, cruise lines look like both the riskiest, but also potentially the most profitable area of the stock market in which to fish -- and at nearly $21 billion in annual revenues (pre-coronavirus, at least),    is the biggest fish in the sea.The past year has seen Carnival stock lose 78% of its value, with more than 70% of those losses occurring since the start of this year -- and for good reason. Not only did Carnival vessels feature prominently in , linking the company and the virus in investors' minds, but they continue to feature prominently in stories to this day, notably including the CDC's recent order  until late June at the earliest.Carnival sailed into this recession, moreover, burdened by $13 billion more debt than cash on its balance sheet -- not the kind of cargo you want to be carrying in the midst of an economic storm.For a time at least, there was serious doubt the company would survive. And yet, thanks to the Federal Reserve's March corporate lending program, Carnival has already managed to secure bank loans for an additional nearly $6 billion -- , says the CEO, to keep the company afloat even if its ships must remain docked throughout the entirety of this year. \u00a0If you believe Carnival's CEO, therefore, there's every possibility that within a year or two, Carnival could be back earning what it was earning in 2019 ($4 a share or thereabouts).

Please go ahead. -- Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We are living in difficult times. Since our last call in February, the spread of COVID-19 has grown exponentially bringing uncertainty, turmoil and in too many people, tragedy all over the world. What started as a regional outbreak that we had hoped would be contained and would follow the paths of other new viruses like SARS or H1N1 has grown into a global pandemic of unprecedented proportions. We join the global community in our sadness at this horrific suffering and loss of life and recognize the tremendous economic toll on so many people in so many countries. This virus has wrecked havoc on industries across the world, and this is without a doubt, the biggest disruption in modern global travel, the world has ever seen. Billions of people have been under stay-at-home orders and there have been and continue to be closures of borders, government enforced travel restrictions and strict guidelines regarding social distancing. These actions have profoundly affected our industry in every corner of this earth.While our Q1 reported room nights declined 43% year-over-year, we did not see the virus' full negative force on our business until mid to late March. So, the 43% decline does not truly reflect the state of our business, nor the travel industry today. In March, our reported room nights declined over 100%, meaning we received more cancellations during that amount than new bookings. Looking at things, a different way, our newly booked room nights, which exclude the impact of cancellations, were down over 60% year-over-year in March and down over 85% in April. This gives you a clear indication of how much our business is currently impacted by this crisis.That being said, while the virus' impact on travel is unprecedented, I am confident that this crisis will eventually end and people will travel again. Travel is fundamental to who we are and while it may take some time to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, we will get there eventually. And then we'd expect travel to continue to grow thereafter. So what are we doing now as we wait for effective treatments for a successful vaccine? During the first quarter, when it became clear that the virus' impact was going to be more significant than anyone initially anticipated, we quickly developed a series of plans to help us navigate through these challenging times. One, stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis. Two, optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. And three, position the business to capture travel demand when it returns so we can emerge from this crisis on strong footing and extend our leadership position.As we entered the stabilization phase at the beginning of the crisis, our employees' health and safety was a top priority. So while we have -- although we have a few offices currently open in Asia, the vast majority for our employees are now working from home, including our customer service teams, which is no small accomplishment, considering the technology requirements and the huge increase in chained requests and cancellations that we experienced. I'm very proud of our teams and pleased to say that we are functioning well in this new distributed environment.Another immediate priority was helping our customers and our supply partners. For a number of weeks, we were fielding a significantly higher number of daily inbound calls than we typically receive. For our customers, this entailed supporting them as they sought refunds for bookings that were no longer possible due to government regulations or made request to modify their travel plans. For our partners, many of whom do not have the ability to process such a large volume of customer service calls, we supported them by handling the unprecedented level of cancellations and deep modifications requests.Looking ahead, we'll be working with our channel partners to create plans to stimulate travelers to book again once this crisis is behind us. We know how critical it will be to bring demand to our supply partners in a cost effective way. Also, as part of our stabilization plan, we took immediate steps to conserve cash and increase liquidity such as halting stock buybacks, dramatically reducing marketing spend worldwide, cutting non-essential costs, implementing a general hiring freeze, and reducing executive compensation with our brand CEOs and I foregoing salaries during this crisis. and the other senior managers throughout the company voluntarily reducing their salaries and our Board of Directors foregoing their cash fees. In addition to reducing costs, we bolstered our liquidity by raising over $4 billion in debt. These measures have enabled us to have sufficient liquidity to weather a long period of significantly reduced travel demand and have the necessary resources to invest in securing demand when people are ready to travel again.We have begun to respond to execute our optimized plan in which we will adapt to the new reality that assumes it will be -- likely be years, not quarters, before we witness a full recovery of global travel demand. We believe that either a vaccine or effective treatment is needed before people will feel fully comfortable traveling the way they did before the pandemic started. And even after a vaccine or treatment is declared safe and effective, we believe it may be some time before there is sufficient quantity and distribution of them to give people an governments confidence for people to travel freely.Furthermore, as in pre-COVID-19 days, some will be dependent on the overall economy, consumers' financial health everywhere having gone through a very deep recession, and consumers' confidence in their own economic futures. For these reasons, we expect travel to fully recover later than many other industries. However, when travel demand does start to recover, we believe there will be attractive growth opportunities. We are in the process of assessing the cost structure of our entire company in developing plans to align with expected market demand. As part of these efforts, we are also evaluating our strategic initiatives and the timing of significant expenditures. We intend to continue to invest in our key projects such as Payments and the Connected Trip that we believe will position us well for the future. We are also reexamining all areas of the company to see where can we reduce or delay costs where possible. Fortunately, our financial strength allows us to make strategic decisions pointed toward the long term interest of the business.We recently completed a strategic evaluation with OpenTable and KAYAK announcing last week a series of actions to reduce operating costs. Unfortunately, this included the decision to lay off and furlough some employees. As a principle during this crisis, we have not reached first for employee reductions to lower costs but after making adjustments in other operating expense areas, we made the tough decision to ensure the size and scope of our business is proportionate to the new realities of the travel market. We are now working with the other brand to examine their cost structures and we'll be thoughtful and deliberate in our evaluations.In an attempt to minimize the impact on our employees during these difficult times, we have been evaluating and employing various governmental financial support programs. Booking.com recently announced that it would participate in the employee aid programs offered by the United Kingdom and we were able to place employees on furlough there, which has enabled employees to receive a significant portion of their full-time salary. We have also applied to the Dutch government to obtain aid under the recently enacted program to support employment in the Netherlands. This program provides funds to Dutch companies impacted by this crisis and covers a portion of employee salaries for a three-month period with the requirement that companies which receive this aid maintain employment during the time the aid is provided. These programs, along with all the other steps we have taken, will help us support employees and maintain jobs as we continue to fully evaluate the operating environment. We will continue to look at other available options that might help us mitigate near term headcount reductions during this period of significantly reduced revenue.The actions we are taking in our stabilization and optimization phase are being done so that we can capitalize quickly and efficiently on travel demand when it becomes safe for people to travel again. We want to emerge from this crisis as a strong organization that is equipped to deliver for our customers and our partners, well-capitalized and in a position to increase our market share when the world is ready to travel again.On a smaller, but somewhat positive note, we are seeing some stability in our newly booked room night growth trends. We hope that this is the beginning of the road back to recovery, but it's certainly too early to say with certainty. Some governments have seen progress in limiting or reducing the pandemic. They have slowly begun to reopen their economies and we have seen new bookings, primarily for domestic travel, although still at very low levels. Some, or many of these reservations may ultimately be canceled, but we believe it does show that travel for essential business and personal reasons will slowly return as society makes progress against the pandemic. And as travel returns, we expect to see improvement in our revenue.We are also prepared for disruption in that progress, as relaxation of social distancing in some geographies may lead to a resurgence of infections and reinstatement of government restrictions. Our aim is to optimize the business to participate in the ultimate return [Technical Issues]Please continue, sir. -- Hello?Go ahead, sir. -- Hello. Hello. Am I still on the line?Yes, one moment please. -- Thank you. Hello, operator, can you hear me?Yes, I can hear you. -- Okay. Am I live on the line?Yes, you are. -- Thank you. Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. Operator, am I live on the line? Can you confirm that please? I can...Yes, you are, sir. -- Thank you. Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the first quarter, discuss our stabilization initiative to bolster our liquidity and provide some color on trends we saw in April. All growth rates are related to the prior-year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.Now on to our results for the quarter. At the time of our last earnings call on February 26, the outbreak of COVID-19 was largely contained to Asia and we were yet to see a meaningful impact in our business across Europe or North America. As we moved into March, the COVID outbreak continued to spread throughout Europe and North America leading to eventual declaration of a global pandemic and the implementation of numerous travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. Not surprisingly, we saw a resulting short duration of our top-line trends in March with significant levels of cancellations and a substantial reduction in the level of new bookings. Although, we only felt the full brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic around mid-to-late March, our Q1 results were still significantly negatively impacted.Our Q1 reported room nights declined 43% for the full quarter, however that decline exceeded 100% in March when we received more cancellations than new bookings in the month. Our cancellation rate peaked in mid-March and has been steadily improving since then as we work through the wave of cancellation of bookings made prior to the imposition of restrictions on travel. Gross bookings declined 51% in Q1, which is a greater decline than reported room nights due to average daily rates for accommodation is decreasing about 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis.Consolidated non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $2.3 billion and decreased 21% year-on-year. Revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than room nights and gross bookings due to the fact that many cancellations were received in Q1 with check-ins that were expected to occur later in -- were expected to occur in later quarters. Adjusted Q1 for EBITDA was $209 million, which was down 60% year-on-year. We benefited from having a highly variable cost structure to manage the declines in periods of low travel demand. As Glenn noted, we are taking further actions in reducing other areas of spend as we stabilize and then move to optimize and align our cost structure with the new demand environment.With that being said, there are some areas of expense pressure in the quarter related to COVID-19 pandemic that I'll walk you through. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense decreased 29% year-on-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the pay channels. In addition, we took actions to substantially reduce our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. We expect our marketing expense will remain significantly below 2019 levels for the remainder of the year.Sales and other expenses increased 75% year-on-year due primarily to a $183 million increase in provisions for expected bad debt and other credit losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the impacts of the increased provision we recorded in the quarter, sales and other decreased 10% year-on-year as this expense line is substantially variable in nature. For example, we recorded lower expenses associated with payments in Q1. This reduction was partially offset by higher outsourced customer service costs as we worked through the heavy volume of cancellations we received in the quarter.Personnel expense decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to decrease in stock-based compensation, which was impacted by reduced financial performance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding SBC expenses, personnel increased 12% year-over-year, and although we have implemented a hiring freeze, personnel expense this quarter was impacted by annualized hires that were made last year. We expect the pressure on personnel expense will diminish as we move through the year.G&A expenses increased 6% year-over-year, largely driven by higher indirect taxes including digital service taxes. Excluding these indirect taxes, G&A expense decreased 7% year-over-year as we reduced discretionary expenses such as T&A expense. We will see less year-over-year pressure on G&A from digital service taxes once we lap the enactment of the French DST, which occurred in Q3 of last year. Finally, information technology expenses increased 20% year-on-year, driven by higher software fees and outsourced datacenter and cloud costs.On a GAAP basis, we incurred an operating loss of $308 million as our GAAP operating expense in the quarter included a charge of $489 million related to an impairment of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK. This impairment charge is driven by reduced financial projections as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We excluded the impairment of goodwill from our non-GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP net loss was $699 million. Our Q1 GAAP net loss includes $307 million of pre-tax losses on our equity investments in Trip.com and Meituan and the $100 million impairment charge related to strategic investments. This was partially offset by $33 million of FX remeasurement gains on our eurobonds. We excluded these unrealized losses, impairment charge and remeasurement gains from our non-GAAP results.Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance was $9.2 billion, which decreased from our December ending balance of $11.8 billion, due to several factors including the following primary drivers. First, we had $380 million of operating cash outflow in the quarter, which was driven by $820 million use of cash due to change in working capital as well as the lower earnings we generated in the quarter. Working capital in Q1 was negatively impacted by a prepayment of taxes in the Netherlands of $770 million that was subsequently funded in April. The large reductions in our deferred merchant bookings, accounts payable and accrued expense balances were mostly offset by the significant reduction in our accounts receivable balance in Q1. The deferred merchant booking reduction was driven by both lower bookings and customer refunds. We expect these balances to all continue to decline in the low level of bookings we are currently seeing in the business.Second, we repurchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q1. Almost all of which was purchased under a stock buyback plan we filed last November. We halted buybacks as soon we recognized the growing impact of the pandemic. Third, we had capex of $80 million in the quarter. And finally, the value of our investments declined in part by the $370 million unrealized loss on equity securities and the $100 million impairments related to a strategic investment that I mentioned earlier. In addition, we had $106 million decline in investment value that did not impact the P&L, but was reflected in the balance sheet. The majority of the remaining $288 million difference between cash and investments at year-end of March 31 is primarily due to timing of the settlements of sales for some corporate bonds that were classified in prepaid expenses and other assets at the end of March. These sales were settled in April and moved into cash and investments.In our efforts to stabilize the business for the immediate shock of the crisis, we've taken several steps to shore up and bolster our liquidity position. We halted repurchases of our stock and we will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility in the shape and timing of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We worked to receive a refund in April of the prepayments of taxes in the Netherlands that was made earlier in Q1. We amended our revolving credit facility to substitute a minimum liquidity covenant for the previous leverage covenant that was due in '21 to ensure we continue to have access to a source of liquidity.And finally, and most notably, we completed a bond in convertible note offering on April 8 that raised $4.1 billion of capital. If you adjust our March 31 ending cash investment balance of $9.2 billion for a bond in convertible note offering and the settlement of the corporate bond sales and the refund of the Dutch tax prepayments, all which occurred in April, our March 31 cash and investment balance would increase to about $14.3 billion, approximately $12 billion of this is highly liquid after considering the actions we've taken including recently completing the sale of our Trip.com [Indecipherable] moving on cash and investments into corporate -- moving on cash and investments in corporate bonds into AAA treasury and government money market funds. After the bond in convertible offering, we had about $13 billion of debt, $4 billion of which matures before the end of 2022.Due to the COVID-19 crisis, I will not provide quarterly guidance like we normally do. However, I will provide some color from our preliminary April results which will give you a clear picture of our recent top-line trends considering that April was the first month fully impacted by the pandemic. As Glenn mentioned, on newly booked room nights in April, we're down over 85% year-on-year. As a reminder, newly booked room night excludes the impact of cancellations. Of course, these new bookings may be canceled in the future, especially as a very high percentage of new bookings in April were made with flexible cancellation policies. Reported room nights continue to be negative in April as cancellations outpaced new bookings. We expect our revenue in April to have a greater year-on-year decline than newly booked room nights, considering the impact of the cancellations in March for April stays and also since many hotels, especially in Europe, were not open in April.New bookings revenue for full second quarter may vary from April's results depending upon the level of travel demand and accommodation availability we experience in May and June. As Glenn noted, we're seeing some stability on newly booked room night growth trends with the year-on-year decline rate being quite consistent for our April after reducing rapidly through the first quarter. We believe that domestic travel will rebound sooner than international travel as we expect travelers to look to their home country or region first for safe travel option.In April, we made a meaningfully higher domestic mix in our business. Historically, domestic accommodation bookings represent about 45% of Booking.com's total business and if we consider Western Europe as one market, the historic mix increases to about 55%. In April, Booking.com's domestic share increased to approximately 70% and if you consider Western Europe as one market, the domestic mix increased over 75%. Towards the end of April, we saw some very early indications that domestic travel were starting to return in certain markets where shelter-in-place rules were relaxed, including Greater China, South Korea, Vietnam and Germany. Newly booked room nights in the U.S. declined less than our global average in April and we saw an improvement in domestic travel during April, but we cannot tie this to relaxation in shelter-in-place rules, as these have only happened in a few States and in recent days.I must emphasize again, that it's too early to say, we're witnessing anything like a broad rebound in travel, especially as we've seen some countries like Singapore where travel demand was less impacted than other places initially, but is now seeing significant travels demand decreases associated with new outbreaks. If we look across all our business, the decline rate for newly booked room nights in the last few days in April was only a few percent better than the decline rate in the first few days. We've also observed a meaningful change in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. In April, the customers mainly booked either very close to stay or several months out. The combined mix of both very short booking and bookings for over two months time is twice the normal amount. This booking behavior change has also been accompanied by an increase in mobile bookings, particularly in our app, helping drive a higher mix of direct bookings and we'll continue to focus on providing our customers with a great app experience.As Glenn emphasized, we have a tough road ahead of us as we look to navigate through the unprecedented challenges that COVID-19 has presented to us. We're working hard to stabilize our business through actions including our cost savings initiatives and the significant bolstering of our liquidity position. We'll continue to optimize our business and our cost to align it with expected market demand and we'll work to position ourselves to capitalize upon the reemergence of travel demand when that time occurs and wherever that demand occurs. We have the confidence that through these actions, we'll be well positioned to come out of this crisis and extend our global leadership role in the travel marketplace. With that, we will take your questions. -- And David, can you hear me? -- I can hear you now, Glenn. -- Thank you.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first response is from Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Maybe I'll try two questions. First, David, I think at the end you talked about this increase in app bookings so rise in direct bookings, is that something you actually were able to drive, that just happened randomly and is there a way to coming out of this crisis that at the margin you can tilt more of your bookings to -- you can accelerate this transition to direct bookings? And then secondly, thanks for the data points on the improvements in a couple of the markets, any quantification on those? Is there any way to say that any of these markets, South Korea, Vietnam, whatever are back at down 50% or something like that? Like what's the -- can you kind of draw the curve a little bit or it may be too early? Thank you very much. -- Yeah, Mark. Thank you. This is David. I'll take that. Let me go to the second question first. We have called out markets where there has been a double-digit improvements in the rate of decline from the start of April to the end of April. And we really don't count -- kept our remarks for the month of April because early trends in May are too early to call, so I'm not going to tell you exactly how much of that's down. I mentioned to it in total even with this improvement we've seen in these markets, our all-in room night decline rate is only a few points better at the end of month than it was at the start, but the markets that we called out have seen double-digit improvements during the course of the month of April.In terms of the shift toward app, first of all, I'll just caveat, as I said before, anything that we talk about in terms of April when we were running this kind of 10% to 15% of our normal volumes, you have to take and qualify through that lens and try not to draw too big a trend from it. We did see during the course of the month that we saw more app customers, we saw more Genius customers, which is often tied to app use as well and we were pleased with the fact that in the areas we saw some demand increase, where we saw the residual demand occur, more of it was going into the app. We'll continue to try and emphasize the app as we come through this because we want to make sure that we drive more direct business and of course the app is one of the strongest ways to drive direct business. But I wouldn't say there was a particular strategy that drove us there. I'm pleased that that's the way the things came out and we're going to continue to understand how our customers are buying and trying, continue the app trends as demand starts to recover. -- Thank you, David. Thank you, Glenn. Wishing you both the best. -- Thank you, Mark. -- Thank you.Thank you, your next response is from Kevin Kopelman, Cowen. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks so much. I just wanted to dig into the cost trends that you're seeing in April and also what you're planning for going forward. So could you help us think about that? Maybe starting with advertising, how that might trend relative to that new bookings metric and then moving on to personnel and your other big chunks of expenses, what you're planning for there. Thanks. -- David, why don't you take? -- Yeah. Thank you, Kevin and Glenn, let me take that. So marketing expenses are going to correlate quite closely to the rate of newly booked room nights. So you can assume as close correlation there. I actually walked through a number of these in the prepared remarks for Q1 and Q2. But just to summarize, sales and other, obviously, a piece of that is -- a large piece of that is tied to our merchant platform, those are variable with volume, but things like customer service costs and bad debt as you saw was a major factor in Q1. Those may continue to be a factor in Q2. Next biggest area, of course, is personnel. And, as we mentioned, the hiring freeze and the other actions that we took do not have much of an impact in Q1. In Q2, you'll get the full impact of those, also to the extent that we are successful with our application for government aid, that would generally help Q2 and some of the optimization actions that we've already taken like KAYAK and OpenTable will also help Q2.So as we move through the year and continue with optimization activities, that will also help with personnel expense as we move through the year, although the government aid promise we mainly focus upon Q2 and not the second half. As I mentioned, pressure will decrease on G&A, particularly, as we start to lap the DST expenses last year and information technology is an [Indecipherable] line, we saw obviously a fair amount of pressure on that in Q1. I pointed out how some of those costs relates to our volumes, and even though our revenues were basically not very high in Q1, the volumes that we had to process through the business through refunds and cancellations, etc, were also high and that drove IT cost up. That was one of the factors. We expect there to be less pressure on that line going through the rest of the year. -- Thanks. And then if I could just ask one quick follow-up, can you talk about how successful you've been in getting refunds out to customers who have had to cancel and also helping them coordinate refunds when they're dealing with a hotel? -- Yeah. Well, Glenn will take that one. -- Yeah. So this is a difficult issue. We have customers who have purchased reservations far in the future, perhaps that were non-refundable. And then there was a case of a pandemic and is a force majeure situation or a situation where the customer says, well, I can't travel because the government has said that you cannot travel there and we have hoteliers who are saying, wait, I can't refund everybody, maybe we'll spend some money, sharing is a difficult situation. So we always believe in trying to do what is best for the customers and our contracts with our hoteliers is completely set up for this exact situation, a force majeure situation in which case and it goes over all long history of travel that in a situation like this, the hotel should refund the customer. So what we will do is, we will provide the money to the customer and recover from the hotel. Now we've talked about that there is an issue, many of these hotels are closed right now, there's nobody actually there to have discussions with. We hope to get us a significant portion of it but we don't know yet if you're not talking with the people and we always want to come up with a good relationship with a hotel. So as they reopen, as things start again, we want to do this in the best way possible. I don't think we have any specific numbers to give. David is quoting the reserves and I think that's -- we hope for the best going forward. -- Thanks, Glenn. And thanks, David. -- Thank you, Kevin.Thank you, your next response is from Naved Khan of SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Thanks a lot. Just a couple of questions. So in the new bookings that are coming in, are you seeing any kind of a paradigm in terms of people -- more people opting for maybe alternative lodging versus a hotel or vice versa? And then in terms of just the the fixed cost, I think, David, you gave us a sense of where these were on your Q4 call, I think you said by less than 50% of the opex and after the initiative that you're taking -- that you've taken or will take, give us some sense of where these could land ultimately. -- Yeah. Naved, on the new bookings, I mentioned the fact that we're seeing a bit of a, what I call a dumbbell in the kind of pattern, which means that there is a [Indecipherable] close to the current stay hold there a long way out. What happened in the first quarter is hotel and alternative performed about the same. So they basically, almost in lockstep from a growth point of view throughout the quarter. In April, we saw a shift to alternative associated with those longer-term bookings. So we saw alternative accommodation doing better in the April bookings, particularly at the far end of the dumbbell, which is the two months-plus out bookings, particularly in the domestic markets, where we saw some decent return rates in the domestic markets in the month of April. So that's also relative to the mix.On the fixed costs, we are still, as Glenn said, I think he went through a fair amount of detail in his commentary, we are still building our optimized plans for many parts of the business. We've really only put those in place yet in one of our business segments and we're working through the other business segments, as we speak and of course, the timing of that is also going to be tied to what we're doing around some of the government aid program. So I don't want to come with a number just yet. I'll give you a data point for example that the reductions that we took at KAYAK and OpenTable reduced the personnel and off the expenses there by about 20%. And those will be part of that fixed or semi-fixed cost base I've talked about. That's one example. I really don't want to go into any more details when it comes to finalizing our funds yet, but as we do and when we do, we'll let you know what we're expecting to do to our cost base. -- Got it. Thank you and good luck. -- Thank you.Thank you, your next response is from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Hi, this is Alex Longo on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Just two questions. One, Glenn, you talked about sort of positioning the business to become stronger. Can you talk to us a little bit how you think about new strategies or approach in the U.S. market, specifically coming out of the downturn? And then the second question, just given the stay-at-home dynamics and with strong social media use, do you see an opportunity to potentially use more social advertising to drive growth coming out of the downturn? -- Thanks, Alex. It's very important for us as we come out as optimized to make sure that we're doing everything we can to become a better competitor in the U.S. We've talked in the past that we believe we under-index in the U.S. and that is something that is important to countering and be able to do. One of the things that we believe this provides a better overall value proposition to the customers, and it's also, as we talked in the past of making our customers more -- or potential customers aware of this better value proposition. And that goes through the Connected Trip that we've talked about in the past and how important we think that we'll be able to provide something different and better to the consumer. But your point is a good one about social media and how do we get that message to those consumers. And with -- our CMO came from Google who has been here about 10 months now, we absolutely believe that the social area -- social media is a way to try and drive that message to the consumer and we will be doing things in future, albeit always looking what's the right ROI for that. It does us no good to waste advertising money. -- Great. Thanks, Glenn.Thank you. Your next response is from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Two questions if I can. First, can you just talk about how you see the P&L coming out of this? And specifically, do you think that performance marketing can structurally benefit perhaps from lower competition in advertising auctions? And then secondly, wondering if you're seeing any shift between kind of urban and more ski and beach type of locations for booking and given somewhat of a shift to alternative. Give us an update on how you feel about your whole home inventory position as people perhaps look to locations with less urban density. Thanks. -- Well, let me start with the second one first, about the nature of the -- where's the demand going in April and such. And I can't give you any more specifics beyond what we've already described through a slight increase in people going for the alternative accommodations over home. I can say though, there's not a lot of skiing in April, so I don't know what I can tell you. And remind me, your first question was? -- First question was do you see -- how do you see the P&L coming out of this and then, might there be some longer-term structural benefit from lower competition in advertising options? -- Yeah, so one of the things that I think is important to understand, what we do believe that certainly because of this pandemic, some of the smaller players in the industry are going to have trouble going forward. But the big players are still going to be around, they're going to be very competitive as they were in the past and they are the ones who are the sophisticated players in the performance marketing area. So I don't think it's going to change a great deal versus the people who've been [Indecipherable] are going to be seeing people going forward. So I don't see significant change in that area. In terms of the P&L, when we get to that place down the road, that shining sun where we have fully recovered, I hope to be doing what we did in the past. We have the leading margins in the industry and still growing nicely and that's about the best one can put forward in terms of a long-term prediction. -- Okay, thank you.Thank you, your next response is from Doug Anmuth of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Hi, this is Davy [Phonetic] on for Doug. Thanks for taking our questions. So first of all, can you talk about your business travel mix, what the mix was going into COVID-19 and do you have any data that suggest maybe some business is helping recovery in some of the markets where you are seeing some? And then in those markets where you are seeing some pickup in demand, are those countries recovering in a similar manner? Just looking to see if the timeline in those countries can help educate us on how other country recoveries might look like going forward. -- So why don't I take the latter one or take the former one. One of the things I think is somewhat -- I think it's something that can be deceiving in terms of trying to take what has happened in one country and then model outcomes everywhere else. And we've seen a little bit of cases where countries have begun to open up, doing better, but then because they opened up the economy, there is a resurgence in infection and then they put in the reinstatement of the restrictions and things go backwards. And I think it's hard to do that. And also you have different countries, they've different travel patterns also. So I definitely would not -- I definitely would not take what is happening in one and then apply that across the entire world and say, OK, that's how this is going to roll out. I think that'd be a chance to come out with a very bad prediction for future. And, David, in terms of the first question. -- Nothing really, no major observation of business travel, that is, we don't have a formal percentage. We have a self-declared estimate that maybe as much as one-fifth of our business might be business travel, but it's not a noisy number, it's not a number that we really track or spend a lot of time looking at it. It's basically just a self-declared booking field. What I would say is and obviously as Glenn said, we're just talking about very small deviation. We're trying give you as much color as we can for what we saw in April. What I will tell you, and it's pretty obvious, that our domestic business was -- rates grew appreciably faster than the international rates, except this business travel -- well, it's international, that's still very depressed. I'm not seeing a large piece of this, but obviously a chunk of it is, so that's another way to look at it, we don't really have any specific data for the month of April, what happened to business travel versus non-business travel, other than the fact that we know what happened to domestic versus international. -- Got it. Thank you, both.Thank you, your next response is from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Learning and experimenting to merchandise better to the customer and connected travel have been themes you've been talking about for some time now, but with the demand environment being what it is, does that slow down the product development team in terms of the ability to innovate, because I guess there's a comparative lack of data and consumer behavior. And I guess, your competitors are probably struggling with the same difficult circumstances as well, but strictly as you think about what you wanted to achieve for booking in terms of product development and what the company looks like on the other side of the crisis. Thanks. -- You're right. One of the things that's been a great advantage for us is our experimentation ability because with more data, really come up with insights and be able to develop things much faster and that's always been a great advantage for us and if there is no demand, you're right, it's hard to put something and say is this working or not, how well does it work or not. So I agree with you that, but one can still make great insights with what, in comparisons, a small amount of data, but still can give you the insights. Don't forget, we were a lot smaller 10 to 15 years ago, but we were able to come up with a lot of new things that were very valuable and helped make us a leader in innovation in this industry and we believe that we'll still be able to do that and the Connected Trip will still be going forward, because we do believe and we are seeing -- we're seeing data before COVID that was indicating we're going in the right way and I do believe that this will continue going forward. As demand comes back, we'll be able to do more and more with that data. -- Thank you.Thank you, your next response is from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Please go ahead. One moment please. -- The inventory, longer term, Glenn, any views about how supply might consolidate on the other side of COVID-19 just because of the benefits of needing scale versus some of the historical trends, which could be quite a positive for the OTAs as demand is needed and demand starts to pick up looking back at past period yield case there to take share, it tend to be a better partner for the hotel industry. So just curious about the relationship with supply and how you yourself see supply evolving over the long term on the other side of COVID-19. Thanks so much, guys. -- In the long run, a very long run, there'll be supply that will be commensurate with what it was before COVID and it will match up with what the demand is in the long run. There may be, there may be in the period, right now, going forward, should go into this recovery, that there may be some decline in some areas of supply, that just isn't as great a place to stay and therefore the demand doesn't go there and prices have adjusted that the better quality places are a little bit cheaper and people go or gravitate there. But here's the point, the buildings don't disappear. The hotel business doesn't -- if there is demand, it will get sold, maybe a new owner, it may be recapitalized and such. But it will -- it will be there. So I think in the long run, I am not concerned about a constrain on supply that impacts our ability to provide great value to the consumer at all or any chance that the supplier doesn't need us anymore. I don't see that happening at all.Thank you, your next response is from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn, how would you characterize your answer to the previous question on the alternative accommodation side, I mean alternative accommodations has a great mix up inventory from urban apartments to traditional vacation rentals, and also you know people like hosts that are using their homes. Have you seen any meaningful disruption on that side? Is that something that's going to change meaningfully long term in your view? And then second question, I was also going to ask about your thoughts on investing behind brand, it feels like particularly in markets like U.S., you can invest on brand and then support it with some of the direct channels to capture meaningful share of the initial recovery demand. What are your views on that? Thank you so much. -- In terms of the first, and we'll go back to the second one. So in terms of alternative accommodations, interesting question about will there be a decline in the supply because there's no demand right now for many of them and they just say, well, I'm not going to bother with this, one. Two, is there an issue people are deciding, this isn't a great thing to do because there's concerns about having strangers in their homes and just don't want to have that, how long does that go for. You have also the trends beforehand about the regulatory environment, does this issue of the pandemic increase regulatory restraints on the supply or not.The flip side of that is very interesting, of course is where did Airbnb and a lot of this business really come out of was the Great Recession in 2008-2009 where a lot of people said I need to get extra income. So I'll rent out my spare bedroom or something of that nature, and that of course has morphed into a much more professional thing. I think I think in the end, this is a good business for everybody. People like alternative accommodations, the people that host, the people who own these properties, people who are doing this in these cottage industries, they like it, it's good money and as demand comes back, they'll continue to do it and there will be supply to meet that demand. On the demand side, people as you see right now, in just April alone, people see a need for it. I think that's good. I really don't see a lot of changes.One of the thing -- and I'll just use your question to point to this, is that people think the world is going be so different and I don't think the world is going to be hugely different once we get past this. There have been pandemics in the past, go back a 100 years, go back Hong Kong flu, but there have been pandemics, there have been terrible things, but in the end, people want to travel. People are willing to supply accommodations and I don't see that there's going to be a great change in the long run. And your other question was? -- Yeah, it was just on using brand advertising and support it with direct channels to capture a lot of the incremental demand during the initial recovery curve. Do you think that's something that's possible or how are you thinking about it, at least in certain markets like U.S., where it feels like brand advertising can be more efficient initially? -- Well, we are talking with the whole marketing team about that, one of the things you don't want to be doing, the reason we're not brand advertising right now is you don't want to be putting a message out when nobody is really listening or very few people are listening to you and you're spending the money for the number of people who you're spreading this message to, who really are not interested in traveling right now. That's not an efficient use of the money. I talked a little earlier about how we really want to be ROI efficient in this, so I'm not sure. Certainly, when we think that enough people are ready to travel, then it would be good to start pushing that message out to them. The critical thing is when is that right point, we'll be measuring very carefully to see when that right time is. -- Great. Thank you so much.Thank you, your next responses is from Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Good to see you back. Two questions, and I apologize, If they have been asked, but first, thinking about your merchant platform today, much bigger than before. Does that help you when people are ready to come back and hotels are engaging with different offers or pricing or things like that? And then secondly, if you assume more people are going to travel in their own countries versus international, does that change anything for ADRs or your market share or your take rates? Thank you. -- Well, I'll do the first one and I'll let David talk to the second one. The merchant platform will be very important, and that's why we do believe it's such an important part for us to continue to invest in our payments products and get that out, because as you point out, providing value, providing the right price, putting it together through that Connected Trip, that's one of the things we've talked about a lot. We still believe this is a great thing for consumers really being able to put together different packages in a way, so paying one way and clearly one of the things too is us having more control over the cash makes it much easier if a refund is needed. To be doing it for one thing, instead of a customer having to deal with refund from their Air, from their hotel, from their car, maybe other things that are attractions they didn't -- all different people I talk to try and get refund from. By doing it in one package, Connected Trip with us, through our merchant payment platform, we'll be able to give much better value both in the time when they buy it and even if they have to deal with getting a refund. So that's more important. And David, I'll let you talk about ADRs and what you think. -- Yeah, sure. Thanks, Justin. So, historically both ADRs and length of stay has been a little shorter for domestic travel because people's longer trips have been international and therefore they have been going toward higher ADR, longer length of stay. Now, to the extent those international trips get moved back into the advancing marketplace, that distinction may actually not be as great because if the domestic marketplace was generally more short term oriented, and that mix shift becomes more of the place that people want to go for their longer major vacations etc, that may not be as big a factor as it was before. And there's really no difference to take rates. -- Great, thank you.Thank you, your next response is from Daniel Powell of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I may. First is, kind of to build on the question around the timing of advertising and when you decide to sort of step back on the gas, I guess sort of, what are you looking for sort of indicate when would be a good time to step in and what would your expectation be around ROIs if there has been somewhat of a vacuum created from hotels and other partners, perhaps not being as able or willing to spend when things start to look a bit -- a little bit better? And then the second question, you mentioned maintaining good relationships with your suppliers. Wondering if you could sort of give us a sense of during the global financial crisis, what did your relationships -- what your access to inventory look like coming out of that environment versus what you might expect in this one. Thanks. -- Sure. So regarding the brand advertising and I'm sure you'll forgive me for saying that I really don't want to give away exactly when we'll put on the gas and what the signals are so our competitors can then get a jump on that day, and I'm sure you'll understand that. Look, it is important, though, for us to feel that we are going to be effective in using that brand advertising and going through, and as the question earlier about -- there's a lot of things that we can do, desktop now and be able to put out what is -- have video, have brand, and have performance through video channels then you can start seeing some better response and a better sense of what your ROIs are, not being able to move, bit more selective in how you use that. And I think we're going to definitely be pushing that way.In regards to the supply relationships and the Great Recession as a model going forward, we were very pleased to see that -- and this is why we feel comfortable and confident to talk about how a deep recession can be helpful to distributors because in the past, the suppliers leaned in heavily into distributors who had demand but for the obvious reason that if you're a hotel and you're running 40% or 30% occupancy rate you need to get that demand and we're here to provide it to them. So that helps build that better relationship and I do think that's what you're going to see going forward and I do agree, I think that some of them may not be doing as much brand advertising, perhaps as they were in the past and that could be due to cash constraints and other things where they need to make sure they're maintaining a certain amount of cash flow. -- Great. Appreciate it.Thank you, your next response is from Lee Horowitz of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Great. And thanks for taking the question. Given the moves you guys have made with your balance sheet, and shoring things up in obviously depressed private and public valuations, I'm wondering how you're thinking about your potential ability to be a acquirer of assets across the travel space during this crisis given your strong balance sheet. -- Well, we like -- we always like having a strong balance sheet for many reasons, that being one of them. And of course valuations as we know have changed drastically but they've changed drastically for a reason. And so the risk factor has significantly increased than it was a short time ago. So our -- the way we approach acquiring assets or any type of acquisition, it is always the same, which is we measure in terms of what will it add to our business, or the franchise to help consumers and partners, what is going to be great. What do we think about management? Do we think they're great? Do we think they can help us or not? And if not, can we operate this in ways without that management team? This is something that we've always -- we've built our company through M&A, as you know and we're going to continue to look out for that. But we recognize that this is a sloppy time and we have to be careful and picky in terms of what we do because the risk factors are much higher now. And David, you want to talk anything more about the balance sheet or no? -- No. -- All right.Okay. Our final question is from James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities. -- Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. So really appreciate all the data points on March and April, obviously somewhat limited. But I wanted to take a step back, was curious if you guys have done some consumer work. It seems like you're in a unique position to sort of understand what types of travel, consumers are most likely to reengage in the soonest. Obviously there's air travel, hotels, restaurants, vacation homes, apartments even car rental, all of which you guys have your -- a piece of. How are you thinking about which of those are most likely to resume normality the quickest? -- Well, what we've seen is, the hotel area -- and David talked a little bit about what we've seen in that, a lot of areas is still extremely limited whether by government restrictions, or If you look to certain countries or the amount of flights and times available and people just in general are fearful about getting on a plane right now, and you may have seen, for example, the Ryanair data that just came out. In Europe, Ryanair has bid bellwether for air travel in Europe in April. It was essentially almost nothing, really almost nothing. And that's, unfortunately what we've seen in other parts of the world, extremely low amount of air travel. But this all will go somewhat together as people feel more comfortable about how the entire situation is, it's the vaccine you talk about, it's a treatment perhaps and it's also in their economic situation, all those things. So I think what we'll see as things start coming back, yes, some things will be the other one, I think overall it will all come back pretty -- very similar. -- Got it. And then last question for me, if I may, it sounds like you're not quite ready to give any sort of a monthly cash burn number just given some of the expense optimization is still going on. But maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes. You've got about $1 billion of deferred merchant bookings. How quickly is that coming down? Are there timing differences between when you provide refunds to customers versus when you're getting those refunds from the hotels? And then, can you help us with an interest number given the transactions that's taking place? -- Thank you, James. Maybe I'll wrap up with this one. So, we haven't given a cash flow projection for the year. We did give you an indication as to kind of what our cash position would look like at the end of 2021 before we did our bond offering because we have significantly over $4.1 billion more than that. So we're not going to get to a monthly burn. We walked you through the changes to our balance sheet for working capital movements in Q1. Those balances will continue to reduce until we start to get travel demand occurring once again. I think the best way to handle this is once we've really gone through our optimization plans and we've decided when we're going to reset our cost base to, at that point in time, we'll give you more color as to where we are. I do not have an interest rate number for you off the top of my head, but we can follow up with everybody to follow up with that one. -- Okay, fair enough. Appreciate it.Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Glenn Fogel. -- Thank you. Now I understand there was a technical difficulty and some of the last part of my speech -- my prepared remarks were cut-off and I think what's actually works out well because the last two paragraphs are actually a nice way to close this off. So let me just close out all for everyone. We know the progress against the pandemic is going to be disruptive at times as relaxation of social distancing in some geographies may lead to a resurgence of infections and a reinstatement of government restrictions. Our aim is to optimize the business to participate in the ultimate return of demand, manage our expenses in light of our best estimate of the shape of that return, invest in our business to build on our leadership position in the industry and serve our customers, employees and partners and build shareholder value going forward. We have a tough road ahead of us and we have been through many difficult recession in the past, the last few weeks and we're going to have some in the future, for weeks to months and quarters to come. The pay scale and impact of COVID-19 is unprecedented but we know one day, we will be on the other side and we are doing everything we can to ensure we are well positioned to navigate through these challenging times.We have a confidence that with a highly variable cost structure, strong cash and liquidity, great global brand awareness and some of the best people anywhere, we are well positioned to come out of this crisis and extend our leadership role in the global travel ecosystem. I'm going to close by giving a heartfelt thank you to all the employees, our customers, our partners and the governments as we work through these difficult days together and to our employees, I have never been more proud of you and your enormous efforts to support our customers, partners everywhere. We know there will be more tough days ahead, not just for us but for so many people in industries all over the world. I am confident we will get through it. And lastly, I want to say thank you to all the frontline workers out there, the doctors and nurses, the scientists trying to come up with a cure or vaccine, the delivery people, the people making sure there will be food in the stores, basically to everybody at their job that is designated as critical. To all of you working night and day to help our world get through this, thank you from all of us at Booking Holdings.

I didn't think of a name to call you this time, Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. Just call me Old Nutsy, that's it.Old Nutsy?! [laughs] Anyway, hi, Bro. In this week's episode, we're joined by Motley Fool contributor Brian Feroldi. He's here to answer the most common questions he's hearing from concerned individual investors on how to act during the financial fallout from COVID-19. All that and more on this week's episode of .Well, how we've been starting our episodes lately is to talk about the week that was, because there has been -- always a lot of interesting financial things going on. And so Bro is actually going to take the lead, but before he starts, open up his yap, let's introduce Brian Feroldi. Brian, how are you? Guys, I'm getting called up to the big leagues. ? What? How? I get to chat with Alison and Bro. You flatter us. And, Bro, whatever. That's the way most people feel. Alison! And Bro... and for a good reason. Brian, where are you coming to us from today? Sunny Rhode Island is where I call home base. I had no idea you were from Rhode Island. Does that make me better or worse in your mind? Bro, I think we should have talked about this beforehand. I don't know, do we have people from Rhode Island on the show? Sure. Some of my favorite people are from Rhode Island, so I'm happy to have Brian Feroldi. Guess what, Brian? You're my only \"people\" from Rhode Island. You're the only person I know. Your only one? Yeah, you're the only person I know from Rhode Island. So longtime Fool Selena. Selena Maranjian.Selena Maranjian, that's right, she lives in Rhode Island. Seth MacFarlane of , of course. Seth MacFarlane, yeah, Chuck Saletta, another Fool, and of course, Tom Gardner went to college at Brown in Providence, Rhode Island. But do we have any postcards? That's the real question. Yes, I'm sure we have some postcards that have come in from Rhode Island; I'm pretty sure. Well, I think. I would like to talk about anything other than what the markets did today, if we're spending this much time talking about Rhode Island, [laughs] but I guess we should get to it. But, Brian, why don't you first tell us a little bit about how you came to become a contributor with The Motley Fool? Sure. So I've been reading The Fool's content for about 15 years or so, got started off with just, you know, the old  back in yesteryear. And then I became a paying subscriber myself about 10 years ago, and I was just spending pretty much all of my free time [laughs] on The Motley Fool's discussion boards, this is where my passion lies. And then five years ago, I was afforded the opportunity to become a writer, and I've been doing that, kind of, ever since. And they brought me on because my expertise was in the healthcare space, I worked for a medical device company for 10 years. So I kind of help with the healthcare side of things. And I personally invest a lot in technology stocks, so I hang my hat mostly in healthcare and technology-land. Right. Very apropos, probably, for our conversation later on. So Bro, why don't you take it away and tell us what happened this last week? Because again, I don't understand the stock market, apparently. [laughs] Well, I can understand why you'd say that, because I'm going to begin this by quoting Dickens: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" So just a reminder, everyone, we're coming to you from the past. We're taping this on Friday, April 10, so who knows what the helicopter is going on by the time you're hearing this, dear listener.But as for this week, it was quite a good week for the stock market. So the S&P 500 was up 12.1%, its best week since 1974. Looking at just since the peak of the market on Feb. 19, the S&P 500 is down just 17.6%; for the year, it's down just 13.6%. And I know, in most years we would say being down by that much is disappointing, but considering that we were down 34% on March 23, it's quite surprising.Looking at the Nasdaq, Nasdaq is down 16.9% since the peak but down just 9.1% for the year.Going to Russell 2000 Index of small caps, small caps got hit pretty hard, they're still down 26.5% since the peak, but last week, they were up almost 20%. One of the best weeks for small caps ever.Looking at international stocks -- we're just going to look at the  -- they're down a little over 20% for the year.And as for bonds, bonds really ended last week very well -- or I should say, this week; last week, when you're listening to this -- because the Fed came in, announced a whole new program worth $2.3 trillion. Increased lending to mid-size businesses, but they're going into the bond market and, for the first time ever, buying junk bonds. So I actually have very mixed feelings about that, but regardless, the Fed is going up and buying up all kinds of bonds.So the bond market went a little haywire for a couple of weeks in March, but now it's up 6% for the year. So for those who kept that money safe and dry, they're pretty happy.So why is all this happening? Why is the market going up despite -- Yeah, why, why? Yeah. Well, of course, no one really knows, but I would say if I had to take a guess, it's two things. First of all, the government on all levels, including the Fed, has demonstrated that they will do just about anything to get us through this crisis. I think that's heartened a lot of people. And also, some of the news on the health front is encouraging. So hospitalizations are going down in New York. Number of beds and ICUs being used is going down. Tony Fauci said that the final number, in terms of fatalities due to COVID, may actually come in around 60,000, lower than that original 100,000 to 200,000 estimate.So there's just some sort of light at the end of the tunnel that people may be banking on here. And it all brings to mind a line from Rob Arnott, who is the founder of asset management firm Research Affiliates, who said, \"The strongest bull markets are not built on a foundation of good news, but on diminishing bad news.\" So that might be what's happening here.That said, this could be just your standard bear-market rally. And it happens often during long bear markets, where the market does go up for a little while, but then it comes back down. I don't know if that's going to happen at this point, but we certainly have a lot of bad news, more ahead of us.Which brings us to the worst of times. So an additional 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment. That brings the total claims to almost 17 million. In other words, the U.S. workforce has lost 10% of its jobs in just three weeks, and we're going to continue seeing that for the near future. And while the government is willing to help out in terms of paying additional unemployment claims, giving loans to businesses, the rollout has been difficult, many people having trouble getting those loans, many people having trouble getting their unemployment benefits. So there's a lot of stumbling going on with that.Relatedly, at least in terms of what the government is doing, there are a couple of developments. We've all heard about the payments from the CARES Act, which the government is calling economic impact payments, they're going to start rolling out this week. And they've created a website for people who don't file taxes to get those payments, and very soon they're going to create another website where you can put in your direct deposit information or update your address if you don't have that already on file with the IRS.The place to go is . Go to that, and you'll see updates, but so if you're worried about if you're going to get your payment or not, visit the site, and it might be able to provide some updated information.Some other interesting good news is that 10 insurance companies have said they're going to offer rebates to people, in basically recognizing that we're not driving very much anymore and we're kind of overpaying for our car insurance. So the big names -- GEICO, ,  -- it's going to automatically show up in your next bill, that's good news.And if you're actually buying anything these days, chances are it's costing you less, the Labor Department said today that the consumer price index dropped 0.4% last month; that's the biggest drop since 2015. As you would guess, the biggest drop is due to gas, hotel, apparel, airline tickets, stuff like that.For the last 12 months, inflation came in at 1.5%, down from 2.3% a year ago. Just anecdotally, the family and I drove on to the hills of Virginia to take a hike a few days ago and saw gas for $1.50 a gallon. So as we said in a previous show, if you have funds and you're looking to make a big purchase -- car, appliances, or something like that -- you might actually get a pretty good deal these days.And that, Alison, is what was up this week. You know, it's funny. I remember in the good old days, when the market was in a bear market for over a decade and companies would report their earnings, but then their stock would still drop because they didn't report as good of earnings as analysts had hoped for. I wonder if -- because earnings season is right around the corner. Isn't it coming up here in April? -- I wonder if it's going to be like, earnings reports are awful, but they're not as awful as analysts had expected; therefore [laughs] their stock price is going to skyrocket. Maybe not skyrocket, but at least not take a hit.Yet another reminder that the stock market is not the economy. [laughs] So there you go. On that note, Alison, one of our longtime  writers, Seth Jayson, has long said, \"You could give me tomorrow's news ahead of time and I still couldn't predict stock price movements,\" for the exact reason you just said. The numbers are going to be bad, let's just accept that, but are they going to be as bad as Wall Street is expecting? We don't know. And if that's the case, stocks might go up. This is why investing in the short term is basically impossible. Thank you again for joining us on this week's episode. There's a reason why we wanted to have you. And that's because you have been very busy as a contributor for Motley Fool, kind of being on the front lines of talking to our readers, talking to our members, hearing what their concerns and thoughts are as far as being investors today. And so we thought we would have you on to, sort of, sum up what are the most common questions you're getting, and then, obviously, offer an answer, because this wouldn't be a very helpful show if all we did was ask questions. [laughs] It's kind of in the title of the show, don't you think? It is kind of in the title of the show, it is a promise we make. But I will say more often now, I feel like I just don't have any answers. And so, really, we should just name the show, \"Questions\" and then shrug, and go, I don't know, the stock market. But, anyway.So Brian, thank you again for joining us, and should we just get into some of your questions that you're seeing? Yeah, sure. And just to bring everybody up on speed, so The Motley Fool has basically put on a   livestream for almost the last month. And we've invited all of our subscribers to kind of join us on there, and we have a huge range of contributors that, kind of, take different sections. And throughout each one, we're basically asking those that are watching for questions where we're answering the most common questions.So that's why I'm on the front lines, so to say, is that I've been on, like, four hours a day of this livestream, because I just love it, it's just such an amazing educational tool, and it lets you connect with people in a way that you just can't when you're writing articles and sending them out into the world.So yeah, the livestream, I absolutely love it, but to get to -- This episode will be a bit of CliffsNotes for [laughs] listening to the livestream. So if you're a The Motley Fool member you're still welcome to go listen to the livestream, but we're going to cover the big questions here. So let's start with the first one that you're hearing a lot of, which is, should I invest in __________, by which I mean, insert any number of different company names here. Yeah, and we've been getting the same companies over and over and over again. And these companies have been in the news a lot. So the No. 1 question we've been getting recently is, \"Should I invest in ?\" which is, unfortunately, a China-based coffeemaker that basically said last week that they were cooking the books. They inflated their revenue significantly.And this one really stung, because it was actually a Motley Fool recommendation. And when they announced that, the stock dropped 80% in a single day. And there's no doubt a lot of people really got hurt with Luckin Coffee. So tons of questions about Luckin Coffee. But does it boggle your mind that you're like, this stock proved out to be fraudulent? Are you really asking me if you want to invest in a company that was, like you said, cooking the books? Or are people just so hungry for a value, [laughs] they just want to get a piece of that one? Well, I think a lot of people, unfortunately, this is their first experience with this kind of shenanigans, and it's obviously gut-wrenching to see an investment you make drop by 80% in a single day. So they want to know what we think, what they should do with it? And in the premium services of The Fool that has recommended those, we have issued guidance for what to do. But no doubt that this is a company that's on the top of everybody's mind.And there's actually been a couple of other Chinese companies, even since then, have come out and also admitted to wrongdoing. So sad time, unfortunately, for a number of Chinese-based companies that are listed on American exchanges. Yeah. What are some other companies that you're hearing a lot of questions about from investors? So if I was to say, No. 1, definitely Luckin. No. 2, and it's a close tie, is Zoom Video Communications. I mean, not only has this been one of the best-performing stocks year to date, they came out and they basically said \"the number of users that we've had, the number of meetings, has increased by 20X this quarter.\" 20X. It went from 10 million to 200 million. Which shouldn't be all that surprising given what we're all going through right now. But this has been a red-hot stock.And then, of course, over the last couple weeks, we've seen numerous concerns about -- what about the security problems? Can I use Zoom? Is Zoom a good stock to buy? etc. So just another stock that has been in the news for good reason. And our members really have questions about Zoom. Yeah. And then, another stock that I assume has seen a big bump because of the coronavirus is , which is remote doctors, right? Remote doctors, done, that's it.-- where you chat with the doctor. This is one of Jason Moser's favorite companies, road-to-growth stocks, and it provides face-to-face video conferencing with a doctor, so it skips the need to go to a waiting room. Obviously, a very attractive service in general, but the usage of this product is likely skyrocketing right now.And the final company that I'll just call out, that we've gotten a lot of questions about, is . Boeing has been going through a huge number of problems unrelated to coronavirus before this, and the coronavirus has since accelerated this company's problems.So no surprise to see these four companies, which have been in the news a lot, these are top of mind for our members. Yeah. What's your general advice when people are asking you, should I invest in this X company?Yeah. So Boeing is not a company I followed or cared about before this, and still, it's not even close to being on my radar. Zoom was a company that I liked a lot before this happened. I always was held back by the valuation. The valuation of this company was very high even before it went on to basically double in 2019.I'm a bit of a contrarian. When I see huge investor interest in a company, it kind of diminishes my interest in it, because it says, like, \"Wow, this company is getting so much attention right now from people and rightly so for good reason.\" So I've just personally kept away, but Zoom is a very high-quality company and there are a lot of people at The Motley Fool that really like it, and I completely understand why. Same goes for Teladoc.Luckin is, kind of, its own unique situation, where basically, again, they basically came out and said, \"Yep. Don't trust our books. We cooked the numbers; our revenue is extremely inflated.\" So that wasn't a company I covered before and don't really have any interest in covering it now. So I can't be helpful on that one, in particular. Yeah. So we had a funny conversation with my mother-in-law over the weekend, because an aunt decided that she was going to invest in Zoom because of this hype around Zoom and everyone is using Zoom and they're going to use Zoom. And you know, what did we think about that? And I was like, well, you know, we use Zoom, it is a recommendation of The Motley Fool, it was a recommendation before it really hit the headlines as being the software everyone is using to communicate now. But, you know, if I were to invest in Zoom now, I would still want to be holding it for 5, 10 years down the road. I would want to invest in companies that I believe in beyond coronavirus.And what's funny is that our aunt ended up buying Zoom and then selling it two weeks later. [laughs] I was, like, \"Oh, man, we need to sit her down and have a talk.\" Yes. So that wouldn't be investing in Zoom, that would be hoping to make a quick buck on Zoom, which is, unfortunately, when companies are really in the news. You see a lot of that, you see a lot of people that they're investing for the first time and they don't know what to do, but they've heard on CNBC or their simple logic is, \"Zoom must be doing great right now, I'll buy it.\" And so, that I think is a big reason why we're seeing the share pop, price go up so much.Now, I will say, a lot of people are using Zoom for the first time and I'm a true believer that habits are changing, and I think that people will be much more likely to use Zoom one year from now, three years from now, five years from now because of COVID-19. Same with Teladoc. So I do think that these companies will have not only short-term benefits but long-term benefits from the COVID-19 crisis, so that is something that does make me more bullish on both of their businesses over the long term. Whether or not that justifies their valuation today is a completely different matter, but the businesses themselves, I think, will see permanent increases from this. Yeah. All right, let's move on to the next question that you're hearing a lot of. And Bro touched on this at the top of the show, but when is the bottom? Did it already happen? I don't know. Again, this is exactly [laughs] why investing and trying to figure out where prices are going in the short term is so unbelievably hard. You know, it's been pointed out many times, if you look back to the last crisis, when was the bottom? March 9, 2009. What were the news that came out on March 9 or March 10, 2009? I guarantee you it was bad. It was bad economic news that probably featured huge job losses and stories about businesses going under left and right.The tricky thing for us is, you never know when a bottom is until well after it happens. So we always advise people: Don't try and focus on timing the market, you will never get in at the exact bottom. Focus your attention on finding investments that you like that you would be happy to own at the price today. And mentally tell yourself ahead of time, \"I'm not getting in at the bottom. This company could drop 20% from today's price.\" And as long as you're OK with it, get invested. Yeah. Do you find that Fools are asking you when is the bottom because they want to get the lowest price possible for the stock, or are they asking when is the bottom because they are scared about their portfolio as a whole? Yeah, both. I think it's a little bit of both. And, again, it's very natural. If this is your first time really going through a crisis or really getting interested in the market, it's natural to want to ask somebody that's been doing it for a while, \"Well, when's the bottom? Obviously you know.\" It just makes sense that people that look at this all day, like we do, would know when the bottom is. But I'm here to tell you, nobody knows when the bottom is. I mean, if Bro doesn't know, who could know, right? Bro, Bro, do you know? I don't know, but if I may add another question that's related to that; because I've done some of these livestreams too. Now that the market has popped up 20% or so since the bottom, now people are asking, \"Is it too late to get back in?\"And many of us, myself included, had some cash on the side, gradually putting some of the money in, but not putting all of it in. And then people are like, \"Oh, no, did I miss the bottom?\" So I'll answer it, and then, Brian, you can tell me how you would answer it. And the question is, I don't know.If I had to say, one way or the other, do I think the market is going to go down again? I would say, probably, yes, but just because of the really bad news we have coming out. On the other hand, it is quite possible that, because the cause of this downturn is well known and that won't be with us forever, that we may have put in the bottom. But I think any money that you put in today, five years from now, you'll be happy you did, because stocks still are down pretty considerably, and some parts of the market are still down really considerably. Like I said, small caps are still down 25%. I think if you were to buy in small caps today, five years now, you'd be happy you did. Yeah. When it comes to this kind of stuff, Alison, I am personally a big advocate of investing mechanically on a schedule that you make up ahead of time. And what I mean by that is, rather than trying to time the market and pick the bottom, say to yourself, OK -- let's say you have $1,000 to invest. Say, \"I'm going to invest $100 today and I'm either going to invest another $100 in some time period -- say two weeks -- or I'm going to add $100 from a 5% decline in the market from today's prices.\"And that way you are taking the decision of when and you're deciding it ahead of time. So come up with rules for yourself that are either based on time or on percentage drawdowns in the market, and stick to that schedule. That way, you won't feel like you completely mistimed it, but you'll also make sure that you do get your money invested in a rather timely fashion.I mean, everybody at The Motley Fool, I think, is a big fan of dollar-cost averaging, investing the same amount of money into your 401(k) or the market month-in and month-out. The reason that that works is because you get to take advantage of dips, you're buying when things are low, and you're buying slightly less when prices are high.So my advice is, always take your lizard brain out of the investing process, come up with rules for yourself, and then follow those rules. All right. Another question you're getting that's along the same lines is, \"When will it be 'safe' to invest again?\" So this sounds like this is coming from people who are nervous. Yeah. Again, same thing, people want to know when is this crisis going to be over, when is the market going to go back to \"normal\"? I say that in air quotes, because I don't know that the market is ever behaving normally. But, again, it ties into the same issue. Is now a good time, or have we bottomed? Is the crisis finally over? And, again, I have no ability to predict such things, which is why, again, I'm such a big fan of just doing it on a mechanical schedule that you set up. So Bro, when do you think, when's it going to be safe to invest again? I don't know. And I would say, again, if -- Boo! This show is called . Boo! Get off the stage. Yeah. So what can I say? The golden rule, as far as I'm concerned when it comes to investing, is any money you need in the next three years shouldn't be in the market, any money you don't need in the next three years, keep it in the market. And history says, 80%, 90%, 100% of the time, depending on how long you have, you're going to make money.So I agree with Brian that there's never a normal time when it comes to investing, but we are going through an abnormal time in our society, right? We're all at home. We're working from home. Restaurants aren't open. No one is traveling. But that will change, and that will change before this year is over, I think. So given that the stock market always rebounds faster than the economy, you can't wait too long before things get back to an upward trajectory, as, really, we've already seen for a couple weeks now. I always like to remind myself, what happened in the 20 century, right? The 20 century, this amazing period of progress, yet we fought how many world wars? How many presidents were shot at? How many...? Like, the Bay of Pigs, there was a Cuban Missile Crisis, there was so much bad stuff that happened in the 20 century. And yet, if you invested throughout the entire period, boy! did you make a lot of money at the end. So there's never a perfect safe time to invest. We say, just stay invested throughout good times and in bad, and it'll likely work out very well in the long run. Yeah. So I was reading through your questions that you said were the most common ones. And I'm like, \"Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay.\" And then this next one came up, and I was like, \"Wait! What?!\" [laughs] And so now I have a feeling that this question snuck in because of your tech bias, but maybe I'm wrong.So the next question is, \"What are some 5G stocks?\" Are you really getting that question all the time on the livestream? I am shocked how often people want to know about 5G stocks. And is it safe to assume that people know what 5G is? I just know that there's a conspiracy theory out there that 5G is what gave us coronavirus and somehow it controls you, and that's really all I know, so. That is 5G; you are an expert. [laughs] There we go. It sounds like a hot investment tip. Mind control. So 5G is the next coming wave of cellular connectivity. So the current \"G\" that we have is fourth generation. And 5G is basically going to increase the download speeds to smartphones and mobile devices dramatically. And I can't tell -- I honestly didn't want to include this question, because I don't have a great answer to it, it's just that we keep getting it, \"What are some 5G stocks?\" And it kind of made me want to do some research, because I was like, wow! There's obviously an interest in this.And full disclosure, I have not invested in either of the companies I'm about to name, but just to put some out there, because, again, there's so much interest in it.One 5G stock that I will call out is , the ticker symbol there is AMT. This is a Real Estate Investment Trust that owns the actual physical towers that the telecommunication sits on. They don't own the equipment, they actually lease out space on their equipment to the s, the s, the s of the world. And it's a very consistent cash-generation business that has been a fantastic long-term investment. So if you think that 5G is going to be a big deal, odds are pretty good that a company like American Tower is going to benefit from it.One other one that I will throw out there is . Skyworks is a maker of chips that, kind of, power cell phone and mobile device connectivity. They're a big supplier to, like,  and , for example. So if you own an iPhone or an iPad, you've bought Skyworks' products even though you didn't use it. So Skyworks has been a really great long-term investment because they've ridden that wave of iPhone demand higher. And what impresses me about them is they've actually been able to maintain their profitability, which is a big thing to say about someone that relies on Apple as a customer.So again, not personal recommendations, but if you're interested in 5G, I would check out Skyworks, SWKS; and American Tower, AMT. All right. And the last question that you're getting a lot of is, \"Can we invest in airlines/cruise lines?\" So I assume these stocks have all taken a massive hit, and that's why people are wondering, huh? Yeah, you can say that, yes. And, again, huge interest in just cruise lines, in general, airlines, in general. They see the headlines about these companies that are in big-time trouble. And the government is stepping in, I know, to save the airline industry.My answer to that is that I personally did not like the airline industry or the cruise line industry as investments beforehand. So I have no interest in any of these companies now that their businesses are all in serious trouble. In a big way, we're depending on the government to take some sort of action in some cases to save these businesses, so that tells me that it's probably not a great place for shareholders to keep their money long-term, but I understand the interest.If I was to play the airline or the cruise industry, I would highly suggest people check out either , BKNG, or , EXPE, as a set instead. So Booking owns a number of leading search brands, such as, Booking.com, Priceline, Kayak.com, Rentalcars, OpenTable, and it's a portal that you go through to book airlines, to book cruises, to book hotels.Expedia owns Expedia, Hotwire, Orbitz, Travelocity, CheapTickets, Vrbo, etc. So both of those companies have been crushed alongside with the airlines and cruises, but to me, they are far superior business models than what an airline or cruise operator is. So those companies do not need governments to save them, and they were wonderful long-term investments before this crisis.So if you're interested in airlines or cruises, you might want to check out the booking sites instead.I'll just add that when I've been looking for what to buy during this downturn, I've been thinking about businesses that are good, solid, long-term businesses but that have been hit particularly hard. So I thought about airlines, in particular, . But then I also looked at the holdings of the mutual funds that I own in our Fool 401(k), and I found that a lot of them already own a good bit of airlines as well as some of these. So you might want to look at what's inside any of your mutual funds, index funds, ETFs, because you might already have some decent exposure to some of these companies.And I did not consider the cruise lines at all, because that is a situation where I'm just going to be very curious how long it's going to take for them to recover, because I think a lot of people are going to be reluctant to take cruises for a while. Yeah. Well, we had this exact same conversation, my husband and I are like, \"Wow! maybe we should invest in something related to travel,\" and we're, like, \"Okay, an airline?\" And we are just, like, \"Ugh! Southwest?\" Like, I mean, it's hard to invest in these companies that you don't love as a consumer. And the same thing goes with the cruise line, like, we're not cruise people, so we're like, ugh! And we kind of landed at the same place you did, we're like, \"I guess, maybe we'll invest in Booking...\" We like to travel, but that's a tough one, so, anyway. Yeah. The companies that own the physical assets, the airlines and cruise ships, those are capital-intensive businesses. So they rely on lots of debt, typically, to buy those things. By comparison, Booking and Expedia, they run websites. That's just a generally much more capital-efficient business. Yeah. All right, OK, so that covers it for the questions. Is there any other big question that we want to end on here, Brian/Bro? No. I asked earlier about whether it was too late to get back in. Alison, I got something. So I just mentioned how I'm deciding to put my cash to work. Brian, have you been buying during this downturn, and if you have been, you don't have to name specific companies, but what's your just general frame of mind in terms of making those decisions? Yeah, it's the same as it was before the crisis. I try to look for the highest-quality companies that I possibly can that I think will have substantially higher revenue 5 and 10 years from now, and then I do my best to pay an attractive price for them. So the coronavirus has definitely increased the number of businesses that are trading at far more attractive prices than they were, but nothing that I've done has fundamentally changed. I still add money to my brokerage account every single month, and I still look for the best use of my capital that I can.So I have not really changed anything that I do because of this. Brian, thank you so much for coming on and sharing your answers to questions. We did provide the answers. It wasn't just all questions.All right. I'm going to go first this week for Foolish recommendations. Let's see, so far, I have recommended podcasts, and I don't even remember what else I've recommended. But today I'm going to recommend some of my favorite mobile games, because I do love playing a good puzzle game on my phone. Other people, kind of, like to play, like, , like, games or war attacking games or I don't even know, I don't even know all the names for games. But I like a sit-down-and-figure-a-puzzle-out game.So the games that I'm going to recommend are  which are very popular; there's two of them. Basically, a visual spatial puzzle game. , which is a hilarious game, where it's a raccoon trying to take over Los Angeles by making these big holes in the ground, and you have to keep having bigger and bigger stuff fall into the hole as the whole grows; it's hilarious, it's adorable. A very peaceful game is , where a tree, it's like a cherry blossom tree, is growing, and you have to prune just the right branches to get the tree to grow in the direction that you want it to and then bloom. It's very relaxing.And then for those of you who want a tougher puzzle game, I'm going to recommend . It's a really cool-looking game where you point and go places and solve little puzzles, and it's wonderful. It's a game that I have not finished because I don't want it to end, I love it so much.So those are my recommendations for some mobile games: ,,, and .Luminosity. That's what I thought too. Well, I know, but it's two words,.I agree, it's a good game. I'll just add on to that real quick. I've been playing a lot of board games online. A particular board game will have an app, but if you're into board gaming, you may know that already, but there's also sites like  and , and there's other ones out there that will host board games online. Some of them automate everything for you and some of them it's just a virtual desktop where you, kind of, put a virtual board out there and you have to be able to play it. And there's one where even, if you get mad, you can flip the table upside-down.So virtual board-gaming, if you don't already know about it -- I'm sure everybody knows about all of these things already -- but I recommend it, it's a lot of fun and you could use Zoom at the same time, so you can have a chat with your friends. I'll throw out a free game you guys may have heard of: . My son got me into last year, and I now play it way more than he does. He has since moved on, but I play it pretty much every day. It is by far my favorite video game of all time. And again, free, and it still exists. So . [laughs] [laughs] , it still exists. It still exists. For board games, my family loves playing Dominion, which is a card deck-building game. And I assure you, even my kindergartener can play that one, so that's a good one that's entertaining for all ages.For the book side, Alison, you asked me to bring recommendations, so I brought all kinds. You brought them. Yeah, you weren't sure when we would have you back, so you got to get them all out there. That's right. I don't know if you guys have ever heard of an author named Alexander Green, but he has written probably two of my favorite books that I've read in the last five years that are my absolute favorite. So this first is called  and the second is called . He's a former investment and money manager, and he actually writes about the good things in life, so not just money but how to have a rich life. They are extremely readable books. I just so enjoy them and can't recommend them enough. And he's not a name I've ever heard before until I found his books. So an unsung hero in the business financial world, Alexander Green.And then for podcasts, I just listened to  this week, which is the story about Theranos. Yeah, that's a good one. That's a great podcast. Even though I've seen the movie, I just love the podcast. I mean, it's such a fascinating story. And then I'll throw in there too. I don't know if you guys have ever listened to , the podcast. The first episode is all about the mafia in Rhode Island in the 1960s. It is a phenomenal, phenomenal story; it's so entertaining. So that's .And then a couple of my favorite YouTube channels. I don't know if you guys have ever heard of . But it's a guy that is building a machine that uses marbles to play music, and it's taken him about three years, and he's almost done. If you like -- Oh, I just saw Rick's ears pricked up when he heard that: marbles to make music. Yeah. This guy is unbelievable, unbelievable. He's, literally, three years into this project. And if you like engineering and music, I guarantee you will like this channel. So it's W-I-N-T-E-R-G-A-T-A-N. And then the final one -- More screen time for my kids. There you go. Hey, it's engineering, it's educational, right? And then the final one is -- if you like chess like I do -- there is a grandmaster named Hikaru Nakamura, and he recently did a speed run where he plays the absolute worst possible opening and then he just blasts people into oblivion while barely paying attention. It is so entertaining to watch somebody that is that good at something just blow through people like me who are chess aficionados but still are nowhere close to his skill level. [laughs] That's awesome! Those are some great recommendations. Bro, you got to take us to a big finish. All right. Well, I don't know if I got a big finish, but I do have a song recommendation just based on our conversation. Brian, I'll be curious if you know it. \"Rhode Island Is Famous for You,\" are you familiar with this song by Blossom Dearie? Most of us, if any of us, know Blossom Dearie from singing the  from Schoolhouse Rock. So she was big in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. I love that song. No, Bro, I don't think I remember it. Why don't you sing a couple of bars? Right now. Go ahead. Maybe if you sing it, I'll figure it out. Yeah. \"Unpack Your Adjectives.\" That's it, there you go. You know that song.

Oil and natural gas prices have fallen dramatically from much higher levels in the early 2010s, with crude in particular having fallen from triple-digit levels to just over $20 per barrel. That's had a huge impact on many exploration and production companies, pushing some of them to the brink of failure. has been one of the hardest hit stocks in the energy sector, with shares down more than 99.5% since late 2014. With the stock trading at just $0.14 per share recently, Chesapeake has decided to resort to what for many companies proves to be a last-gasp effort to stay financially viable: doing a reverse stock split. The move should ensure that  on the New York Stock Exchange for now, but it raises the more important question of whether it'll actually help the company regain its former stature as a leader in the industry.Chesapeake announced that it would do a 1-for-200 reverse stock split. What that means is that for every 200 shares of Chesapeake stock investors currently own, they'll receive just a single share back. Theoretically, after the reverse split is complete, the per-share price of the stock should be 200 times greater than it was previously. So an old $0.14 per share price should translate to new shares at $28 each.Image source: Chesapeake Energy.Economically, splits shouldn't have any real impact on the overall value of the company. In Chesapeake's case, the oil and gas producer has about 1.94 billion shares outstanding, for a market cap of around $270 million. After the reverse split is complete, Chesapeake will have just 9.7 million shares left. Keep the market cap constant and do the math, and you get right around $28 per share.The immediate reason for Chesapeake to do a reverse stock split involves exchange listing requirements. Companies have to keep a share price above $1 in order to meet NYSE guidelines, and so the reverse stock split will get Chesapeake's shares up well over the $1 mark.What often happens, though, is that a stock that does a reverse split merely keeps falling in value. One reason is that it's difficult for short-sellers betting against a stock to borrow shares when the price is low, but it's easier once share prices return to more typical levels. By enabling a new round of short selling, reverse stock splits can ironically accelerate a stock's decline.However, there are a few instances in which companies have used reverse stock splits to their advantage, buying time to recover. One of the biggest is , which did a 1-for-6 reverse split in its former name of Priceline Group back in 2003. The online travel giant had suffered greatly during the dot-com bust, but the company has roared back, climbing from its post-split level of $22 per share to trade at $1,450 even after seeing big losses in the coronavirus bear market.Yet even when reverse stock splits are successful, companies rarely get back to their full former glory. Discount brokerage specialist  and private prison operator  did reverse splits, and their shares gained ground following the moves. However, neither stock is anywhere near returning to the share prices they commanded before their respective moves.Unfortunately for Chesapeake, avoiding delisting is the least of its problems. Rock-bottom oil prices have made it extremely difficult for the oil and gas producer to generate revenue, and it only has months before it needs to pay down hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of debt. Asset sales have been a go-to method for \u00a0 to generate cash in a pinch, but there aren't many buyers in today's dour environment. Similarly, selling stock in a secondary offering isn't a viable option for Chesapeake right now.If oil prices were to recover sharply, then the extra time Chesapeake's buying with a reverse stock split might be enough to see it through. More likely, though, the energy producer will watch the clock run out and have to resort to  to keep itself operating well into the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Chesapeake Energy wasn't one of them!

Certainly, cruises, airlines, and oil companies have all been mauled by the global COVID-19 pandemic, as people are ordered to stay at home and not travel. In addition, even when quarantines are lifted in the intermediate future, it's unclear how quickly travel volumes can come back to full pre-crisis strength.Yet even the most capital-light, digitally based travel companies are now feeling the pinch. The largest and arguably strongest travel-related company in the world is the world's leading online travel agent (OTA)  . Yet even Booking, the class of the industry, just released some downbeat forecasts for cash burn through the crisis, and it has quickly moved to raise cash and issue debt.Could Booking Holdings run out of cash? Image source: Getty Images.At the end of December, Booking Holdings had a strong $7.3 billion cash position, though it also had about $8.7 billion in debt. In spite of the net debt position, $7.3 billion in the bank seemed like a fair cash cushion to weather . However, Booking also has a $1 billion convertible debt maturity in June and another $1 billion coming due in September 2021.  Should the coronavirus pandemic drag on until we have a vaccine 18 months to two years from now, Bookings seems set to continue burning cash, putting those debt payoffs in question.In fact, on April 7, Booking Holdings disclosed that under current business conditions, and without raising any cash in the meantime, the company has enough cash to last through at least the end of 2021. On the bright side, that doesn't include any money from the company's $2 billion revolver, since that revolver is incumbent upon Booking Holdings already having a certain amount of liquidity. However, on the negative side, Booking said that if conditions continue to worsen, its cash might only last through the fall of 2021. Like many other companies, Booking has made several big moves to shore up its balance sheet in recent days, extending the timeline for riding\u00a0 out the pandemic. First, Booking began selling down some of its stake in  . Between March 23 and April 3, Booking sold off 4.5 million shares of Trip.com in the low to mid-$20 range, raising about $100 million. However, Booking still owns another 29.6 million shares of the China giant, so this amounted to only about 15% of its Trip.com stake. Obviously, it seemed like a bit of a desperation move, as Trip.com's share price had already been more than cut in half at the time of the sales. Still, $100 million versus the billions in debt maturities over the next few years is a relative drop in the bucket. More consequential, Booking went back into the debt markets to raise a substantial amount of cash in the form of senior notes. On April 9, Booking floated $1 billion in 4.1% senior notes due 2025, $750 million in 4.5% senior notes due 2027, and $1.5 billion in 4.625% senior notes due 2030. In conjunction with the offering, Booking is also floating another $750 million of 0.75% convertible notes due 2025, with a conversion strike price of approximately $1,886.44.  That seems like a pretty good deal to me, as the conversion option isn't that much lower than Bookings' 52-week high share price of $2,094. The combined $4 billion in notes is supposed to close today, April 13, giving Booking some breathing room to pay off its $2 billion in maturities and bolster its balance sheet by another $2 billion. That should help extend Booking's cash reserves until early 2022 at least, which would presumably be just after a vaccine is introduced. I happen to think the company is raising all this money at very reasonable prices,  in the travel-related space, who have had to issue equity and debt much more expensively in recent days. It should be known that Booking Holdings has been making these moves while its CEO has been battling COVID-19. CEO Glenn Fogel was tested on March 26, and his test came back positive on March 31. Fortunately, Fogel hasn't had any symptoms since March 28 and appears to be solidly recovered, at least going by the company's filings. Fogel has also continued in his duties as CEO this whole time, meaning he orchestrated the aforementioned moves even as he was battling the disease. While things aren't great for the travel sector right now, Booking Holdings' recent moves give it more firepower to weather the ongoing crisis. However, saddled with more debt and with Bookings' stock down \"just\" 32% from its recent highs, I'm not sure the stock has fallen enough for it to be a  in the travel space just yet. The travel sector may be the last sector to bounce back, meaning the \"travel recession\" will be longer for companies like Bookings than for others.\u00a0\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. This is , I'm Alison Southwick, and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, Personal Finance Expert here at The Motley Fool. I said Brobert before, oh, well. That's alright, people won't remember. Okay, so it's the March mailbag. And with the help of Motley Fool analyst, Jason Moser, we're going to answer all your questions about the current market, what's in JMos bucket, all that kind of good stuff, all that and more on this week's episode of .Well, before we get to the mailbag, why don't we chat a little bit about the week and then I can get your thoughts, does that sound good, Jason and Bro? Sounds like a plan. Alright. Well, the big news this morning, and by the way this morning is Friday, is that the U.S. has surpassed China in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases. I think we are at about 85,000; does that sound about right. We're into 90,000s now. Oh, wow! Okay, so that's my research from this morning, so things are ticking up pretty fast.  estimates that at least a 160 million people nationwide have been ordered to stay home. And when it comes to the stock market, well, it kept ticking up this last week, pinned on the hopes of the stimulus bill. Then news came on Thursday that 3.3 million people had filed for jobless claims, which is roughly about a bajillion percent more than the previous worst week ever of about 695,000 claims. That was back in 1982.So, again, now it's Friday. And I believe the stimulus bill is still plugging along, is that right, Bro? Yes, the House has passed it and the President will sign it. So, by the time you are listening to this episode, it will be law. Alright. And at this exact moment on a Friday, a random Friday afternoon, the market is down about 2%. Is that right, JMo? Yeah, I think 2.3% last we looked. In other news. I'm on day four of my sourdough starter, and it seems to be bubbling along nicely, so there's that. The bad news is that everyone is baking now and you can't buy flour to save your life. So, how are you guys doing, how are you feeling? There's going to be a shortage of eggs too soon. Eggs, why eggs? The same thing, people are baking so much. Oh, and then we're all going to get so chubby. See, I guess I'm lucky, I just don't have that itch to bake. I just don't know, it's not my thing, and so therefore I'm not stuck in the kitchen, eating a bunch of baked goods. So, that's the hot market take from JMo. Stay out of the kitchen. You want to stay fit, just stop baking. Yeah, there you go. So, yeah, Jason, how are you feeling after this week; as an investor, not as a consumer of baked goods? [laughs] I mean as an investor, you know, I'm feeling pretty good about things. I posted a note to our members and the services that I run, the  service and the , and the note was based on this stimulus package that Congress has been debating and now has passed. And I think, I mean, there's always going to be political bickering when it comes to things like this, it's too much money, it's not enough money, to put things in context this $2 trillion package; you know 2019 GDP domestically here was $21.5 trillion, just to give you an idea of how those numbers match up.So, frankly I think that number, that $2 trillion number, is going to go up in time, because I think this is probably a little more of a protracted battle then maybe some think it might be. There's not really a clear finish line. I think we got to get used to the fact that we're going to be dealing with COVID-19 in some way, shape or form in our lives for a while here. So, the health and the economic impacts will be significant and I think they'll last for a while.With that said, it is encouraging to see our government come forward in a bipartisan fashion to get aid to the folks that need it most, to the businesses that need it most. And hopefully, I mean the devil's in the details, hopefully this all does get into the right hands, and I'm sure some of it won't, and we can learn from that and hopefully do better next time. But as an investor, I'm very encouraged that we've seen our representatives in DC finally get together and make something happen. Yeah. Bro, I don't know about you, but when I saw those jobless claims numbers, I was literally speechless. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised, but wow, that was insane. What do you think? Yeah, no, it's incredible, and it's most definitely going to get worse. James Bullard, who's the President of the St. Louis Fed, told  and he said, unemployment could hit 30% over the next couple of months, which reached 10% during the Great Recession and 25% during the Great Depression. So, it'd give you an idea, that's the highest unemployment rate we would have seen perhaps in our nation's history, certainly over the last century. So, it's significant. So, when I see those numbers, I just have huge sympathy and empathy for all of those people, all those businesses that who knows if they'll be able to reopen once we solve this virus problem. So, that's the way I feel.I would certainly encourage everyone to dig into the details of this aid package, because there is a lot of aid for people, there's increased unemployment benefits, a lot of ways to defer payments. People don't have to pay their student loans now, at least, their Federal student loans for a few months. So, there are a lot of ways that the government, as well as bigger corporations are trying to help people. So, if you are in a financial pinch, definitely look at what resources are available to you. Alright. Well, should we head on to the mailbag now? Why not?! Let's do it. Alright. So, let's head to the first question, it comes from Jerry. \"To the Gardner brothers and The Motley Fool analysts ... \" that's you guys \" ... you have convinced me that investing in index funds, either domestically or internationally, is guaranteeing mediocre returns. Two examples from your own newsletter support my case. One, had I invested in just ,  and  over the last 20 years, I would have soundly beaten the S&P 500. Two, going forward, I believe that investing in just one stock, , will significantly outperform any Latin American ETF or Global ex U.S. index fund. If you agree, why does  still stick to promoting index funds? So, anti-.\" Oh, Bro, this one is coming at you. [laughs] Well, so, I would first of all say, that I think, we, at The Motley Fool, just about everyone involved thinks that index funds are a great start for most people. In fact, if you go to our  service, there's a  guide to Fool's success, step No. 4, even includes the line, \"We think index funds should be the foundation of your portfolio.\" So, to the extent that we do recommend index funds, it's generally for people who are newer to investing, and then you can start branching out to individual stocks.I will point out that he also said, you know, \"Had I invested in Amazon, Microsoft and Apple the last 20 years, I would have soundly beaten the S&P 500.\" Yes, if you can pick the stocks beforehand that are going to outperform the S&P 500, that is a great investment strategy. If only. I will point out, by the way, he's right about those three stocks, but for Microsoft, and if you look back 20 years, starting in March of 2000 and invested in Microsoft, for the next 18 years, you were underperforming the S&P 500, it wasn't until April of 2018 that it started to outpace the S&P 500. So, for most of the time, it actually wasn't beating the S&P 500.But the point being, it's very difficult to know beforehand which those stocks are going to be. If you look into our services, and we've looked at this as a company, there's sort of a pareto principle with our return. So, 80% of the returns are provided by 20% of the stocks. I wrote up an article for  a month ago, so this is before the biggest drops that we've seen recently, but even when I looked at it then, almost 30% of 's recommendations have lost money, and almost 12% had been down 50%.So, while I do agree that once you become a more experienced, sophisticated investor, you can move away from index funds, but thinking that you can put your portfolio in a handful of stocks and beat the S&P 500 is pretty risky. Yeah. Alright, let's move on to the next question from anonymous. \"Heard you discuss refinancing with Chris on .\" Jason is this coming directly at you here, it must be? I think so. Yeah, I think so. \"But what typically happens with home prices? Good idea to wait to buy, do you think? Also, you said we should all have 20 to 30 or so stocks in our accounts. What if you have more than one account? I have a personal brokerage account and a separate IRA account, should I shoot for 20 to 30, overall, across both accounts or 20 to 30 in each account. Keep calm and Fool on!\" Yes, very good question. And so, let's tackle the home question first, because there is some interesting data here. Now, certainly with the interest rate environment that we have today, it's absolutely time to at least inquire about refinancing, if you own your home. I'm in the middle of enquiring about that as well, trying to see if I can get to a point where it actually makes sense. And I'm encouraged with what I'm hearing from our lenders. So, definitely look at that, that's an easy way to cut that payment and put a little bit more cash in your pocket at a time when a lot of people could really use it.If you look at the actual behavior out there today, total mortgage application volume fell almost 30% here just last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And purchase applications fell even more dramatically in states hit the hardest by COVID-19 today, so you're looking at New York where it's down 35%; California, where it's down 23%, 17%, in Washington state. So, there is clearly a decline there in that mortgage volume. And we saw companies like  here just recently put on hold their home-buying program, which is a new part of the business they recently introduced where they're actually buying homes and then reselling them. They've put that program on hold right now given the situation. And you know most companies are trying to conserve capital and make sure that they can weather the storm, because we don't know, really, how long it's going to last or how much of an impact, economically speaking, it's going to be.Now, Zillow also recently performed a study here, and I got this from an article that came out recently on our  website, Maury Backman published this. Zillow recently did a study on the impact of previous pandemics on housing markets, interestingly enough, and one thing they found in this study is that home prices largely held steady or declines were very modest, in most cases. And that simply was because during those times there were fewer transactions. So, if people aren't desperate to sell, then they're not going to get out there and sell at a loss, they can weather the storm and just wait until times are a little bit better. And so, they don't feel like they have to sell at a loss. And so, I just thought that was an interesting point to note there as well.I mean, housing, as they always say, it's location, location, location. And so, it does change depending on where you are. And I think that where you are at this point in time, you certainly want to look to see how your area is dealing with this crisis. Clearly, California and New York are two states that are getting hit harder than a lot. But it does seem like in times like these, pandemics in particular, there is data out there that says that housing market can stay fairly resilient because people just, kind of, pull back and wait to weather the storm. Alright. Then the second part of that question was, \"Should I shoot for 20 to 30 overall stocks across all accounts or 20 to 30 in each account?\" So, when you have different brokerage accounts. Yeah, absolutely. I'm in that same boat, I mean I've got a self-directed brokerage account and then I have just a discretionary account. I think you're aiming really, you're looking in the context of your overall portfolio, so all accounts combined. Being well-diversified, 20 to 30 is a great place to start. For some folks, that number is going to be higher. For some folks, that number might be lower; if they're a little bit more confident or if they feel like their risk tolerance is high. But, yeah, I would look at in the context of all of your accounts. Alright. Next question comes from J. \"I am in my lower 20s, and I've always been interested in personal finance investing and saving for the future. Growing up, however, my dad has always lived an extremely high consumption lifestyle. He lives in a home worth well in the excess of $1 million has owned dozens of cars including s, s and Maseratis and wouldn't be surprised if he spends close to $4,000 a month eating out at expensive restaurants. He makes between $500,000 and a $1 million a year, so it seems he is able to maintain this lifestyle. However, with his level of spending, it makes me wonder whether he has built any wealth at all. I've tried starting conversations about finance with him and he never seems interested and doesn't add much to the conversation. I know he'd been previously burned by bad investments and I don't think he really invests anything. Am I right to be concerned about his spending and financial habits and if so, how would you recommend bringing this up with him to make sure he's preparing himself for retirement?\"Alright, Bro, that one's going to you. It is. And it can be tricky because there are just some people who do not want to talk about their finances, especially with their kids. That said, I do think the current crisis actually could be a way to bring up the conversation, and I think it's always good to lead with what you're doing. Talk about, \"Hey, you know, look, things are tough right now. This is happening to my retirement savings, this is what's happened to my portfolio, what's going on with you?\" And you might even frame it as a way for advice. That might cause your dad to be more inclined to open up, if you're saying, like, \"Hey, dad, what do you think I should do? What's going on with you?\"It's also I think important to frame it as concern for him, because many parents, especially wealthier parents will interpret this as, really, \"Why are you spending my inheritance?\" So, you definitely want to frame it that way. That said, there's only so much you can do, so if he's not willing to talk about it, you may just have to let it go. From what you've told me, my guess, he's going to be OK, I mean, he does have a $1 million house that he can do a reverse mortgage on or he can downsize. Given how much he's made, he probably is going to receive the maximum social security benefit, which is about $36,000 a year, maybe $40,000 a year, if he waits till late-70, not a lot compared to what he's making, but it'll prevent him from being penniless. But I think just open up the conversation talking about current events, might be the way to get that conversation going. Alright. Next question comes from Morty. \"I would appreciate Jason explaining what his stock buckets are and which stocks are in each bucket? What is his methodology for picking the stocks, market capitalization, growth, momentum, dividends? Is he going to create a coronavirus bucket?\" [laughs] I'm probably not going to create a coronavirus bucket, that might that would be a tough on the message, I think, we're trying to find that happy medium between recognizing the human toll here and also doing our job and making sure we're looking out for our members and our listeners and helping people secure their financial freedom. But the buckets or baskets, as I like to call them, two baskets that I have I have been maintaining here now for a little while. The first one, and this all started initially with just some discussions that Chris Hill and I were having every quarter it seems, when we would do  and we would look at the returns that some of these payments companies were lobbing out there. And we thought, \"Well, why don't we own shares of these companies?\" And so, it struck me that maybe there would be a payments related basket I could form. So, the war on cash basket was born on July 24, 2017 and that basket consists of , ,  and  all in equal amounts. So, 25% weighting on each position. And the idea is, take the total amount of money that you would want to invest in this sector, split it four ways and invest in these four companies.And to-date, since that date of inception in July 24, 2017, the war on cash basket has returned 81% versus the market's 9.6%. So, clearly that baskets worked out very well even throughout this bear market and COVID-19 crisis. And as you can see, with those four companies there, MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, Square, there wasn't one particular angle as far as philosophy, because you've got two dividend payers and you've got two that don't pay dividends. Two were a bit more stable or bigger, lower-risk in MasterCard and Visa. PayPal kind of that mid-risk. And Square being a little bit more of a risky play. But that was the idea behind the basket was to give yourself a nice risk exposure there; cover all ends of the risk spectrum.And so, after the war on cash basket, it struck me that another very attractive market opportunity is healthcare. And healthcare is another space where we have a lot of different ways we can invest. I had identified some companies that I do like in the space and so I came up with the healthcare and wealth-care basket, that date of inception was February 9, 2018. And to-date the returns of that basket, the basket is up 144.4% versus the market's 2.4%.Now, I will say, one caveat here on that on that number.  is one of the components of this basket and that stock has performed extremely well since February 2018, it's up +400% versus the others, but you've got , , Teladoc Health and . And, yes, IDEXX Laboratories is animal health; we cannot neglect our furry friends particularly in these trying times, they're serving as a point-of-support for a lot of us, as the owner of three dogs it just struck me that every time I went to the vet, IDEXX was getting some of my money, so then why not own some shares of IDEXX and get some of that money back. And thus far, it has all worked out very well.And the basket approach is simply meant to identify big, attractive market opportunities and then invest in those market opportunities, instead of trying to just pick one winner from a space, because oftentimes when you find attractive market opportunities, there are a number of companies that will win and in the case of the war on cash basket and the healthcare basket, thus far all eight components of the combined effort there are performing well, outperforming the market, positive returners. So, that's the general idea, is to give you good risk exposure while being able to invest in exciting market opportunities. Jason, do you think that given Alison's new baking hobby that you need to have a bread basket. [laughs] Hey, oh. I'm not sure which one would be easier to message, Rick, a coronavirus basket or a bread basket. I just got done telling a reporter, I'm like, all people are talking about is getting puppies and baking bread, like, that's what the coronavirus is doing to us here in Northern Virginia. We're drinking, a lot of drinking.Well, beer is just liquid bread, anyway, right. Liquid bread. Exactly. Were long on yeast, apparently. Alright, next question comes from Tom. \"I have 27 years left on a $250,000 mortgage with a current rate of 4%. Should I be paying extra principal or investing the money instead with the goal to pay off the mortgage, won't I have better odds paying it off sooner by investing that money for the long-term?\" Well, as Jason mentioned earlier, folks should be considering refinancing. So, mortgage rates had touched 3.25% a few weeks ago, all-time lows, they're slightly up to 3.5% now. But one rule of thumb about refinancing is that if you can cut your interest rate by 0.5% and you're going to be in the house for several years, it makes sense. You should definitely run your numbers. But the first thing I would look at is refinancing.I certainly think that the farther you are from retirement, generally, it's better to maintain the mortgage and invest the extra money; with the goal of paying off the mortgage before you retire. I've mentioned before that that's what I had been doing, I'm paying extra payments so that my mortgage is paid off before I retire. The reason I like that idea is, imagine you were retired right now and your portfolio has dropped by 33% and you're concerned about how that's going to eat into your retirement income. Your probably No. 1 concern is going to be, can I pay for my healthcare? And then, No. 2, can I pay for my mortgage? Because that's everyone's biggest expense and that's what everyone's biggest fear, losing their house. But if your mortgage is paid off, you don't have to worry about it. That said, my wife and I are actually going to stop those additional payments to the mortgage, because I think stocks are a better value right now. So, I'm actually going to be doing more investing than I had been in the past.So, Tom, in your general situation, unless it's extremely important for you to pay off the mortgage soon, I would rather invest the money. Alright. Next question comes from Caroline. \"I've heard that it is highly unlikely for this virus or any virus to be transmitted on cash, regardless, if enough people believe it can be carried that way, I would imagine it might cause even more people to abandon cash for credit cards and/or digital payments, no? I'm thinking that while the dollar amount value of transactions may decrease in an economic downturn or even for a few months because of the coronavirus, the number of transactions may increase and therefore our war on cash baskets of stocks may at least stay flat in the coming months or year. This question was prompted by my seeing someone in my local Upper West Side neighborhood bodega this morning insisting on being allowed to pay for a purchase of less than $10 using their digital wallet, credit card is not accepted for purchases less than $10, because there is at least one reported case of corona here and using cash is not safe he argued.\" Okay. Well, I will begin this answer by telling you that I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist, although, I do like science a lot and my dad is a doctor, so that doesn't matter either way. [laughs] I have done some research on this, though. And I will say that based on everything I have found that cash, paper money, absolutely can carry the virus and is a higher risk for transmitting that virus versus non-cash transactions. The World Health Organization certainly, they have warned that the virus can be transmitted to customers via bank notes and coins. So, don't think it's just paper money, certainly coins can carry it as well.China, I think, just went through a process of deep cleaning a lot of potentially infected cash to try to limit the spread of the virus. And ultimately, while pathogens and viruses can live on most surfaces for around 48 hours, there is research out there that shows that paper money can reportedly transport a live flu virus for, get this, up to 17 days, so. What? Yeah, I'm just telling you what the data says. Now, I'm not saying that you're going to get sick by using cash; don't get me wrong. I'm not really a big user of cash anymore, anyway. Like, I just find it more convenient not to use it. As with most things in life today, you just have to sort of -- there is some judgment involved and you just have to just be safe, you know. If you don't need to use cash then why use it? And I'm sure that a lot of merchants, a lot of stores out there are trying to navigate what is a tricky environment as well as the example that Caroline just offered. And considering your war-on basket, you're like, you know what, why not use that MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, Square -- MasterCard, and Visa, and PayPal, and Square, yeah, and I mean, you know, it's -- Definitely reach for that Visa says, Jason Moser, Visa shareholder. I think, coronavirus notwithstanding, I mean, the trend is clear, we are moving away from cash transactions and more toward electronic transactions worldwide. Alright. Next question comes from John. \"I know the government allows us to put away money in a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA tax free up to an income level. I believe in 2020, the household AGI has to be less than $206,000. What I'm not sure of is, if your household income is more than $206,000, are you still able to put money into an IRA, just not tax-free, and if so, is it a smart strategy, or is that a bad idea? Since when I take money out, I will end up paying taxes on my $6,000 contribution again?\" Well, I like to think of IRAs as really three types, there's the Roth IRA, whereas, when you put the money in, you don't get a tax break, but it grows tax-free, you take the money out, tax-free as long as you follow all the rules. There's the deductible traditional IRA, whereas, when you put the money in, you get a deduction, it grows tax deferred, but when you take the money out, you then pay taxes. If you make too much money, though, you may not be eligible for either of those, but you can always still contribute to the traditional IRA nondeductible, no deduction, but it still grows tax-deferred and when you take the money out, it's taxed then.So, just to give you some numbers on which ones people are eligible for. So, the Roth, your eligibility starts to fade when you make a $124,000, if you're single. It's completely eliminated when you're at $139,000; if you're married, a $196,000. It starts to be reduced to $206,000; again, if you're married then it's eliminated completely.If you are not covered by a retirement plan at work, any contribution to a traditional IRA is always deductible. So, if you don't have a 401(k) or a 403(b) and you're in a high tax bracket, the traditional IRA might make sense. If you are covered by a plan at work and you make a contribution to a traditional IRA, it may or may not be deductible and that is also subject to income limit. So, if you're single, your ability to deduct starts to go down at income level of $65,000; if you're married it's $104,000 it starts to go down.So, really, the point is, you're always eligible for some type of IRA, it just depends on your income and whether you're covered by a plan at work.One thing that John said was, he's basically asking, \"Should I bother contributing to a nondeductible IRA, if I put in that $6,000, I didn't get a tax break, and then when I take it out, I'm going to have to pay taxes on it again.\"That's actually not true. So, any nondeductible contribution you make to a traditional IRA, you're not going to be taxed on it again, that money will come out tax-free, it's the growth that you'll be taxed on. If you do not have significant amount of assets in traditional IRAs and you're not eligible for the Roth, you can make a contribution to the nondeductible traditional IRA and do what's called a backdoor Roth IRA. You basically do an instant conversion. I don't want to go into too many of the details, google it, you'll find plenty of articles, or even just call your discount broker, they'll know how to handle it.But the bottom-line is, anyone who's working can contribute to an IRA, it just depends on what you're eligible for based on various things. And I think if you're eligible for one and you have the excess money, it's always a good idea to contribute. Alright. Next question comes from Gary. \"What are the best defensive stocks in a volatile market? Best aggressive stocks with risk to buy now?\" So, that's a tough question, just because, there's so many stocks out there and, you know, these are unique times where it doesn't seem like there's necessarily always a correlation. But I do think, in a volatile market if you're looking for stability, something that is not going to go to crazy one way or the other frame your mindset around needs, think about things that people need as potentially ways to invest.And so, I'm thinking of things like utilities and telecom, things like that, they can be a little less susceptible to these heavy market moves, given that their revenue streams are largely uninterrupted, right. I mean, most people aren't cutting off their power, right? You kind of need power. Most people aren't cutting off their cellphone service, so whether that's  or . I mean, if you look at this stretch, Verizon, year-to-date down 12.5%; AT&T down 21.5%, compare that to the greater market, that doesn't really seem like it's so bad. And they also pay really healthy dividend yields that they can afford, again, because they're businesses that are providing services that people really do need.So, I think, if you're looking for stability, think about needs.If you're thinking about more aggressive stocks, I can give you a couple of ideas. One of the things I love to focus on in times like these, when everybody's kind of in the same boat. Look for the market leaders in their respective spaces, because they're the ones that typically emerge from periods of time like this stronger. They're typically the companies that pick up a little bit more market share, even if they just maintain essentially a flat market share, the fact that competitors are typically smaller -- I mean, we're talking about smaller competitors here, but typically you see either bankruptcies or businesses that lose business and revenue declines and whatnot. You look at the market leaders in their respective spaces, they tend to walk away from stretches like this even stronger.A couple of companies that come to mind, examples there, think about something like . Travel right now, I mean, obviously getting hammered for obvious reasons, I mean people aren't traveling, but when things get better, when the dust does settle, Booking.com is still going to have this tremendous network of hotels, the biggest network out there. It's going to still be a great business that does a lot of business in the travel industry. So, that's a good example.And then another one, I think, is . Starbucks is a company that is going to be able to weather the storm financially. You know, they're going to come out on the other end even stronger I think given their history, given what they sell. Chris Hill, I think, put it very eloquently today. He said it's a legally addictive product. And you know, anytime you can sell a legally addictive product, you got to look at that as a potential investment opportunity.And then, I'll just give you a last thing here. Some ideas as far as stocks that I've personally bought myself throughout this stretch here over the past month. Companies that I bought include , which is in the AutoCAD software business. I did open my very own position in Starbucks finally, so that I can be invested in Starbucks alongside my daughter's. And , which is, I think everybody familiar with Adobe the PDF company, but it's so much more. And then also , which is a programmatic advertising.And I really do believe that when the dust settles, those are for companies that will emerge even stronger. Alright. Next question comes from Jeff. \"I was wondering if it makes sense to discontinue my student loan automatic payment plan that provides an interest rate deduction, to begin sending my monthly payments through the Virginia529 plan? I'm thinking, yes, assuming the interest rate deduction provided by the lender for automatic online payment is small compared to the, I believe, 5.75% savings on Virginia taxes using the 529 plan would provide.\" So, Jeff, let's remind the audience what a 529 plan is. When it was originally conceived, you would put the money in, you didn't get a deduction when you put it in, generally, at least on the Federal level, but then the money grew tax-free as long as you used it for qualified higher education expenses. Then a couple years ago they changed the rules so that you could use some of your 529 money for elementary and secondary school expenses. And then just at the end of last year, thanks to The SECURE Act, they now allow people to take out $10,000, lifetime limit, to pay off student loans.So, Jeff is thinking, if I put money in my Virginia529 plan, something that I also participate in, I get a tax deduction. And that's true of about 30 of the 529 plan, every state has one, 30 of the states offer a deduction on the state return, not Federal, the state return if I put the money in. He basically wants to put the money in and then take the money out quickly to pay off his loans.As opposed to what he's currently doing, he's on some sort of automatic payment plan, and most of these lenders as well as all kinds of other banks and lenders, will basically reduce your interest rate a little bit if you sign up for some sort of automatic payment plan.So, my first thing to say is, I think you can do both, you can still stick with the plan, you can put money in the 529 and then take it out, because the money you take out of the 529, doesn't have to go directly to the loan, you can take it out and take it yourself and then write the check, just have it sit in your bank account. And at the end of the year, you'll get a 1099-Q indicating that you took a deduction.I think we discussed in a previous episode, it's actually rather surprising at how little anyone follows up on whether you actually use the money for qualified higher education expenses or not.I did call the Virginia529 plan today just to say, like, \"Is there any limit on how long I have to leave the money in there?\" And the person I spoke with said, \"No,\" so. But you might want to check, everyone has their own plans, every plan has their own rules, so you might want to pay attention to that.Also, for states that do offer this deduction, they often have what they call, recapture rules. And Virginia has one and many states have this. So, for example, if you donate to the Virginia529, get the tax deduction but then transfer that 529 to another state, it might basically want you to pay back the money you got for taking the deduction.Some states do this if you use the money for K-12 expenses. The interesting thing here is, using money for student loans, it's so new that states don't have any rules about this yet. I even looked through the 60-page document for Virginia's 529 to see how they treat distributions for school loans, and there's a big disclaimer on the frontpage saying, \"We know that there's no rules, but we haven't codified them yet, so stay tuned.\" So, I would just follow-up on that to make sure that there's not going to be any sort of tax deduction recapture if you use the money to pay off your school loan. Alright. Next question comes from Jerry. \"Would you help me understand what investment managers mean when they recommend investing internationally? There are several reasons the term \"international\" seems confusing. First, if a company incorporates in a nation outside the U.S., is that sufficient grounds to call it an international stock? Does that make an American depositary receipts on the NYSE an international investment? Do managers believe opening a special brokerage account that permits trading on a non-U.S. exchanges is a must?\"\"Second, if a stock is only traded on an exchange outside the U.S., not ADRs, is that sufficient to call it an international stock? What if the company makes the majority of its sales from clients in the U.S.? Finally, what if the top ten large cap American multinationals incorporated in the U.S. and traded on U.S. exchanges received the majority of their revenues from clients outside the USA, does that make them international stocks? For example, Microsoft makes more than 50% of its sales outside the U.S.\"\"Bottom-line it seems that the  provides plenty of global diversification without the word \"international\" entering into the calculation.\" Excellent question, and I will begin with Jerry's takeaway there, the bottom-line. I agree with you that, yes, I think that the Vanguard Total Market Index provides plenty of global diversification without the word \"international\" entering in the calculation, primarily because so much money is made outside of the United States and other international locations.So, defining international investing has certainly changed throughout the years and as the world gets smaller, thanks to technology, we're all more and more connected. And so, I think international investing is very much just wanting to make sure that you get exposure to the global economy, however you do that, it is a bit of a squishy definition. I think that I personally look at it today as most big companies out there are international in nature, because they make their money all over the world. It didn't always used to be that way, but it certainly is more the norm now, and that's how I view international investing.I think the Microsoft example is a really good one. I think Microsoft can certainly be viewed as an international investment based on the revenue it generates and the locations it generates it. Starbucks, Apple, , I mean the examples just go on and on. I think international investing today is much easier than ever before, because we've got companies that are making their money in so many different places. Alright. Next question comes from Sam. \"If I sell a stock in my Roth IRA for a profit, are there any issues with rebuying the same stock immediately in my taxable brokerage account? I'd like to lock-in gains in the Roth to free up cash and move a non-dividend paying stock to my other account.\" The quick answer is, no, there are no tax consequences to selling anything in your Roth. You don't have to pay capital gains and you can't take a capital loss. So, you go ahead and sell that stock and then you can rebuy it on the outside. And it sounds like what you're doing is asset location, and that is, putting the right investments in the right accounts for maximum tax efficiency and it sounds smart. If you have a dividend-paying stock and you're not yet retired, it's better to keep it in the IRA, use your taxable brokerage account for stocks that don't pay dividends. Alright. Next question comes from Vasu. \"Following your advice, in an effort to be able to buy stocks on a discount in the situation like we are experiencing right now because of the coronavirus, each month I put aside a portion of my savings, about 5% to 7%, in a high-yield account to invest in a downturn. My question is, do you have any rules of thumb or strategies for when and how to invest in such a situation? Right now, I have about $7,000 saved up compared to my monthly contribution to my retirement account of $4,500. I primarily invest in a mix of U.S. and international index funds for my retirement savings. Retirement for me is 37 years away. So, when and how do you think I should invest the $7,000?\" So, my primary rule-of-thumb, and I've learned this from the Great Recession ten years ago, take it slow. No matter what, first-and-foremost, just take it slow. You're not in a race to try to get all of this money invested at once, because as we've seen, the market has moved a lot one way or the other for the last month here, so the opportunities are certainly there.From there, I think you take the money that you have, a good idea -- and Ron Gross turned me on this idea a while back, is take that money, split it up into four or five tranches, you know, divide that out and say, \"Okay, I've got four or five tranches of a $1,000 each and I'm going to put those to work on my given opportunistic timeframes, whether that's every week or when the market falls a certain percentage, whether it's 2%, 3% or 4%, you can determine that line for yourself.But I think taking it slow and dividing that money out into tranches that you can get to work in there will help you do that. Alright. Next question comes from Matt. \"I have very little debt and a six-month emergency fund in place. My wife and I are 30 and make good income, but should still get the full $1,200 per adult and $500 per child in the new stimulus plan. Can I take the $3,400 my family will get and invest it in my traditional IRA or my children's 529 plans and claim that as a deduction?\" The answer is, yes. So, from what I have read, the money that's coming from the stimulus plan will be automatically deposited into your bank account that was listed on your 2019 or 2018 tax returns. So, that money will just magically appear in your bank account and there's no rules against then using that money to put in a 529 or an IRA, the only limits for an IRA is it's $6,000 per year, another $1,000, if you're 50 or older, as long as you make that much money. So, as long as you're working, you can do that 529 there's really virtually no limit. So, go ahead and do that and you can still take the deduction for the 529 if your state offers that or for the traditional, if you meet the limits that I mentioned earlier in the show. Alright. Next question comes from Mary. \"Why in the world is the stock market tanking on Monday and then up on Tuesday and then tanking again on Wednesday? There really has been no news, the virus has continued to spread globally and we won't have a vaccine for another 12 to 18 months. I know that a lot of this trading is done algorithmically, but there are still humans providing price inputs. I'm so confused.\" Well, there are humans providing price inputs, but the word that was mentioned their \"algorithms,\" that really is a big part of what's going on here right now. We are seeing a resurgence in high frequency trading and , which is a publicly traded company out there, one of the largest high-speed trading firms out there actually said, that it expects to post trading income of around $515 million here in the first quarter, which is more than double the amount from the same period last year. And then Thomas Peterffy, who is the Founder [sic] of , noted that they have seen, I think, double the trading volume in this time compared with last year as well.So, certainly high-speed trading is a big part of it. I think it's also worth noting that there are folks that short stocks, obviously, as they go down. When we see shorting at some point, they start covering and that can sometimes cause a little bit of a squeeze which sends the markets back up. So, it's not one particular answer, it certainly is a combination of a lot of things, but we're definitely seeing a resurgence in high-frequency trading these days. Next question comes from Charlie. \"I'm a 20-year-old college student who has had the privilege of investing since I was 14.\" Oh, that's awesome. \"When it comes time to finance a house or car, would it be wise not to touch my investments and to let them run. I have a Roth IRA and two taxable investment accounts, one taxable account holds a small mix of ETFs and some index funds, while the other has 40 individual stock picks. Upon graduating, my plan is to gradually build up my emergency savings while still contributing to my investments. Is it unheard of, given my age, to be practically all-in with equities and use these investment vehicles to save for a down payment and other life goals?\" I personally don't think it's unheard of to use those types of investments to achieve life goals. I mean, I certainly have invested in individual stocks and sold those positions in order to make, actually, a down payment on a house as well. And so, I think that that is definitely one way to look at it. And I like, particularly when you're talking about a house, to me, that is essentially taking money from one investment and you're allocating that money to another investment where the opportunity for you is a little bit better. And in this case, if you're putting a down payment on a house, I mean, yeah, you know, you're investing that money into something that's going to put a roof over your head for the next however many years you plan to stay in that house. So, it's another investment. It's just always worth remembering the tax implications that are involved whenever you do something like that. So, just keep that in mind whenever you do plan to liquidate and allocate that money to another form of investment. Alright. The last question is for Jason. \"What is he most excited for on his future visit to Clemson University.\" Derek wants to know. \"Jason, are you going to Clemson.\" Yeah, I was so bummed, man. Derek is a guy on Twitter that he and I have talked back-and-forth about investing and stuff. And I was going to go down to speak with some folks at Clemson, some investors, some students and just talk a little bit about what we do, what I do, and you know, just talk stocks and stuff. But it's a postponement, it's not a cancellation, so I am looking forward to getting back down there. I went to college just an hour or so away from Clemson a while for college. So, for me, it's always nice to get back to South Carolina just because that's where I grew up.I've got a cousin down there, Austin, she's still down at South Carolina and I don't get to see her very often and I was really excited to get back down there and catch up with her. But again, a postponement, not a cancellation. So, Austin, I'll be down there eventually and we'll go grab some dinner. Alright. My sister went to Clemson. And back in the day it had a strong agriculture program and they had all their own homemade ice cream and it was crazy cheap and it was outstanding. [laughs] I mean, they still have very strong agricultural program there. Clemson is a big school, a good school. I got a lot of friends that have graduated there through the years and so I'm just excited to get back down there and see it.[...] Alright. Well, that covers it for our mailbag, but we can also head to the other mailbag. Okay, I don't know what's going on with the postcards, because again, we're taping this remotely from each of our houses and so there may be a stack of postcards from our listeners waiting at the office, but what I was able to do though is go to iTunes and see all the people who've left reviews for us lately.So, other than MFFan saying that the host voice is painful, I want to thank Claire in Knoxville, Rebel, Smith, Drew, Jake, What2What, Finn, Dave, Matt, King Hoser, Bunch of Liars, and then a P with a couple of asterisks and an L -- I don't know, people pick hard to pronounce names on iTunes, but that's OK, I want to thank all of you for the reviews, it helps bump us up in the rankings which helps us attract new listeners and that's a good thing, especially now.So, before we go though, as we've been doing during these troubling times, we've been closing by sharing our one recommendation for the week for our listeners to do or read or whatever to kind of take their mind off of the sadness that surrounds us. [laughs] That makes it sound so dark and sad at our house, I promise you, I'm OK. So, who wants to go first this week with their recommendation? I'll go, just because I don't have a particular good recommendation, because I was so busy all week, so I'm more eager to hear other people's recommendations. However, I did stumble upon the  account of Patrick Stewart @SirPatStew. And every day he's reading a sonnet with his outstanding English accent. So, highly recommend that. Good stuff, Bro, good stuff. Yes, so I just got done watching on HBO that limited series The Outsider, it was based on a Stephen King book. And so actually read the book a year, year-and-a-half or whatever. Really liked the book. I got to say, the series did the book justice. So, read the book or watch the series. Either way, I think it is super-entertaining, if you have any Stephen King inclinations whatsoever. Alright, Rick, how about you? You pointed out that I keep picking music things and that's my brand here, but I'm also a photographer. And so, I'm going to recommends some fun with your iPhone or whatever camera you have around the house. And that is to do some, either backyard or indoor photography. So, I'm going to rifle through a couple of tips, things you might not think to do because you're just pointing at your kids or whatever. One is perspective angle, try shooting from on your knees or from lying on the floor, try different angles, see what you can find.Light, instead of looking at the subject of what you're looking at, look at the way the light is spread across the floor or across the wall or whatever; cool things come out of that. Look for lines and shapes. Look instead of just a tree, look at the bark on the tree or look at the books on your shelf, you know, what kind of patterns are they making; look for that.Macro, get up close. Take close-up pictures, as close as your camera will focus. Bad weather. Bad weather makes good photos. It's the perfect time to do portraits of your pets and family. Try different locations around the house, either inside or outside. All of these things can feed your Instagram account and all of your socials. Have some fun with your camera, try some different things, do some things you wouldn't normally do, have fun. And you can send those pictures to us by email instead of postcards in the interim, so. Oh, there you go. Well, we have so much luck when we ask people to send us anything that's not a postcard. Bro, how many emails did we get with people giving us their moneysaving piece of advice? Not many. [laughs] As many as we got sending us our holiday traditions. That's OK. [laughs] I think we got a few holiday traditions, actually, but -- Did we?Yeah. Okay. Alright. Well, my recommendation is an artist and a writer named Charlie Mackesy. Do you guys know this guy? Nope. Okay. So, you can follow him on Instagram. He also has a recent book out called . And the book is just a lovely series of illustrations and conversations between a boy, a mole, a fox and a horse. And they're all about acceptance and love and every drawing is just like a great big hug, as we all socially distance here.So, again, you can follow him on Instagram @charliemackesy, and the book is, . Highly recommended if you need a hug.Alright. Well, that's the show, but I should probably say a disclaimer, huh, because we did talk stocks, so.As always, The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against the stocks we talked about today, don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you heard here.Jason, thank you so much for joining us this week. We really appreciate it. Thank you for having me; it's always a pleasure. Yeah, well, we made it work. We're trying to make it work doing it all remotely. So, I hope our listeners aren't suffering too much as we kind of blunder through this.Alright, the show is edited socially by Rick Engdahl, I don't know, usually Rick helps me come up with what my adverb is. Socially distantly. [laughs] [laughs] Socially distantly by Rick Engdahl, our email is Answers@Fool.com. Again, send us those pictures and Christmas traditions and moneysaving tips. For Robert Brokamp, I'm Alison Southwick, stay Foolish, everybody.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Online travel agency   is booking a large new issue of debt.

Airbnb is getting another lifeline: a $1 billion five-year loan from a group including Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners, just after the two inked its $1 billion bond deal. It\u2019s not cheap, though, at 7.5 percentage points over a benchmark rate. Throw in the discount the paper was sold at, and lenders get about a 12% return, Reuters reported. Online travel firm Booking Holdings, meanwhile, looked to borrow five-year money recently for just over 4%.That doesn\u2019t mean Airbnb is getting a raw deal. It has few assets, even by travel-industry standards, that can be liquidated in bankruptcy to pay creditors \u2013 not least compared to a cruise operator like Carnival, which recently paid double-digits for three-year paper. And post-pandemic, it\u2019s probably going to have to pay up to instill confidence in properties\u2019 cleanliness. Even then, travelers might be hesitant. The unicorn isn\u2019t getting fleeced. (By Anna Szymanski)BACON BONUS. It\u2019s not just President Donald Trump who is mailing out cheques this week. Smithfield Foods, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed WH Group, the world\u2019s largest pork company, said on Wednesday it would pay a $100 million \u201cResponsibility Bonus\u201d to hourly production and distribution team members as a thank-you for putting meat on tables across America.The pay-out amounts to an average $2,500 for each of Smithfield\u2019s 40,000 workers. That\u2019s more than double the sum the U.S. Congress approved as a direct cash payment to Americans who make up to $75,000 a year. Smithfield is not alone among companies showing their financial appreciation for workers braving the pandemic. Still, the fact that a Chinese-owned group is topping up the government handout will not be lost on Smithfield\u2019s employees \u2013 or their pork-loving customers. (By Una Galani)SOONER OR LATER. Companies left and right are slashing 2020 earnings estimates because of the Covid-19 pandemic. It might seem surprising that UnitedHealth, America\u2019s largest health insurer, hasn\u2019t. The $266 billion company\u2019s first-quarter earnings were better than analysts had hoped on Wednesday, and it affirmed earnings for the year. Today\u2019s good news might be problems stored up for later.Doctors and hospitals have emptied their practices and beds to prepare for the onslaught and prevent the spread of the disease. For insurers like UnitedHealth, that means fewer expenses to pay. Meanwhile, Covid-19-related costs have yet to really hit. The disease was ramping up rapidly into the end of the quarter, and bills to insurers will lag treatments.Chief Executive David Wichmann warned employer layoffs may mean less premiums flowing in down the road. And people won\u2019t put off the cavities or curious looking moles forever. Insurers may soon be tripped up. (By Robert Cyran)ADIDAS ADDS UP. Securing a 3 billion euro loan should be cause for celebration amid the coronavirus pandemic. That\u2019s not how it feels to Adidas shareholders who have had to sacrifice future dividends so the 43 billion euro athleisure maker can take funds from the German government.Fitting for a maker of running shoes, speed was the determining factor. Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted warned last month that sporting goods were likely to lose out as customers prioritise filling their fridges. The company was shedding around $100 million a week in revenue even before its fast-expanding U.S. market announced lockdown measures.Normally, it would be better to sell bonds. But Adidas is short of fitness in the debt markets. It has only issued four bonds in eight years and doesn\u2019t have the credit rating required to perform a swift fundraising. Luckily Germany\u2019s KfW agency was on hand for a fundraising boot camp. (By Aimee Donnellan)CHINESE CONVERTIBLE BOND BUBBLE. Clever retail investors, worried about equity markets destabilised by the coronavirus outbreak, have discovered a safer toy to play with. Convertible bonds, which can be exchanged for shares at a pre-set price, have become the preferred instrument of mainland day traders, according to a Reuters report. Issuance tripled to 270 billion yuan ($38 billion) in 2019, as Chinese firms cashed up, and some adroit traders noticed. Monthly trading in the securities quadrupled in March from February to over $140 billion. The market is liquid, and not restrained by intraday trading rules that govern stock exchanges. The bonds can be held to maturity, limiting losses.Turnover is tame compared to stock exchanges, but impressive nevertheless considering there are only around 220 tradeable instruments. In the past, bubbles have formed in exotic markets like carved walnuts and egg futures, then collapsed, embarrassing regulators. If Beijing takes notice of this one, the market may cool off in a jiffy. (By Pete Sweeney)PIXEL PARTY. Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner may be about to learn that shareholder democracy works just as well via video chat. Proxy advisor Glass Lewis is recommending that investors reject the $21 billion bank\u2019s compensation report ahead of an April 30 virtual shareholder meeting, questioning the board\u2019s decision to award a \u201cgood leaver\u201d status to former Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam.It\u2019s a valid question. If, as Thiam and the bank have claimed, he knew nothing about a recent spying scandal, why leave? If he\u2019s in any way accountable, even just by being inexcusably ignorant of the affair, why pay him $11 million for 2019 and let him keep roughly the same amount again in unvested deferred share awards? True, investors\u2019 vote on the wider compensation report is merely \u201cconsultative\u201d, but they can block 2019 executive bonuses, including Thiam\u2019s $3.4 million sweetener. Rohner may want to hit the escape button to avoid an embarrassing virtual defeat. (By Liam Proud)FLOG ON THE TYNE. Not content with splashing out on bombed-out European oil equities and cruise operator Carnival,, Mohammed bin Salman is set to acquire another serial underperformer, Newcastle United Football Club. The Public Investment Fund, which the Saudi Arabian crown prince controls, has agreed a 300 million pound deal to acquire the team from UK retailer Mike Ashley, according to the Financial Times.At less than 2 times sales the valuation looks relatively cheap, and as Breakingviews wrote in January there\u2019s some logic in MbS trying to echo what neighbouring Abu Dhabi managed with Manchester City. Still, the price tag is only 12% less than what was mooted in January \u2013 compared to a 37% fall in the shares of similarly black-and-white-attired Juventus FC \u2013 and Covid-19 has left football stadiums empty.

Warren Buffett actually learned that from value investing legend Benjamin Graham, who was extolling the importance of emotion in investing before Buffett bought his first stock. In fact, there's now a whole branch of finance that looks at this issue, called behavioral finance. It's basically a blend of psychology and finance that examines all of our all-too-frequent mental mistakes. You make them -- but we all do.If you want to be a successful investor, you need to understand these misconceptions. Here's a primer on why your mind is the most important factor in investing.\u00a0If you ask a room full of people if they are above-average drivers, almost everyone will raise their hand. That's statistically impossible, since roughly half have to be worse than average. This is anecdotal, but it gets to the heart of the matter. We all think we are better than we really are. And in investing that's a big blind spot, and one that will often lead you astray.\u00a0Image source: Getty ImagesThis isn't to suggest that you (yes, you specifically) aren't smart and capable. It's just that you are likely to overestimate just how smart and capable you are. That will lead you to believe that what you are doing is right without question. In other words, although terribly cliche, the first thing you need to do is admit you have a problem. And once you do that, you can start to look at ways that you might be wrong about your investment decisions.This, however, never ends, because you will be human all of your life. So you'll need to be on guard forever. Getting \"you\" right is a lifetime effort.The human mind has two broad ways of thinking. One is slow and calculated, the other quick and emotional. By nature we tend to use the quick way most often. It makes sense -- if there's a car bearing down on us as we cross the street, we can't sit around and contemplate what to do. Investing, however, requires us to move past quick decisions and use the vast processing power of our minds. Sounds easy, but when we're under stress we usually revert to quick, emotional thinking. Investing is stressful even on a good day. (Today, with  pushing us into a  and likely , it's even more stressful than usual.)You need to make changes to your process so you limit the stress and give your calculating mind time to work. For example, you might stop placing trades during market hours, and instead set up your trades before or after the market closes using limit orders. That way you don't feel pressure to act. Or instead of watching the market every second looking for a stock to buy, look at companies and create a list of names you'd like to own. After you have that list, figure out the prices you'd be willing to pay, and only buy them at those prices. You get the idea -- pull yourself out of high-stress situations and you'll give yourself the space to make better choices.You make mistakes, we all do. It's actually a good thing, because it's the way human beings learn. That, however, doesn't mean you should accept mistakes, especially since we're prone to making the same ones over and over again.\u00a0If you , for example, you'll probably find yourself attracted to companies where the dividends are at severe risk of being cut.  , for example, had a yield in the double digits  because its aggressive use of leverage limited its access to capital in a difficult energy market.

It went public under the Priceline name in 1999 at the peak of the hype, rocketed higher, . It was a real business, and still is, but it took roughly a decade for the stock to get back to its IPO price after that decline. Obviously, there was too much hope and hype in the price when the stock came public.\u00a0If you know your investment style, then you need to figure out what can go wrong with that style. For example, Bruce Berkowitz, the manager of , has a list of things that companies often do that lead to disaster. He is, essentially, . The list includes things like taking on too much debt and spending more cash then a business can generate.\u00a0There are three big takeaways from this list. One, Berkowitz examined his process and figured out where he often goes wrong -- recognizing that he isn't infallible. Two, he created a list to test his decisions -- questioning himself before he acts. And three, the list forces him to slow down and work outside of the pressure cooker that is Wall Street -- removing the intensity of time constraints.These are just three points to consider, but they cover a lot of ground.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. We've been doing this show for over a decade and it has never felt more important to pull back the curtain a little bit and timestamp what we're doing and where we're doing it. As of this moment, it is early in the afternoon on Friday, the Federal government has pushed the filing deadline for taxes back to July 15, the Governor of New York has ordered nonessential businesses to keep a 100% of their workforce at home starting on Sunday, as his state deals with the worst coronavirus outbreak in the United States, and as of right now, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, both, on-track to finish the week down more than 10% each.So, with all of that and everything else that's going on; Ron Gross, let me start with you. Amidst everything going on, what are you thinking as an investor right now? For me, first of all, the volatility has been just incredible. Up big one day, down big the next. Oil, in particular, all over the place. I think people are focusing mostly, and trading mostly on emotion at this point, I think. There's just too much uncertainty out there, lack of data. I think this is going to continue until the government steps in a very big way because with businesses not opening and workers not going to work, this is going to continue to spiral and get worse till government intervention halts that. And until that happens, stocks are not only going to continue to be volatile but volatile on the downside. Yeah, the word that comes to mind is, equanimity. You got to look at a period of time like this and understand that your advantage as an individual investor, like we are, the one thing you can do, and I'm not saying it's easy, but you can keep your wits about you, you can keep your cool and recognize that there's only so much you can control here. And I think ultimately, the greater point is, this is one of these things that it is essentially out of all of our control to a degree. We can do certain things that are prescribed to help stanch the spread of this virus, and so, we're doing that to the extent that we can.But this is mother nature, I mean you can't fight mother nature. And so, you got to, kind of, ride out the storm. Now, I was thinking about this morning, pulling back to some experience that I had back in 1989 in Charleston, South Carolina, when we went through Hurricane Hugo -- and I mean I know that Hugo wasn't a pandemic, but there are some parallels there. And we were right in the middle of that storm. I mean, Charleston got pounded and we were out of school for a month, like, we were out of school for a month and it was not all fun and games either. I was up on rooftops cutting trees and stuff. It was a time that had -- no one had been through a time like that before, all you could do was try to keep your wits about you and understand that this too eventually shall pass.I think, in this case, this too shall eventually pass. I think back then we had the luxury of no social media, so panic was probably a little bit lower. But, yeah, I think, this \"don't panic\" is really more important now than ever before. Ron, we're going to get into some of what's happening with different industries, and certainly individual stocks as well, but broadly as an investor, what is your mindset right now, because we're getting a lot of questions from listeners and from Motley Fool members asking in some way, shape or form, is this the bottom, should I be getting in now, should I be pulling my money out now? What are you thinking as an investor right now? Sure. So, this feels different to me, different than the dot-com crash, different than the Financial Crisis, because there's a health scare involved here. So, this one feels a bit different to me. And on the average day, I'm actually more focused on the health part of this than I am on the financial. And then I get back to work and I see everything that's going on, I say, \"Okay, so what am I going to do now as an investor?\" And more than a month ago, really, I took my cash and I looked at where I was. I divided my cash into five equal pieces and I said, \"I'm going to slowly deploy one-fifth [20%] of the cash as things continue to get worse.\" And I'm about two-and-a-half deployed now, so about 50%, I've got 50% of my cash left.But as we said last week on the show, I want to unburden investors from thinking they need to call the bottom, because I think that is just too stressful, you don't need to do that to yourself. If you buy  at what you think is a great price and it still goes down 10% or 15% more, because we're in unprecedented times, I think you're still going to be OK, and you still can buy more then, if you like, if you continue to hold some cash on the sidelines.But even at down 10% to 15%, if the stock continues to go down; five or ten years from now, I think you're going to really be happy that you put the money to work when you did, because bottoms are just impossible to call. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. It does seem like the volatility has made it impossible to really gauge any firm sentiment. But I mean, we have been stuck in this just horrible news cycle for a straight-up month now. I mean, every day the news is just not good. And so that clearly plays out on the markets to a degree. But to Ron's point there, I mean, sitting there and trying to call the bottom is just a fruitless effort. You're not going to be able do it sustainably, it doesn't really matter. And so that's why we continue to focus on just buying good businesses, businesses that we want to be owners of for long periods of time.I know some people like to think, maybe that's a copout, \"Oh, we're in this for the long-haul,\" but it really does work when you look at it. And so, depending on your stage in life as an investor, if you can afford that time, if you can take that outlook, I think it really does make things a lot easier. But with that said, obviously, everyone's situation is somewhat unique. Yeah, you'll often hear us talk at The Fool about not selling, not selling, and in general, I think that's a good policy. In times like this, it's OK to sell in certain circumstances, and that 'circumstances' is not panic, but it is OK to sell if you have companies in your portfolio that you no longer believe in and you just never got around to selling them. If you have companies that you think are going to be permanently impaired by what's going on right now in the economy, it's OK to sell those stocks and redeploy that capital into something that you think is better and that you'll be happy to hold for the next five or ten years. That's just prudent investing that quite frankly should happen all the time, but in times like this it gets a little bit exacerbated and you can perhaps focus on it a little bit more. Yeah. And just one last thing to reiterate, because we talk about this a lot. I just want to make sure people out there understand. We are invested in this with you. We're not just telling you what to do without actually doing it ourselves, we are feeling this pain with you. I personally, I'm not selling anything, I've made some methodical buys on the way down here, I'll continue to do that as my cash allows. But we are feeling this pain with all of you investors out there. So, please understand, we're in this together. It's just going to take some time to work through it.Yeah, one thing I often say, perhaps you've heard it before is, I actually don't look at my portfolio as a whole during times like this, I find it to be quite stressful. I don't really need to see, in the aggregate, [laughs] how much I'm down; that's not helpful to me. Instead, I focus on individual companies, individual stocks that I would like to either own or add to, and that helps me manage personally my stress level. Just like individuals and families across the country and around the world are thinking about their own financial situation, Ron, companies are doing the same thing. And I wanted to get your thoughts on what we've been seeing this week in terms of dividend cuts. We've seen some big ones already. , , both coming out this week saying, they're suspending their dividends. This feels like only the beginning, and I'm curious what you think this means for people who are either dividend investors completely or they've got some portion of their portfolio that has allocation toward dividend payers? Yeah. In good times and bad, one of the main things a good manager or leader of a company can do is be a strong capital allocator, and that means deciding when to pay dividend, when not to pay dividend, when to buy back stock, when not to buy back stock. Especially in a crisis, there comes a time where it's actually very prudent; and as a shareholder you should want your leadership team to preserve cash. And in certain circumstances, it means cutting a dividend or perhaps outright suspending a dividend. If it's the right thing to do, then you should be actually very pleased that that's happening.Now, if you're an income investor and you're relying on income as part of your investment strategy, I would say, you should be focused on companies with very strong balance sheets that typically wouldn't need to cut or suspend a dividend in a time of a downturn or times of crisis. If you're a total return investor and you're looking mostly for appreciation, but a dividend yield is nice as well, it's perhaps not as essential, but just in general, we always like to focus on companies with strong leaders, strong target markets, great balance sheets. And if you stick to owning mostly companies like that, you should be OK in good times and bad. But you've got to see Ford and  and even  taking prudent measures here to preserve cash. The dividend will come back when appropriate, but times are tough right now and you need to, kind of, batten down the hatches. Our email address is . From Keaton Deal, who writes, \"Hey, guys, I'm a brand-new investor, trying to get into the market with all these low prices. I don't have much cash on hand to invest, around $1,000 tops. I've been listening to your shows for about two weeks now and while I'm learning a lot, I'm stuck on this question, \"Should I take my few hundred dollars and invest in a ton of cheap stocks or should I diversify more by buying fewer stocks that cost more upfront. PS: Love the show, tons of great information. Thanks.\"Thank you for the question. Thank you for listening. Jason, a good reminder that, yeah, there are a lot of things that look inexpensive out there that doesn't necessarily mean they are inexpensive. I think we've talked before about how it doesn't matter how cheap the oil stocks are, I don't think any one of us is looking to jump into those. But I'm curious how you think about his question. Yeah, I mean, it's a good question, one we discuss a lot, particularly with new investors. And it comes down to, really, not confusing price with value, because they're two very different things. I'm assuming that what he's saying, when he says, \"Cheap stocks,\" is he's talking about stocks that are lower in actual price, so something that maybe $10 versus a $100. And really, we try to get investors to not really think about that whatsoever, because price and value are two very different things. A stock at $5 could actually be very expensive based on the fundamentals of the business.So, it all leads me to say, when you see a company like  or Google [] or , with these share prices that are $1,000 or more, actually, we're looking at companies like that today and thinking, \"You know what, those actually look pretty cheap from a valuation perspective.\" Historically speaking at least and given their positions in the markets.Now, if you're a little bit limited in how much money you have to invest, the nice thing about today is, the commissions are virtually nothing in most cases and there are always the options for fractional shares as well. So, I really would utilize this opportunity to focus on buying into the market leaders in their respective spaces. And, when we talk about attractive spaces, spaces that probably aren't that attractive right now, energy certainly is at the top of the list, unless you know how to parse through all of that data and make some forecast there. But, yeah, just don't confuse price with value. What do you think, Ron? Yeah, I completely agree with Jason. Don't ever worry about the number of shares of a company that you're buying, the only thing that matters is the amount of capital, the amount of money you are deploying. I know it feels better to own a hundred shares of something versus two shows or something, but honestly, it doesn't make a difference to the investment, it just matters how much money you're putting toward something. If you have a $1,000, I happen to personally be in a similar situation, I just added a $1,000 for the first time to my son's Roth IRA and was trying to decide what to do with it, I was thinking about a third in an S&P 500 Index ETF, and then a third each in two stocks that I think look really great right now. And there are so many, whether it's Microsoft or , , I think  looks good here,  I think looks great here, especially with all that cash they have to deploy. So, I think it's a great time to be getting into the markets, even though it certainly feels uncertain and you might feel a little bit panicky, but I think five or ten years down the road you'll be in good shape. And, Jason, Keaton wasn't asking specifically about penny stocks, but that's really part of the appeal, isn't it? The fact that you can -- particularly when you're just starting out, it's like, \"I've got so many shares.\" And then, to Ron's point, it's like, \"Yeah, you have so many shares of an awful company that's probably going to zero.\" Exactly. I mean, you can rationalize until the cows come home, \"Well, it's only $1, all it has to do is get to $2; and that's a double.\" Again, you got to understand the fundamentals of the business and the economics behind it, because in most cases stocks like those are destined to fail more often than not. We've just got about three minutes left, and I wanted to get your thoughts, guys, on an interesting tweet by our colleague, Brian Feroldi, he basically ran a screen for, companies that have a market cap of over $10 billion and they have no debt. And then, taking those two data points, he was looking for, \"Okay, companies that meet these two requirements, who are the stocks that have dropped the most?\" I was surprised by some of the brand names that we talk about frequently; and this is as of yesterday. , down 43%; , down 41%; , down 39%.I don't know, I look at this list and it seems like a really great starting point. Again, because, Jason, these are not upstart companies, they're not small per se, and they've got no debt. And in times like these, I'm looking for companies that don't have debt. Yeah, I mean, zero debt or at least just very little debt. I got a question like that the other day from one of our members and just, \"Do you feel like these companies here in our scorecard for future of entertainment service, are these companies and their balance sheets OK to withstand this?\" And I think that's a question you have to ask yourself in good times and bad, particularly, in good times, because you have to assume, at some point or another, bad times will come.It was very interesting to see that list of ten. They run the gamut of markets from restaurants to chipmakers and healthcare. Some of those look more attractive than others, but, yeah, there are some high quality businesses on that list. Yeah, what he did, it's called running a screen, and you can choose any criteria, and this is a wonderful one. The $10 billion market cap, no debt, stock's down 40%. That's a great place to start, what a wonderful list that spits out. And then you can just dig in and see what you think about each individual company, whether you like the management team, whether you like the industry that they're selling into, where their customers come from? That's probably a great screen in any time, you know, $10 billion companies with strong balance sheets, you can maybe layer in some valuation criteria, if you're so inclined.But I love investing that way, where I come up with a thesis. There's plenty of software packages out there online where you can, kind of, test it, see what kind of list it spits back at you, and then you tackle each company one at a time. And you do see, in times like these also, it's been a unique time for companies in this low interest rate environment. We've seen a lot of companies out there raising cash through issuing debt, so just because a company has a slug of debt on their balance sheet doesn't necessarily mean they're in a financially precarious situation. Apple is the first name that comes to mind there. About 35 seconds left, Ron. Real quick before we let you go, our habits are changing in our daily lives, what is the biggest change you've made to your diet over the last couple of weeks? I am obscenely focused on frozen pepperoni pizzas unfortunately, so I am making sure to get on that treadmill every morning before the workday starts, otherwise this is not going to end well. I feel sorry for all you people. Mom, thank you for teaching me how to cook when I was a kid, because my diet hasn't changed at all, we're still cooking all the same great stuff and we're using a lot of  spices, of course, Chris. Joining us now via a Zoom Video, Andy Cross. Andy, thanks for being here. When you think about everything that has gone on this week, what goes through your mind as an investor? Hey, guys, it's been an incredible week, obviously. I mean, we have now the worst week probably in the markets since 2008 maybe. We'll probably finish, down more than 12% for the week. So, the news flow, as you guys were talking about earlier in the show, just is really incredible when you just think about all of the information that investors are trying to digest and what that means for the stocks. And we still have so much of the trading driven by algorithms and institutions. The individual investors are actually hanging in there.Some of the data coming out from Vanguard is that the individual investors haven't really been panicking, which is great to see, we love that, we love investors who think much more optimistically, as best you can in this environment.So, when I see this, I personally am just trying to make sure my portfolio is set up for the next five years, capital that I'm going to invest in the markets is capital that I don't need for the next few years, and thinking about the businesses I want to own. And when prices are dropping in dramatic fashion and I see my favorite stocks or stocks I want to add to my portfolio go on sale, I'm looking at this as a time to add. But it's a really important time for investors to maintain that long-term perspective that we've been championing at The Motley Fool for so many years. Yeah, it has been a really, really long negative news cycle. It's been a straight-up month and we've gotten just no good news day after day. So, I think, early on, individual investors certainly, we've been looking for reassurance in some capacity, reassurance that the economy is not going to just completely blow up. So, we're starting to see our policymakers coming up with solutions. I mean, it's taking some time, of course, there's a lot of moving parts here. But I do feel like, every day that passes, we're getting another sign that maybe there is a little bit more reassurance there, which I know it's difficult to see now, but I think down the road, people will start feeling a little bit better about that.And we're also getting, at least some idea of how this could potentially impact the economy over the coming year.  just came out with some forecasts here for the coming year. We've gone from talking about, if we have a recession, really to just how long is this going to last and how bad is it going to get. And based on the numbers from Goldman, they're projecting for Q1 here, that is yet to end, remember that ends at the end of this month, they're talking about -6%. Going into Q2, -24%. Then, assuming that we get back to a little bit more of a state of normalcy, we see positive growth of 12% Q3. And then, 10%, Q4. But that's still a full-year contraction of close to 4%.I mean, this is a tough time for sure, but the more we can get at least some idea of how to quantify this and some reassurance from our policymakers, I think that things will start -- we'll get into a little bit of a better news cycle and I think that'll certainly help the cause. You know, Jason, I think that's a really important point. Investors are going to start to see a lot -- we already have seen a lot of predictions, a lot of estimates, we've already seen companies adjusting our guidance down, we'll get really good insights in the companies that report on their fourth quarter results sometime in April. As we hear that information come in and start to use that information to make decisions.I'll just say, you guys talked about it earlier, not trying to pick the bottom. The market is forward-looking, so the stocks will react far faster than the economic cycle starts to hit that recession. So, don't try to time based on those economic cycles, because you just won't be able to get it, in general. So, all the advice you guys were saying about trying to buy small positions, that's what I'm doing, I'm just buying little positions in some of the businesses I want to own or some of my favorite businesses and I'm going to build on some positions as my portfolio allocation strategy warrants.But the stocks will react far before the economic cycle bottoms, we've seen it time and time again. We're looking for a good news cycle. Let's just start that cycle right here, Chris. Andy, what do you say? This is the good news cycle, it begins right now, right here in this studio . [laughs] I think, for me, as an investor, and I'm sure I'm not alone on this, part of what is a complicating factor is, looking at entire industries where the stocks have been knocked down, thinking, 'Long-term, of course, there's going to be a bright future for that industry,\" but the amount of uncertainty in the short-term keeps me away.And I'll just throw out the airline industry as one example there. An industry which bounced back after 9/11, the business model improved, as evidenced by the fact that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway started jumping in and buying shares of airlines a couple of years ago. The complicating factor right now is, will there be a bailout, what does that look like are other industries going to get bailouts as well?And one more narrative that's out there is, essential services, what are the businesses that are essential to keep everyday life going along. And God bless the people who run  for trying to come out and say, \"GameStop, we're an essential business just like grocery stores or drugstores.\" And I don't blame them for trying, but I'm sorry, if people can't get to the grocery store, they go hungry. If people can't get to the video game store, maybe pick up a book.Well, if you paid attention at all to GameStop's numbers they've been chalking up here over the last year. In the best of times, people weren't going to their stores. So, clearly, you're right, that was a shot in the dark, I don't think that's going to work out very well for them.But, yeah, I do not envy our policymakers at all. The moral hazard involved with making some of these decisions is going to be really, really high, and it's not going to make everyone happy, but it is a matter of prioritizing. And airlines, you could argue, are very essential to our way of life. You look at what's going on in Nevada, for example. I mean, I was listening to the call between the President and the Governor of Nevada yesterday, and bless him for trying, but I don't know that you necessarily look at the gambling industry and say, that's necessary, obviously, the ripple effects with all of the jobs that it impacts. Again, they're going to have to be choices made and priorities assigned. And that's just going to be very, very difficult to do.You know, guys, I was thinking about that morale hazard question, Jason, that you were just saying, and thinking about the decisions across the industries, the people, of course, a lot of consumers and a lot of employers and employees are going to be really challenged by this. We saw some of the initial unemployment claims come out this week and they really spiked. And so, we're just seeing this, this will start a ripple effect and the unemployment levels will certainly increase and might even double maybe even more than that.So, we're going to see a lot of business challenges and decisions to make for that. As an investor, I'm not thinking about this as a time to really start looking at those companies that are really struggling, that are going to potentially be rescued. Take a company like . I mean, the stock has just been decimated over the last couple of months, and now they're looking for maybe a $60 billion handout. And it's been struggling even before this with all the 737 challenges.So, as an investor there are just too many great businesses, when I look out five and ten years, that will be around, that will be more meaningful, that will be more relevant to consumers. They're innovating, their customers are going to be returning to those businesses time and time again. And the businesses are not leveraged in a capital structure way that's going to put them looking for that capital, looking for more and more help from the Federal government per se.And I think those are the opportunities you really want to look for, because those stocks, as you guys were talking about in the earlier section, so many of those businesses are down 30%, 40% and use that as an opportunity to be buying their stocks.And you'll hear a lot about the Federal government supporting and coming in with fiscal measures (sic) to support some of those businesses' bailout, just like we saw in 2008-2009. You're also going to have a lot of businesses that will continue to chug-along through this time and use this as an opportunity to build up their solutions and take market share. Our email address is . From Kevin Marcotte, who writes, \"Thank you for continuing the daily podcast, even with everyone at home, it's great to keep the daily routines of being able to listen to you guys and read your articles as a member of your services. I wanted to share my unexpected personal experience over the past couple of weeks as the market has been going through wild swings. I've been listening to The Motley Fool for years and slowly built up my portfolio and active watchlist. I feel I've done reasonably well to stay calm as the market has been dropping. What really shocked me the other day was when the market went up and stocks were up 5% to 10% in a single day. And that is when I started to get fearful. There's a small panic in me that I've just missed the bottom. I'm in my mid-30s, so I'm thankful that I get decades more to be invested, but am I crazy to feel more emotional on the up days than I am on the down days? Thanks. And I always appreciate the work that you guys do.\"Thank you, Kevin, for being one of the dozens of listeners and a member of our services. And you're not crazy. But his email, Jason, does speak to the heightened emotion. We've talked about the rise in the volatility index, I think it's reasonable that there is a rise in everyone's emotions too. Oh, easily. And thanks, Kevin. I will say that's a two-way street there, as much as it helps with our listeners' daily routines, I can assure you it helps with ours as well, because we're grateful to be able to bring you all these shows every day and every week.I think that's just so -- I can almost picture myself sitting in my chair, seeing the market up on a day where it seems like there's just no good news in sight. You're trying to think, this makes no sense. It's like the company that releases their earnings report and everything is just stellar and the stock tanks 20%. You can't figure it out, sometimes it's very difficult to rationalize what's going on in the market. I definitely understand that fear, and that's why it's just so important to be able to take a step back, give yourself a minute to collect your thoughts, never act in haste; you know, you can be very successful investing, just take it slowly. It's very interesting, how our brains operate at times of stress and what is firing inside our minds, because Kevin's example is an example of FOMO, the Fear Of Missing Out. And so many had it over maybe the last couple of years, \"Oh, the stock now has gone up from $100 to $150, I don't want to buy it.\" And then it goes on to $300. Now, of course, all those businesses and so many stocks have pulled back. But now you're starting to see a little different side of the FOMO coin, and people are starting to see, \"Oh, I'm trying to, again, get the right bottom, the right timing around it.\" And that's a very dangerous complete approach to take. Don't think that way. Yes, there are times when you may be more aggressive in the markets, and not when stocks are really starting to fall off. We saw that in 2008 when all of the market drop started happening in the Fall and then the market bottomed in 2009. So, you have time to buy in these positions in little increments. And I would really encourage us to think about that way as opposed to thinking, I might have missed out on something.Because even if a stock rebounds 15% in a day, and we will see those, it doesn't mean that you necessarily missed out when you think about the next three, five, seven years of investing. Whatever you do, don't fall victim to FOBI, that is, the Fear Of Being Invested. We want to do the opposite, we want to be invested, don't fall victim to FOBI. This is not the time, folks. Andy, let me start with you, before we get to the stocks on our radar. It's hard for me to imagine that there aren't going to be entire industries that change. Yes, they will adapt. Yes, they will continue to do business, just as the airlines adapted after 9/11, but I'm curious, when you think about either individual companies or entire industries, what are you the most curious to see what the long-term ripple effects of all of this are? Oh, so many, Chris, when I think about the businesses that are going to have to evolve in this, and I think this will be a catalyst for so many to do. Obviously, collaborative work tools come immediately to mind.What's interesting, I was thinking about talking to my brothers. They just closed the gyms, I think, in Virginia. And my brother, who lives over in Virginia was a little bit upset. And I, first of all, was like, \"Codo, you shouldn't be going to a gym. Codo, you're a listener of , so don't go to the gym.\" But it did get me thinking, I've been pretty hard on , but businesses like that, you have a lot of continued interest in just health and wellness. And how are we going to become healthier, how are we going to change our habits, will we continue to go to the gym, will we continue to congregate for health events in person? That's just something that I was thinking about.I use a lot of apps to monitor my health and to hopefully stay healthy; training systems on my bike. And I just think we're going to see more and more of those initiatives keep up through the virus, but actually after this, as well. So, I'm more interested in how consumers adapt to the health and wellness post coronavirus? Jason, we've talked a lot about streaming entertainment and the opportunity there for those businesses. Earlier in the week, on , Mac Greer and Dan Kline talked about , a business that was, sort of, on death's door and suddenly saw its shares rise dramatically this week. Maybe there's an opportunity for food delivery companies, I don't know, but to your way of thinking, what are you curious to see, in terms of long-term ripple effects? Yeah, you know, the Blue Apron thing, really -- I get it, but let's remember, folks -- much like acquisitions, coronavirus is not a thesis, so don't go out and invest in Blue Apron because now you think these meal prep kits all of a sudden makes sense. You know, the economics and the competitive disadvantages still exist.For me, travel to me looks like it's going to be a fascinating opportunity here in the coming months and years. You don't know where things are going to ultimately get back to normal. And look at companies like , we think about all of the ski resorts that have shut down recently, Vail Resorts is one that to me, I don't think people are going to -- I think that once we get back to a state of normalcy, I think people are going to be really itching to get out and go do things again.But the other one I keep on looking, and I've done more and more research over the past week here, I really think these are just nothing but tailwinds for a cashless society, Chris. The research either tells you, these viruses can live on paper money for up to, like, 14 to 17 days, which is just insane to think about. And if you walk around these days and you see anybody paying for anything with cash, it almost is like, \"Ew!\" you know there's like \"Ew!\" factor. So, yeah, I do think the electronic payments system and how we pay for things, I think this hastens that move toward cashless. Alright. Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Steve Broido is going to hit you with a question. Andy Cross, you're up first, what are you looking at this week? I'm looking at , symbol RDFN. Market cap of $1.1 billion, it's a residential real estate broker, really built for the 21 century, provides services for home buying at a much lower rate and much lower fee than your typical broker. What was interesting is, this weekend they announced that they're pausing RedfinNow, which is the business that buys and sells homes directly. That really has been a nice growth engine for them. Their CEO, Glenn Kelman, came out and just said, \"We remain committed as ever to giving homeowners the option of an instant offer, but we really want to know what that fair price is, and right now we don't.\" so, they've paused that, it's 30% in their sales last year, and it's really been an engine of growth. So, I'm just kind of watching that. The stock was IPO'd at $15, peaked out $33 last year. Now, it's at $13 after falling as low as $10. So, really rough time for Redfin. So, it has my attention, it's recommended in a few of our services. Steve, a question about Redfin? So, if I recall correctly, after 9/11 there was a housing boom. Do we expect the same after something like this? You know, the housing market, obviously, over the next couple of months at least is going to be pretty disrupted, because it's such a large purchase for so many people and there's going to be some concerns on that. But I think over the next year or two, Steve, I think we'll see a resurgence in homebuying. Jason Moser, what are you looking at? Yeah, I'm talking about keeping our eyes on high quality business, market leaders, , ticker ISRG, is one that I've gotten my eye on. Like most stocks, it's down 30% over these past several weeks, for good reason. I mean, we talked about, on , several weeks back that while they recorded a good quarter, they placed 336 new da Vinci systems, global procedure growth was 19%. And recurring revenue continues to be such a strong part of the business model there.But they are running into some elongated consideration cycles. And ultimately what that means, there's more competition out there competing for the space, they're not the only game in town anymore when it comes to robotic surgery, so that was playing out a little bit on their revenue growth estimates and perhaps a little bit on the margin line as well. Now, they're getting this, sort of, second wave, where hospitals are, obviously, having to prioritize focusing on taking care of folks with COVID-19 as opposed to other surgeries. Yeah, I look at this pull back in Intuitive Surgical, there's potentially an opportunity here. Steve? Is there a virtual medicine component here for Intuitive Surgical, yes or no? Yes. Yes, there is, they have their IRIS Augmented Reality System, which is in clinical use now. What do you want to add to your watchlist, Steve? ISRG, baby. Hey, now. Alright. Andy Cross, Jason Moser, thanks for being here. Thank you. Thanks, Chris. That's going to do it for this week's show. Thanks for listening, we'll see you next week.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The restaurant industry is on the verge of being irreversibly altered from the global coronavirus pandemic. Even where  are not disrupting dining habits, social distancing and self-isolation are causing havoc with chains.\u00a0Data from   OpenTable online reservation service shows seated diners at restaurants in its network all across the country have plummeted 98% from the year ago period as of March 19, a dramatic change from just one week prior when only reservations had fallen by just 28%. The last time they showed growth was March 1, meaning in less than three weeks' time going out to dinner as an option has all but completely ended.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.While that's perhaps a necessary outcome in the fight to stop the spread of COVID-19, it also means that casual dining restaurant operators like  , which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, as well as upscale dining restaurants like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, are facing a gloomy future.Where fast food outlets such as   can fall back on their drive-thru windows -- even fast-casual leader   has come to rely upon its Chipotlanes for increased business -- the casual dining sector's takeout and delivery business has always been ancillary to their business.Darden ran $5 takeout specials last quarter that  and helped boost the top line, and Applebees and IHOP owner   says takeout represents about 10% of its business with delivery accounting for around 3% or so.For Chili's owner   the percentage is a bit higher at around 17% for takeout and delivery, but casual dining is still one typically defined by dining in and sitting down. It's almost a requirement for fine dining.Beyond having to change the way they operate, restaurants have also found it necessary to step up assistance for their employees through what is hoped will be a relatively short disruption.\u00a0Increased pay, emergency benefits, and time off are some of the policies restaurant have offered their workers, yet many times they represent the sort of benefits the workers have been  across the industry before the pandemic.It now may become difficult to rescind a lot of these programs after the crisis passes, and many will undoubtedly continue to live on in some form afterwards. Employees may have heightened expectations that restaurants will continue to care for their employees with beefed up benefits, even if they're not as extensive as they were through the pandemic.Many service workers have continued to ensure food and other necessities were available while the public was able to practice social distancing and self-isolation. Perception may shift more in favor of them being offered enhanced benefits going forward.Darden Restaurants is one of the world's largest casual dining chains and how it responds to the crisis and comes out on the other end will likely result in many other chains following suit, both within the casual segment and without.The paid sick leave policy, for example, is now permanent. It had been rolling it out already across the company, but accelerated its adoption in response to the pandemic. Others may offer some form of the benefit going forward as well.Yet it's also true  on thin margins as it is, and less financially secure operators won't be able to do so, even if they survive. That's why this industry may be forever altered by this experience.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson went on CNBC today, and the comments he made there appeared propitious for the whole entire travel industry.But, first, here's the bad news: According to Sorenson, the  has already damaged Marriott's business more than did 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis, combined. With hotels closing around the world, the situation facing Marriott today is \"dramatically worse than what we saw in those two prior crises,\" said Sorenson. Revenue in the U.S. alone could be down 90% this quarter, and 75% around the globe. \u00a0Sorenson went on to predict that while 2020's numbers will be abysmal, business \"will come back\" after the coronavirus is gone, and 2021 will probably look \"a whole lot more like 2019.\" \u00a0So what does that mean for investors?In 2019, Marriott earned $1.3 billion in net profit. A recent market capitalization of $25.6 billion means that while we can expect Marriott's P/E ratio to skyrocket later this year as coronavirus-depressed numbers roll onto the income statement, Marriott stock is still trading for less than 20 times what the CEO thinks it might resume earning in 2021.Let's extend that logic to the other  enjoying rebounds today. Booking Holdings stock might look pretty pricey later this year as well, but if  year it can earn at least what it earned  year, then Booking's forward P/E should be about 10.6, and\u00a0Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico would be only a bit more expensive at 12.2 times those hypothetical 2021 profits.Today, investors appear to be betting that this rebound will happen.

As most of the world hunkers down in place, the $12 billion online booking site reckons it could be through the worst of the virus. First-quarter sales are expected to halve, but boss Jane Sun also sees a rebound coming at home, where the epidemic may be ebbing. It offers a glimmer of hope in a sea of economic gloom.Travel has been one of the industries hit hardest by Covid-19. In China, the start of the outbreak coincided with the weeklong Lunar New Year festival, a peak time for taking trips. As a result of quarantines and contagion fears, some $4.4 billion of Trip orders were cancelled. Weak demand, along with the company\u2019s generous refund policies, will hurt the bottom line. Its adjusted operating loss may be as much as about $260 million in the first quarter.Sun is starting to see light through the fog, though. Even as international flights are grounded and countries close their borders, the People\u2019s Republic is gradually lifting curbs. Trip says hotels and airlines across the country are resuming business and it anticipates a quick recovery in domestic tourism. Likewise, smaller peer Tongcheng-Elong <0780.HK> earlier this month reported a surge in hotel and flight reservations at the end of February; notably, airline ticket sales for June also have ticked up as travellers look ahead.Despite the serious risk of a resurgence in cases in China, Trip\u2019s clearer outlook is a far cry from peers such as Expedia <EXPE.O> and Booking <BKNG.O>. Both have recently withdrawn financial guidance, citing\u00a0the pandemic. Moreover, Sun and other executives have gone out of their way to reassure investors and customers, including taking voluntary pay cuts of up to half their salaries and guaranteeing cancellations.Nasdaq-listed Trip shares were already faring slightly better for its sector before its latest outlook. After falling by more than a third since the start of the year, they are trading at some 17 times forward earnings, according to Refinitiv data, more than twice as high as Expedia\u2019s valuation. That\u2019s at least one small encouraging sign for those only starting their coronavirus journey.Additional reporting by Sharon Lam.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["With the stock market about 30% off its all-time highs as of this recording, and four-digit moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average every day for more than a week, we were certain that our\u00a0\u00a0listeners had quite a few questions.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. It's Monday, March 16. I'm your host Jason Moser, and on today's show, we're going to dive into some listener Q&A. You know, it's obviously a unique time right now with COVID-19 bringing everything to a virtual standstill. So, over the weekend we reached out on  to see what questions you listeners have given everything that's going on? And we thought we'd dive into them today.Joining me, as always, is Certified Financial Planner, Matt Frankel. Matt, how's everything going? Pretty good. It's really weird talking to you face-to-face because normally we don't see each other while we're recording. [laughs] Yeah, it's a little bit of a different time. And, for listeners, if you're wondering, if the audio is a little different, it is a little bit different. We, right now, have closed Fool HQ for nonessential stuff. And while I'm sure you all view your podcasts as essential, as we do as well, you know, we have technology on our side here to be able to record in trying times like these. And so, I'm actually at my house, Matt is at his house, but thanks to our man Austin Morgan, he's going to make all this work for us. And I think this ought to work out well.So, Matt, let's just go ahead and jump right into it. The first question we have here on Twitter is from @RoseSelavy2, who asks, \"Will the corona pandemic be the great paradigm shift to boost digital payments? And while the EU gets punched in the face, what's your view on ?\"So, let's just go ahead and start that question of, first-and-foremost. It seems like the main question here is in regard to the shift toward digital payments. And I certainly do think this is another one of those periods in time where, it does seem like, logically speaking, it makes more sense to use less cash and rely more on digital payments in times like these. I was looking at some different takes here over the weekend, and there's no question you're looking at situations, they are talking about how pathogens and viruses can live on most surfaces for around 48 hours, but paper money can reportedly transport live flu virus for up to 17 days.That just goes to say that paper money and even coins definitely can transmit those germs, those viruses. And I could see why that would prompt people to want to use less cash. And definitely physicians out there, the World Health Organization, have warned that the virus can be transmitted to customers via banknotes and coins. And so, regardless of your location, using cash is going to, in some cases, probably up the risk there and consequently I think we'll probably see more of the option of digital payments as time goes on. I don't know that this is something that we'll necessarily forget so quickly.But in regard to Adyen, I did look into Adyen over the weekend and I had not looked at it before, it's a relatively new company on the market. But they call themselves a tech company trying to redefine the payments business. And so, it plays an interesting role in that value chain of payments, but I'd have to dig into it more to get a full understanding of what they view as their competitive advantage.But there are a lot of things in its favor, strong balance sheet with more than $1 billion in cash. The Co-Founder, Pieter van der Does, is the CEO of the company. The value proposition seems to be that it's a single platform to serve from transaction, to initiation, to risk management, to processing. And they certainly are processing their fair share of currency. I mean, there's about \u20ac160 billion processed through Adyen networks in 2018. So, not making a call on the stock, but definitely one that I'm going to get on my radar to learn more about, because playing in this massive payment space, it does look like Adyen could be another way to do that. So, thanks for the question there.Next question up, we have from @Namredla5, who asks, \"When the market sells-off like this, what's the best way to differentiate between the business stock price just going down with the overall market or a business that might actually have its earnings and revenue take a hit in the coming quarters? Airlines are obvious, but others aren't.\"Matt, you had a chance to take a look at this, what's your thinking there? Well, first of all, I want to make it perfectly clear, most businesses are likely to take a pretty big earnings hit because of this. There are a very few stocks I could point to that I would say are just going down because of the overall market, most businesses are going to be affected in one way or another. I mean, the U.S. economy is essentially ground to a halt, that's why we're both sitting in our houses right now instead of in offices. [laughs]But having said that, I would focus the most on companies that have strong balance sheets, companies that have clear competitive advantages, lots of demand for their products. I mean,  is one that just immediately comes to mind, no one's going to stop buying iPhones after this. They might stop temporarily, but once the dust settles, you're going to see demand pick up. Their revenues and earnings are certainly going to take a hit, at least for the first few quarters of the year, but in the long run they're going to be just fine. They have a ton of cash, big brand name, competitive advantage. And those are the types of businesses I'm looking at, I'm not looking for businesses that aren't going to take an earnings hit, because you're fighting a losing battle there, so. Yeah, it does really feel like. This is a true bear market. I mean, these event-driven bear markets. I mean, they just don't discriminate, and it's just amazing to see even a company, like, Apple selling off the way it has. And we've talked a lot about Apple, going into this year the stock has performed so well. And that's really been a function of multiple expansion, more than anything. It's not, like, the company is growing its profits at some breakneck speed, but the market is just giving it a lot of credit for the dominant company that it is, right? Right. And it's just that I would avoid companies that are really going to take a hit. I mean, airlines look really enticing right now, but I wouldn't go anywhere near them. Same with things like cruise lines, there's so many moving parts there. And if you think a stock like a major airline couldn't possibly go to $0, I can guarantee you that it's a possibility. It's happened before. [laughs] Yeah, we've seen it before. And just because it goes down, doesn't mean it's necessarily going to come up. And it's always helpful to try to identify the catalyst that ultimately will bring it back up. With some companies, the catalyst is very obvious, and with others, it's not so obvious.So, we have another question here from @deedubya78, who asks, \"The online bankers, like, , shouldn't have coronavirus fears, but they dropped significantly as well. How do we evaluate them in comparison to banks that have brick-and-mortar components?\" What say ye, Matt? I would say, you're thinking about it wrong. The banks aren't dropping because people don't want to go to branches and things like that. The banks are dropping for a couple of reasons. One, a big one, interest rates have plunged, especially if you look at the treasury yields, the 10-year treasury yield is roughly one-fourth of what it was at its peak not much more than a year ago. Banks make their money by loaning out to customers and getting paid interest, if they're charging less interest on loans, then they're going to make less money. No. 2, and probably more importantly in this scenario, if we do get a big global recession, which is looking increasingly likely, it's going to really decrease demand for loans, it's going to cause defaults to rise. And that's true whether you're an online bank or a brick-and-mortar bank. Online banks do have an inherent cost advantage, but they're not at all immune to the effects of a recession. Yeah, that's a really good point. And I was thinking about another bank that lacks the bricks-and-mortar presence. And remember, not all that long ago, we had the President of , Huntley Garriott. We interviewed him for the show and we talked a little bit more about Live Oak Bank and what its value proposition was. Pretty much a bank built on technology and their focus is really on small business lending, and they don't have any physical branches either.Another stock that has just gotten really trounced here in this sell-off, in this bear market, and yet to your point, I mean, hey, there is no physical presence to worry about, but is this \"a baby with the bathwater\" situation? It could be, particularly, if we think that maybe as we recover from this, banks like Live Oak are going to play a pivotal role in making sure a lot of these small businesses that really feel the pinch from this, making sure they actually are able to get back up on their feet. That remains to be seen.I mean, I think that could be seen as potentially a catalyst for something like Live Oak, and that maybe starts the conversation of, is this a time to be looking at a company like that? But, yeah, to your point, it's just not discriminating, it's everything is getting hammered here. And that's just what happens with bear markets, and we've seen this before and we'll see it again.A question here from @TMFBowman, who asks, \"Will there be widespread bankruptcies, and what companies will go first?\"And, you know, I think that's an interesting question. I think the market right now, you know, what we're seeing, because we saw, obviously, the Fed drop rates to basically 0% here over the weekend and introducing new quantitative easing, trying to get more money into the system and free up the financial system. So, that access to funding is not so difficult. But it, kind of, feels like to me, they're missing the point.The market, to me, wants reassurance, not rate cuts. And so, I think until it actually gets reassurance, we're going to see this thing going bonkers. And I mean, when I say reassurance, that's either going to come in the form of virus abatement later, which hopefully will happen at some point here sooner or later, or financial aid to support the millions of jobs and lives that are being put on hold here.And I think that perhaps where we're not seeing enough done is actually the commitment to the financial aid to help people meet payrolls, to help people that are dealing with hiatus from employment, that hasn't really happened yet. Now, I know Congress is working on passing a bill here to help move things along, but we haven't gotten anything yet. And I imagine, once they get that passed, it's going to feel like we need more.If companies do go bankrupt, I would suspect it would be the small and medium sized businesses first. I think the companies that just don't have the financial resources to deal with any kind of extended time like this, any kind of extended stretch, those are probably going to be the companies that do go first. I do feel like we will probably have somewhat of a safety net pulled in here that will keep bankruptcy still minimum, but there will likely be some.Airlines I think is one of the markets we keep on talking about, Matt. And clearly, D.C. is already talking about ways to help keep the airlines propped up, because it does seem like the situation is only getting worse for them. Yeah, and I mean, like you said, if I were just to look at the numbers right now, you know, obviously, I would have to bet on airlines or cruise lines or something to that effect to go bankrupt, but there are so many moving parts here. We don't know what a bailout bill could look like. I mean, going into the financial crisis, you would have bet on the banks to go bankrupt but they got so much capital injected into them. And the system kind of propped them up that the big ones were all OK in the end. So, I think the same thing is going to happen here. Yeah. And, you know, that's interesting, I'm glad you brought that example up, because I remember very vividly, back at that time, you remember Washington Mutual, and back in the time of the financial crisis Washington Mutual was one of the big players in the mortgage space. I mean, this was one of those companies that were kicking around, is this too big to fail? And then you have this conversation of, \"Well, are they going to nationalize banks? If they do, what does that look like?\" And at the end of the day, you saw some financial institutions go belly up but most didn't, but some did and Washington Mutual was one of them. Yeah, it's really too early to tell, I'd say another week or so, we'll have a lot more clarity from the legislative standpoint of it. Yeah, I think that's a good point. And I do think, you know, this is one of these environments where after the dust all settles here, this is one of those situations where we're going to look back on this period of time here. And the strong really do get stronger in times like these. I mean, companies that go into bear markets, economic pullbacks like this, a crisis like this, the companies that go in here with the strength, the competitive advantage, they come out oftentimes a lot stronger. So, maybe that helps make some sense of what your watchlist should look like. Look at ...Yeah, a good example. Very good example. ... before and after the financial crisis. They went from being, well, one of the big players, but to being, you know, the powerhouse in the industry. They were, I'd say, the strongest of the Big Four going into that. Yep, absolutely. Okay, we have a question from @Sandeep and David who asks, \"On which companies do you think Warren Buffett is spending his $120 billion?\" Matt, I know you have a couple of thoughts here. [laughs] As much as he can get his hands on, I'm hoping. A few things I hope he's buying right now. I hope, first of all, he's buying a lot of  shares back because Berkshire's getting hit just like the regular market. It was down 10% this morning. I hope he's taking advantage. I mean, they bought shares back at about $218 last quarter, which remember, to buy back shares they have to, both him and Munger have to agree it's trading cheaply. And if they thought it was cheap at $218 then the $170s, I'm sure they really think it's cheap.But beyond that, I hope they're buying some of their favorite bank stocks because financials have -- as we just mentioned a little while ago -- have really gotten hit. I hope they're adding to the positions like ;  is another one that they own a lot of that they could buy some more; ; our war-on-cash stocks,  and , Buffett owns a little bit of. His energy stocks,  is looking terrible. And as most people who speculated with the airlines, I would love to see Buffett take this opportunity to acquire a whole airline cheaply. But I honestly, as much as this is an unpopular opinion, I don't see that actually happening. Yeah. I would be kind of surprised actually to see that. It does feel like he would buy a lot more Apple in a situation like this. And I'm just going to offer up my periodic reminder that  is still looking really, really nice out there. Market cap is now pulled back below $17 billion. This could be a meaningful acquisition, you know, from that elephant gun perspective, without having to spend all your money in one place. And you know how I feel about McCormick, Matt. Yeah. I'd like to see Buffett acquire, that's a very Buffett business. It's a timeless business. I mean, they sell their products no matter what kind of economy is going on. Yeah, that's right, good or bad, they still sell a lot of it. Okay. How about this question from @tara98333, she says, \"Jemo, thanks for listening to us.\" You're welcome, Tara. \"Analysis of fintech companies that will hurt versus benefit the most, also, who has enough cash and debt to survive this crisis?\"So, Matt, let's tackle the fintech companies that you think walk out of here looking better versus the ones that are going to have some trouble to deal with. What are some of the companies that you feel like are hurt more from a bear market like this? Well, most will hurt. The companies that are going to get hurt the most are the ones that, both, process payments and lend money. If you think of, like, a Visa and MasterCard, they're essentially the middleman. They get a small percentage of each transaction they process and in a recession the payment volume is going to drop but their risk is limited because they don't actually loan any money, they're just the middleman. Whereas when you think of a company that actually makes loans, like, I hate to say it, one of my favorites in the world, . [laughs] I was going to go to that one eventually. They not only are, kind of, a middleman processing payments, but they have a pretty substantial business lending program. With Square Capital, you're talking ... ... With Square Capital. Now, having said that Square Capital is not your average loan program. I worry more about a company, like, an AmEx or a  in this environment with actual consumer lending exposure. But at the same time, the companies that do both sides of the fintech business, the loans and the processing are likely to feel a sting. But on a good note, most of our favorite fintechs really don't have a ton of debt, they're mostly cash-rich companies.I mean, Square, , Visa, MasterCard, all of them have solid balance sheets. So, I don't see any of them getting hurt to the point where they're going to have to raise capital or shut down or anything like that. But they could get hurt in the short-term and it's really a question of how quickly this pandemic really works itself through the system and how quickly the economy rebounds afterwards that's really going to name the winners. Yeah. And you know, I'm glad you brought up Square and its two-sided network there, because it does a lot. And on the one hand, it's nice it has that diversified business, but on the other, you can see its exposure to \u2013 I mean, most of its clients, most of its customers are the small- and medium-sized businesses that are really starting to feel the pain from this and will feel the pain for some time to come. And so, in the near-term, I can see that being a problem, obviously, it's going to result in fewer dollars flowing through that network and probably fewer customer signing up, because fewer businesses are starting in conditions like these.However, I do also think that maybe this is a little bit of a light at the end of the tunnel here, but I do feel like with Square and Square Capital, they're going to be seen as part of the solution to this. I mean, this is going to be part of the solution and being able to help people recover. And we know how Jack Dorsey is, he's a good person, I think this is going to be something that really becomes central to his focus here in the coming year and beyond, is helping all of the small business customers get back on their feet and they'll use Square Capital to do that. And, perhaps, that expands their customer base, because they're seen as a way to work through what is, obviously, a big problem for a lot of small- and medium-sized businesses out there today.I'd agree. In tough times, I'd rather owe money to Jack Dorsey than to Bank of America or one of those. [laughs] It's just a better situation to be in. Yeah. He seems to be a little bit more empathetic. [laughs] Alright. Well, let's take a look here at a question from @Chris63130109. Man, you got to get all those numbers out of that user ID, buddy, but anyway, here we go, \"My brother works for a popular SaaS company. He gave everyone $15,000 worth of stock for Christmas.\" Damn! that's a nice brother. \"We moved $4,000 out and diversified into other stocks, and we've been adding every two weeks since. Should I lower the SaaS position more? Is the portfolio still too weighted? Thanks for any help.\"So, everybody's risk tolerance is going to be different. I mean, when you look at that on the numbers there, you're close to 33% there that you've only taken out of that $15,000 position. In other words, you kept essentially, it sounds like, about 65% or so of that position in that one company; if I'm reading that correctly. In any case, if you have that much exposure in your portfolio to one particular company, that's a lot. Now, I'm not saying, it's right or wrong, it's just you need to be aware of the fact that you've got a lot of eggs in one basket there.Now, if this is just one part of your overall investment portfolio, Chris, I'm not sure. And I don't know what SaaS company this is, so take this with a grain of salt. My initial reaction here though, is that you probably would want to diversify that money out into some other holdings. I think that we've certainly seen the benefits of diversification over the last few weeks here as the market generally has been feeling so much pain. But, yeah, I would definitely at least look at that and see if there are not some other places for that money to go.Next question here from @SherifMarcos, who asks, \"What do you think about a company like , trading for less than cash-on-hand. $900 million market cap versus $1 billion in cash ... \" That has changed since he asked the question; it is a little bit cheaper today, but \" ... with gas where it's at and interest in debt being next to free, do you see a multi-bagger from here?\"And I would just say here, Sheriff, that while Spirit is a company that has been recommended in a couple of our Foolish services, you know it has not performed very well, unfortunately, and obviously, this is a very difficult time for a small airline. And you made a good point there, it's a small company that's less than $1 billion market cap now.They do have a balance sheet rich with cash, however, in some instances, I don't count that cash in some cases. In the cases where I don't really count that cash are situations like this, where you know that airline is going to need that cash. It's going to be lucky if it can make it through without any assistance. Chances are it's probably going to need some type of a bailout, given what we know about the state of the airline industry right now. I mean, there's talk of putting all flights in the U.S. on hold, which is, I can't even fathom what that would look like. I mean, I know we had to harken back to the days of 9/11 when that feeling, I think, last existed.But I look at Spirit today and I don't know that I would view that as a multi-bagger opportunity because of all of the headwinds on the horizon. And I wouldn't count that balance sheet as anything other than some cash that they're going to need and they're going to need more. So, I would not value the company based on that cash at all. I would instead try to understand a little bit better what moves the airline industry forward from this. We go back to talking about [how] the strongest survive. I don't know that Spirit Airlines is necessarily the strongest out there right now, and I'm not saying that it's going to go out of business, but I'm saying from an investor's perspective, I don't know that I would have this top on the list, and I certainly wouldn't be looking at that $1 billion on the balance sheet as really any type of an asset that investors would ultimately see. Right. And being an airline is a capital-intensive business, it costs a lot to put a plane in the air, it costs a lot to just own and maintain a plane. Airlines are set to lose billions of dollars from this. You've probably seen pictures being tweeted of flights with, like, three people in them, the airlines lose a ton of money when that happens. Yeah. I mean I saw a flight. There was a video the other day, I'm assuming this is real, but it was a flight to France and there was, like, one guy on the entire plane. He was doing the worm up-and-down the aisle. [laughs] Which was just bizarre-looking. But, yeah, you just think the airlines are taking a bath on that, but that's just the situation that we're in right now. You'd be surprised how quickly an airline can run through $1 billion of cash when that happens. Yeah, absolutely, it disappears in the blink of an eye. Okay, Matt, we have another question here from, I love this, @UnderdogIsHere1. Danny asks, \"Any insights into the huge swings in  the last couple of days? If you could add one company to the war-on-cash basket who would it be? Thanks for all that you both do.\"Danny, thanks for the question and the kind words. And, Matt, I knew you were thrilled to see a question on Green Dot, so I'm going to let you take it. I am. I would actually put the second-half of that question to you, but we'll get to that. For Green Dot, my take on it is that Green Dot's core business of prepaid cards could get hit really hard in the recession. It's just a business that, No. 1, is just declining in general, but No. 2, it depends on consumer spending, like we've been talking about a lot of them.And on the other hand, I think the market doesn't really know how to value the Banking-as-a-Service side of Green Dot's business, the infrastructure it sets up for companies like Apple and  and Stash and things like that. And it's such a new concept to provide third-party banking services to other companies that I just don't really think the market knows what to do with that.But it's worth mentioning that Green Dot is still after a 30% market drop, well off its lows. Today it's actually one of the better performers in the entire financial sector. Remember it dropped a lot a little while ago when the CEO announced his retirement unexpectedly. Green Dot is still about 30% higher than its low when we were talking about it last time. So, it's holding up pretty nicely. It's been pretty volatile, along with the rest of the financial sector, but it's actually been one of the better performers.As far as a company to add to the war-on-cash basket, that's kind of your basket, so I was going to put that one over to you. Well, I'll give you one name I would throw out there, and then to see if you have one too, I'm always interested in what you have to say. You know, for a long time, thought I would just go with , but you know what the other company, I feel like I probably put in there before MercadoLibre, is . And really, just, you know, learning more about Shopify and the business opportunity that exists for a company like this, the Shopify payments part of the business, and they work in conjunction with Stripe to run a lot of money through their networks.I think I might actually put Shopify in there over MercadoLibre, but it's a really close call there, I don't know, do you have one in mind? I mean, I don't disagree with that. Maybe AmEx is one that I would add to it just because I like a lot of what they're doing. Especially because they're a unique kind of credit card company in the sense that they're being interactive in embracing millennials and that sort of thing. Their Lounge network is obviously a play toward millennial travelers and things like that. And I think it's going to be a good opportunity to pick them up right now. Yeah, I think you're right. And what we're seeing with American Express too is that they've been able to pivot, more or less, their business toward that younger demographic. They've been able to expand their product offering and change the whole perception of what it means to be an American Express cardholder. I mean, for the longest time you were a high-cut if you had an American Express card, but now it's really, it's a card for everyone. They've got a lot of different products out there that can fit a lot of different needs. And so, I do applaud them for being able to do such a good job with that. And I think the brand, obviously, there's tremendous amount of brand equity there that would be hard to overcome as a competitor.Okay. Let's take a look here, another question from @BrockHBriggs, who asks, \"Rates have continued to go lower over the last little bit and successful banks have found other ways to make money besides interest to continue their growth, is this sustainable for them over the long-term because the Fed seems to think lowering rates is the answer to everything?\" [laughs]You're right, Brock, they definitely do figure that is the answer to everything, as we've seen here over the weekend as well, but, Matt, what's your take here? And this question was posted before the Fed decided to chop interest rates to 0%. So, that was a happy coincidence there. But, yes, banks could definitely make money in a zero-interest rate environment, they're still going to charge interest on loans, you might see mortgage rates drop to 3% or even 2.5%. You know, it's the same with auto loans, personal loans and pretty much every other banking product. Like, for example, credit card interest rates are directly tied to the Federal funds rate, but this was just \u2013 I mean, I say, just, but this was a 100-basis point cut, meaning that, if your credit card was charging you 17% interest, it's now charging you 16%. So, banks are still making money, it's not like interest is being eliminated totally.So, profit margins are definitely going to be squeezed when interest rates fall and the Fed lowers rates. I don't see the Fed going negative, despite what some people in the media have said. This is a not-so-bold prediction in my mind that the Fed is not going to even entertain the thought of negative interest rates despite what the President has said.So, this will be a profitable environment for banks. In the long run, like you said, they'll come out of it, I think, even stronger than before because they're very financially sound. If you remember that since the financial crisis, banks have had to be stress-tested. So, we know that the big banks, especially, can really survive even a much more terrible downturn than even the worst-case scenario of this could be.I forget the exact requirements for the stress testing, but it's something, like, 20% unemployment or something like that. So, the banks are fine. They're going to make money. It won't be as much money for a little while, but they're still going to be profitable.And it's also worth mentioning, for all of the banks that have investment banking divisions, which is pretty much all of the big ones, volatility is actually usually a positive for trading revenue. I want to say, for Goldman Sachs, 2009 was its most profitable year ever and volatility is a big reason for it. So, you're right, they do have other ways to make money, interest rates are going to hurt profits but not by as much as you may think. Okay. And let's piggyback on that discussion there into this next question from @TeddyMacGaron, and Teddy asks, \"What should I think about banks in a zero-interest rate environment, which could come very soon?\"And clearly that day is today. But his question, kind of, gets to another important issue here, what about the differences between big banks and small regional banks: Buy, sell or hold? And so, I just wanted to talk a little bit with you about how you feel about big banks versus the smaller banks today. Because you and I both love the small banks. One that I talk about all the time, , I found Ameris back in the depths of the financial crisis and the Great Recession back in 2010 or something like that, when it felt like the whole world was coming to an end there. And their stock had gotten hammered, but it was a well-run bank that kind of just kept on doing what it was doing and it recovered nicely.But lo-and-behold, now, here in this bear market, Ameris is getting hit along with all of the other small banks; we talked about Live Oak just a little while ago. So, I see opportunity in both. I mean, it does feel like the leaders, the big dogs, come out of times like these in better positions, but that doesn't mean that smaller players, smaller regional banks can't come out of here looking better as well. Do you tilt toward one over the other in a time like this? I tend to agree. As far as my investment dollars go, I tend to gravitate toward the big banks in environments like this, just because they've been so stress-tested and so scrutinized that we know that they can make it through. It just seems like a little bit more of a safer play, I mean, a well-run regional bank can be a great investment in any environment. Like you said, Ameris, I don't think is anything to worry about. Just to kind of disclose one of mine, I bought Goldman Sachs about a week ago, after the downturn started, because I think it's a great value and because I think it can really make it through pretty much anything the market throws at it. Yeah. And I'd tell you, I was looking at the sell-off in Ameris today and part of me was thinking, \"Man! you know what, I really want to buy some more shares of this bank.\" Then the other part of me said, \"You know what, I think we're probably going to talk about it on today's show, so I better hold off.\"And for listeners who don't know, we do have trading guidelines here at The Fool, so whenever we talk about these businesses, we have periods of silence we need to maintain before and after we make any transactions buying or selling. So, anytime you don't hear us talking about something that may be why we're being silent in a period of heavy news.But, yeah, I feel like Ameris, if this sell-off holds, this is one I own shares in today and I think I'd like to add to it, because you're right, I do think they are in a good position. They just finished that acquisition with Fidelity. Financially, in great shape. I mean, this is just one of those things that just, again, these bear markets don't discriminate.Talking about bear markets, Brian here @bsc082 asks, \"Can this current scenario be compared to anything in the past?\"The short answer is, yes, I think you can compare it to anything and everything, it's just a matter of trying to figure out what the similarities and what the differences are. And I came across some interesting research recently from Goldman Sachs that was talking about bear markets like the one we're in, event-driven bear markets, because there is a difference between an event-driven bear market or a secular bear market that's a bit more tied toward economic performance.But these types of bear markets tend to result, on average, in 29% declines and take about 15 months to get back to their previous levels. And so, I mean, clearly, we're in that 29% range now. I think the Dow is down around 30% from its highs. And the 15-month thing, I mean, it's important to note too 15-months to get back to where they were, to where things were. So, you have to recognize that all along the way, getting back up to that point where it used to be, that also represents opportunity. I mean, you want to be buying all the way up. That's why investing in that 401(k) all along the way here is so important, because that recovery is also an opportunity. Don't you think, Matt? Oh, absolutely. And directly there's no comparison to this event, especially in the modern age. I think, in 1918, there was a big disease \u2013 don't quote me on that year \u2013 but it's happened before where a health outbreak has, kind of, rocked the nation, but not in the past hundred years or so. No. And there was SARS, it wasn't that long ago when the SARS crisis hit, but that was so much smaller in comparison. I mean, that was a virus that ultimately was contained. Something that's very similar to the coronavirus, but the numbers there were just a fraction of the numbers that we're dealing with now. And so, it's difficult to compare.I mean, the last time I felt like this in the market, it was back in '08-09 during the housing crisis and the Great Recession that followed. This is what feels about like I felt back then. Right. And I think I'm just going to avoid the market in March from here on out. [laughs] Well, I mean, it's just these times are \u2013 they're tough to deal with, but by the same token, they can be a tremendous benefit, you can learn so much from them. And I've just, I've said it so much. I mean, going through that Great Recession, it was just a great educational tool as an investor. I pull back from that experience, all the time, lessons that I learned and ways to look at companies, how to invest. One thing I've kept on saying to people is, take it slow, now especially with no commission cost, you don't have to go in there and invest everything at once, you can invest slowly. There's just no reason to try to put everything to work at once, because as we can see, it's not something that just fixes itself overnight.But, yeah, I mean you can compare and contrast, I think, to really anything, but it does feel like, this is a unique situation, I don't know that there's anything that I can pull from that really necessarily correlates, given the numbers that we know today.So, here is another question from @Eric_Albee, who asks, \"Are there any specific companies that you have changed your long-term, five-year-plus outlook on as a result of the past few weeks?\"And you know, Matt, when I read this question first, my inclination was to think, \"Okay, what companies am I less bullish on now than I was before?\" And then it started kind of striking me. You know what?! I don't know that there really are any companies that -- when I look at a five-year-plus time horizon -- there aren't companies that I've really changed my outlook on from that perspective, from a negative perspective. But I do feel like, on the upside, I do look at some of our favorite companies, and I think, you know what, they come out of situations like these a lot stronger, in a lot better position.So, it actually does make me feel a little bit more optimistic about what the future holds for a business like ; I think I've used as an example on  before. Easy to see today why Booking.com is getting shellacked. I mean, travel is ground to a halt, people aren't going anywhere. But if you believe that in time this virus abates and we get back to life as normal, more people will eventually start traveling again and Booking.com is going to be still that massive network that has a global presence and a massive presence in the travel industry. It's going to be a stronger business, after all is said and done here. And that's one that kind of comes to mind from that question there from Eric.I don't know, Matt, did you have any examples? Yeah, I'm not sure that my long-term thesis on any stocks that I liked have really changed, but you have to think of some of the things that this is kind of bringing out the use-case for. I mean, just to give one example that we could tell you all too well is . We're on a Zoom meeting right now. A lot of people thought their jobs weren't possible to do from home until this past couple of weeks. And it's really kind of \u2013 yeah, I think Zoom is going to see a nice uptick in business. Especially, I think that I read that Zoom was giving away their services to students who were at home.I didn't read that, but that's distinctly possible, that certainly sounds like something Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan would do. A very, very strong culture there. And his focus, you know he always uses that word \"Happy,\" he's just trying to make his customers happy. And I would imagine that he would look at something like this and say, \"You know what, this is a time where we all need to band together and fight this thing as a team.\" And that will have a long-term impact on their business. The brand equity that comes from doing something like that is tremendous.And speaking of Zoom, I was reading through a note here earlier on , that was saying that they experienced a 50% spike in patient visit volume over the previous week. Times like these really, I think, make the argument for telemedicine, why virtual healthcare can work and why it should be a fundamental part of our healthcare system. And so, you see a company like Teladoc, I feel like they're going to come out of this even stronger. Right. And I mean that 50% is not going to be permanent. People are going to start going back to the doctor after this, but at the same time, it's a matter of getting your product in front of more eyeballs, which is what Teladoc and Zoom are doing right now. Exactly, exactly. And I think, as a society, we're starting to buy into this notion that, \"Hey, you know what, we can actually get a lot of work done at home,\" and \"Hey, you know what, maybe logging into the app there and opening up my doctor's visit from my phone is the better first step to make, in some cases.\" And so, yeah, it was just interesting for me, I felt like it makes me more bullish on a lot of the companies that I love, but I don't know that there are any companies that I really feel are terribly threatened from this. But a good question, nonetheless.And let's go ahead and wrap it up, we have one more question here from @WilliamWadbrant, and he asks, \"When buying equities, especially in worried markets like this one, it's vital to own quality businesses, as they survive and flourish, while weaker ones fail. How do you evaluate that quality and determine if a business will be able to handle the difficult environment ahead?\"And that's a good question, it lines up with one we took a little bit earlier, \"What are some of the qualities you look for in businesses? What makes a quality business to you?\" And for me, Matt, one of the first things I go to is the balance sheet and financial resources. I mean, you see a company that has the financial resources to deal with an extended downturn like this, they're going to be the ones that you feel like are going to be in better shape, right?Yeah, that's definitely the first thing I'd look at. But finances being equal, I see which has the more valuable brand name, which one has the services that people can't live without? You mentioned Teladoc, that's a service that people need. Balance sheet aside, Square and PayPal, all our favorite war-on-cash stocks, that's a service that's needed. Visa and MasterCard are some of the most essential companies that I could think of. How many payment transactions would you say go through their system every day? Billions, right? Yeah. You get to those absurd numbers like Apple's balance sheet and Facebook's users, the numbers are so big, it's almost difficult to comprehend at times. Right. And so, in things like that, I tend to gravitate toward the bigger companies, the sector leaders during these times as companies that have a better shot of making it through anything unscathed, like I mentioned, the big banks already. In the airlines, I would avoid the Spirit or one like the listener said. And if you were going to go with any, stick with the most financially sound and best brands, like,  or  or something like that; not that I'm recommending any of those. But if I was going to pick an airline, it would probably be one of the bigger ones in the sector. So, yeah, you got to start with the financials, as you said. Yeah. And I think, you know, another thing that I find helpful is, I like to look at who the company's customers are, and then further, who are the customers' customers. And the one that kind of came to mind was Square, thinking, well, Square's customers are, for the most part, small businesses, and then those small business customers are people like us. You can connect the dots there and see if there're going to be some problems there in the near-term that will impact that business. That doesn't necessarily make it a less quality business, but it shows you, at least, what you might expect here on the near-term horizon, the challenges the business may deal with.And so, we like Square a lot. It has the financial resources to be able to deal with periods of time like this, and that's great, but it's also worth noting who the customers are. And then, I think, ultimately, look toward leadership as well. There are leaders that inspire, there are leaders that don't, there are leaders that we can look at and we think, \"You know what, these are the smartest guys and girls in the room.\" And other ones, that you really kind of don't want to be around. And so, I think leadership is another one you can take a look at and that can help make some more sense of it.Eric Yuan with Zoom. I mean, a leader that I feel like is a tremendous asset and certainly helps make the argument for the favor that Zoom is a quality business.Okay, Matt, that wraps it up for the questions this week. I know that was a lot, but we feel like this is a unique time and a trying time, and one where we wanted to make sure our listeners knew that we were listening to you all as much as that you, thankfully, are listening to us. And we're very grateful for the questions that you threw out there on Twitter for us.So, before we wrap it up this week, we do want to get back to our ones to watch. Matt, what is a stock that you're going to be watching this week? I am watching Berkshire. I think Buffett is about to do his biggest buying spree of all time, if it's not already under way, it very well may be. [laughs] I like that. I like that a lot. I'm going to be keeping an eye on (NASDAQ: GLOB), the ticker there for Globant is GLOB. But they are an IT consulting firm and what really is only becoming a more tech-driven world. And Globant has some really big-time customers in their network, including,  and Google [,] and .For me, really, my interest was piqued on the augmented reality and the immersive technology side of things. And one of one of our colleagues, TJ Piquet had introduced me to this company. As a matter of fact, I think, back on an  episode many, many months ago, he was one of the newer analysts at the time, when we had some of the new analysts on the show and interviewed them. And TJ got this on our radar. So, that's one I'll be watching this coming week as well.But for now, I think that's going to do it for us this week. Folks, remember you can always reach out to us on Twitter @MFIndustryFocus or you can drop us an email at . Let us know how things are going, let us know how you're coping with this time. We know it's not easy, but that's why we're here. Reach out to us on Twitter, let us know what stocks you're buying, ask any questions you have, that's why we're here folks.So, as always, Matt, very, very happy to join you this week and I'm glad we were able to make all the tech work here. Maybe a few more weeks where we're doing this remotely, but it's good to know that we've got a process figured out. Yep. Always good to be here and I hope that you're enjoying the work-from-home stuff as much as I do. [laughs] Well, you know it's got its good time, it's got its moments. Sometimes it's nice and other times you feel like you gotta get up and walk around and maybe get outside for a bit. But certainly, understand the situation and acting in an overabundance of caution is probably the right way to go. So, we'll be back up-and-running in the studio as soon as we're able to, that might be a little while, folks, but for now, we will stick to the remote and be thankful that we can at least deliver the podcast to you and thankful that you'll continue listening to them.So, as always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.Thanks to Austin Morgan for taking his production skills to the next level during these trying times.

This allows new investors with limited capital to begin their investing journeys with a portfolio diversified in at least a couple\u00a0.\u00a0In this current coronavirus market correction, might I suggest some starter stocks relatively insulated from health crises and with lots of cash on the balance sheet. Both social-media empire\u00a0  and law enforcement technology company\u00a0 fit that description.Facebook, has certain advantages during a time like the COVID-19 pandemic. It's relatively easy for its employees to work from home, as many are already doing. Furthermore, its primary products (Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp) are digital social platforms not in danger of coronavirus contamination, so the doors won't close like a retail business.\u00a0 data by Facebook's stock has dropped with the market, bringing it down to relatively low valuation multiples. And beyond the company's core advertising revenue, it has future opportunities for growth in , the , and . And its pristine balance sheet allows it to pursue these ventures even in a recession. The company ended 2019 with $55 billion in cash and no long-term debt.Likewise, Axon Enterprise is relatively unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a recent statement the company said it's still manufacturing and shipping its physical products -- non-lethal weapons and body cameras -- on schedule.\u00a0It also has subscription software products and is now generating $161 million in annual recurring revenue. And\u00a0because its customer base is comprised of law enforcement agencies, a fairly non-cyclical customer, it's less likely to see revenue suddenly fall off a cliff.Turning to its balance sheet, Axon has $350 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. And its long-term liabilities are only $11 million. That's a lot of equity for a company with only a $3.2 billion . This cash-rich position, like Facebook, gives it the opportunity to continuing developing new products and services in 2020 -- including the $100 million it's investing this year in new officer-dispatch services. is a good thing in a portfolio. If you're still building out your portfolio, a market crash like this can be good timing. For me personally, I used this market correction to initiate a position in\u00a0 .\u00a0My Pinterest investment thesis is fairly simple. It now has 335 million users, which was good for 26% annual growth in 2019. That gives Pinterest a massive audience, yet still a fraction of Facebook's more than 2 billion users. Improving average revenue per user (ARPU) fueled its 46% annual revenue gain. And the company stands to grow ARPU even further by teaching companies how to better use Pinterest to make their products more \"shoppable\" on the platform.Pinterest isn't for everyone, I'll admit. The company reported a $1.4 billion net loss in 2019, due to high research & development and sales & marketing costs. However, that spending is coming down significantly -- the company \"only\" had a $36 million net loss in the fourth quarter. But thanks to its IPO, the company is still flush with $1.7 billion in cash and no debt.The bottom line is if a company has been on your watch-list for a while, now could be a good time to buy. Nobody knows where the bottom is, so waiting for a better price might be fruitless.My longest holding, and most predictable, is  .

The company will provide an update during its first-quarter briefing once it has quantified and assessed the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak.To add to Booking's problems, the unemployment rate is also soaring in the U.S., with 6.648 million unemployment claims in the week ended March 28. In the week before that, there were 3.3 million claims. The last three weeks of March alone have seen a 3,000% increase in first-time claims for unemployment benefits over early March.With nearly 10 million Americans losing their jobs in the last two weeks, this will surely crimp consumers' propensity and ability to spend. Many people are not going to be able to afford a vacation anytime soon, which will add further pressure on Booking's financial numbers.With most of the developed world essentially shutting down to contain the spread of the virus, online travel agencies such as Booking will feel the pain.CEO Glenn Fogel believes that this will ultimately be a temporary disruption and that travel demand will be back to normal after the virus is contained.

First-quarter sales are expected to halve, but boss Jane Sun also sees a rebound coming at home, where the epidemic may be ebbing. It offers a glimmer of hope in a sea of economic gloom.Travel has been one of the industries hit hardest by Covid-19. In China, the start of the outbreak coincided with the weeklong Lunar New Year festival, a peak time for taking trips. As a result of quarantines and contagion fears, some $4.4 billion of Trip.com orders were cancelled. Weak demand, along with the company\u2019s generous refund policies, will hurt the bottom line. Its adjusted operating loss may be as much as about $260 million in the first quarter.Sun is starting to see light through the fog, though. Even as international flights are grounded and countries close their borders, the People\u2019s Republic is gradually lifting curbs. Trip.com says hotels and airlines across the country are resuming business and it anticipates a quick recovery in domestic tourism. Likewise, smaller peer Tongcheng-Elong earlier this month reported a surge in hotel and flight reservations at the end of February; notably, airline ticket sales for June also have ticked up as travelers look ahead.Despite the serious risk of a resurgence in cases in China, Trip\u2019s clearer outlook is a far cry from peers such as Expedia and Booking.

Mr. Barnes, probably to his credit, declined to do so, but he declined to do so by writing us a letter, which we, of course, photographed and printed right in the first issue of The Motley Fool.Now, why am I telling that story? Well, as I think about where we are right now in the world and our markets, I was thinking for some reason \"10 1/2 Chapters,\" because I have a number of things I want to say this week. And so I thought, why not organize my thoughts, it's thoughts about our world, in 10 1/2 chapters, an allusion to the original copy of The Motley Fool newsletter with Julian Barnes' seal of approval on it. So, welcome.And before we start our 10 1/2 chapters, just a few things to get out of the way up front. I don't exactly know who runs the @TheMotleyFool account on . I think my brother Tom has put a lot of effort in there. I know people like Morgan Housel have contributed over the years. We have a social media team today. Somebody on our Motley Fool account on Twitter, Sunday night, posted a brilliant tweet. Here it was: \"Health plus : Wash your hands, then tomorrow, sit on them.\" That was so apt, so well put. So, credit out to that might be Tom, Morgan on a team. So well put and so true.Now, I had planned, originally, to do the market cap game show this week. I had mentioned that last week. But given how the world has turned, I thought it might look like whistling Dixie, if we're playing the market cap game show in the face of such market turmoil. All that said, I'm kind of a stiff-upper-lip person. Let's keep on doing the right thing. That's not always the best medical advice out there, but I decided, let's go ahead and do the market cap games show next week. We were going to do dividend investing with Buck Hartzell; we'll be doing that in April instead of this month given the events.But we're going to be playing our game next week no matter what, and you know what, look out, Aaron Bush and/or anyone else I invite on, because the market caps have changed. Also, if you're hearing this within the first 24 hours or so, when we publish this podcast -- this typically comes out Wednesdays on the East Coast of the United States of America late afternoon -- within 24 hours I will be on YouTube Live. That's Thursday, 3:30 p.m. Eastern, with Chris Hill. So, YouTube Live, that's our YouTube channel, The Motley Fool, and we'll be taking your questions. So if that would be of interest to you, and you're hearing this quickly enough, you download it and listen to it right away, then you know you can join with Chris and me tomorrow.And finally, one thing I want to get out of the way before we start Chapter 1. I want to say something about the hypochondriacs out there, the warriors. I know some of them. And while I'm generally preternaturally opposite that, I'm kind of the optimist you can't stamp down, I do want to say, the warriors can have their day, and they should. I don't root for those who obsessively focus on worries and health, but they're going to have their day in the sun from time to time, and God bless them. Everyone deserves some sun.You know, one of the best CEOs of our time, the dearly departed Andy Grove, former CEO of , wrote a famous book, I bet many of you've read -- it's called . That's not, again, the mental space that I come from, as I approach work and life, but some really, really successful people have. And in highly unusual circumstances like this, as we find ourselves globally in March of 2020, this might be one where being paranoid about your health is a darn good idea. Wash your hands, then tomorrow, and then sit on them.All right, Chapter 1. Chapter 1 is entitled \"Nothing.\" As in doing nothing. People are saying to me, and I understand why they would, \"Hey, Dave, what are you doing with your money?\" And I say, \"Nothing.\" They say, \"Do you have any money saved up on the side?\" You know, \"Is it time to deploy that cash that you've been holding back?\" I'm saying, \"What cash?\" \"No, I remain fully invested.\" That's pretty much what I've always done as an investor and what I've talked about for years now in this podcast. And of course, for decades on our website before that.I certainly respect people who like to keep a cash cushion, so-called. The thinking is that they can dive in at the right moment and invest that and do even better, but in my experience, given that the market typically rises 9% to 10% a year and we don't really know when it's going to drop or come back, if you look at the math and most studies, you'll see that staying near or fully invested is the best way to approach maximizing your returns over the long term as an investor, which is the only term, the only game that we are playing. So what am I doing? Chapter 1, I'm doing nothing. What about you?Now, I hope that doesn't sound irresponsible. As humans, we're fairly conditioned, and most of the time this works. We're fairly conditioned to think more effort, more reward. Ironically, though, I think part of the approach to investing that's worked so well for us here at The Motley Fool is that not working so hard does better.On  on Monday, a really wonderful effort by Jason Moser and Chris Hill, they took a mailbag item from somebody who said, \"Hey, guys, I've held my cash back, so should I plunge in now?\" And the way that I hear that question is guesswork -- has the market fallen far enough or will it fall farther? I really don't think there's any way to authoritatively answer that question. I don't think Chris and Jason really tried to do that, but if I had been on the other side of that question, I would have said, if you have a cash lump, either one you saved or maybe you just got a lump sum from somebody else, one of the best ways to do it is to deploy it systematically.And so, even though I'm saying, nothing, earlier, Chapter 1, nothing, the truth is that I'm saving every two weeks -- I hope you are too if you're a wage earner -- and I'm investing. And so it's a constant mechanical process that involves absolutely no guesswork. So I do congratulate anybody sitting on a cash cushion, because this 20%-off sale in March has been a much better deal than people were getting in January when we recorded \"The Day the Market Crashed.\" So, congratulations, but I nevertheless think that you should be deploying that money on a regular basis. And if you have a lump, buy in thirds, divide it up into pieces, and systematically put that money into the market. I bet you'll be happy five, 10-plus years from now, which is after all why we're doing what we're doing, right?And as we close down Chapter 1, let me just repeat something I said on the podcast just a couple of weeks ago. In fact, it was our February mailbag, and I felt a compulsion at the time to just try to speak to coronavirus, since it was becoming a bigger story and the markets were starting to rock. I'm just literally going to reread what I said from two weeks ago, because, I think, I hope, it still feels just as imperative and just as relevant.And here it was: \"From an investment standpoint, I just want to say, these events don't change my approach. I personally have made a lifetime commitment to our stock market as an investor. So I really am, I'm playing the long game, and I hope you are too. So how the stock market does this week, this quarter, this year, is not going to change how I do, I hope how we do, what we do. Certainly, if you're right near retirement or you need the money that you're investing to live on, you should already be making, have been making plans to transition into some more income investing, these other ways to secure your financial future if you're near the end of your tether. But for those of us in the middle of our tether or earlier on in life, you shouldn't allow even scary things, like human tragedies, to shake you or your money out of the market. You're going to do far better if you patiently keep adding money. The biggest question isn't should I sell or should I get out before a downdraft in the market because of coronavirus? The biggest question most of us should be asking is, am I saving enough on my next salary check, and where am I going to put that money now maybe at a discount?You should be thinking that every two weeks. And that's the approach we've always promoted here at The Motley Fool. That's what we live by. We're all in different circumstances. We're in different countries around the world with different risk tolerances at different points in our lives. So your mileage may vary, and if it does, make sure it's appropriate to you and who you are.But for the most part, our Foolish way of investing in what we do here at , really, I try not to allow even bigger stories that dominate the headlines for a month or a year to change where my money is invested or how I'm doing it, and I hope that's true of you too.On a side note, I was listening back to the day the market crashed from a couple of months ago, and one thing we had right, we had  down 30% that day, and as I record here, on Tuesday afternoon, March 10, even though the stock market is incredibly volatile, back up 3% at the moment, Stitch Fix down about 30% today.All right, Chapter 2. I felt like Chapter 1 may have sounded a little preachy; I hope it didn't come across too strong, but I feel that strongly, so put it out there. But Chapter 2 is that \"The Tide Heads Out Sometimes.\" And I think the tide is headed out.And when the tide heads out, we see who is prepared for it and who is not. Who wasn't wearing a bathing suit? I remember in the financial -- do you remember in 2008-2009, the Great Recession? -- the number of Ponzi schemes that were being exposed, people who were money managers, who were supposedly making a lot of money by taking your money in and giving you great returns, 2005, '06, '07, all of a sudden remember Marcus Schrenker. I certainly don't remember the name, but I looked this one up. Marcus Schrenker is a former American financial advisor.In 2009, he attempted to fake his own death due to personal financial and legal troubles. He was a pilot. He got up in a plane. Do you remember the story? He made a distress call near Birmingham, Alabama, telling air traffic controllers his windshield had imploded and he was bleeding profusely. He put the plane on autopilot, he parachuted out, he parachuted to safety. That was an over-the-top effort, real-life effort by somebody to avoid the financial consequences that he was causing in other people's lives. It took 2008-2009 to trigger that. It took losses to expose who wasn't prepared, who was fragile, who was antifragile. Marcus Schrenker is an incredibly iconic story for us, as I think about this, but of course there are many more sympathetic ones.You know, some businesses do need to exist on debt, in part, in order to run their operations smoothly and effectively. And when we have financial catastrophes, those businesses and the people who are part of them can get really hurt. Slightly less sympathetic to me are people who are on margin, people who are taking crazy risks with their money. I hope that's not you. Certainly, I preach about that week-in and week-out over five years now, so I trust most of my fellow Fools are not in such a situation. But think about the people who were taking silly risks. The businesses that were borrowing too much money. There's a natural process by which, when the tide goes out, these things get exposed and get knocked down. They either have to reform or go away. And thus, the world moves forward.So even though I'm the guy who every year says, \"I think the market is going up this year.\" You remember that's my market prediction I make each year, and boy, have I been right a lot of the last several years. Maybe I'll get it wrong this year. But I'm fully prepared to get it wrong financially and mentally; I hope that you are too. I hope that part of being a Rule Breaker has strengthened you against the downside, whether it's podcasts like \"The Day the Market Crashed\" which gets you to psychologically process that ahead of time or just the good habits that I hope you built through The Motley Fool, either through this podcast over the last five years or how about our business side over the last 25-plus years.I know a lot of you are more than equal to the test when the tide is headed out. And in fact, those who are, are even stronger as a consequence and emerge more successfully as inevitably the tide comes back.Chapter No. 3. Chapter No. 3 is entitled \"You Don't Need to Hear From Me, Do You?\"\u00a0Which I think I kind of spoke to, but sometimes I've whined in the past in this podcast that I don't feel any great personal urgency to come in and reassure everyone to be patient and hold or buy more during downtimes. In fact, I remember having to do that with my brother Tom. We'd go on to network television or CNBC, on a fairly regular basis the first 10 years of our business. We would be the guys who were called in when everything is going badly. They'd have us on \u00a0-- \"Guys, the market is down.\" And I felt like the most important messages that we're being asked to give was whenever the market was dropping, but that's not a natural state. Natural state is the market rising. People don't want to have us on  to talk about when the market is rising. They wanted us to speak to the pain, and I understand that and I'm trying to do that myself to up to a point.But Chapter 3 is entitled \"You Don't Need to Hear From Me, Do You?\" Because I don't take a lot of enjoyment in that kind of reassurance. It feels like Pablum to me sometimes. \"Oh, it's OK. Just keep buying. It'll all come back.\" I mean, I do do that myself, but it doesn't sound that satisfying to me either to say or to hear it. It's kind of stereotypical to me, maybe a cliche, but maybe that's because I'm a Fool.But while you don't need to hear from me, I hope, do you, I am going to sound four of my favorite lines to you right now. Just resound them to many of you. The first is, stocks always go down faster than they go up, but they always go up more than they go down. I don't want that line on my gravestone because there are many more interesting things to talk about, but I think that's a truism, and I've always loved that line ever since I first conceived of it.I was thinking about F. Scott Fitzgerald, that whole thing about holding two opposed thoughts in the mind at once and that's a sign of brilliance. I want to make you brilliant; I want to make sure you understand. And you're seeing it right now -- once again, stocks always go down faster than they go up, but they always go up more than they go down.Line No. 2. In direct contrast to the threadbare disclaimers, you should know that past performance may very well be our single best indicator of future results. I think we've all seen those financial ads -- often they have to end \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\" I've often looked at that, of course, that's the conventional wisdom, so as fellow Fools I look at that and I wanted to take a shot at it, because it's such horrible advice. Indeed, as I just said, probably our single best indicator of future results is the past. \"#WinnersWin.\"So, let's briefly think about the past when it comes to the stock market. Take a look at the line of the stock market's graph performance over the last 100, 50, 30 years, take your favorite long-term slice, whatever your favorite era is you want to look at. You're going to see it starts in the lower left and goes to the upper right -- past performance.Now, in any meaningful era, 30, 50, 100 years, if you zoom in to a two- or three-year period, you might see, since you're zoomed in, what looks like a scary drop. And it didn't feel great at the time and a lot of us have lived through multiple ones. And I know a lot of you are older than I am. So you've seen more than I have. But I've certainly seen the 1987 market crash, I've seen the 2001 market crash, 2008-2009 market crash. And if this ends up being a really bad market year, we can notch our belt one more and have lived through it together.But the whole point, my fellow Fools, is let's zoom out again and take a look at what happens for the people who are playing the only game that counts, the long game, past performance, probably the single best indicator of future results. Please don't forget that.No. 3. is \"Optimism Is Not Just a State of Mind; It's a Creative Force.\" Henry Ford famously said, \"Whether you think you can or whether you think you cannot, you're right.\" So, yeah, I'm saying to you, my listener, \"I think you can,\" and I think, you should think so too. So, this one isn't so much about the market, it's about the state of the world right now.Let's divide the world up into two types of people. We do this all the time. There are the people who believe we can and the people who believe we cannot. And I'm pretty sure I know which group is going to take us successfully into the future, and it's the former. And I know I'm speaking to a lot of you today, because most people, in my experience, who love investing, who believe in the stock market, who believe in our society, our culture, in our fellow humans, despite all of our flaws, most of you are optimists. And whether you think you can or whether you think you cannot, you're right.And finally, No. 4, the two keys to my investment approach, \"Stock-by-Stock, In Before the Vast Majority of Others and Out After the Vast Majority of Others.\" We were into  at $3.21; we still hold the stock today. That means we were in way before most of humanity. You could have been in 15 years later and still been early on Amazon. We watched the stock go from $3 up to $95 in 2000, down to $7 by 2002, kept holding. The market is so volatile this week, I'm not even going to attempt to quote Amazon stock, but when you do, think about that $3.21 cost basis that we gave to all our members, all the people who are following The Motley Fool, back in 1997. In before the vast majority of others, but then, of course, the secret, the latter half of that line, out after the vast majority of others. So, many people have traded in and out of Amazon, , , , ,  were the stocks we've held for 20 years or five years. Most people have traded in and out of them once at least already. I hope it's not true of you and I. The way to maximize your returns -- in before the vast majority of others and out after the vast majority of others. Which, of course, given the times where we are, where many people are thinking about selling or are in fact selling, I hope you'll remember that winning formula for winning the real game that counts the long-term game of investing.All right, Chapter 4. Chapter 4 is entitled \"You Don't Need to Hear From Me, Right, But You Will Hear From Me.\" I just want to point out a couple of the basics of the life that I and others, here at The Motley Fool, lead. Every single month, I pick a new stock for Motley Fool; every single month I pick two stocks for Motley Fool. We have more than a dozen services these days, where lots of other Fools, including my brother Tom and so many talented stock-pickers, do the same thing. We're always there for you.And what you will notice that I don't do is I don't start saying I'm not going to put any new stock in for this quarter or this month, I'm scared, or I'm going to put three in at once because I'm particularly optimistic or elated. Nope. It's mechanical. It's two stocks in : one from Tom, one from me, for our members every month; two stocks for  members every month. We've bought them in good times and in bad. And we only really know looking backward, when it was really good or when it was really bad.Some of our best stock picks, some of my personal best picks were made feeling the pain, feeling like, \"But I'm about to email this off to all of our members, and they're going to buy it, and it's going to probably drop another 20%.\" And yet five, 10, 15 years later, we look back and say, \"Boy, am I glad for the discipline that that service instilled on me, the discipline forcing me to pick a stock when I didn't want to.\"So, Chapter 4, \"You Don't Need to Hear From Me, Right, But You Will Hear From Me.\" And you hear from me in this podcast every single week. And my talented producer, Rick Engdahl, and I try to bring you, every 10 weeks or so, a new Five-Stock Sampler. I was looking over my list of Five-Stock Samplers. We've done 23 in this series. I was checking to see how our Five-Stock Samplers are doing here. It's really such a remarkable, untold story in my opinion, but if you've been with me, you've seen we've done this 23 times now, every 10 weeks, 23 times, pick five stocks, 115 total stock picks on the podcast. Eighteen of those Five-Stock Samplers are beating the market. Only five are losing to the market. A 78% accuracy rate. The average performance of the stock in those samplers is 34.5%; the market is 11.8%. We're up 22% per pick across 115 picks. That's all for free on this podcast every 10 weeks. So you don't need to hear from me, but you are and you will.Chapter 5, \"And You'll Hear From Me Beyond Just Stock Picks.\" Because while I just focus on individual selections and what our services do, I want to make sure I restate the six traits that make you a investor. This is about you now; this is not about the next stock that you're about to buy.Rule No. 1: Let your winners run high. No. 2: Add up; don't double down.I want to speak to those two briefly. We live in a time right now where most stocks are down, some of them 20% to 50% just in the last few weeks. So what is a winner, and what does it mean to let your winners run high or add up? Well, first of all, I'll remind you that your winners, even if they've had a bad few weeks, are probably still pretty great. Take a look over the last one, three, five years of returns and ask yourself, which are the companies that are really thriving, which companies has the stock market validated as big-time performers, the success of their business as translated into their stock price?That's a pretty good indicator for you to know what are the winners and know that some of them are down. In fact, most stocks are down right now. But that doesn't mean they're not still winners, and yet at the same time, if you have extra dollars, I would consider buying a new stock or two. After all, most of us have successful winners where our portfolio can end up concentrated in those winners. So instead, why not have some fun, add a new company name to your portfolio, add a few new stocks, probably at a much cheaper price than you were going to get a few weeks ago. So, instead of doubling down on an existing holding or re-adding to something you already may have a lot of, maybe this is an opportunity to spread a few new seeds and get to know the world even better, take some risks and have some fun.Again, it may not feel fun this week, but let's look back in a few years, shall we?OK, traits No. 3 and No. 4, of you, the Investor. No. 3, invest for at least three years, and No. 4, remember the four tenets of conscious capitalism. Speaking to those briefly. Yeah, the word \"Invest,\" I've talked about it a lot. I love etymologies, it means to wear the clothes off, to put on the vestments, like, \"priestly vestment\" is the same root, invest. It's like wearing that home team jersey, which is what I do when I go to a sports game. I bet you do too. You cheer on your home team. You're not going to change your jersey, throw it away, if your team loses that day or has a bad quarter, bad week on the market, are you? Or a bad year? Nope. You're going to stay invested for at least three years.Now, each of my six Investor traits here is a mnemonic. You'll remember, the number is implicit in each one. Rule No. 1: Let your winners run high. No. 2: Add up; don't double -- that's the word -- down. No. 3: Invest for at least three years. And No. 4: Remember the four tenets of conscious capitalism.I'm not going to go over them here. Google \"conscious capitalism\" if you're not already familiar with this idea that your money should be invested in the things that you think will thrive and make our world better. And as those companies do good, you will do well.Finally, traits No. 5 and No. 6. Max 5% allocation -- that's the in trait No. 5. That means, for any new position that you would take, never put more than 1/20 of your money. And keep your money invested in a wonderful diverse set of companies; don't overload on any one at the start. Now, if a company does really well for you and becomes more than 5% for you, more than 10% even, sometimes larger numbers, depending on who you are and how comfortable you are with that, that's when you can allow your allocations to go, but that initial allocation, max 5%.Finally, No. 6, aim for 60% accuracy -- there's the number. And by that, I'm reminding you, when you buy new stock, when you enter a new position, have confidence that it's going to beat the market, don't be silly or be too speculative, bring more than a coin flip's confidence that this investment is going to beat the market. I'm not just saying go up; I hope every investment goes up. What we're about at  and The Motley Fool is we're about beating the market, beating the index fund. And so, aim for 60% accuracy.Chapter 6: \"Be Selective With Your Media.\" How much time do I spend watching financial TV most of the year? Zero. How much time did I spend watching financial TV this week? Zero. I prefer print, personally. I don't know about you. We all have our different tastes, but I'll tell you, I think Bloomberg does an awfully good job covering things. I appreciate their free services.In fact, as the week started, I got an email from Bloomberg saying, \"Hey, would you like to subscribe to our coronavirus daily, our prognosis section that we have a daily little newsletter?\" And I said, \"Sure.\" It's free and I could sign up for it. Those are the kinds of media that I select into. I think I've talked about in the past. Now, I appreciate their coverage; their Espresso app is good for waking up in the morning and knowing what's happening. But I wouldn't spend a lot of time preoccupied with the news. I mean, I say that most of the time anyway, as generally a non-traditional news consumer, but I especially feel that's true if you're thinking about your investment dollars.The more you watch some crazy man talk about the market moving up and down and what you should be doing, the more likely it is that you, yourself may go crazy.Chapter 7 is entitled \"Leadership.\" I'm probably verging on another cliche when I say, \"In hard and troubled times, leadership emerges; leadership is tested.\" But I have a little bit of a different approach to thinking about this than I think most people around me. Maybe you're sympathetic to me, you think the same way I do maybe. If not, you'll hear a different viewpoint from me here.So, one of my favorite bumper stickers I'm seeing these days, I bet you've seen it too. \"Any Functioning Adult 2020.\" Love that bumper sticker, because in a lot of ways it describes [laughs] my own thoughts, at least here in the United States of America, about political leadership. And this isn't about either party. In fact, for a variety of different reasons, I would say, both diverse reasons and manifold reasons, I wouldn't actually put any of the three 2020 candidates in the CEO seat of any important company whose stock I hold. Now, I'm quite sure some of my listeners love one of these three, and don't like another or maybe love two of them; I'm not sure. And while I certainly respect the importance of leadership. I can't look at our present-day leadership or our coming potential leadership in the public sector, in the government, and say that I'm impressed by the achievements of any of those people. [laughs] And I've met at least one of them.Sometimes I wonder, \"Am I watching professional wrestling here with these debates, or am I watching the future of our country?\" I don't want this to sound like a rant. I sure hope it doesn't, because what I want you to know is there is tremendous leadership across the United States of America and the world. Most of the best leaders that I know work in business where they are forced, especially as conscious capitalists, to think through pleasing all of their stakeholders, not pitting one set of stakeholders against another or trying to create win/lose situations. Most of the best businesses that you and I are invested in have deep experience in caring and working for the success of all of their stakeholders, certainly their customers, that's why businesses exist, certainly their employees, great companies to work for, their partners and suppliers, the best ones admire the businesses that they supply, and certainly, shareholders, you and me, can look at the best stocks and be pleased by the outcomes they gave us.So, I hope if you're frustrated with political leadership in our country, you won't obsess about that or forget that the more dysfunctional political leadership becomes, the more influence it loses, the more likelihood that the private sector and the leadership from the businesses that are delivering us the products and services and solutions every day that we need to survive in this world that they will thrive and that they will lift us higher. So there's a thought about leadership.Chapter 8, \"Science.\" You know, I wasn't an effective science student. I always tried to duck. I never even took physics. Somehow, I got out of it. A lot of us do biology here in the U.S. in ninth grade and I took chemistry in tenth. I was like, \"Can I possibly opt out of physics?\" I'm not good at science, but I still have [laughs] an admiration for it.So, Chapter 8, I just wanted to say a few things about science and hope. For my book club, months ago I was reading a book called  by Dr. Jeremy Brown, who works as a virologist at NIH. And one of the things Jeremy talks about is the state of the world in 1918, when the so-called Spanish Flu, the big epidemic -- I think it started in Kansas -- it came through the military, spread around the world. World War I didn't help. Fifty million or so humans died. It was a century ago, and it was still practiced at that day -- venesection. Do you know what venesection is? I had to look to remind myself what the term meant. It's the medical term for bloodletting. And that was a common practice a century ago, when trying to figure out how to heal people.It turns out it didn't help, didn't help the epidemic at all. Fortunately, a century later we know venesection is hopelessly backward in its thinking. It wasn't until 1939, there was a watershed moment in the history of virology, Dr. Brown writes in his book , the newly invented electron microscope took a picture of a virus. In 1939 we first finally saw the enemy.The first coronavirus was not found until the 1960s. The name, by the way, since I love language and etymology, coronavirus -- the corona, of course, means crown, coming from Latin. And it's so called, because the visual, if you're looking at a coronavirus, it has, kind of, a fringy crown around it, in contrast to some other viruses, hence the name coronavirus. So it's only been in the last 50 years that these have even emerged in a way that we can understand them today.Here's a shocking thing I often forget but I want to say here. Seven years before that, 1953, Crick and Watson discovered DNA. We haven't even known about DNA in the last 75 years. A lot of my listeners were born into a world where we didn't even know what DNA was yet.So here's the good news. What incredible progress we have made over the last century at combating all kinds of bad stuff and creating new solutions for our bodies. And certainly, we're invested in so many healthcare companies,  and  and  and , and the list goes on of companies aligned technologies that are doing something better for our bodies today.So, pinch yourself -- not only are you living at the best time in human history to be helped by others, to be helped by medical technology, but you as a fellow , you and I can be invested together in these companies and prosper as they heal the world. So I just want to remind us of the power of science. And while we can't get a vaccine this March to fix the coronavirus, it's being worked on, and you can only imagine the amount of innovation and collaboration by the smartest minds to ride in on a white horse at some point and start fixing things. So I have a profound optimism in where science is going to continue to take us.And while the human tragedy, we talked about it a few weeks ago, a few thousand people had already died in China back then. It's a lot more now. The human tragedy is very real. And I hope for you it's not personal; I hope it won't get personal. But we're all connected. And so, talking out both sides of my mouth, we have to acknowledge how really hard 2020 is going to be, and at the same time we have to remember that whether you think you can or whether you think you cannot, you're right.And I really believe our scientists and our doctors and the whole systems that are around them, even though they're in danger of being overwhelmed at different places in the world, I believe they're more resilient than we think. And I hope that proves out here in the weeks and months ahead.All right, Chapter 9. This one came through Twitter, @ScottJack. Scott, I really appreciate this point. So, earlier this week, when the market went down 8% or so in a single day, we sent out a message to all of our members. It was well written. It was written by Seth Jayson, I believe, a longtime analyst here at The Motley Fool, a longtime Fool. \"It was great, but one minor change.\" And I thought this was really good. Scott said, \"Instead of 'don't panic,' use 'stay calm.'\"So, Seth or our headline had used \"don't panic,\" which always makes me think of . Of course, perhaps you, too. But, no, Scott says, \"Instead of 'don't panic,' use 'stay calm.'\" Scott says, \"The brain only sees the word 'panic,' not the word 'don't.' It's something I learned from a smart marketer.\" @ScottJack goes on, \"This is similar from Mother Teresa. 'I was once asked, why I don't participate in anti-war demonstrations. I said that I will never do that, but as soon as you have a pro-peace rally. I'll be there.'\" Thank you, @ScottJack, for that reflection.Stay calm. I'm not going to say don't panic. Stay calm. It reminds me of Roy Spence, one of my favorite people in business, did a wonderful interview with Roy on this podcast a couple of years ago. You can Google it and listen to it again. One of Roy's great lines is \"I'm a \u00a0person.\" Lot of people are against this, against that; they define themselves by what they are not or what they're fighting. Roy says, \"I'm a  person.\" Well, I am too. Stay calm.Chapter 10. I'm just going to give you my favorite word of the week. It's a quick chapter and I've got a half-chapter after this one. My favorite word of the week goes back to the Romans. I was thinking about, the other day, \"vale,\" V-A-L-E. Do you know this one? This was a common greeting used in the Roman Empire. Vale. What does it mean? It means, be strong, be well. So, I wish for you, I wish for your family, for your business, for our world at large, vale. And I'm going to be rocking that greeting throughout March. Friends and family, vale!And finally, now, chapter 10 1/2. Chapter 10 1/2, Julian Barnes, thank you.I've made a point in the past of saying I don't use bad language. I'm from the school of thought that it pollutes the world. It pollutes oratory. It debases not just the air about us, but the people who use it. A friend once suggested to me that people who use bad language were basically telling others how cool they think they are, which, when I listened for it in the future, was often right.I've taken pride that on iTunes on my podcast page, well, at least the one I used before the OS change, I had a \"clean lyrics\" icon. Well, I never had intended to be lyrical, per se. At least Apple thought I was clean and your kids could listen in as well and through 50-plus mailbags, I've heard from you that you do feel comfortable letting your kids listen to , which is so great. And in part because we have clean lyrics.So, I'm simply going to warn you, as we conclude, that I'm about to use what I believe is my only bad language in  history, and I hope not to do it again. It'll just be there in my final four words. Why am I doing it? Because when you use a potentially powerful tool -- here, bad language -- infrequently, incredibly sparingly, you give it its true force when conveyed properly with the right timing. And so, feel free to cut off the podcast right about now before I close with my final four words, kind of ending these 10 1/2 chapters in the same way I began them.My advice to you. Here we go.

Consider that the  peaked at nearly 3,400 a month ago. Since then, it has cratered almost 30% as investors consider the wide-reaching ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. This sell-off is fast approaching the 34% drop of 1987 -- one of the worst bear markets in U.S. history.\u00a0Some want to invest but want to know if we've reached the bottom. However, that's a question no one can answer, and it doesn't matter anyway. Consider our last bear market: the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009. The S&P 500 would lose over half its value, but in the long run, it didn't matter whether you invested in 2007, in 2008, or at the bottom in 2009.\u00a0Data by .On the extremes, fear either keeps people from investing anything, since they believe the market will fall further, or they go all in when they believe it's bottomed.

In Roger Lowenstein's book , he writes that Buffett believed Coca-Cola's stock, down at the time, was \"as close to a sure thing as he had ever seen.\"With that context, here are three stocks that I believe are \"sure things\" in the long run.Energy drink company   is a great market-beating stock. If you back up to January 2007, before the Great Recession, Monster is still a nine-bagger stock. It gained a key distribution ally in Coca-Cola, which bought a 16.7% equity stake in Monster in 2014. Since then, Monster has seen its products go global with 2019 net sales hitting $4.2 billion, which generated $1.1 billion in net income.This strong profitability helped pad Monster's now $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. The company also has no long-term debt. You'd be hard-pressed to find a stronger balance sheet for a company with a $30 billion .\u00a0Granted, there's relatively low barriers to entry in the beverage sector, and Monster is constantly challenged by new competitors. For example, in its , Monster management noted that newcomer Bang, owned by Vital Pharmaceuticals, had gained market share in January and controlled 7.6% of the energy-drink category. However, Monster energy still controls 40.9% across its various beverages and lost only 0.6% market share -- indicating Bang is stealing more from other players than from Monster.Given its top-dog energy drink status, global distribution, strong balance sheet, and history of success, I'd say Monster has a good chance of beating the market going forward.Because of the coronavirus, the travel industry has ground to a complete halt worldwide. That's devastating to travel reservation company  \u00a0since no one is currently booking anything. But this affects Booking's competitors as well and virtually prohibits new players from arising right now. And considering the company's portfolio includes properties like Priceline.com, Booking.com, OpenTable, and RentalCars.com, this is a network that can't be replicated overnight.For 2019, Booking Holdings generated record revenue of $15.1 billion, which resulted in a whopping $4.9 billion in net income. The company was projecting more growth in 2020, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, it had to withdraw its first-quarter guidance. But assuming this present health crisis is temporary, Booking can weather the storm. It has $6.3 billion in cash and an untapped $2 billion in credit if things get tight in coming quarters.When the travel industry returns to normal, it's likely that travelers will resume making reservations through one of Booking Holdings' many properties. There's no reason COVID-19 would dethrone Booking from its top status. And considering it trades at less than 11 times trailing earnings, you've never been able to call this a  more than now.Data by .Coffee empire   was hit harder than most during this bear market, due to the company's high exposure to China where COVID-19 originated.

(\"Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,\" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.)

Stocks can fall for a variety of reasons, but market history proves that it pays to keep a long-term perspective and stay positive about the future.With that said, there are some good deals available right now. Three that could be rewarding investments from current levels\u00a0over the next decade are \u00a0,  , and .Fears of a global epidemic from the virus have driven these stocks, which were already good deals to begin with, to even lower valuations. Here's why you should consider buying shares today.Image source: Getty Images.After a few years of being bogged down by  from , shares of Intel were in rebound mode before the virus flared up, as the chip giant found some much needed momentum heading into 2020.\u00a0The shares currently fetch a conservative valuation of 11.8 times trailing earnings and pay a dividend yield of 2.25%.\u00a0Intel is starting to fight back against AMD, which has taken share of the server market from Intel.\u00a0Intel's data center group, including high-end chips for servers, managed to grow revenue by 19% year over year in the fourth quarter, driven by robust demand for Xeon processors.\u00a0But the short term could get bumpy. While the impact from  on operations so far, other factors could come into play as the year progresses. Some analysts anticipate that Intel may get into a price war with AMD to win back share, and that could pressure near-term profitability.\u00a0Looking at the bigger picture, Intel is laying the groundwork for long-term growth. It's planning nine new product releases on 10-nanometer this year, including a next-gen mobile processor, a 5G base station system-on-chip, and an artificial intelligence accelerator.\u00a0Intel is also working on a discrete graphics processor.Also, a 7-nanometer chip, which AMD has already launched,\u00a0is on track to release by the end of 2021.\u00a0AMD is winning now, but Intel has the ingredients to deliver returns for investors. It's generating $16.9 billion in free cash flow to fuel investments in new products and dividends.\u00a0It's not going to take much to send the shares higher from here.One of the most vulnerable industries to the potential impact of the coronavirus is travel. Fears that travelers are going to stay home have hit Booking stock hard in recent weeks. It's similar to what happened to travel stocks after Sept. 11, 2001.\u00a0Shares of Booking Holdings are down 11% over the last month but trade at a modest valuation of 16.7 times this year's earnings estimates.\u00a0During the fourth-quarter conference call, management warned that the coronavirus has already had a negative impact. Currently, Booking is expecting that the number of room nights booked will be down between 5% and 10% in the first quarter.\u00a0However, Booking has a stellar record of delivering growth.\u00a0Revenue has climbed more than 500% over the last 10 years, while free cash flow per share has grown faster, up 890%. Those gains have fueled a similar rise in the stock price.\u00a0It has a strong competitive advantage with a wide network of thousands of hotels and restaurants across 230 countries.\u00a0This should protect the moat against potential entrants to the market, including tech giants such as\u00a0.\u00a0Booking has the customer service, mobile apps, and relationships with hotel owners around the world to guard and expand its share of the market and deliver growth for investors.\u00a0In the short term, management is focused on\u00a0investing in alternative accommodation offerings, such as attractions, dining, ground transport, and flights.\u00a0Booking is also building out a payments platform to provide a more personalized and frictionless customer experience.\u00a0 compared to previous years. Last year, revenue increased by just 4%,\u00a0but adjusted earnings were up 15%.Still, this is a leader in a growing industry, and the recent sell-off has taken the stock down to attractive valuation levels.\u00a0The underwear brand continues to show that its valuation is out of whack with underlying business performance. While the market is worried about the sluggish innerwear segment, total sales increased by 2% in 2019,\u00a0with currency-neutral organic revenue up slightly in the fourth quarter.That doesn't sound like much, but this is a stock with a price-to-earnings ratio of about 7 times. Any sustained level of growth could deliver a double on the share price over the next few years.\u00a0This looks like a well-managed business. Management is controlling costs and\u00a0allocating resources to drive better returns for investors,\u00a0and this can be seen in the 13% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter.\u00a0Management expects future performance to be even better.The highlight of the business continues to be the , with sales up 22% year over year in the fourth quarter.\u00a0This is now a $1.9 billion business (about a quarter of total revenue) and still has tremendous potential for long-term growth.\u00a0Management has spent the last few years stabilizing the weak performance of the innerwear business while focusing on where to improve sales growth (e.g. Champion) and drive faster growth in profit.\u00a0CEO Gerald Evans believes 2020 is the year Hanesbrands will turn a corner.On the recent conference call, Evans said:With a lot of heavy lifting done ... we believe 2020 represents an inflection point for our company, one that reveals the underlying strength of our ongoing business and unleashes the full potential of our capital allocation model to drive accelerated shareholder returns.\u00a0The stock pays an above-average dividend yield of 4.8%.\u00a0With a low P/E, high yield, and a management team making the right moves, the coronavirus sell-off might be the last chance investors have to buy this \u00a0at rock-bottom prices.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Hey, it's Chris. Thanks for listening to this week's . If you're like me, you're probably seeing a lot of red in your portfolio, it has certainly been a very rough week and we're going to get to that right off the bat.We begin with the worst week for the stock market since the financial crisis in 2008. More than $6 trillion in  value has disappeared, gentlemen. The  hit a new high just over a week ago, and by Friday morning, it had fallen to 15% from that point.There is a lot to get to, including some company-specific news. But Ron Gross, let me start with you. Generally, when you look at this as an investor -- and we've seen entire years when the market goes down 15% -- but when it happens this quickly, when you look at your portfolio and everything is red it's really, really jarring. It's jarring, and I try not to focus too much on my portfolio during times like this. It's just not healthy, it doesn't feel right, it doesn't feel good. I focus on, if I have cash to put to work, what do I want to do with it? I am doing that now to a certain extent. We're at the early stages of this, this could be a recession for all we know. With the Fed, kind of, powerless to do much about it, because this is really a supply problem, not a demand problem, and the monetary policy doesn't really address supply chain problems that well. Nevertheless, investors are pricing at 100% likelihood that the Fed will cut on March 18, which is interesting. But listen, there's disruption all over the place, the health concern, obviously, a major, major factor; disruption of travel, commerce -- as I said -- the global supply chain; near-term hit to earnings for sure; near-term hit to stock prices, we're seeing. We just don't know how long this will last, but, for sure, panicking -- both, from a health perspective and a stock perspective -- won't help anything. Yeah, it's certainly natural when you think about how individuals, and individual investors, for sure, may react to a situation like this. There's so much uncertainty, it's a very fluid situation, we don't know. Our minds tend to play tricks on us and we start to expect the worst and then you can just see how it plays forward. Let's not forget, we haven't seen a real pullback like this in over a year, at least. And, on average, pullbacks like this happen every 12 to 15 months or so. This is pretty exceptional because of where we are coming off of a fantastic 2019, that investors really got -- in some ways -- a little bit complacent. We've been talking about raising some cash in your portfolios, being ready for a situation like this so you can, both, have a little ballast to your portfolio from a volatility perspective, but as Ron said, have some money ready to work.So, when I think about the investing landscape, you know, this may continue for the next few months, we don't really know, investors have to be ready for that situation. I think, more importantly, you have to use this as an opportunity to make sure you're ready for the next three to five years of investing, because that's the time frame you want to be looking at as the investor. Yeah, I love that perspective, use this as a time to prepare and a time to learn. I think a lot of us have looked at this past week. And, I know, I certainly harken back to being an investor through the Great Recession. That was a unique point in time where we witnessed some market behavior that just had not happened, either ever before or in a very long time. So, if this is your first massive market correction that you've been through, it's scary, no question, utilize this point in time to learn more about yourself as an investor and perhaps incorporate some heuristics, some ways to teach yourself how to cope with these periods of time.I will remind you, as investors, it is not a loss until you sell, OK. So, while the market being down, you see a lot of your holdings down and that doesn't look good, you haven't lost anything yet, OK; it's not a loss until you sell.And going back to the cash point, I do think, with the ferocity of this sell-off -- I mean, this past week has been phenomenal for a number of reasons. This is a great reminder of the value of holding cash in your portfolio. I mean, the levels will vary from investor to investor, but having that liquidity, that ability to pull the trigger on anything that you want, whenever you want, that's the return, and I think that makes a big difference. And it's a great reminder too that you don't have to do it all once, do it slowly, because this will likely go on for some period of time, it's very difficult to quantify the impact of the market. And clearly, we've seen a lot of selling thus far this week, but it's OK to take it slow.Yeah, I agree, definitely. It's easy for us to say, as professionals, to put cash to work and to buy when things are down, but it's scary, it's very scary for the individual investor and I completely understand that. I do like how Warren Buffett tends to put things into perspective. And he recently says, he's buying stocks for 10 or even 20 years, and he doesn't see anything coronavirus-related that would upend any of those investment theses he has for the next 10 or 20 years. So, if we widen the perspective, widen the time frame, I think it can help lower our anxiety. And we've been saying since the coronavirus first broke that, among other things as investors, this is an opportunity to pay extra attention to the leadership of the companies that you own shares of, how are they communicating, what are they doing with guidance. And to go to a point that you touched on, Jason, when we think about earnings over the rest of this year and possibly into 2021, it's going to be interesting to see the ripple effect of this. Here are just a couple of the big tech companies and moves that they've made, which may not necessarily have a direct impact on earnings, but I think it's worth noting things like,  has canceled its annual developer conference and that was scheduled for May. Next month, there's going to be a game developers conference in San Francisco, both  and Facebook have pulled out of that.And when you look at Japan, where schools are closed through the end of March, Japan is looking to host the Summer Olympics in Tokyo this summer, and there is a window of opportunity for this to be contained, and if we get past that, it's not inconceivable that the Olympics get canceled. And then, if you're a , which owns NBC, and you've sold over $1 billion worth of ads, Andy, yeah, there's going to be a financial impact there. Yeah, as a Comcast shareholder [laughs] my portfolio would definitely feel it. You're starting to see analysts cut their earnings projections for the stocks in the S&P 500. I've seen them down 5%, 10% from where they were just a few months ago. We're seeing yields at all-time record lows; the 10-year and the two-year now are both record lows. So, I think the Fed will have to feel, like, they have to cut. Even though I agree, I don't know if it will do much. This is, as Ron said, it's really a supply challenge, not a demand challenge, as so many other of the Fed cuts do benefit.So, it'll be interesting how the reaction from the financial players go forward looking at the coronavirus.  has cut their GDP estimates now 2.8% globally, down from 3.1%. So, you're starting to see these numbers go out into the public markets and that's having even more of a ripple effect, but it's actually very real. As you said, companies, smartly, are starting to react, and hopefully the best ones are getting ahead of it. I think it's going to be really fascinating to see what happens over this weekend, because I think when you look at Monday through Friday, normal market hours. And I mean, it's easy just to think about things domestically here, but I mean, you can go halfway around the world, it's a time change, right, Chris. I mean, the market is open at all times in the end. So, it's really difficult to get out in front of any kind of news here to stanch the bleeding, so to speak.I would be very surprised, if we didn't see this weekend the Fed jump in and really try to control the narrative here in some capacity to calm people down. It's weird, it feels like we hear more about the Fed in this coronavirus as opposed to the CDC. And the CDC, [laughs] seems a little bit more relevant. But I mean the Fed has a lot of levers to try to at least settle things down on the market. I would be very surprised if we didn't see some type of headline, some type of official statement coming out of the Fed here over the weekend to try to stanch the bleeding, so to speak. Now, whether it works or not is another point entirely.But, I mean, yeah, it's not like this is going to get contained overnight, it's going to take time to develop a vaccine and then to produce it and then to administer it. I mean, this is something that could stretch out for many, many months. And I would not be surprised at all, if we saw a mild recession as a byproduct of this toward the end of the year. I mean, it's totally within the realm of possibility. Agreed with that. From an optimistic perspective, I will say, the strength of the U.S. economy it's pretty strong right now. And so first, to hit us while we're strong is a good thing. The strength of our healthcare system, despite what you'll listen here on the debate stage, is very strong. We're able to handle a contagion like this. Especially, one that luckily doesn't actually appear to be that severe; this is not killing everyone it touches, thank God! So, we are in a relatively good position to get through this. You know it's interesting, on Friday, I think part of the news was also that the inflation data that came out in the U.S. was actually not that robust, so I think that put even more pressure on, like, \"Wow! is the economy really in a position where it can thrive in a case of an exogenous factor like this coronavirus?\" So, there is a little bit of more of looking at the Fed and looking at interest rates, given the conditions of the U.S. economy that inflation is just not growing very fast. So, as we wrap up on this topic -- and, Ron, I'll start with you -- what do you tell investors who are -- however nervous they are, they're looking at their portfolio, maybe they've got a little bit of cash to work with, what advice do you give investors who are thinking about maybe making a move here?I find it easiest to just tell them what I'm doing, which is, I'm not focusing on my existing portfolio and how it looks compared to how it looked a month ago; that's just not helpful. I am a buyer of stocks, I have put money to work this week, if things continue to go down, I will continue to do that. I looked across my cash balance, I divided it by approximately five, and I said, \"I'll buy in five different stages over the next weeks or months,\" depending on how this goes. And I think that's a relatively measured approach. Jason? Yeah, I like that. Take it slow, take the cash that you have, try to give yourself a formalized plan as far as the time frame, because you see it, time and time again, people want to just plow everything into one market sell-off, thinking it couldn't get any worse, and clearly it's gotten a lot worse. But for investors -- before this happened, after it happened, during -- go through your portfolio, assess the businesses that you own today, take a look and ask yourself the simple question, \"Is this a good business?\" And I know it seems like a silly question, but the fact of the matter is, in times like these, you can change your opinion a little bit. So, asking yourself whether this is a good business or not, that can really help dictate, No. 1, whether you want to hang on to those businesses, but also, it can help dictate what kinds of businesses you want to add to your portfolio in times like these. Andy? Yeah, nothing more to add -- I mean, two smart pieces of advice. I add a little bit of some stock this week as well too, I think that advice is great. I might want to also use it as an opportunity, to Jason's point, when I look forward over the next five years, maybe I have some businesses in there that I'm just not that excited about. Yes, they're going to be down, and to Jason's points, it's only a loss if you actually sell it, but maybe use it as a chance to trim your portfolio, maybe get rid of ones that you're not so excited about. Because the prices -- you're going to have opportunities to buy stock in prices very attractive, I think, over the next few months here. So, you want to have that cash ready to go. Shares of Teladoc up 20% this week after fourth-quarter revenue came in higher than expected. Teladoc posted a loss, but that was smaller than expected. And, Jason, I'm guessing, given the current environment, at least a few more people are open to the idea of seeing a doctor through videoconferencing. I think that's a safe assumption. I think this very well may be the point in time, the event that seals the deal on total buy in regarding the merits of telemedicine. Fortunately for shareholders, Teladoc is building up the most comprehensive offering in the industry. The numbers are really impressive -- U.S. paid members up 61% now, to 36.7 million. Visit fee only access members up 104%, to 19.3 million. And total visits for the year were up 57% to more than 4.1 million. Revenue growth was 27%, most of that was organic. Guiding for 2020 in very much the same fashion.And they've got really, I think, a big and continuing tailwind in the Medicare Advantage patients that are going to be coming into the system here as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, they can do to bring down the barriers in making telemedicine more accessible for those senior citizens.So, I think it was a smart move on their part to not focus on the coronavirus in the call, because in theory, really that probably is a tailwind for their business, but nevertheless, again, I think we are at a point now where buy-in is inevitable and that is ultimately a good thing. Home Depot and \u00a0 wrapping up their fiscal years this week. Let's start with Home Depot. Andy, fourth-quarter revenue was a little light, but profits, higher than expected. Shares of Home Depot down a little bit, but not nearly as much as the market. It was actually a very nice quarter. Comp growth, the same-store sales growth, up 5.2%, that's on the 52-week measurement period was higher, the estimate was around 4.7%. Transactions, up about a little less than 1%. Average ticket price, up 4.4%. So, it was nice to see that growth in, both, their pro and their do-it-yourself markets.Big-ticket sales are now 20% of their overall sales; and that was up double-digits. Gross margin was a little bit lighter. Operating margin up nicely. They continue to invest in technology to grow the business.Store sales growth for the coming year, the guidance is for 3.5% to 4%, which is pretty nice. Also, some nice growth on the EPS line. So, overall, a pretty nice quarter for Home Depot, $245 billion market cap. They increase the dividend 10%, which I like to see, and are now targeting to increase that every year that they grow operating profits. Lowe's fourth quarter, not as strong as Home Depot's. And, Ron, when you combine that with Lowe's guidance for 2020, stock down around 14%, 15% for the week. Yeah, that's the headline, not as strong as Home Depot and kind of weak overall. Same-store sales up only 2.5%, lower than expected. Growth driven almost entirely by U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. Online sales up only 3%. Management fell on the sword a bit saying, \"Marketing activities should have been launched earlier in November, not as close to Black Friday as it was.\" They are investing about $1.7 billion in the supply chain; very necessary. So far have added three new bulk distribution facilities and four cross-dock terminals; this will help them supercharge their e-commerce business, which I think is essential at this point.As you mentioned, guidance was a bit weak; investors were not happy to see that. You see a divergence between Home Depots and Lowe's valuation more so than in the past. 16X forward earnings for Lowe's, Home Depot at 21X. That's a bigger spread than you typically see. Marvin Ellison was brought in to run Lowe's in the summer of 2018. A lot of attention, talk of a big turnaround. We're closing in on two years on the job, how do you think that's going? Am I correct, that he was the CEO of JCPenney at one point? You are correct. Well, there you go. Not great. The online business is weaker than it should be. They should have taken action, I think, more quickly, but they do have investments there. They're trying to work this out. Shares of , up 16% this week after a strong holiday quarter. Jason, Etsy is still lower than where it was a year ago, and I'm wondering if this fourth quarter report is a sign of good things to come? I think it is. I mean, this has become, I think, a really impressive business given its marketplace model and the constant focus on the part of CEO, Josh Silverman, to continue to bring more service and value to not only sellers but buyers as well. All of those efforts are starting to pay off. They just quarter-in and quarter-out chalk up these impressive growth numbers. For the quarter, the total sellers was up 28%; active buyers of 17.5%. Mobile continues to gain share of overall gross merchandise sales, which by the way, those gross merchandise sales grow 33% to more than $1.6 billion flowing through their network. And they're calling for 25% to 28% gross merchandise sales growth for 2020, and revenue with a range a little bit higher than that.So, I think one of the big questions for Etsy has been around their Etsy ads product. And it's what ultimately helps sellers in advertising around the internet. They are iterating, they're developing that program, so it's going beyond Etsy ads, and they're also going to have Etsy offsite ads, where it's going to be more promotion on properties, Facebook, Instagram, , things like that. I think there's a lot of potential there. I think sellers can benefit a lot from that, as long as it's executed in a thoughtful fashion; and we have every reason to believe they will.One final lever, that's really starting to play out, is free shipping. And just an interesting little datapoint here. A survey they conducted in January, only 12% of Etsy buyers were actually aware that they offer free shipping. I would imagine as that number goes up that should boost traffic and gross merchandise sales. Best Buy closed out the fiscal year in style. Fourth quarter profits came in higher than expected. Ron, you can add Best Buy to the list of retailers having a good holiday quarter. Very impressive. Same-store sales up 3.2%. This is their 12 straight quarter of comparable sales growth. Who would have thunk it back in the day? [laughs] Investments to beef up their e-commerce business have paid off. Online revenue up 19%. Gross margins narrowed a bit, just because of product mix, but adjusted earnings up 7% almost. They did mention the coronavirus on the call, they think it'll be mostly a first half of the year impact, how they know that, I don't know, but they're looking at it as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact their long-term strategy and initiatives.But, of course, there are some supply chain related issues that they called out, they took that into account when giving guidance. As a result, guidance was relatively weak compared to what investors were expecting, but the stock's only 12X earnings and they continue to put up good, good numbers. That's pretty impressive that they've had comp growth for three years in a row, when you consider, ten years ago -- I don't want to say that Best Buy was at death's door, but it was the quintessential big box retailer, the jokes about it being  showroom, and the way that they retooled that business is really impressive. I'm as guilty as the next guy about really thinking they were dead in the water, and it's very impressive how they turned it. The service aspect of their business was a big, big push, and it has paid-off for sure. Fourth quarter profits for  came in higher than expected, but shares down more than 12% this week, because, Andy, Booking Holdings is Priceline, it is booking.com, it is in the travel business. Yeah, 20% of the room nights booked are over in Asia, so obviously a lot of conversation in the guidance that they put forward for the first quarter, not so good, but the results for the fourth quarter were pretty impressive. Dollar bookings, up 6%. Room nights booked, up 12%. Revenues, up about 4%. Advertising and sales, up 3%; so, nice little advertising business they're kind of working through. They're spending less on brand and advertising. They are continuing to invest in technology as a tech company in tech platform. People expenses, up 16%. IT spending, in general, up more than 40%.So, making the investments, but Chris as you mentioned, the concerns about the coronavirus really kind of overshadowing a very nice quarter. The guidance for the first quarter -- and of course, they said they don't know for sure -- is, room nights booked is going to be somewhere between down 5% and down 10%, and revenues down somewhere between 5% and 10% as well too. So, obviously, that's going to hit on the earnings per share line, which is expected to drop somewhere around 15%. And of course, investors got nervous about that and sold the stock off. See, this takes me back to the point you made, Jason, about looking at a company in a time like this and saying simply, \"Is this a good business?\" And Booking Holdings, unlike -- and not to pick on them -- but unlike the cruise lines, I look at Booking Holdings and think, \"Well, there's a stock I don't own.\" And, yes, it's in the travel business but I'm going to put that on my watchlist, because at the end of the day it's a good business. Yeah, I mean it is a simple question, but it can be very, very helpful in just trying to make those simple assessments and what you want your portfolio to look like going forward. Big CEO move this week. Bob Iger stepped down effective immediately as the CEO of Disney; he is staying on as Executive Chairman. Bob Chapek becomes the seventh CEO in Disney history. Jason, I say this as a Disney shareholder. Who is this guy? [laughs] I mean, I think that's a fair question. I mean this was probably a bit of a shocking headline at first for a lot of us, but once we got a little bit more clarity as to what Bob Iger really wants to do, I don't think it's that big of a deal. The question, to your point, is: Is Mr. Chapek the right person for the job? I know there are some questions in regard to his background with Parks and Experiences. Maybe most in the financial media think this is more of a streaming company and therefore a streaming expert should be leading the way. Let's not forget that Parks and Experiences really still are the bread and butter of this company. Even though we know the future is going to streaming and over-the-top entertainment is going to play a big role.Listen, I think, Chapek is a fine choice, and most of that comes from the fact that he has the blessing of Bob Iger. And I don't want to put Bob Iger on a pedestal, no one's perfect, but he certainly did one heck of a job during his tenure there with Disney, and it's worth noting that he's going to spend the last year-and-a-half of his time to 2021 working on the creative side and really helping address, I think, one of the biggest challenges this company has in the near term. And that is, building out a content library for Disney+, because as cool as it is, a lot of that content is pretty old. And so, they're going to have to start getting some new content in there to keep viewers interested in coming back for more. I like knowing that Iger is going to be running that. And I think having Iger as a resource is going to serve Mr. Chapek very well over the course of the next year, as he gets settled in his new role. Yeah, agreed. With Iger as Executive Chairman and In-Charge of Creative Direction, I feel like Chapek is more of a COO at this point, at least for the next year-and-a-half and he appears to be kind of this no nonsense, nuts-and-bolts and numbers guy. Which is kind of what you want in a CEO often. Now a year-and-a-half from now, when he takes over more creative control and more of the future control of this company, I might get a little nervous than, when Iger actually leaves. Yeah. That's certainly a fair point, something worth keeping in mind, I mean, I think a good analogy here is that Kevin Johnson-Howard Schultz dynamic at . I mean, it's working out so far but it's certainly worth noting that Mr. Johnson had a lot of time to learn from Howard Schultz along the way, and I think that plays out on their business well also. Interesting on how the partnerships work. We saw over at Salesforce, the Co-CEO situation changed a little bit, and the CEO stepped down, stepped away, so, now Marc Benioff is back in running as the CEO solely. It is interesting, the hand-off as they think about. These businesses are so complex and there is so much now goes into running these massive organizations that having someone in distributed capacity that can really work well together could actually be, maybe, a little bit more of the future, although it's really hard, I think, to get right. And like you, Jason, I don't want to put Bob Iger on a pedestal; I do think we should take 30 seconds and give him his due, because Bob Chapek has a tough act to follow. Even if you only look at Disney through the lens of acquisitions and the way Iger was able to buy Pixar and Lucasfilm and Marvel Entertainment, and what that did to open up every other part of Disney's business. Yeah. And I think it's also important to think about, going forward, is Mr. Chapek view going to line-up with what Mr. Iger view has been in regard to the company. And all the interviews I've seen with the two, since this was announced, it really does look like Mr. Chapek is looking to just keep the ball rolling on the foundation that Bob Iger has built.And, listen, it seems to have worked thus far. I like that philosophy, so I expect good things. Shares of Shake Shack down around 20% this week. Fourth quarter profits look good, Ron, but same-store sales were down 3.5%, and overall sales -- they're still growing, but that growth is slowing. Yep. Not a great quarter, and guidance was weak as well. Company saw growth in deliveries slowing amid a shift to a sole partnership with , which is relatively unique for these restaurants to go with one delivery partner. As you mentioned, same-store sales down about 3.6%, that includes 1.8% increase in ticket prices, but offset by 5.4% decline in traffic. I'm no restaurateur, but I don't think you want declines in traffic. Operating expenses were up. Margins narrowed. The company generated a net loss of $2.1 million for the fourth quarter.In their guidance, they also talked about coronavirus, they do have some international locations; about 95 out of their 280 are located internationally. They do have some in China as well. We'll see what impact that has. So, Ron, you're a New Yorker, right? Yeah. Okay. So, we were talking about this earlier this week, Chris and I, on . And I can't help but wonder, if Shake Shack doesn't have that Bojangles' dynamic, in where it's a good concept, good food, good brand and everything, but given their regional popularity and given that's a burger joint at the end of the day, I wonder that maybe they just have trouble leaping out of that geographic footprint. Maybe it's not something that translates so well nationwide. I mean, I don't see them ever getting to a -like 2,500 stores, do you?No. I haven't even heard them say that that's their goal. I mean, you are right, it's a burger and shake shop at the end of the day, which I think does transfer through to most parts of this country. Interestingly, they rolled out a chicken nugget line this year, which was a bit of a misstep, and they've spent a lot of time focusing on it -- ... a bit of a stumble. [laughs] A bit of a stumble. And that kind of impacted results as well. So, they probably should just stick to their knitting. I was just going to say, you know, at least the one thing you can say about Shake Shack is they stick to their knitting, they're just burgers and shakes. I wasn't even aware that they were attempting chicken nuggets.Before we get to the stocks on our radar, guys, one story caught my attention this week and I think it could have some interesting ripple effects. Panera Bread which is part of JAB Holding Company, a private company that owns Krispy Kreme, Insomnia Cookies, Peet's Coffee and other delicious businesses.Panera Bread is launching a monthly coffee subscription. So, for $9 a month you get unlimited coffee and tea. And as someone who works in a building that is across the street from a Panera, I am very, very interested in this opportunity. And they're going to lose money on me, because I'm absolutely going to drink more than $9 worth of coffee a month. But you'll take an extra egg sandwich here and there, I bet? I probably will, but I'm curious to see not only how much coffee I can drink, but also, how this plays out, first-and-foremost, in the world of coffee. I mean, our building is on a corner and across the street is a Panera, and on the next corner is a Dunkin' Donuts, and on the next corner is an Einstein's. So, I'm just going to say right now, Dunkin' and Einstein's are going to be getting less of my business in the immediate future because of this.This is absolutely, Ron, something that other businesses are watching, even if they're not developing their own plans to jump into this model, right? It's a very good idea. It's very well-priced. They'll probably still make money because coffee is basically water plus some coffee. [laughs] But even if it's a loss-leader, it probably makes sense to bring folks in to buy the extra pastry, the extra egg sandwich. It definitely puts the pressure on the competition, as you noted. It's a big deal for my family, in fact, I texted my wife about this earlier, and her response is, \"Wow, this is amazing news!\" [laughs] She's right, it is amazing news. [laughs] Well, I was doing the math and we probably spend $40 to $50 on coffee beans in our house every month, and we make most of our coffee at home. Well, Chris, last I heard, $9 is less than $40 to $50, so I'm compelled to at least give this a shot. But further to your question in regard to, other restaurants taking this into consideration, I mean, imagine the direction this could go. I mean, you have a Chipotle guacamole club, you've got a Chick-fil-A waffle fries club. The possibilities are endless. I don't think that's an overstatement. I think, Andy, when you look at any number of businesses, not just restaurants, but across retail, the recurring revenue model is one we like to see as investors. Yeah. We have Software-as-a-Service, this is basically \"Coffee-as-a-Service,\" it's a subscription business. I imagine that the retention rates will be fairly high. You have to join MyPanera, their membership club, so it's -- ... which is free. Which is free, exactly. Now, you can only get one cup of coffee every two hours, Chris. There are some restrictions. And only during, you know, when it's open. So, there are some slight limitations to it. It helps that they have actually good coffee. If it was just mediocre coffee, whatever -- Yeah. And also, tea, you can get tea with it too. This is a Disney+ price point. I mean, whoever priced this thing, they put some thought into it, because you're almost doing yourself a disservice if you do not subscribe. I mean, if you're a coffee or a tea drinker, you're losing money if you don't subscribe to this. Great! something else I have to subscribe to now. Well, but to Ron's point, I mean, they've picked not only a good price point, but they've picked the right product, because it is a product that lends itself, \"So, I'm going to have -- yes, I'll have coffee on its own, but maybe I want a little snack in the afternoon or maybe I want a breakfast sandwich to go with it.\"And I think to your point, Jason, whether it's Chipotle, Bojangles', any of these burger joints, any of these fast-casual places, they got to figure out, what is that thing for them? Yeah, I still think it's -- I looked at Chipotle and guacamole. Chipotle's chips, they're like the new  fries. They're just so good, they're not as good, I don't get anywhere else. But the guacamole is just ridiculously good, I feel like there is something there. And their third iteration of queso may finally be the ticket. The queso blanco. I was just going to say, yeah, it's interesting and probably correct that Jason is suggesting guacamole and not queso, because they got guacamole right, right out of the gate.And I mean, there's nothing to say, you can't throw a choice in there, right? It could be the queso/guacamole, because you get to choose which one you want. Definitely going to be watching this business and I will be highly caffeinated while it's going on.Hey, real quick.

Our man behind the glass, Steve Broido is going to hit you with a question. Ron Gross, you're up first. What are you looking at this week? I'm going back to   trash removal, recycling, other services to residential and commercial customers. Going with it, because it feels safer to me in this current environment, this uncertain environment, even though the stock is off about 13% this week. But it is a dominant company. An essential business. Limited outside threats. Competitive advantages in the fact that they have North America's largest network of landfills. They've succeeded both through organic growth and acquisitions. They've increased their dividend for 16 consecutive years; and their yield currently stands at 1.9%. Steve, question about Waste Management? Does Waste Management have a total monopoly, like, when my trash gets picked up, is it just de facto go to a Waste Management facility? Not de facto, but there are regional monopolies and they control them very nicely. Jason Moser, what are you looking at? Sure. I'll go with what I personally bought this week. We're talking about slow and methodical, right. Well, I opened a position in , ticker ADBE. Adobe, as we know, is a digital media company, shares are down 12% since February 19, but, Steve, I know you're very familiar with Adobe. So, I'll keep it tight.Ultimately this is a subscription business. 90% of its business is tied to subscriptions. Gross margins closing in on 90%. Net margins in the 25% to 30% range. And it's such a good offering through their Creative Cloud and this new Aero product that they have that focuses on immersive technology. It gives management the ability to consistently invest 15% to 20% of revenue back into research and development, which just keeps the good times rolling with a company like this. Just a wonderful business; I think, still plenty of room to run. Steve, question about Adobe? They're certainly dominating the creative space. Is there a market they should be in that they're not? Perhaps queso, I mean, Chipotle has opened the door, I think there's really a lot of opportunity in queso. [laughs] Coffee. Andy Cross, what are you looking at? Stevo, looking at , symbol is KNSL. It's a $2.7 billion, so it's a small cap specialty insurer; writes what's called E&S lines -- so, it's excess and surplus lines -- of insurance. These are very hard-to-price insurance. So, construction, mining, marijuana dispensing. It's a recommendation in a few of our services. The stock has done really well for an insurance company. It grows very fast. They grew premiums more than 50% last quarter. It's a really good market right now, growth across all of their lines. IPO-ed at about $16 in 2016, it's now at $116. Had a very nice run. The stock is a little bit expensive, 40X earnings and 6.5X book value. So, just looking to see how the price reacts in this market, because it could be one that I would go shopping for. This is a fellow Virginia company, isn't it? This is a fellow Virginia company. Michael Kehoe founded the company and owns 4.5%. Steve, question about Kinsale Capital? You bet. Does this company have outsized risk with things like that coronavirus that could ripple down across multiple industries? It could. Interestingly, they had earnings a few weeks ago, and they didn't mention it on the call. So, not sure how that plays out long-term for them. Adobe, Waste Management, Kinsale Capital. Three very different businesses, Steve. You got one of those you want to add to your watchlist? I love trash and I love Ron Gross. Let's go with Waste Management. I love you too, Stevie. Am I the only one who now wants to watch a reality show where Ron and Steve throw up their own trash collection business? [laughs] Yeah -- [laughs] They're on to something big. Alright.

Last year, its adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.1 billion, and it had previously been forecasting double-digit percentage growth this year. However, when it provided that outlook on Feb. 13, the company stated that it was expecting a $30 million to $40 million EBITDA hit from coronavirus in the first quarter. But with the outbreak having reached pandemic levels, the company now sees that prediction as too optimistic.\"As COVID-19 has rapidly spread from Asia to Europe and North America over the past few weeks, travel trends have continued to worsen,\"\u00a0said Chairman Barry Diller and Vice Chairman Peter Kern in a press release. \"It remains difficult to predict how long this pandemic will persist, and given the lack of visibility on our trends we've decided to withdraw our 2020 guidance.\"Notably, many nations' travel restrictions were implemented late in this quarter, suggesting that the hardest hit to the travel industry could come later in the year.Similarly, on Monday,   pulled its first-quarter 2020 guidance.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.On Feb. 26, Booking Holdings held its fourth-quarter , and issued Q1 guidance that attempted to factor in the negative impact of COVID-19. The company guided for a \u00a0(adjusted) revenue decline of 3% to 7% on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA of $560 million to $590 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share of\u00a0$9.05 to $9.65 -- down 14% to 19% year over year. That it felt compelled to pull that guidance less than two weeks later suggests just how rapidly conditions in the travel industry are declining.Expedia so far has only withdrawn its adjusted EBITDA guidance, as it monitors the rapidly changing situation. However, shareholders should also note that it has suspended its share buyback program. From early December through February, it was on a share-buying spree -- repurchasing 5.8 million shares for $634 million.\u00a0Excluding undisclosed repurchases in the last month, it still has approximately 23 million shares worth of buybacks on its authorization, and at steep discounts to the average $110.72 per share it paid in December.Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, Expedia is choosing to maintain liquidity for now, even if its shares are down around 55% from their 52-week highs.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The results for '  final quarter of 2019 are in, and it's more of the usual: gross travel bookings (value of all services booked on one of the company's sites) growth of 6%, revenue growth of 4%, and adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 4%, all of which handily topped management's forecast provided a few months ago. It was a solid end to a year that began with travel disruption from the extended U.S. government shutdown and slowing global economic growth. Despite numerous fears of recession, travel is on the rise. Investor reaction to the report has been tepid, though. In fact, Booking's stock has been struggling for three years now, underperforming the market (as measured by the ) by a wide margin. The online travel company has been hit on multiple fronts. In addition to the aforementioned macroeconomic issues, there's been  in the online travel space, a strong U.S. dollar (which lowers the value of Booking's international sales), a general  as Booking has grown, and now the novel coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0Data by .The latest scare to upend the Booking, Priceline, OpenTable, and KAYAK family-led management to issue weak guidance for the first quarter of 2020: at least an 8% year-over-year drop in gross travel bookings, at least a 3% drop in revenue, and at least a 14% decrease in adjusted earnings per share. Not a fantastic read, but before you rush off to sell, there are a few points to bear in mind. Regarding the COVID-19 outbreak's origin in China, CFO David Goulden had this to say about the coronavirus-fueled outlook:The coronavirus has had an impact across our business since it made news headlines on January 21. The early impacts were increased in China, but we also saw these impacts across Asia and, to a lesser extent, in other regions outside of Asia as well. To help with context, the APAC region represents a little over 20% of our room nights with no single country accounting for more than a mid-single-digit share of total room nights. \u00a0Put simply, travel booking from any single country (except for the U.S.) is a small piece of the whole pie. If the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak keeps spreading, then investors could expect results to continue to deteriorate. But for the time being, management has already built in current travel disruption plus a little extra for some margin of safety. The coronavirus is taking its toll, but Booking remains in good shape and will likely remain profitable. \u00a0A scene being enjoyed by fewer people at the moment because of coronavirus. Image source: Getty Images.That's the short term, but longer-term it's high time investors start thinking of Booking as less of a high-growth technologist and more of a well-established . Perhaps one of the more telling signs that the days of all-out expansion are in the past was management's comments that emphasizing cost optimization is a top priority in 2020. Being an efficient spender is always a good thing, but that's not usually a point that gets highlighted on an  at a high-growth tech company. This dot.com darling has moved on to a new page in its story.  That's not a bad thing. The stock's transition in this slowdown phase hasn't exactly been graceful, but a return to share price expansion is likely in the works. Shares trade for a mere 16.7 times 2019 adjusted earnings per share, and though the immediate future is cloudy, Booking is still investing in new products to maintain its lead in the travel industry. As to progress on that front, CEO Glenn Fogel added this on the :We are on a journey to build a multi-product offering, including accommodations, flight, attractions, ground transport and dining, all connected by a seamless payment network and supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless customer experience that we believe will drive enhanced loyalty and support growth. \u00a0That  project has been in the works for a few years now, supported by Booking's multiple acquisitions to broaden its offerings for all things travel. And if an unknown amount of future growth isn't good enough, there is at least the stock repurchase program that has helped boost earnings. Over $8 billion-worth was repurchased in 2019, and there was another $11.5 billion remaining under the repurchase authorization at year-end. Plus, Booking ended the year with $11.8 billion in cash, equivalents, and investments, only $8.7 billion in debt, and generated $4.5 billion in free cash flow in 2019. That's plenty of extra pocket change for the company to keep investing return some excess cash to shareholders. It's been a rough stretch the last few years with Booking Holdings' stock stuck in an up-and-down ride to nowhere, but my money remains invested on the expectation it will soon gain some positive momentum again.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The outbreak began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China; it has killed roughly 2,500 people, infected more than 83,000 people overall and spread to nearly 50 countries, including the U.S., since then.The coronavirus has now passed the 2002-03 SARS and 2015 MERS outbreaks in scale, and that has triggered heavy selling: Stock indices around the world, including here at home, have been sent into correction territory. Numerous stock picks are already in bear markets.It's no small worry. The SARS outbreak tallied 774 deaths across more than 8,000 cases over a six-month period, yet helped knock China's GDP down from 11.1% in the first quarter of 2003 to 9.1% in the second quarter. The coronavirus's ultimate potential to disrupt the global economy is far worse.This health issue is weighing on most stocks, but it's cutting particularly deep into a few specific industries where the financial strain is already being felt. If there's any silver lining, it's that, like with SARS, this could end up being an opportunity to buy otherwise high-quality stocks at a discount for a potential snap-back.Here, we look at 13 stock picks that are being hammered by the coronavirus outbreak. These stocks might be best avoided until a clearer picture of the coronavirus's eventual fallout develops. But they eventually might be extremely attractive buy-the-dip prospects.Market value: $39.7 billionDividend yield: 2.1%Technology is becoming a more important aspect in most facets of our lives. That includes everything from AI-powered supercomputers that monitor your search queries to determine what ads to serve you up ... to, well, your toaster. And driving all of that is the humble semiconductor.Given both China's place a manufacturer and as an adopter of tech, the coronavirus has some pretty dire short-term implications for the broader semiconductor industry.Getting hit on both fronts has been Analog Devices (, $10.72).Analog Devices cut its teeth on boring, low-margin analog chips, but it has since moved into higher-margin processors used in everything from 5G communications to self-driving cars. The problem? Sales of analog chips to original equipment manufacturers have trended down, while 5G and other advanced tech rollouts have stalled in China.CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah recently had this to say:\"Unsurprisingly, we have begun to see weaker demand in China related to the extended Chinese New Year and ongoing business disruption. As such, our outlook assumes that China demand for industrial, automotive and consumer is minimal for all of February before returning to a more normal level in the last 2 months of our second quarter. And we are assuming an impact on our communications business due to the high likelihood of a delay in the 5G rollout.\"Mahendra-Rajah added that the firm will see a $70 million hit to second-quarter revenues.That potential normalization might mean now is the opportunity for a relative bargain. Shares are off more than 12% over the past week, and ADI's forward P/E has been knocked down to 22 - not cheap, but decent compared to some of its industry rivals.Moreover, Analog Devices has grown its payout for 16 consecutive years, including a 15% increase to the payout announced in mid-February. Doing so amid the coronavirus outbreak is a glimpse into management's longer-term confidence.Market value: $68.2 billionDividend yield: N/AChina's government, in an attempt to contain the coronavirus, quickly ramped up quarantine efforts and put numerous travel restrictions in place. More governments are beginning to follow suit, and travel is being curtailed in other ways too. In the U.S., for instance, several universities are canceling or rerouting travel-abroad programs.Booking Holdings (, $1,659.85) - the parent of Booking.com and Priceline, among other travel sites - has understandably been hit hard.Booking has made China, and its huge consumer base, a primary focus for growth. It has invested in leading Chinese travel sites including Trip.com () and Meituan-Dianping to gain a foothold in this market. Booking doesn't break out China revenues specifically, but it has said that China is a major part of its International Other revenues, which accounted for 13% of revenues for the first nine months of 2019.Its ties to China have weighed on the stock more recently - BKNG is down more than 15% over the past couple weeks. But this might be a case of short-term pain, long-term gain.\n\nA strengthening Chinese consumer is bolstering travel spending in the country, both domestically and internationally. China's Outbound Tourism Research Institute pegs 170% growth in the number of annual overseas trips by Chinese residents, from 149.7 million in 2018 to 400 million in 2030.How deep BKNG and similar stock picks fall is difficult to determine because COVID-19 hasn't been contained - the longer the outbreak lasts and the wider its spreads, the worse it could get for Booking. For context, though, the  says that Chinese stocks as a whole \"caught up\" with their international peers about six months after first reporting SARS to the World Health Organization.DAL Market value: $30.9 billionDividend yield: 3.2%UAL Market value: $16.1 billionDividend yield: N/AAirline stocks such as Delta Air Lines (, $48.19) and United Airlines (, $64.94) have delivered mostly flat stock performance over the past few years. However, they were already in value territory to begin 2020, and their stocks are getting even cheaper as travel fears mount.According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, only about 60,000 passengers flew from the U.S. to Wuhan last year. Delta and United don't even offer direct flights to Wuhan, though they do offer service via their OneWorld and Star Alliance partnerships. That said, their ties to China more broadly, as well as Hong Kong, are significantly stronger. For instance, Stifel analysts predict that United has about 5.5% of its capacity heading along U.S-to-China/Hong Kong routes.Both airlines have been forced to issue refunds, cancel flights and reroute people returning from China just to conduct screening measures. Now, the pain is spreading to U.S. travel. Research firm Vertical Research Partners recently said U.S. travel agency ticketing, by dollars transacted, plunged 9.4% year-over-year between Feb. 24-28. Their troubles likely will only get worse the longer the outbreak lasts - travel bans likely will become more restrictive, and people in general are likely to put off international and even domestic travel until the coronavirus situation has been contained.Worry about these outcomes have already weighed on UAL (-26% in 2020) and DAL (-18%), and might continue to drag their shares down. But there are reasons to like airline stocks once the coronavirus danger has subsided. Lower fuel costs, rising fees and overall higher ticket prices have been improving many airlines' financial situations.Analysts had been optimistically cautious at first. Bernstein analyst David Vernon, for one, predicted that the coronavirus would only affect United's earnings by 8 cents per share, writing that it would be \"less severe\" on load factors than SARS. Delta, which has less exposure to China than United, should feel an even smaller impact, he wrote. However, downgrades have been creeping into these and other U.S. airlines as they adjust for growing coronavirus concerns domestically.Market value: $213.11 billionDividend yield: 1.5%Disney (, $118.04) shares beat the market by more than 3 percentage points in 2019 on the strength of the company's Marvel and Star Wars franchises, as well as the launch of its streaming service, Disney+.But while investors fawned over Disney's big-screen success, the House of Mouse also was scoring gains in the theme-park business. \"Parks, Experiences and Products\" revenues grew 6% year-over-year in its fiscal year ended September 2019, and operating income improved by 11%.However, thanks to travel bans enacted by the Chinese government, Disney has been forced to close its Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland. Worse, it hasn't listed a reopening date. Worse still, this is coming during the critical Lunar New Year travel season. And on top of all that, its Chinese operations had been hurting already. Disney CFO Christine McCarthy  earnings release that the Hong Kong protests \"have led to a significant decrease in tourism from China and other parts of Asia\" and that the company expected a $275 million full-year revenue decline in those operations. That was before the outbreak.Disney has continued to slide more recently amid growing coronavirus concerns, specifically the potential impact on its U.S. and other international parks. Further complicating matters is the recent sudden departure of CEO Robert Iger, who led a massive expansion for the entertainment giant since taking over for Michael Eisner in 2005. He will be replaced by parks chief Bob Chapek.It's not all woes at Disney: Its new Disney+ service is a hit and racking up new subscribers at a rapid clip. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Bernie McTernan wrote ahead of Disney's most recently quarterly report that he expected the company to claim 25 million subscribers for its streaming service, versus a previous 21 million estimate. Disney exceeded his and other expectations by saying it had already reached 28.6 million.Disney has its short-term work cut out for it, but the coronavirus selloff is at least knocking a lot of froth off the stock's valuation. It now trades at 22 times forward-looking estimates, which isn't a steal, but is considerably cheaper than what investors had been paying for months.Market value: $210.9 billionDividend yield: 7.0%China became the world's largest importer of crude oil in 2016. You can thank not just China's growing internal demand, but also fracking and low-cost shale production in the U.S., for that.But that kind of position can create some serious hiccups in the global energy market.The coronavirus has already knocked about 3 million barrels per day off China's consumption. That, as well as worries about what will happen as the COVID-19 spreads across the world, is hammering oil prices, which have fallen into bear-market territory (a decline of at least 20% from a peak.) WTI currently trades at $44 per barrel - the lowest prices we've seen in more than a year.For pure energy exploration-and-production companies, profits are simply a measure of the commodity's price minus their costs to produce it. At these low prices, not many can generate any sort of real value from crude. But Exxon Mobil (, $49.82) can, and it's at 15-year-low prices. From a valuation perspective, it's trading at 14 times future earnings estimates, which is less than the market. XOM also has a more-than-generous 7.0% yield on a .Exxon absolutely has issues. Indeed, lower oil prices will negatively impact Exxon's E&P business. Analysts are worried that the company is falling behind on its multiyear growth plan. And in turn, Wall Street has been lowering its price targets.But as an integrated energy super-major, XOM has its ladles in a variety of soups, from pipelines and production to refining chemicals and LNG exports. The firm has spent plenty of dollars expanding into low-cost shale regions like the Permian Basin. In fact, Exxon Mobil believes that its breakeven costs for the Permian will be around $15 per barrel in the near future. Meanwhile, the energy stock has turned its attention to toward exporting natural gas with new deals with India's IndianOil and Petronet. Moreover, natural gas demand in China continues to grow despite declines in crude oil.The panic selling might be overdone. Don't try to \"catch a falling knife\" and buy the stock today. But once the price stabilizes for a few weeks to a month, XOM finally might be ready for new money.Market value: $5.6 billionDividend yield: N/AChina's presence as a low-cost manufacturing hub has long been a crutch for retailers, particularly dollar stores and discounters. But the coronavirus has forced numerous factory and warehouse closures, disrupting the supply chain and dinging retailers who are forced to contend with higher prices for goods.Some have been able to navigate this better than others, however.Five Below (, $101.19)  about the trade war forcing higher prices back in June, but the firm has again had to guide lower for the rest of 2020 as a result of coronavirus-related factory closures and export issues. But long term, FIVE looks exceedingly attractive - and there's a small chance its guidance is too conservative.That's because of Five Below's niche. While technically a dollar store, FIVE is targeting not adults, but their kids.Five Below sells a variety of toys, candy, health & beauty items, fashion and gadgets. It's the kind of stuff that 7- to 14-year-old kids just can't get enough of. Moreover, the target demographic tends to be upper-middle to upper class, which has allowed it to raise prices and introduce \"Ten Below\" zones in several of its stores. Q3 net sales jumped by nearly 21% during its last reported quarter. Cost controls and higher prices managed to keep operating income at still high levels despite the tariff issues.FIVE no doubt will deal with supply-chain issues as long as the coronavirus outbreak persists, but the company clearly is set for the long-term. It's also debt-free, which is a great trait for any holding during an economic disruption.Market value: $4.9 billionDividend yield: 1.5%*Expenses: 0.59%, or $59 annually on a $10,000 investmentTo say that Chinese stocks are cheap would be an understatement.China's equities were already dinged up thanks to trade-war issues and slowing growth. But the coronavirus has crushed the country's stocks to valuations not seen in years. At the beginning of January (the most recent data available), the MSCI China Index was trading at less than 12 times estimates for next year's earnings - making China one of the cheapest markets in the world, and it's certainly cheaper now than it was then.This might be a chance to buy one of the world's better long-term bets at a rare deep discount. Many of the drivers behind pre-coronavirus Chinese optimism, such as a growing and increasingly wealthier middle class, are still very much in place.One of the best ways to gain exposure continues to be the iShares MSCI China ETF (, $61.81).The exchange-traded fund tracks the aforementioned MSCI China Index, providing exposure to nearly 600 large- and mid-cap Chinese stocks. You get a \"total picture\" of the Chinese economy - large multinationals as well as smaller, regional players. Naturally, it's heaviest in the heavyweights, so you get considerable exposure to companies such as e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (), internet conglomerate Tencent () and China Construction Bank ().MCHI, at just 0.59% annually, is about half as expensive as the average Chinese-focused mutual fund.* The trailing 12-month yield, which is a standard measure for equity funds.Market value: $199.7 billionDividend yield: 1.7%The rise of the Chinese consumer isn't boosting only normal goods - it's quickly becoming a shopper's paradise for luxury products. Data from consultancy Bain & Company shows that . Moreover, rising Chinese demand for high-end handbags, jewelry, shoes and other goods accounts for more than 90% of the growth in the luxury market. Those sales happen not just in mainland China and Hong Kong, but also on trips to Europe and major U.S. cities.This trend has been a boon for luxury powerhouse LVMH (, $79.35), whose brands include Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Mo\u00ebt and Hennessy. Its revenues have grown by 11% annually over the past four years, and Asia ex-Japan sales accounted for roughly a third of 2018's total.But LVMUY shares have been hit hard, off 12% in just about a month amid worries about the economic impact of the coronavirus.Here again, though, the longer-term outlook is still rosy. The firm continues to strengthen its portfolio of brands, most recently with its $16.2 billion purchase of Tiffany, which is expected to add more than $4.4 billion in annual revenues - the bulk of that from North America. An eventual return to normalcy likely will include a return to Chinese luxury spending in many of LVMH's premier brands.Market value: $16.1 billionDividend yield: 3.8%Royal Caribbean (, $77.00) is plenty exposed to China. RCL has built up its brand in the country over the past decade, and now offers several cruises throughout the region. The resulting brand familiarity has spurred Chinese travelers to also book Royal Caribbean cruises in other parts of the world. The company said Chinese guests with non-China itineraries spiked 75% between 2016 and 2019.RCL is feeling the bite now, though. The company had to cancel a Shanghai-to-Japan sail, and it will turn away passengers either from Wuhan or who have recently traveled through the city. More broadly speaking, consumers increasingly are becoming wary of scenarios where they're trapped with others in close quarters for several days. And the spread of the coronavirus on Princess Cruises' Diamond Princess cruise ship has painted a disturbing image for would-be passengers. As of mid-February, Royal Caribbean had to cancel 18 cruises.Shares have plunged by 40% in 2020, in part because while investors assume the COVID-19 outbreak will take a financial toll, there's little visibility into just how much. During the company's quarterly earnings call at the start of February, CEO Richard Fain said when asked about how many cruises the company would have to cancel: \"We don't yet know how many.\"Like these other stock picks, RCL's short-term plunge could be a buying opportunity. For Royal Caribbean, its brand is its pull. Cruises tend to rely heavily on brand loyalty; their booking perks keep consumers entrenched in a single cruise line. And RCL has a strong grip on the Chinese market. But investors should wait for the stock to stabilize before considering dipping in.Market value: $91.9 billionDividend yield: 2.0%Comedian Lewis Black has a  about two Starbucks (, $78.29) coffee locations being directly across the street from each other. While it has more to do with the fickle nature of human beings and wait times, it does highlight how Starbucks is pretty saturated here in the U.S. That's why the Seattle coffee shop has set its sights on China as a source of new growth.They're ambitious plans, too. Starbucks is in the midst of a multiyear plan to build nearly 3,000 new stores in mainland China between 2018 and 2022. That's basically double the number of locations it had previously and equates to a new store opening every 15 hours. Starbucks is also going heavy into digital operations with news apps and partnerships with China's Alibaba. Those efforts had been bearing fruit: Starbucks reported in late January that in its most recent quarter, Chinese revenues jumped 13% year-over-year, including comparable-store sales growth (revenues from stores open at least a year) improving by 3%.Coronavirus fears have thrown all that for a loop. The coffee roaster was forced to close more than 2,000 of its current 4,300 stores in January. It remains to be seen what it will have to do in other areas of the world where it has exposure, including in the U.S.But one thing to note: Roughly 85% of its Chinese stores are open now. While the coronavirus still is spreading in China, the official numbers say the spread there has begun to slow. Starbucks says the virus will \"materially\" affect its results for the current quarter and whole year, but the impact might be less than what people are pricing in.As coronavirus goes, so does Starbucks. If China is stabilizing, SBUX could see a similar pattern of short interruptions across the world before returning to normalcy. Starbucks' forward P/E of 26 might be a decent price for the eventual rebound. If the outbreak worsens, however - especially if it rebounds in China - SBUX could get a lot cheaper.Market value: $11.9 billionDividend yield: 3.6%Wynn Resorts (, $111.16) will strike a chord with American consumers for its Las Vegas properties, but the company is very much a China play.As one of the only places in China that gambling is legal, the special district of Macau has become a travel mecca for entertainment seekers - and Wynn was one of the first groups to be granted an operating license in the region. Today, Wynn pulls almost three-quarters of its adjusted property EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) from the region - the highest among the major competitors there.The problem for investors looking to history is that Wynn's presence in Macau began after the 2002-03 SARA breakout, so there's little to compare it to. However, Jefferies analyst David Katz says a worst-case scenario for WYNN would see a roughly 29% decline from its Jan. 20 closing price - and shares have already dropped 27% since then.Interestingly, more recently, Bank of America analyst Shaun Kelley actually upgraded WYNN shares, from Neutral (equivalent of Hold) to Buy, amid stable and declining growth rates in China and abroad. While China continues to stabilize, growth rates are accelerating in other parts of the world, however.The long-term upside for Wynn isn't in VIPs, but the so-called \"mass-market gambler.\" Wynn has shifted its product mix in Macau to court the average Joe, and it's working. VIPs often demand opulent perks, cutting into their margins, but Wynn is finding that it can squeeze plenty of profit out of regular players. Thus, the company is executing several projects, including converting some luxury rooms into standards, to capture more of this market share.The quick drop in WYNN shares has also brought its yield to well more than 3%, which is on the high end of its range for the past few years.Market value: $16.5 billionDividend yield: 1.1%Pure-play Chinese domestic-consumption stocks have taken a beating. The Global X MSCI China Consumer Discretionary ETF (), for instance, has dropped by double digits in just a week's worth of trading in late January.Yum! China (, $43.75) was in the same boat, dropping 16% in five days.With more than 8,750 restaurants in over 1,300 cities, Yum! China has been among the better stock picks leveraging the domestic Chinese economy and offered up torrid growth - both when it was part of Yum! Brands () as well as following its 2015 spinoff. Yum! China is responsible for Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell operations in China.But when Chinese consumers won't - or can't - spend any money, YUMC naturally will find itself in a difficult situation. Yum! China temporarily closed some of its KFC and Pizza Hut stores in Wuhan due to the outbreak. It's a tiny fraction of its base; the real fear is that overall traffic will decline throughout the company as fewer people venture out over virus fears.But while YUMC shares could sustain even more losses the longer the coronavirus outbreak drags out, the stock has been stabilizing for several weeks amid an improving picture across most of China. A longer-term rebound seems likely given its longer-term growth drivers, such as coffee concept COFFii & JOY and its controlling interest in hot-pot chain Huang Ji Huang. And as China continues to modernize, Yum! China plans to expand its empire into more cities, targeting 20,000 potential locations in its network. In the future, you might not be able to go anywhere within the country without running into a KFC or Pizza Hut - and that would be music to investors' ears.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: The Motley Fool.\u00a0Q4 2019 , Welcome to Booking Holdings' Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call.

Go ahead, gentlemen. -- Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We had a strong fourth quarter as we booked 191 million room nights which is up 12% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. We produced over $3.3 billion in revenue and approximately $1.3 billion in EBITDA which are year-over-year increases of approximately 5% and 3% on a constant currency basis, respectively. I will talk first about our full year performance in 2019, then about our objectives for 2020. And then I will address the current situation regarding the coronavirus. 2019 was a good year for our company. We booked 845 million room nights for the year, which is 11% more than in 2018. Just to put that in context, that means we booked, on average, more than 2.3 million room nights each day. We produced strong year-over-year growth across our key financial metrics. Non-GAAP revenue and adjusted EBITDA were up 8% and 6% on a constant currency basis, respectively.Our non-GAAP EPS was up 15% on a constant currency basis, exceeding our guidance for the year. Our EPS growth rate benefited from over $8 billion of share repurchases during 2019, which demonstrates our disciplined approach to returning capital to shareholders and our confidence in our business. I am pleased with these results considering the macro environment we faced in certain geographies throughout the year. Moreover, we accomplished this top line growth rate, while also producing solid leverage in our performance marketing spend. Our ability to execute consistently in this environment speaks to our scale and global diversity as well as to the dedicated and talented teams we have at our company. We made solid progress against our key strategic goals for the year: expanding the Booking.com payment platform, improving our alternative accommodations business and further building our connected trip strategy. As we move into 2020, we will continue to focus on becoming an even more customer-centric company that drives loyalty and increased repeat behavior. We can we plan to accomplish this goal through smart customer acquisition while providing the best experience in our core accommodations product using our scale to offer the best value to our customers and making further progress in our connected trip strategy.In addition, while we have always been a cost-conscious organization, in 2020, we will further emphasize the need to make sure our expenses are appropriate for our revenue, and we'll look at ways to streamline and make all aspects of our company more efficient. Investing in products and process is important for the long term, but so too is eliminating unnecessary expense and during 2020, we'll be taking a close look at these opportunities. One of our highlights during 2019 was expanding our payment capabilities at Booking.com. Over 50% of our Booking.com's gross bookings now occur on properties that are enabled on its payment platform. The percentage of Booking.com's gross bookings processed on its payment platform grew from approximately 10% in 2018 to over 15% in 2019, and we expect this to reach approximately 25% in 2020. As we have discussed, this platform provides payment options favored by both our customers and property partners, particularly non-hotel property partners and provide a platform for merchant product offerings. Merchant offerings also provide Booking.com with merchandising capabilities, and we expect to continue to increase our investment in this capability to drive growth. This payment platform is a foundation for our connected trip strategy in which we envision a frictionless customer experience across multiple products that we believe will drive increased loyalty. Our alternative accommodations business grew solidly in 2019 and has large scale.As of December 31, 2019, we had 6.3 million listings in our alternative accommodations business. We remain focused on increasing the quality and variety of properties joining our platform so we can provide the best choices for our customers and drive search conversion. Booking.com's alternative accommodation business recorded approximately $3.1 billion in revenue in 2019, representing approximately 21% of our overall revenue for the year and a solid growth rate of 14% when expressed in euros. It consistently were faster than our core accommodations business throughout the year and also maintained a healthy profit margin. We believe presenting both alternative accommodations and traditional properties on one platform is the best customer proposition. Last year, we took further steps to create our vision of connected trip. We are on a journey to build a multi-product offering, including accommodations, flight, attractions, ground transport and dining, all connected by a seamless payment network and supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless customer experience that we believe will drive enhanced loyalty and support growth.We saw early signs of these benefits last year as we leverage the integration of rentalcars.com and Booking.com to deliver a better ground transport offering for Booking.com's customers. Rentalcars days grew 12% year-over-year in the fourth quarter primarily due to the increased cross-sell of the product to Booking.com customers. We believe we are in the early stages of seeing the benefit from this cross-sell opportunity. We've also been encouraged by certain incentive programs that provide discounted ground transport options to bookings to bookers with higher value accommodations. These programs have shown an increase in conversion at acceptable ROIs. We look forward to further experimentation with these types of offerings during 2020. We also expanded our flight capabilities across the company in 2019. Booking.com launched an integrated flight product while Agoda and Priceline began building a global flight platform that is initially focused on the APAC region. Currently, Booking.com offers a flight product in 12 countries in Europe, but we plan to expand this throughout 2020. Booking.com's goal for the year is to be able to expose 50% of its total customers to a flight product globally. Developing a robust flight product remains an important investment considering there are more than four billion global flight passengers last year. Having the ability to engage with these customers early in their travel journey gives us a better opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products. But even more important, it enables us to offer a true connected trip experience.This year, we will continue to expand other aspects of a connected trip, such as attractions and dining options. For these offerings, we will utilize not only our own assets but also partner with third-party providers, so we can offer the best customer experience possible. We continue to see loyalty benefits from accommodation customers who also use our attractions product. We will continue to invest in our app platform as it becomes the center of our connected trip experience. Booking.com remains one of the most downloaded travel apps in the iOS and Android stores globally. According to a leading third-party research firm, Booking.com was the only OTA to rank in their top 10 travel apps in the world ex China in 2019, coming in at number three. We've been investing in the app platform for some time, as it is becoming the preferred platform for travel bookings, and we are very pleased with the strong room night growth that occurs on Booking.com's Act. As I mentioned earlier, all of these investments are designed to drive greater loyalty and increased repeat behavior with our customers.We made progress on this front last year. In each quarter of 2019, our direct channel grew faster than our primary pay channels and our direct channel increased its share for the year. The direct channel represents over 50% of our total booked room nights and when including rooms booked through branded search terms, this number increases to over 60%. We have a large and loyal customer base today, but we believe we can grow this further and increase market share. Booking.com is best and most loyal customers are part of its Genius program. This group of customers has grown consistently for several years. In 2019, and we had over 70 million active Genius customers, an increase of 9% year-over-year. These Genius customers were responsible for a growing proportion of Booking.com's booked room nights in 2019, and we thank them for their loyalty. On top of that, we see that Genius customers book more frequently and more often on a direct basis when compared to non-Genius customers. We will continue to focus our efforts on growing this special group of customers and offering them great value as part of their Genius membership.While we are pleased about our long-term prospects, we recognize that current travel demand has been impacted by the coronavirus. At the present time, Greater China has been affected the most. The broader APAC region has also been impacted, which is an area in which we have been experiencing strong growth over the last several years. And we are now starting to see a slowdown in travel globally and are aware of the potential for further demand deceleration around the world. David will provide more details in his remarks. But I would like to point out, this is not the first time our company management team has faced an exogenous impact to travel demand. We know that travel is fundamental to people's lives, and we believe travel industry growth will rebound to prior growth rates. While the coronavirus impacts travel, we will continue to manage the company in a measured way that builds value for the long term. However, the steps we are taking today include: one, making sure we take care of our customers and help them with their travel plans, which includes facilitating cancellations and working closely with our supply partners; two, ensuring the health and safety of our over 26,000 employees around the world; three, managing our marketing efforts appropriately. We will continue to participate in those paid channels that provide us quality traffic and attractive ROIs, recognizing that we need to incorporate higher cancellation rates in our bidding calculations. In regards to brand marketing, we will be very cognizant of when and where brand marketing money should be spent this year. Four, working with our travel suppliers, so they are best positioned to achieve success on our platform. And five, continuing to invest for the future. The company that provides a better travel service, a holistic, seamless, frictionless connected trip that delivers more value to both the traveler and our supply partners will create a lasting relationship with both travelers and suppliers, and we intend to create this service over time.With that, I will now turn the call over to David for the financial review. -- Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter in 2019 and then discuss our thoughts on 2020 and our guidance for the first quarter. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 12% in Q4 exceeded the high end of our guidance range as growth accelerated through the quarter with a strong finish in December. Our room night growth in Europe continued to exceed our expectations despite continue to exceed our expectations in Q4 despite a macro environment that remain cautious. Room night growth rates for the rest of the world also exceeded our expectations and grew slightly faster than Europe in Q4. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down about 4% year-on-year in Q4 on a constant currency basis, which was in line with our guidance. As indicated on our last , the year-over-year ADR decline was impacted by decreases in rates within several key markets such as the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong as well as an increasing mix to faster-growing lower ADR markets and the impact of lapping 1% ADR growth in Q4 of last year.Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q4 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately one percentage point versus last year. We estimate the change in FX rates impacted gross bookings, revenue and EBITDA growth in Q4 by a similar amount and EPS growth by less than one percentage point. Q4 gross bookings grew by 6% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew about 7% on a constant currency basis, coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.3 billion and grew by 4% in U.S. dollars and about 5% on a constant currency basis. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable grew by 3% in Q4 as we lap the benefit of the hotel combined acquisition in December. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $1.3 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range and was up 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and about 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance marketing expense increased 2% year-on-year, which helped drive leverage about 40 basis points in the quarter. The year-on-year growth was driven by higher-than-expected volumes in our paid channels. We spent $86 million on brand marketing in the quarter, which represented a decline of 31% versus Q4 last year and contributed about 130 basis points of leverage. This decrease is in part driven by a ramp-up in spend in the second half of 2018. We remain committed to investing in brand marketing in a disciplined manner going forward. Sales and other expense decreased 1% versus Q4 last year and contributed about 30 basis points of leverage due to reduced chargeback expenses as well as a reclassification of certain sales and other expense of certain sales and other expenses incurred during 2019, inter revenues in Q4, both of which offset the increase in expenses related to the continued growth of our payments platform at Booking.com. Personnel expense was in line with our forecast, growing 16% year-on-year and contributing about 175 basis points of deleverage in the quarter as expected, driven in part by lower year-end reversal of bonus accruals that we experienced in Q4 2018. G&A expenses increased 16% and year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes a $21 million travel transaction tax charge in Q4 of 2018. Non-GAAP G&A expenses contributed about 60 basis points of deleverage in the quarter. This year-over-year increase in G&A was driven largely by higher indirect taxes, including the French DST.Finally, information technology expenses increased 42% year-over-year, driven by several items, supporting the growth of the business, including payments to contractors, software license fees, outsourced data center and cloud costs. Our non-GAAP EPS was $23.30, up 4% on a reported and constant currency basis versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.7% in Q4, which is significantly higher than Q4 last year due to a onetime adjustment of approximately $72 million in Q4 2018 related to a provision of the Tax Act that was clarified by revenue guidance issued in Q4 2018. Our Q4 tax rate was about one percentage point lower than our guidance due to some discrete items. Our 9% lower share count in Q4 benefited EPS growth in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income increased by 3% and GAAP operating margin decreased by about 50 basis points compared to Q4 last year. Q4 GAAP net income amounted to $1.2 billion or $27.75 per share, up 81% from Q4 2018. Our Q4 GAAP net income includes 360 $326 million of pre-tax unrealized gains on equity investments in Metro and Ctrip and $47 million of FX remeasurement losses on our Eurobonds. We exclude these unrealized losses and reversion gains from our non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of 17.5% for the quarter, which increased significantly from the prior year due to the tax impact of the items excluded non-GAAP results as well as the fact, as I mentioned, impacted the non-GAAP tax rate. In Q4, we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, which declined 1% compared to Q4 last year. Our free cash cash flow for the quarter was about $1 billion, which decreased by 1% compared to last year, mainly due to timing of payments, which reduced year-over-year growth by 15 percentage points.We repurchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q4, bringing the total repurchases for the year to over $8 billion. As of the end of the year, we had about $11.5 billion remaining under our $15 billion repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in cash and investments and $8.7 billion of outstanding debt. Looking back at 2019, we are quite pleased with our performance during the year as we produce steady room night growth in the 10% to 12% range. We delivered a very healthy 39% EBITDA margin while investing in the business and absorbing unplanned DST expenses. And we grew our non-GAAP EPS by 11% or around 15% on a constant currency basis, which exceeded our annual guidance of low double-digit growth. Turning to 2020. Our initial outlook reflected a continuation of this operating model, i.e., to gain share in accommodations with some deceleration in room night growth to invest in payments, merchandising and the connected trip, creating modest pressure on operating margins and for EPS growth to benefit from our share repurchases. Due to a few mechanical factors, including the lapping of ADR declines and the phasing of personnel and G&A expenses during the year, we expected our earnings growth to be weighted largely to the second half of the year. Now turning to more recent events. The coronavirus has had an impact across our business since it made news headlines on January 21. The early impacts were increased in China, but we also saw these impacts across Asia and, to a lesser extent, in other regions outside of Asia as well. To help with context, the APAC region represents a little over 20% of our room nights with no single country accounting for more than a mid-single-digit share of total room nights. In APAC, we've seen an increase in cancellations, reduction in new bookings and pressure on ADRs. As you all know, it's not possible to predict where and to what degree outbreaks of the coronavirus will disrupt travel patterns. While the incidence of infections has slowed in China, in the last week alone, new outbreaks have occurred in South Korea, Iran and Italy.We've been able to measure the impacts on our business so far in Asia and we've seen our recent impact of our room night bookings in Europe following the outbreak in Italy. As a result, we're providing only a near-term outlook with a wider guidance range to account for the possibility there will be a growing travel disruption in Europe. Based on where we are in the quarter and considering the continued impact of the coronavirus, we're forecasting Q1 booked room nights to be down 5% to 10% versus the prior year. Clearly, we're dealing with a very fluid situation, and it's extremely difficult to predict where Q1 will come out, but this is our best estimate based upon the data we have available now. We forecast total gross bookings to decline 8% to 13% on a constant currency basis and about 200 basis points more in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs of the company will be down about 4%. We forecast for non-GAAP revenue to decline 3% to 7% on a constant currency basis and declined 200 basis points more in U.S. dollars. Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $560 million and $590 million, which is down 16% to 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and about 200 basis points more in U.S. dollars. We are forecasting Q1 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $9.05 to $9.65, which is 14% to 19% below Q1 2019. On a constant currency basis, we estimate Q1 non-GAAP EPS to decrease year-on-year by approximately 12% to 17%. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast for Q1 includes an asset income tax rate of approximately 18.5%. Our Q1 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 41.6 million shares, which is 9% below Q1 of last year. We forecast GAAP EPS to be between $7.95 and $8.55 for Q1.Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q1 attributed a tax rate of approximately 18.5%. We used a dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.10 when setting our Q1 guidance. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But the hedges do not protect our gross bookings revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Finally, a housekeeping item. Starting with our Q1 results and going forward, we plan on reporting our performance and brand marketing expenses on a combined basis as we view our overall marketing spend as an investment in customer acquisition and retention.We'll now take your questions. Operator?[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- I guess, just the first question, a bit of a clarification. I think, David, you said something about seeing expecting some share gain with deceleration in room nights I wasn't sure if I heard that correctly. Is that kind of before the impact of the virus or including the impact of the virus? Anything you can kind of share there. And along the same lines, ex the virus, are you seeing anything in particular, changing with marketing ROIs as some competitors pull back in certain brands in certain geographies? And then, I guess, a second question, if I can, would just be anything particular changing with regard to some of the SEO channel impacts from last quarter. Are you seeing that spread to either new geographies or change in intensity? Anything you could share there would be great. -- Sure, Lloyd, thank you. Let me start off answering the first question. So yes, to clarify, what I said was when we turn to 2020, we talked about our initial outlook, which is our outlook at the start of the year. Obviously, around the time we're putting our plans to get a full year. We talked about that reflects the continuation of the same operating model we delivered in 2019. So my comments about gain share in accommodations with some deceleration room nights, some modest pressure on operating margins and for EPS to benefit from our share buybacks, which give you a flavor of the shape of our profile for the year coming into the year before the coronavirus. Yes. And then on the SEO challenge is to pick up your second. I just want to kind of remind people as we said, the SEO channel is a relatively small part of our business and has been for a period of time. The SEO channel continues to be under pressure as the primary provider of that channel focused more upon their paid search rather than free search, but we continue to do well in that channel. We have teams dedicated to it. We are pleased with our share in that channel. As a channel, it is under continued pressure, but as we said before, really contributes a very minor part of our overall business. -- Okay. And then anything on just marketing ROIs outside of the impact of the virus given competitive dynamics? -- Yes, let me start and then maybe again, I'll talk about Q4 because, obviously, our Q4 was a very clean quarter relative to not having a virus in. It's only a few weeks behind us. So I think it's a good time to still talk about Q4. We were pleased with our ROIs in the channels in Q4. We didn't see any major shifts. We mentioned that we saw a continued leverage in our performance marketing spend because our performance marketing channels continue to grow less rapidly than the overall business. So the leverage that we demonstrated was kind of a mix-driven leverage and mathematic leverage. Our ROIs didn't really change very much in Q4, nothing to really note. We're pleased with where they were. And I think with that the genesis of all your questions or you're also asking about current quarter as well? -- That's great. I'll assume that the virus is making things pretty messy, but unless you want to add something? -- No, I just wanted to go stop there. I think that's the right place to stop. -- Great, thank you.You do have another question from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open. -- I want to ask about two things. This kind of attach rate with the connected trip? And how how far along you think you are in tapping into that opportunity. I noticed that both Rentalcar days and airline ticket growth unit growth rates nicely accelerated in the December quarter. It looks like that's much easier comp in airline tickets, but you called out some kind of greater cross-selling opportunities you're getting with Rentalcars. So just talk about how where you are in the process of doing that? Is it a small percentage that you've even attempted this? So we can get a sense of how much better the results could be in Rentalcars. And then, Glenn, when you were talking about the outlook, you seem to emphasize a little bit more streamlining costs in 2020 I don't think that was related to coronavirus. I think it's or maybe it was. But I don't think it was. It sounded like you want to take be a little bit more careful about costs or something like that. Could you just explain the why behind that? Why get a little bit more focused on streamlining costs this year versus last year, unless it was all coronavirus, but I didn't get that impression. -- Mark, yes, let me take the first one, the attach rates, etc. And I think you called it out correctly. The Rentalcar business has shown some good numbers. You look at the supplemental statistics at the end of our press release and you can see some nice growth there. And part of that growth is coming from that cross-sell part of our connected trip that we're building out. And you're also correct in your statement about the air business, air business is so early. We just really are getting that up and running, that you're not really seeing any of the increase there from that or not of the matter right now. It's very, very low attach rates. When I look at those numbers, I believe, over time, we should increase those significantly. And it's going to take some time as we continue to optimize what's the best way to present it, where to show it. One of the things I'm very proud about is the center we built in Tel Aviv that is filled with a bunch of machine learning experts, AI geniuses who really look at all the different parts of the way we present things. And they're trying to come up with what is the best way to present an offer to a traveler at the right time and putting in what is the right merchandising benefit that we should do it to get the right conversion and the right bottom line. It's something that the more data we get, the better we'll know what the right thing to do, but it's something that's going to take time. So that's the answer to that one. Regarding costs, you're also absolutely correct on that.One of the things, when I took the job over in Amsterdam as CEO of Booking.com, and I've been there now a little more than six months, is looking at what are we spending on, where are we spending, what projects are on, which ones are the right ones, which ones should we not be doing right now. And then taking that throughout our entire organization. I always believe that you should be a cost-effective company. And I believe it's also very natural, as companies grow very rapidly and achieve great success on the bottom line, sometimes discipline lightened up a little bit. So certainly, before the coronavirus, I was already thinking that we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to spend money correctly. One of the things I've mentioned in the calls over the last couple of quarters is us bringing all of our companies together better. And that one of the benefits of that is to get some efficiencies in our spend, a real cost-procurement-type project. And in the past, we've run all these companies independently. And that was the right thing to do at the time. But while doing that, you do lose out on some cost efficiencies. Now the state of the company, where it's at, and now it's time to start bringing that in, and that's what we're going to be doing. -- Okay. ThanksWe do have another question from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks a lot. Could you give us more color on the latest trends in Europe travel bookings that you've seen over the last few days following the outbreak of the coronavirus in Italy? -- Yes, Kevin, this is David. Let me take that. Maybe just kind of maybe frame it in the way that the quarter shapes up, and we and our projections do take into account what we've seen in the last few days. So let me kind of give you a lay of the land, first of all, by region, not surprising. We already mentioned that China is a worst impacted. Asia, excluding China, has also been impacted for some time. The rest of the world, which obviously includes Europe and Europe is a big piece out for us, was growing through February but we also expect it to be impacted to the negative in March as well. And to give you a bit more color in terms of just how that plays across the quarter, on a consolidated basis, we saw we, of course, saw room night in January room night growth in January, even though we saw some tapering off at the end with the virus being on the news on the 21st. Expect February to be approximately flat from a growth rate point of view, and therefore, to get to our guidance for the quarter, expect to see declines in March. -- Got it. And so that and that March expectation is based on just the worsening kind of trends over the last few days? -- Yes. I mean, we really obviously, as other pension, we're dealing with a very fluid situation, very difficult to predict what's going on because we're responding to something that we have no control over. We're giving you kind of our best view of. So when we have when we built, what we expect to happen in March and create the guidance range, we're looking very specifically at what has happened over the last few days after the outbreak in Italy and the response we've seen in Europe in response to that, which is not surprising, has been negative. So yes, we are expecting and we're seeing, even though we're going to get room night growth through rest of world in February, toward the end of February, that was already in a decline. And we expect it to continue to decline into March. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- A couple of questions. I guess, it would be helpful if you could give a view on past behavior when you've had travel disruptions and people cancel their trips or your most loyal customers don't book. How long does it take before they start going on trips again? Or do you see a time frame where people cancel and then rebook? I know you can't be too specific, but any thoughts on that? And then second, it's interesting your main competitor pulling back spending, you're talking about some cost savings. Do you think there's inefficiencies in marketing or other channels in travel and maybe the industry as a whole could benefit as people take a deeper look at their costs? -- Justin, I think it'd be it would not be wise to try and use past experience as an analogy for what will happen in the future. The situation now is very different, say, I've now been in this business. In fact, this week, it will be 20 years I've been at this company. My anniversary is Friday. 20 years. And so I've seen a lot of exogenous factors, I mentioned them, impacting travel, some extremely severe. And I won't go through all of them because we'll use up the entire time for the call. That being said, they will have different effects and different rebound time periods. So it's not going to be helpful for me to tell you what took after 9/11 or after the GFC or after swine flu or after the volcano in Iceland. I could go on and on and on, which I'll stop there. So I really can't be that helpful. And you'll just have to make your own best estimates, which will be as good as anybody else's guestimates. Regarding spending, we have very high margins compared to anybody else in the industry. But that does not give us a license to waste money. And I want to continue to always be looking, are we spending correctly every single part of this company. And so we can then spend the money in the right place at the right time. In terms of marketing, there probably is a lot of waste in the industry. Probably. And I think we can see that some people who are probably going to be pulling back and turn into their marketing. We like to think that we've been efficient and effective. But I think there's always room everywhere to do better, and we're going to continue to do so. That's only the right way to try and have a long-term successful company. I am confident, though, that regardless of what the toward your first question, I am confident the business will be coming back. It's something that we've seen over and over and over again. As I said many, many times here, travel is a basic need for people. They have been doing it for a very, very long time. And as soon as the air clear, so to speak, you'll see people will be coming back to travel. -- Great, thank you.We do have another question from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- I have 2, please. David, just I appreciate the month-over-month commentary for the first quarter, but maybe just so we can all sort of better understand the underlying durability of growth. How big of a room night and EBITDA headwind have you put into the guide to factor in the corona for the first quarter? And then the second one, Glenn, just to sort of talk about opportunities and sort of untapped geographies. Talk to us about how you think about the importance and the opportunity to focus more on the U.S., from a branding and a performance marketing perspective this year to perhaps take more share in that area. -- Yes. Okay. Thanks, Brian. I'll take the first part of it. I'm going to try to avoid getting into specific growth rates by month. I'll give you a flavor, I think you can do some back of the envelope math to kind of figure out what March has to look like in terms of getting to a minus 5% to minus 10% range. The way we look at this is that we have, as I mentioned in my answer to Kevin, have looked very much so what's happened to the last few days. And anticipating at the lower end of the range that the travel environment in Europe make it worse because we would be surprised if there's only one outbreak in Europe over the course of the rest of the quarter. So we've taken into account what we saw happening over the last week, which, of course, is led by a lot of cancellations. So over time, it may not be quite as bad as we're seeing in the last week because you see, obviously, there's a different growth rate on underlying bookings vis-a-vis cancellations. The early reaction to these news as usually, you got spike cancellations and things can moderate out. But we've taken into account what we've seen happening over the course of the year last week. We projected that for the rest of the quarter. And recognize that, in fact, make it worse. If there are additional outbreaks in Europe or further slowdowns in the rest of the world. So that's how we've tried to intelligently give you some guidance data points from, obviously, we gain is moving very rapidly it is the best data that we have as of until this morning. -- And in regards to our opportunities around the world, the U.S. is, without doubt, our biggest opportunity. It is an enormous market that we under-indexed significantly. And the reason for it, why we have not achieved what we'd like to yet. And historical, as you know, Booking.com was always a hotel-only company. And we didn't have an aircraft there, for example. Many Americans like start their travel business, using air. So we now we're going to be bringing out an air product over time. That will be one. Second thing is extremely price-competitive, price-sensitive consumer in the U.S. Booking.com, historically, an agency player, meaning the price was set by the hotels or by the non-hotel accommodations. We believe that we have to be able to merchandise, meaning adjusting what that value to the consumer is going to be. But to do that, you got to have a payment product. It was only last quarter that we got up running the domestic payment product for our U.S. consumer. So that's another one. Another big issue, packages. Many Americans like to use a package product or like to do some sort of combination that will get them more value. Well, we're just starting that now. One of the things I'm very proud about is working between Priceline.com and Booking.com to come up with a package product for the U.S. consumers that we're just getting that out. The other thing is we have other assets to help bring consumers to our sites and make them aware of the great things we have. One, for example, OpenTable. A lot of people are using OpenTable every month. In the past, we have never done anything to really bring together the power of the OpenTable platform and the Booking.com platform in a way that will provide more value to the consumers. So lots of things that we're working on, because I do believe the U.S. is a great opportunity for us to help build out our business. -- Great, thanks, guys.We have another question from the line of Justin Patterson from Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Great. One on connected trip first. How should we think about scaling supply through your own assets and third-party partners on the attractions and dining side? With partners in there, is there anything you need to control to ensure an optimal customer experience? And then the second question is on marketing. As your direct channel mix grows and your payments business grows, how should we how do you think about that incremental ROI of using coupons to drive conversion versus, say, attractive customers via branded performance marketing? -- I want to do the first, and I'll let David being our CFO, you can talk about how we're going to optimize in terms of coupons. You're right in terms that in an ideal world, you would like to have all of your supply directly connect to us. And you prefer in an ideal world, not to be using third-party suppliers. That being said, that's a balance against speed-to-market and making sure you have the supply necessary to create a good offer to the consumers. So in the interest of speed, we have gone with third-party providers to provide inventory that we don't have. I mentioned OpenTable a little while ago. Well, OpenTable has a great product, and they are they do a lot of business in a lot of different cities. But there are also a lot of cities around the world that they don't do business. And we want to provide that dining opportunity to our consumers in as many cities as we can. So we will partner with others. Attractions, the same thing. We had our own contracts with the supply, but there are a lot of places in the world where people are traveling, so to make sure that we have the supply, we're going to third parties. Over time, we believe that in the long run, having your own supply helps you in terms of creating that truly seamless connected trip, but speed matters in this market. So we're going to do that, too. -- Yes. And Justin, on the different marketing channels. First of all, we're very pleased to build our direct business. And it's very important for the future in the connected trip and the app and all things how driving that direction. But the performance marketing channels are also really important sources of acquisition of new customers for us. And sometimes, some existing customers can come back to that net as well. But to answer your question, we look at all these on a very measured incremental ROI basis. We can really measure our different activities and compare them on a very comparable basis. So when it comes to things like coupons or other attractions we may only offer through one of our channels, we just look at the ROI on that vis-a-vis other channels and decide where we lean in or don't, as the case may be. So we have pretty good metrics on all things like that because we are able to measure the short-term return on those investments. Again, longer term, we're looking to drive people toward the direct channel, particularly toward the app, and Glenn mentioned how well downloaded that is and how it's becoming very much a powerful app in the travel space. And as the connected trip becomes a bigger piece of the business, and the app becomes a way to experience the connected trip in during the trip, it's even more strategic. But tactically, we can look at all these different things, including things like couponing on a very measured basis and decide to lean in, based upon which ones give us the both the shortest short-term returns and also create the highest level of repeat or return to direct activity after that initial offer. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. -- Great. David, last year, you talked about achieving double-digit earnings growth and then exceeded it pretty nicely ex facts. I understand the situation is a little bit more fluid right now, and the color you provided on the operating model was helpful. How should we think about those things kind of translates into earnings growth for this year? And then how are you thinking about using the balance sheet for share repurchases in the near-term when there is like a disruption currently going on? -- Sure, Deepak, thanks for the question. Let me take the first part of it. So yes, I mean, we talked about the our operating model expectations pre-coronavirus as a continuation of the model, I think, was quite successful for us in 2019. And I don't want to get to specific targets for 2020 because there's not a lot of point in putting out a hypothetical forecast for the year, which we can never measure against or bridge against because, obviously, the year is going to come out very different from what we expected only a few weeks ago, but we were pleased with the way that 2019 came out. If you kind of look back at Q4, look at 2019, understand the underlying health of the business. And we believe that there's no reason why that model can't continue in normal times. And then, Glenn, you want to talk about second part balance sheet? -- Yes. So we are very pleased to have a very strong balance sheet, significant amount of free cash. We have a very good credit rating. And the question really is, as we've always had, is how should we best use our capital. One of the things that's always been, share repurchases. Another thing that we always do is we're always looking at other companies that could potentially help add to our connected trip strategic vision, and we're going to continue to look at that. Certainly valuations have changed significantly in the recent past, and that may provide an opportunity for us in both areas. But as David says, it's a very fluid situation right now and we're not going to box ourselves into anything right this second. I will say though, however, we do look at this very, very carefully because we do want to be agile. -- Operator, do we have any more questions, please? Your line is open.Yes, sir. We have another question from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I can, a few around cost structure and how you're thinking about investing in the business in sort of a relatively uncertain environment. Is there a way to tease out what are some of the investments you plan on making just because they fit with the strategic vision, they're going to be made for the long term, irrespective of how the environment works, up or down, over the next sort of couple of quarters? And how much of it is more variable in nature, where you might tune up or down investments, so we could understand the variable piece? They'll probably more likely track with how room night to get better or worse from the excellent results in Q4 versus the cautionary results or guide for Q1. -- Sure. So I've been talking about our long-term strategic vision for some time now since I became CEO of the holding company a little more than three years ago and how important it is to create and continue to create value for all sides of this marketplace. And we're going to continue to do that. And that requires investing in people in terms of code, making sure we are providing something that is a differentiator from what is out there right now. And there is no reason to slow that down, stop that or hold back on that. The sooner we get out that truly superior travel service, the better we will be. And I want to be in that position when we come out of this current environment, which is something that is unexpected, but will end. I want to come out of that as soon as possible with the best services that we have. So we're going to continue on that. We are not changing that at all. Now in terms of investments in terms of marketing and things like that, naturally, you always want to make adjustments based on what the environment is. So for, as I mentioned, about brand marketing. Well, we are not going to be making brand marketing to people who are not listening to that message at all. If you're not thinking about traveling, you're not listening to a travel ad, it's foolish for us to invest money in a brand marketing campaign. And that's an example on extreme on the other side. And in between, there are always different things in between that we are going to be making adjustments as we go throughout the year. And we've always been doing that. That's no different. Do you have anything to add? -- Yes, Eric, just maybe put a little bit of a framework around what Glenn talked about. So if you think of of operating expenses, you just kind of look at 2019 for a second, about $9.5 billion, a little over half of our opex is really variable with volume. Obviously, our performance marketing change would be going up and down. Our brand marketing is not volume-related. But obviously, as Glenn just said, no point spending a lot of branded people not primarily think about travel. A large piece of our sales and other expenses is also relates to volume as well because that ties back to the merchant processing costs on our payment platform. So over half of our opex really is directly tied to the volume within the business. Now obviously, there are volume-related aspects in the other areas, which are personnel, G&A, IT, etc. And obviously, there's some fixed and the some variable expenses there. But if you think about our cost structure, it really is quite variable with the larger expense lines being tied to volume quite directly. And of course, in the areas that are not tied directly, there are things we can continue to do to refine and optimize, as Glenn talked about.We do have another question from the line of Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Yeah, thanks a lot. A couple of questions. So David, in your commentary, you spoke about maybe 2020 seeing payments process through your own payment platform going to 25%. What are the levers that you control to kind of get that from 15% in 2019 to 25% this year? And then the other question I have was just maybe can you share some light on your maybe early results from the Grab partnership, how that might be working for you? -- Sure. So let me start off with the payments platform. Actually, Glenn wanted to give the numbers out, but let me let me just kind of talk to you about how we see it developing and the impact it will have on our income statement. So as you see, we basically had to grow from 10% in 2018, 15 in 2019, 25 in 2020, we expect obviously to exit 2020 at higher than 25% payments. That's the average for the year. It might be helpful just to understand a little bit about what that's doing to our income statement because there's always some questions about that in prior calls. In 2020, we expect payments actually to contribute both to both revenue growth as it has been, but also to start contributing to EBITDA growth as well. With very little impact at all on our EBITDA rate in 2020 will contribute toward EBITDA growth as we recover an ever-increasing percentage of our payment costs. So that's how we think about payments rolling through our business. Obviously, there's still a very attractive nature in our agency model as well. So one is not going to completely replace the other but as Glenn said, for all sorts of reasons, including the ability to participate in merchandising and also to be able to package and control things together in via the connected trip, payments will become an ever-increasing part of the business, and we're pleased with how it is progressing. And we're on track to get it to a stage, which starts to contribute toward EBITDA growth, which we'll start doing this year. -- And regarding the Grab relationship, I'm very pleased about how that's been progressing. And remember, we invested in Grab for three reasons. One reason was Grab has a significant number of customers, and we want to find all different ways that we can get exposed our hotel accommodation, all of our travel services to customers in different ways, and that certainly was a great way to do it, one. The other thing is that our travelers when they arrive in a place that they're not familiar with, they want to know how are they going to get around. And many people sometimes mistakenly assumed that whatever ridesharing capability they have in their home country is going to be in the place they go visit, and it's not going to be there and not going to know what they're going to do. And then the figure what am I going to do? And one of the great things is we said that we would come up with Grab a way that a person can use the Booking.com app and in a seamless way, can get ride-sharing without having to download another app, without having to put a credit card in something that they're not familiar with, and it will be seamless and a great experience. And I mentioned last quarter, how we've gone that up and running in Singapore. And the third thing, of course, we said we'd like to have a financial return on the money we invested. One of the things I mentioned last quarter was how, by the end of the year, I expected us to be able to have that Grab at operational Booking.com app by the India for Indonesia and Thailand. And I'm very pleased that we are now actually operational in every single territory that Grab operates on the iOS platform. So it's just a great shoutout to the team who's been working on that, and thank you guys for getting that done ahead of schedule and really pushing that through. We'll be operational for Android, I think in two to four weeks, I've been told. And we're talking about it's now beyond Singapore, it's Malaysia, it's Indonesia, Thailand, it's Vietnam, it's Cambodia, it's Philippines. It's my word, everywhere the Grab is. And I tell you, I've seen this used, and it really is something that makes it so easy. You get off that plane in that airport, you just go to that Booking.com app and right away, you can get that car to take you to hotel. It's a wonderful experience. And we're also on the other side, being able to show our hotel accommodations to more and more Grab customers. So good in all areas. -- Thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Okay thanks very much. So Glenn, I guess, out of adversity can come opportunities. So in an environment in which folks are going to be really starved for business, are there any silver linings we should be thinking about in terms of booking becoming a more important partner for your suppliers or being able to onboard more supply for the future? And I guess for the integrated travel experience as well as the rollout of your own payment rails, you are talking about transforming what the Booking.com experience has meant for the consumer for some time now. So do you feel like you have to retrain them to look for non-hotel products or pay upfront? And do you think you need to incur some cost to bring up that awareness? -- So nobody, nobody wants their business to succeed because of unfortunate events. Nobody hopes for that. But sometimes the events happen anyway, and you do end up being a beneficiary of those events. Companies that are stronger when they enter into a bad period emerge even stronger. And in this industry, I've seen it happen over and over again. There is no doubt, I've talked in the past about potential recessions and what would happen in a recession and why I believe that would make us more valuable to suppliers so that they would use us more to get demand because they needed it more. And you've pointed out what could be a very unfortunate thing for many players in our industry. So yes, silver lining is when we describe it. I do believe that in the long run, we will emerge from this in a much better position, a stronger competitor, and we will end up being better off. Though, of course, no, would ever hope for that to happen under that way. In regards to the consumer, consumers are amazing how they they learn very rapidly, how to save money, get value when they see a new and it's interesting. You don't even see announcements of them in different products many times. It's just you're playing around with it and you see it. Now we, of course, will be using all sorts of marketing methods to get and make sure our customers are aware of the better way to do your travel planning, your travel execution. But I am not concerned at all that when we have that better product, I am not concerned that people don't know about it, people will know about it. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Just wanted to ask 2. First, you talked about the 15% of Booking.com bookings using the payments platform. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of conversion rates and speed to book and then other metrics that you may look at in payments? And then secondly, Glenn, you mentioned wanting to expose flights ultimately to 50% of your customers. Just curious why that's the number, kind of why you'd stop there? -- Well, we wouldn't actually stop there. That's just my target for this year, we do intend to have 100% of the people eventually be exposed to it and we want 100% using it. But this is it takes time because of regulatory licensing things, it's not as though you can just immediately just start selling airline tickets everywhere. That takes time to get your licenses in certain jurisdictions. And data? -- Yes, let me just characterize a little bit of what we're seeing on the payment platform and why we think it's very important, but now in the future. So the benefits come in different areas, and they're multiple and sometimes they are additive. So in some cases, just offering people, payments in different methodologies, payments in currency of their own choice or payment process of their own choice whereas to offer a Chinese customer to pay in Alipay, WeChat pay off, something like that. Just offering that payment choice, even if the underlying hotel product is the same, we have seen conversion increases, even if people don't use our choice. It's a bit like offering something in a local language. And of course, we offer our site for local languages. The fact you offer something and presented in some of these native language. In this case, you give payment choice that they recognize that they recognize, is actually something that by itself will help with conversion, and we can demonstrate that, that does, albeit a small amount. If they don't use payments, and then, of course, if they do use payments, it helps a little bit more. So you do get some conversion benefits.But the other thing the payment platform do as well is we can also, as I mentioned, we can start participating in the pricing process via merchandising more proactively. So we can offer, basically, Booking.com can get involved in that and offer book responsor benefits or other offers to the customer that you can only really do if you are participating as a merchant, and you're taking the payments on behalf of the property and passing it through. So the other thing that the payment can do the payment platform also will do, it will help bridge gap between a customer and the property in terms of our customers can pay in, in their payment platform or the payment currency of choice, and we can pay out to the property partner in their payment currency of choice. So for example, again, the hotel in Italy or in Paris may not take all the payment methods that we offer to our Asian customers, and we can give them virtual credit cards. And for example, a Mastercard or a Visa format. So there are all sorts of different benefits from the payments platform. Another one I talked to you about that helps in the business as well is that the agency model, of course, leaves the payment process open to the customer to deal with the property, and vice versa. And we actually get a lot of our customer service request calls are to do with things that go wrong somewhere or were not expected in that equation between the property and the customer where we're not participating because we're just being agents providing the booking. So we find if we manage the payment process, we can reduce the number of customer service incidents around the payment question and actually increase the overall satisfaction and experience of both the customer and the property partner. So there are many benefits of the payment platform. As I said, I mentioned a few. In some cases, you get all of them in one transaction. In some cases, you only get one. But it's something that we are developing rapidly inside of booking.com. Of course, we've got a lot of experience in payments in both Agoda and in Priceline. So we're taking leverage of that capability, where we've already seen those benefits occur. -- Thanks very helpful.Our last question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. You called out specifically the January 21 date is the one where you've sort of started to see the headlines for coronavirus. Wondering if you could share with us sort of where your expectations were than for bookings growth in the quarter, and just to get a better sense of sort of where the magnitude of the shift between then and where we are where we are now. And then also on the as we think about sort of where you're seeing the divergence in bookings growth and room night growth continuing and spreading? I know in the past, you've talked about, obviously, that being a function of cheaper ADRs. Just wondering if maybe you could get a little bit more into detail with us on that as far as how much of that is geographic, how much of that is you believe customers continuing to downshift to cheaper rooms and how much of it might be an access to inventory issue as hotels look to retain more of their compression nights for their own platforms. -- Sure. Let me take those in reverse order. So the ADR question, probably the best place to go is back to Q4 because we were operating, obviously, in a business-as-usual type of environments. And without going through a long explanation because we gave a fairly long relations to what's happening to ADRs and why we saw that ADR reduction in the fourth quarter. Bear in mind, part of it is because we were lapping a rather unusual increase a year ago. So the four really became a 3, if you normalize that. And then we saw basically half of that decline due to lower rates in the key countries, which were like U.S., Japan, Hong Kong. Of course, again, on a pre-virus model, and some of that was macro. About half of the decline in ADRs was due to a shift toward lower ADR countries. Again, some of that was also macro because some of the higher ADR countries got very expensive from an FX point of view. So when we go back and look at Q4 and look at Q3, we saw basically two points of normalized reduction in ADRs in Q three points in Q4. We believe about half of that was kind of macro, and half of that was mix-related going forward. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of flavors to kind of what's going on. Going into 2020, we expected the ADR reductions to be down to a couple of points, again, on pre-coronavirus basically just assuming that the macro piece that continued with a little bit more in the first half and a little bit less in the second half due to lapping effects of what we saw occurring last year. And just to go back to your very first part of the question. Just like we try not to give specific guidance for where we were for the year, pre-coronavirus. And we did give you, I think, a fairly good flavor to how we thought the business would operate during the year pre the coronavirus. We try not to get into a lot of bridging exercises between where we were Q1 and before and afterwards. For what it's worth, I can tell you that we're tracking nicely ahead of our internal expectations for the first three weeks in January, but it's only a 3-week period of time. So take it for what it's worth, but we were running slightly in front of the expectation we had for the year, which I outlined relative to when we talked about 2019 and when we expected things to continue into 2020. But I don't want to get into a specific, we thought room night growth would be and now it's why because we can never really compare against that hypothetical growth. We were comfortable with where the year was shaping up. We felt good about the profile of business we talked about in 2020 relative to what we saw in 2019 and the business model continuing, and hopefully, that gives you a flavor you can have really come to your own conclusions to what it was. But we're pleased with how things were shaping up going into 2020 and the shape of 2020 as we looked at the full year. -- So this concludes the remarks. And I just want to end by saying in summary, our 2019 performance met some important financial and strategic goals. And I'm very pleased about the steps we have taken to date to provide more value to the customers and our supply partners, and we look forward to doing more so in the future. And we're going to manage through the current travel environment, and I am very confident in our long-term prospects. And finally, I want to thank our supplier and marketing partners, our more than 26,000 employees distributed across more than 300 offices and a very special thank you to a subset of those 26,000 over the last couple of months, have been working so hard in this environment. I want to thank them very much. And most of all, I want to thank our traveler customers who are out there exploring the world.

Chalk it up to slowing growth, as search engines have recently made OTA listings less visible. In addition, management has failed to rein in costs amid the slowdown.Expedia recently saw its revenue decelerate from 12% in 2018 to 8% in 2019. The company's adjusted EBITDA grew 8%, showing no margin expansion, while adjusted net income grew only 4% as costs increased at a faster pace. Though operating income grew 16%, that was attributable to one-time impairments taken in the prior year.  The fourth quarter was even worse, with adjusted net income actually  by 3% relative to the year-ago quarter. Expedia Chairman Barry Diller, who also owns about 28.5% of the company's voting power through Class B shares, had had enough of Expedia's underperformance by the end of last year and on Dec. 4 ousted then-CEO Mark Okerstrom, as well as CFO Alan Pickerill, assuming the role of CEO himself. On the recent fourth quarter , Diller lamented that Expedia had become a, \"consultant-led and wildly complex business,\" that was \"sclerotic and bloated,\" lamenting that the company's work-life balance had become, \"all life and no work.\" Diller promised change, getting rid of non-core activities, and looking to invest more in direct marketing to customers in order to get around the search engine problem -- a strategy that allowed rival   to outperform Expedia in the recent past. data by This wasn't false bluster either. Last week, Expedia announced that it would be laying off some 3,000 employees, including 500 at corporate headquarters in Seattle, or about 12% of its entire workforce. Though travel bookings may decline in the near-term, Expedia is still a relatively solid business model that should get through the crisis. At the end of 2019, the company had $4.6 billion in cash, restricted cash, and short-term investments, against only about $4.9 billion in current and long-term debt.  Expedia's business model is also relatively capital-light. Despite the headwinds over the past year, free cash flow still came in at a healthy $1.6 billion, about 13.3% of revenue. Expedia also doesn't have a lot of fixed costs besides marketing, so the company will likely be able to adjust if the coronavirus slowdown gets much worse and still remain profitable.When Expedia gets through the other side of the crisis, it will be a leaner and meaner competitor in the online travel space. That likely means 2021 profits significantly higher than 2019, with 2020 being a question mark. The company trades at 26 times last year's earnings, but at just 13 times 2020 estimates, as analysts take into account the company's cost cuts. Though those 2020 earnings estimates are likely to come way down, Expedia's stock still looks like a  once travelers and investors get past the coronavirus scare.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We could be in for several months of disquiet as the coronavirus now known as COVID-19 spreads well beyond China.China accounts for roughly 20% of worldwide growth, so the global economy will feel a bite, too, S&P said, thanks to \"sharply reduced tourism revenues, lower exports of consumer and capital goods, lower commodity prices, and industrial supply-chain disruptions.\" In the U.S., \"economic fundamentals remain sound and the Federal Reserve stands ready to take action,\" says Capital Group U.S. economist Jared Franz. The virus should not derail his forecast of 2% U.S. growth in 2020, he says.Luxury brands are suffering. In 2019, Chinese shoppers at home and abroad accounted for 33% of the luxury-goods industry, according to Burberry. The British luxury brand warned in February that the virus is causing a \"material negative effect on luxury demand,\" and it temporarily closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China. Sales in China account for a large portion of revenue at Tiffany and Nike, too, according to Morgan Stanley.Supply chains are disrupted. Many parts for smartphones and cars are made in China. Qualcomm, a leading smartphone chip maker, warned that the outbreak was causing \"significant\" uncertainty around smartphone demand and the supplies needed to produce them. Apple warned its March quarter sales would be lower than expected because of a \"slower return to normal\" production of its smartphones at China's factories.Other companies at risk of supply-chain setbacks include Best Buy, Floor & D\u00e9cor Holdings, Gap and General Motors, reports Morgan Stanley. Travel curbs hurt, too. Dozens of airlines have reduced their flights to China through March or April, including American, Delta, Lufthansa, Swiss Airlines and United. At the height of SARS, airline passenger volumes were down 35%, according to the International Air Transport Association. The good news: Once the pace of contagion slows, the economy should rebound. SARS was short-lived, and analysts expect the same for the current coronavirus. S&P Global expects China's economy to expand by 6.4% in 2021, and so should hard-hit stocks.As concerns lessen, look for a number of stocks hit hard by the coronavirus to recover, says Morgan Stanley. For example, through mid February, Las Vegas Sands (symbol ), which owns and operates three casinos in Macau, had slipped 8% from its January peak. In early February, Macau officials closed all casinos for half a month in an effort to contain the virus. Stock in Booking Holdings (), formerly Priceline.com, dropped 5% from its high in early January. The online travel firm has invested heavily in Chinese travel firms, including Trip.com, considered the Expedia of China.

With the stock down 6% year to date, compared with a 3.3% rise in the S&P 500 index, Booking, along with the airline industry, is feeling the effects of the coronavirus which has pressured the travel and leisure industry around the globe.Though the company operates a collection of six primary brands, Booking generates the bulk of revenues from international markets, driven by its agency model which can push sales across all its platforms (hotels, rental cars, restaurants, etc.). While the company is regarded as a high-return business with a long runway for secular growth, the emergence of Airbnb, Expedia (), TripAdvisor (), among other online competitors, remains a concern.As such, the company on Wednesday must provide confident guidance for the stock to reverse course in the near term. In the three months that ended December, Wall Street expects the Norwalk, Conn.-based company to earn $22.12 per share on revenue of $3.28 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $22.49 per share on revenue of $3.21 billion. For the full year, earnings are projected to rise 9.5% year over year to $101.37 per share, while revenue of $15 billion would rise 3.3% year over year.The tepid revenue growth for the quarter (1.9%) and fiscal year (3.3%) has had to do with the litany of headwinds Booking has had to overcome over the past few years. Aside from a strong U.S. dollar that diminishes sales overseas, compared to other currencies, Booking has faced increased competition and numerous global political turmoil. The company must now figure out ways to avert the effects of the coronavirus epidemic which is not only pressuring global travel, but could spark an\u00a0economic slowdown.In the third quarter Booking earned $45.36 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $44.57 per share. Revenue, however, came in at $5.04 billion, falling shy of the $5.07 billion analysts were looking for. Nevertheless, the company remain confident, saying the average consumer around the globe is healthy and still making trips. Q3 gross bookings \u2014 defined as the total value of travel services and accommodations booked on one of the company's sites -- rose 4% to $25.3 billion. And when adjusting for foreign currency exchange rates, gross bookings grew 7%.These were strong Q3 numbers, but the company not only must improve on these results Wednesday, it must also issue upbeat guidance, particularly in light of concerns with the coronavirus.

While the number of companies still left to report is winding down, positive top- and bottom-line results and upward guidance should continue to drive a buy-the-dip strategy. As such, here are five stocks to keep an eye on.Wall Street expects Palo Alto Networks to earn $1.12 per share on revenue of $842.13 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.51 per share on revenue of $711.20 million.What to watch: Palo Alto stock, which is down 1.5% in three months, has underperformed the market over the past year, rising just 7% compared to the 20% rise in the S&P 500 index. Although its Subscription and support revenue continue to rise, billings revenue remains a concern, falling 4% last quarter. But there\u2019s reason to be excited about the company's Next-Gen Security billings expectations, which some analysts expect Palo Alto will beat. The enterprise security specialist, which has delivered ten straight top- and bottom-line beats, still has arguably best-of-breed products and services compared to its competitors. The question on Monday, however, will be with guidance and whether Palo Alto can get investors (and analysts) excited about its business moving forward.Wall Street expects Salesforce to earn 56 cents per share on revenue of $4.76 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 70 cents per share on revenue of $3.60 billion.What to watch: Software stocks have been a key driver of the market\u2019s 2020 gains. Among them is Salesforce stock which has seen its stock rise 16.5% year to date and 30% over the past six months. Salesforce\u2019s customer relationship management services are a must-have for companies looking to add capabilities such as sales, marketing, e-commerce and analytics to grow their businesses. As such analysts believe Salesforce\u2019s stock has more room to run. Jefferies analysts recently raised its price target on Salesforce to $210 from $195, implying 12% upside from current levels. However, for the shares to keep rising, Salesforce\u2019s guidance and its billings forecast will be the metrics to keep an eye on.Wall Street expects Booking to earn $22.12 per share on revenue of $3.28 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $22.49 per share on revenue of $3.21 billion.What to watch: The \u201cname your price\u201d company which operates a number of businesses including Booking.com, KAYAK, priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, and OpenTable, is a leader in online travel. With the stock down 6% year to date, compared with a 3.3% rise in the S&P 500 index, Booking, along with the airline industry, is feeling the effects of the coronavirus which has pressured the travel and leisure industry around the globe. Booking generates the bulk of revenues from international markets, driven by its agency model which can push sales across all its platforms (hotels, rental cars, restaurants, etc.). While the company is regarded as a high-return business with a long runway for secular growth, the company on Wednesday must provide confident guidance for the stock to reverse course in the near term.Wall Street expects Baidu to earn $3.71 per share on revenue of $4.09 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.96 per share on revenue of $4.05 billion.What to watch: Rising 12% in three months, Baidu shares have pushed higher ever since the Chinese Internet search company raised its outlook for the just-ended quarter. The company which has increased investments in its core search business, the cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, upped its Q4 profit forecast to to $1.36 billion from $1.28 billion, while revenue is expected to be $4.15 billion (up from $4.06 billion). The increased forecast suggests its investments, while divesting of non-core businesses continues to pay off. Notably, the company is seeing no adverse business effects of the coronavirus which has impacted various Chinese firms.

This compares to the previous quarter when it earned 6 cents per share on revenue of $91.96 million.What to watch: Beyond Meat stock has regained some sizzle, surging almost 50% over the past three months and is now up more than 55% year to date, compared with a 3.3% rise in the S&P 500 index. Investors want to know whether the recent price surge is purely momentum driven or supported by real fundamentals. The company has a noble goal in mind: Reducing animal-based meat and preserve the environment. But does it mesh with investors\u2019 goal of making money? There are also concerns about valuation and the company\u2019s ability to grow in a market where larger players like Tyson Foods () and Hormel Foods () exist.

The daily deals specialist's board is approving a reverse stock split to artificially inflate its share price, and shareholders will get to vote on the proposal come June. There aren't too many companies that have gone this route and done right by their stakeholders, but a lot of things aren't going right at Groupon these days.Tuesday afternoon's report was a disaster at every turn. Revenue plummeted a sharper-than-expected 23% decline to $612.3 million, its weakest top-line tally in the holiday-spiked fourth quarter since 2011. Analysts felt the dip in revenue would be roughly half what Groupon ultimately delivered. Its adjusted profit of $0.07 a share is also about half as much as Wall Street was targeting.Groupon announced that it would be dumping its low-margin goods business. It will also suspend selling new memberships to Groupon Select, the premium subscription platform that it launched just six months ago to give its most active customers deeper discounts. However, if you have a sense of stock split history, there's probably nothing as bad in Tuesday's horrific financial update as knowing that most companies shifting into reverse never shift back into drive.\u00a0Image source: Groupon.Stock splits are zero-sum events. Whether your 100 shares at $10 become 1,000 shares at $1 in a forward stock split or 10 shares at $100 in a reverse it's still a cool grand any way you slice it. However, it's not a surprise that the market tends to initially applaud a conventional forward stock split while sending shares lower on the announcement of a reverse split.\u00a0A reverse split conveys a lack of confidence, and it's not just the initial hit that weighs on most of the companies that have gone this route. A study by researchers at NYU Stern School of Business and Emory University looked at 1,612 reverse splits that were executed in a 40-year span of time through 2001. They found that the reverse stock splits underperformed the market by 16% a year following the stunt, and the gap widens in the second and third year.\u00a0\u00a0Some companies don't have much of a choice.

Some of the more recent success stories include \u00a0 in 2011 and \u00a0 in 2017, but in those cases the stocks have roughly kept pace with the buoyant market.Groupon isn't dead. It actually makes sense to move on from goods to focus on its signature discounted vouchers to local experiences. Dealing in closeouts involves costly physical fulfillment in a cutthroat market, and it also gnaws away at the Groupon brand. It's surprising to see Groupon give up so quickly on Groupon Select, but with the company admitting that most of its premium members were leaning heavily on the platform to get price breaks on the now discontinued goods -- driving those razor-thin margins even lower -- it makes sense to stage a retreat until it can survey the landscape of the new normal.\u00a0History says that reverse splits are bad bets.

Here are a few comments that highlight their current assessment of Expedia and their goals for the OTA.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Commenting on prior management, Diller said:Management at the same time didn't really have a clear path on how to grow the company. It just kind of had a top-down commandment to deliver x earnings, and that misled a lot of people into actions that kind of made sense for a quarter of a day. And the rest of the day this results in a kind of a top-down pressure without understanding how to actually execute and simplify the business and give it clarity. We've somewhat become a kind of consultant-led and wildly complex business. I said and I think sclerotic and bloated.Diller seems to be identifying a common problem in large publicly traded companies, as employees lose sight of long-term focus and instead work to manage earnings from quarter to quarter. That leads not only to a lack of a long-term strategy but also to a bloated cost structure, which he's now aiming to tame.Diller went on to identify several of the issues in the company's current operations:So we're changing a great deal. We're stopping this too large complexity. We're simplifying our strategy. We're stopping doing dumb things and starting to do what we think are good things. So from doing that dumb to doing this smart, here are a few examples. From wasteful activities that weren't core to our business, to actually driving sustained growth. From every brand working in silos around the world to one strategy on marketing and the geographies across all of our brands. From our reliance on Google and Metasearch, to aggressively moving to grow our own direct business and have loyal relationships with our customers.Expedia has over a dozen brands, with many of them in direct competition with one another. That's part of the silo problem that Diller is referring to, as the company would be better served by its brands working in concert together to serve its customers, rather than operating independently.Similarly, Expedia has realized that the market has changed with the rise of Google Travel and with hotel chains themselves even trying to drive their own direct business. That's why the company is focused on building a direct relationship with its customers, encouraging brand loyalty and app downloads. Diller noted that the company has reached 400 million app downloads among its brands, and that they increased 40% last year. \u00a0Google has sent shockwaves through the industry as it's built up its own travel-booking business, much to the displeasure of established OTAs like Expedia and . Here's what Diller had to say on that:I've been quite vocal about this that Google has certainly a monopoly share all over the world, and it does what monopoly shares get you to do, which is extend its business in every direction they can. Now so long as they don't use unfair practices, I've got no problem with that. But when they compete against their advertisers, and we are one of their largest advertisers, we have Booking.com within their top five of advertisers. They're using their tactics to squeeze these entities that are delivering real service is, among many things, antisocial. I mean, I think it's bad practice.Diller also said he had told Google's senior management to stop taking profits away from its bigger advertisers. The issue underscores not just a challenge for\u00a0Expediaand other OTAs,but also that Google is setting itself up to face increased regulatory pressure as it's now in the awkward position of competing with some of its biggest advertising customers. The company has run into similar problems in the past with websites like\u00a0.Management was careful to note that its current strategy is a work in progress, and it declined to give details on its cost-cutting program as it was still working it out. However, Expedia was confident that it would be able to deliver low-double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2020, which would be a substantial improvement from the 1% growth in that metric in the fourth quarter.The company refrained from giving specific guidance due to the coronavirus outbreak, but it nonetheless sees significant opportunity to improve profitability, customer service, and efficiency this year.Diller, who is also the Chairman of\u00a0, the tech conglomerate that spun off Expedia in 2005, has no plans to actively search for a full-time CEO at this point. So it seems that he and Kern are owning the turnaround plan for now.Wall Street seems encouraged, based on the double-digit percentage jump on Friday. But there's no doubt the company faces a number of challenges ahead, including Google and coronavirus, as well as effectively streamlining a company with over a dozen brands.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

's  \u00a0Google has become a major player in hotel meta-search, which is Trivago's core business, pressuring established online travel agencies. Its bidding partners like Expedia and Booking Holdings have begun focusing on generating more direct traffic to their sites rather than through Trivago; and the industry in general is maturing as growth is slowing across the board.Trivago's fourth-quarter earnings report makes clear that those trends are likely to persist through 2020. The stock plunged as much as 21% on Wednesday as revenue fell 7% to 155.5 million euros ($169.7 million), a reflection of the company's decision to pull back on marketing to get more valuable search traffic.\u00a0 On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA fell by 33% to 18.4 million euros, and earnings per share slipped from 0.03 euros to 0.01 euro.New CEO Axel Hefer, who was recently promoted from CFO, summed up the headwinds in management's letter to shareholders. Describing Trivago's outlook for the industry, he said, \"In the past few years, the industry dynamic has changed as growth has slowed, and large players have focused more on their profitability. At the same time, competition has increased.\"Hefer noted the influence of Google as well as newer competitors like Airbnb and Trip.com, and added, \"Trivago has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in industry growth, growing competition, and the reduced spend of their large [online travel agency] advertisers. We believe that the slowed industry growth has led to a lower share of first-time users of online travel websites, reducing the value of meta-search leads to the large [online travel agency] advertisers.\"\u00a0Image source: Trivago.Starting in 2018, Trivago has been forced to adapt its strategy to the changing marketplace dynamics. In general, the company has shifted its focus from revenue growth to profitability, and tried to use its marketing budget (its biggest line item) more efficiently. That strategy has produce mixed results, but there have been positive signs. For the full year in 2019, for example, adjusted EBITDA soared from 14.6 million euros to 70 million euros.For 2020, Trivago declined to give specific numbers in its outlook, but the company said it did not expect its industry outlook to change significantly. Trivago is planning to test its marketing efficiencies in the first half of the year, which it said could lead to double-digit revenue declines in Europe as it fine-tunes the strategy and makes adjustments.It also said it would roll out new products that will help with the integration of its alternative accommodations, including Airbnb, which recently became a Trivago partner. In an interview, CFO Matthias Tillman highlighted Trivago's advantage over Google in alternative accommodations like apartments and Airbnb rentals, noting that Trivago includes both hotels and other listings on its platform, while Google requires users to look at separate search pages for hotels and alternative listings like apartments. Trivago now has 3.5 million alternative accommodations listed on its platform.Management said it was targeting positive adjusted EBITDA for the first half of the year and aspires to adjusted EBITDA growth for the full year.\u00a0In his last comment on the , Hefer was blunt, saying, \"The times are rough, we do have a clear plan, and we are focused on what we can control.\"Trivago may have a good product as the biggest hotel meta-search company, and it has key advantages over Google, including its specialization in hotels.

The chart below shows how those two stocks have performed over the last decade compared with the\u00a0.\u00a0 data by More recently, however, these stocks and others like\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0have stagnated as industry dynamics have changed and growth has slowed.Trivago's recent earnings report, which caused the stock to \u00a0by double digit percentages, makes clear the challenges the industry faces over the coming year and beyond. Among the issues management noted were the growth of 's   Google, the threat of the coronavirus, and the maturity of the industry and its subsequent slowing growth. Let's look at these three factors.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Google is the leading search engine in much of the world. It's built a $1 trillion company by leveraging the advertising demand around billions of search queries, and that position gives it enormous market power when it chooses to move into a new industry.Google already makes billions selling travel ads, including those from online travel agencies (OTAs) like Expedia and Booking, but over the past few years, the search giant has gradually made a bigger play for travel search directly. It introduced a redesigned hotel search page in October 2018,\u00a0and launched Google Travel last May, a one-stop site for hotels, flights, and vacation packages. Meanwhile, Google has also found ways to coax more ad dollars out of OTAs by pushing free travel listings lower down on the search page.\u00a0In its letter to shareholders, Trivago assessed Google's position by saying, \"Google has invested into its own hotel meta-search product, trying to capture more of the value in the industry and grow its profit base,\" and, \"Google is likely to continue to try to increase its share of total industry profit.\"\u00a0So far, established OTAs haven't found a way to stop Google, and its position as the place internet users usually begin a search gives it a key advantage. So the search giant is likely to grab more market share and profits in 2020 as it makes a bigger push for the online travel market.Uncertainty still surrounds the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 40,000. No one knows how deadly the epidemic will be, or how long it will last, but its impact on business has already come into focus.In travel, the virus has been problematic for the cruise industry, leaving one ship in Japan quarantined, and has forced other travelers to cancel trips to China. Unlike some industries, hotels and airlines operate with a time-based inventory, so a trip canceled today doesn't generally lead to a trip at another time. That's money lost that isn't coming back.In its shareholder letter, Trivago acknowledged that the coronavirus would hurt its business this year, especially in Asia,\u00a0and that the impact is likely to be similar across all \u00a0that do business in Asia.\u00a0The virus will also hurt Chinese tourism in places like the U.S. and elsewhere, because China, with the world's biggest population, has become a significant driver in the global tourism industry. Chinese tourists spent $34.6 billion in the U.S. in 2018, a figure that's likely to decline this year if the coronavirus persists.\u00a0Online travel was at one point a disruptive industry. In the days before the internet, travelers would often have to rely on an agent to book a flight or a vacation package, and the disruptive impact led to rapid growth in the early days for companies like Booking and Expedia as they recruited more and more hotels to list on their platforms. But more recently, revenue growth has slowed as the market has matured and new competition has come in. In addition to Google, Airbnb and other vacation rentals sites have shifted the market, as have newer hotel-booking sites like HotelTonight. Meanwhile, the white-space opportunity in finding hotels to list through online travel agencies is much smaller than it was earlier in the industry's history.The chart below shows how revenue growth has slowed for all of the major domestic online travel stocks.\u00a0 data by Early in the 2010s, companies like Booking regularly had revenue growth in the 20% or 30% range. Now single-digit growth or even negative growth has become the norm in the industry.In its letter, Trivago management noted that industry growth had slowed, which it said was leading OTAs to focus more on profitability than revenue growth. That type of transition is typical for a maturing industry. When industry revenue growth is high, companies tend to spend aggressively on marketing to capture that growth. As revenue growth slows, profitability becomes more important, which generally leads to slower growth in marketing or even a decline in the demand driver, as has been the case for Trivago recently.Some of these travel stocks may be able to outperform expectations this year since they don't necessarily trade in tandem and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

The outbreak began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China; it has killed several dozen people, infected thousands more and spread to several countries, including the U.S., since then. Memories of the 2002-03 SARS and 2015 MERS outbreaks are popping back up - including on Wall Street, where several highly touted stock picks have been derailed by the health scare.It's no small worry. The SARS outbreak not only tallied 774 deaths across more than 8,000 cases over a six-month period, but helped knock China's GDP down from 11.1% in the first quarter of 2003 to 9.1% in the second quarter. Depending on the estimate, it removed between $40 billion to $100 billion from the world's economy.Like SARS, today's coronavirus outbreak also is happening at a troublesome time: the Chinese Lunar New Year. The heavy travel period is what helped spread SARS throughout Asia, and what could contribute to a faster spread of the coronavirus.This health issue is weighing on America's broader stock markets, but it's particularly cutting into a few specific industries where the financial strain is already being felt. If there's any silver lining, it's that, like with SARS, this could end up being an opportunity to buy otherwise high-quality stocks at a discount for a potential snap-back.Here, we look at eight stock picks that are being hampered by the coronavirus outbreak, but may eventually be attractive buy-the-dip prospects.Market value: $82.2 billionDividend yield: N/AChina's government, in an attempt to contain the coronavirus, has quickly ramped up a quarantine effort in 14 cities affecting 41 million people. It also has put several travel restrictions in place, including slapping a ban on international group tours. Meanwhile, other countries are trying to limit travel as well, such as Malaysia, which is temporarily halting visa issuing to Chinese citizens from Wuhan and around Hubei province.Booking Holdings (, $1,962.96) - the parent of Booking.com and Priceline, among other travel sites - has understandably been hit hard.Booking has made China, and its huge consumer base, a primary focus for growth. It has invested in leading Chinese travel sites including Trip.com () and Meituan-Dianping to gain a foothold in this market. Booking doesn't break out China revenues specifically, but it has said that China is a major part of its International Other revenues, which accounted for 13% of revenues for the first nine months of 2019.At the moment, its ties to China have weighed on the stock - BKNG is down more than 8% over the past couple weeks. But this may be a case of short-term pain, long-term gain.\n\nA strengthening Chinese consumer is bolstering travel spending in the country, both domestically and internationally. China's Outbound Tourism Research Institute pegs 170% growth in the number of annual overseas trips by Chinese residents, from 149.7 million in 2018 to 400 million in 2030.How deep BKNG and similar stock picks fall is difficult to determine because 2019-nCoV hasn't been contained - the longer the outbreak lasts and the wider its spreads, the worse it could get for Booking. For context, though, the  says that Chinese stocks as a whole \"caught up\" with their international peers about six months after first reporting SARS to the World Health Organization.DAL Market value: $38.0 billionDividend yield: 2.7%UAL Market value: $20.7 billionDividend yield: N/AAirline stocks such as Delta Air Lines (, $58.81) and United Airlines (, $81.90) have delivered mostly flat stock performance over the past few years. However, they were already in value territory to begin 2020, and their stocks are getting even cheaper as travel restrictions ramp up, and as people around the globe reconsider their travel plans.According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, only about 60,000 passengers flew from the U.S. to Wuhan last year. Delta and United don't even offer direct flights to Wuhan, though they do offer service via their OneWorld and Star Alliance partnerships.That said, their ties to China more broadly, as well as Hong Kong, are significantly stronger. For instance, Stifel analysts predict that United has about 5.5% of its capacity heading along U.S-to-China/Hong Kong routes.Both airlines have been forced to issue refunds, cancel flights and reroute people returning from China just to conduct screening measures. Their troubles likely will only get worse the longer the outbreak lasts - travel bans likely will become more restrictive, and people in general are likely to put off international and even domestic travel until the coronavirus situation has been contained.Worry about these outcomes have already weighed on UAL and DAL, and may continue to drag their shares down. But there are reasons to like airline stocks once the coronavirus danger has passed. Lower fuel costs, rising fees and overall higher ticket prices have been improving many airlines' financial situations.Analysts are more bullish than bearish about both United and Delta, too. Bernstein analyst David Vernon, for one, predicts that the coronavirus will only affect United's earnings by 8 cents per share, writing that it will be \"less severe\" on load factors than SARS. Delta, which has less exposure to China than United, should feel an even smaller impact.Market value: $252.9 billionDividend yield: 1.3%Disney (, $140.08) beat the market by more than 3 percentage points in 2019 on the strength of its Marvel and Star Wars franchises, as well as the launch of its streaming service, Disney+. But while investors fawned over Disney's big-screen success, the House of Mouse also was scoring gains in the theme-park business. \"Parks, Experiences and Products\" revenues grew 6% year-over-year in its fiscal year ended September 2019, and operating income improved by 11%.However, thanks to travel bans enacted by the Chinese government, Disney has been forced to close its Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland. Worse, it hasn't listed a reopening date. Worse still, this is coming during the critical Lunar New Year travel season. And on top of all that, its Chinese operations had been hurting already. Disney CFO Christine McCarthy  earnings release that the Hong Kong protests \"have led to a significant decrease in tourism from China and other parts of Asia\" and that the company expected a $275 million full-year revenue decline in those operations.That was before the outbreak.Again, however, Disney's other arms are running smoothly. Its new Disney+ service is racking up new subscribers. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Bernie McTernan writes that he expects Disney to report 25 million subscribers for its streaming service, versus a previous 21 million estimate. And Bank of America's analysts think Disney's internal estimates for Disney+ are too conservative. While domestic theme-park attendance might take a short hit from coronavirus fears, that too had been surging.Market value: $229.4 billionDividend yield: 1.1%The rise of the Chinese consumer isn't boosting only normal goods - it's quickly becoming a shopper's paradise for luxury products. Data from consultancy Bain & Company shows that . Moreover, rising Chinese demand for high-end handbags, jewelry, shoes and other goods accounts for more than 90% of the growth in the luxury market. Those sales happen not just in mainland China and Hong Kong, but also on trips to Europe and major U.S. cities.This trend has been a boon for luxury powerhouse LVMH (, $91.19), whose brands include Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Mo\u00ebt and Hennessy. Its revenues have grown by 11% annually over the past four years, and Asia ex-Japan sales accounted for roughly a third of 2018's total.LVMUY shares have been hit hard, off almost 9% in just more than a week amid worries about the economic impact of the coronavirus.Here again, though, the longer-term outlook is still rosy. The firm continues to strengthen its portfolio of brands, most recently with its $16.2 billion purchase of Tiffany's, which is expected to add more than $4.4 billion in annual revenues - the bulk of that from North America. And a return to normalcy likely will include a return to Chinese luxury spending in many of LVMH's premier brands.Market value: $26.5 billionDividend yield: 2.5%Despite the \"Caribbean\" connection, Royal Caribbean (, $126.51) is plenty exposed to China. RCL has built up its brand in the country over the past decade, and now offers several cruises throughout the region. The resulting brand familiarity has spurred Chinese travelers to also book Royal Caribbean cruises in other parts of the world. The company said Chinese guests with non-China itineraries spiked 75% between 2016 and 2019.RCL is feeling the bite now, though. The company had to cancel a Shanghai-to-Japan sail, and it will turn away passengers either from Wuhan or who have recently traveled through the city.Shares have dropped by double digits over the past couple weeks, in part because while investors assume the 2019-nCoV outbreak will take a financial toll, there's little visibility into just how much.But like these other stock picks, RCL's short-term plunge could be a buying opportunity. For Royal Caribbean, its brand is its pull. Cruises tend to rely heavily on brand loyalty; their booking perks keep consumers entrenched in a single cruise line. And RCL has a strong grip on the Chinese market.\"It's a long-term strategic program, but our focus on developing the market has exceeded our expectations in terms of performance,\" Richard Fain, chairman and CEO, told  in October. \"Our sales in China are holding up well despite any economic concerns.\"Market value: $14.5 billionDividend yield: 3.0%Wynn Resorts (, $134.75) will strike a chord with American consumers for its Las Vegas properties, but the company is very much a China play.As one of the only places in China that gambling is legal, the special district of Macau has become a travel mecca for entertainment seekers - and Wynn was one of the first groups to be granted an operating license in the region. Today, Wynn pulls almost three-quarters of its adjusted property EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) from the region - the highest among the major competitors there.The problem for investors looking to history is that Wynn's presence in Macau began after the 2002-03 SARA breakout, so there's little to compare it to. However, Jefferies analyst David Katz says a worst-case scenario for WYNN would see a roughly 29% decline from its Jan. 20 closing price - and shares have already dropped 17% since then.The long-term upside for Wynn isn't in VIPs, but the so-called \"mass-market gambler.\" Wynn has shifted its product mix in Macau to court the average Joe, and it's working. VIPs often demand opulent perks, cutting into their margins, but Wynn is finding that it can squeeze plenty of profit out of regular players. Thus, the company is executing several projects, including converting some luxury rooms into standards, to capture more of this market share.The quick drop in WYNN shares has also brought its yield to around 3%, which is on the high end of its range for the past few years.Market value: $16.6 billionDividend yield: 1.1%Pure-play Chinese domestic-consumption stocks have taken a beating. The Global X MSCI China Consumer Discretionary ETF (), for instance, has dropped by double digits in just the past week.Yum! China (, $44.25) is in the same boat, dropping 16% in five days.With more than 8,750 restaurants in over 1,300 cities, Yum! China has been among the better stock picks leveraging the domestic Chinese economy and offered up torrid growth - both when it was part of Yum! Brands () as well as following its 2015 spinoff. Yum! China is responsible for Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell operations in China.But when Chinese consumers won't - or can't - spend any money, YUMC naturally will find itself in a difficult situation.Already, Yum! China has temporarily closed some of its KFC and Pizza Hut stores in Wuhan due to the outbreak. It's a tiny fraction of its base; the real fear is that overall traffic will decline throughout the company as fewer people venture out over virus fears.YUMC shares could sustain even more losses the longer the coronavirus outbreak drags out. But a rebound seems likely given its longer-term growth drivers, such as coffee concept COFFii & JOY and its controlling interest in hot-pot chain Huang Ji Huang. And as China continues to modernize, Yum! China plans to expand its empire into more cities, targeting 20,000 potential locations in its network. In future, you might not be able to go anywhere within the country without running into a KFC or Pizza Hut - and that would be music to investors' ears.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Trip.Com\u2018s (NASDAQ: TCOM)\u00a0Transportation Ticketing, which generates revenues from the reservation of air tickets, railway tickets, and other related services, is expected to contribute $2.4 billion to Trip.Com\u2019s 2020 revenues, making up 40% of the company\u2019s $6 billion in revenues for 2020.\u00a0The Transportation Ticketing segment contribution is almost equivalent to the Accommodation Reservation segment, where revenue is generated from all hotel-related transactions.The company\u2019s revenue grew more than 50% over 2015-2017 and its stock price nearly doubled between 2015 and mid-2017.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.\n\nIn trading on Monday, shares of Booking Holdings Inc (Symbol: BKNG) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.4, after changing hands as low as $1868.04 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 49.2.  A bullish investor could look at BKNG's 28.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2022 put at the $1460 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $66.50.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.5% return against the $1460 commitment, or a 2.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to BKNG's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $1460 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Booking Holdings Inc sees its shares decline 29.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $1393.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $66.50 from $1460), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.2% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Booking Holdings Inc, and highlighting in green where the $1460 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2022 put at the $1460 strike for the 2.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Booking Holdings Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $2060.69) to be 25%.

Its various brands, including Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline, agoda.com, Rentalcars.com, and OpenTable, serve customers and partners in more than 230 countries.The shift in travel spending from offline to online has been a huge tailwind for the company. Booking.com is the company's largest brand, which included accommodations for more than 2 million hotels, apartments, and other bookable properties in 2018.The engine to the company's growth is marketing. Last year, the company spent $4.4 billion on marketing expenses, which mostly went to online search engines it works with. The wide availability of bookable properties coupled with a big advertising budget allows Booking Holdings to land top search results and maintain its leadership position in the online travel market.The opportunity here is centered around taking market share in a multitrillion-dollar travel industry. Travel is a growth industry, but Booking Holdings is expanding much faster. Total spending on travel and tourism worldwide is expected to grow at a low-single-digit rate. However, Booking Holdings has seen its revenue increase by 77% in total over the last five years.There is still plenty of opportunity in the industry for Booking Holdings to maintain its momentum. Management has positioned the business to capture  over the decade. Last year, Booking made a $500 million investment in Didi Chuxing, a leading mobile transportation and ride-hailing platform in China. Booking also made a $200 million investment in Grab, a leading on-demand transportation and mobile service platform in Southeast Asia. The strategy here is to cross-promote its bookable properties with users of these transportation services.The stock currently trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.9 times next year's earnings estimate, and analysts expect earnings to grow at 12% per year over the next five years.Chinese tech giant Alibaba proves every quarter why it's one of the best tech stocks to consider if you're looking to juice your returns. Revenue increased by 40% year over year in the most recent quarter. The largest revenue driver is the company's widely used commerce platform, including Taobao and Tmall, which has a growing base of 693 million annual active users and 785 million active users on mobile.Alibaba doesn't make or sell anything. It generates most of its revenue from digital ad services, which help merchants connect with consumers through the company's e-commerce marketplaces. Alibaba basically has a toll-booth monopoly on foreign brands that need to reach Chinese consumers. Some of the biggest brands, including  and , rely on Alibaba's Tmall to sell their goods in China.These e-commerce platforms , which management uses to invest in other growth initiatives. There is Alibaba Cloud, the largest cloud service provider in China, which reported revenue growth of 64% last quarter. Alibaba is also investing in new retail concepts like its Freshippo supermarkets, which is blending the online and offline shopping experience in innovative ways.The overarching mission of Alibaba is to \"make it easy to do business anywhere.\" Management sees a long runway of growth. The goal is to serve 1 billion consumers and double gross merchandise volume on its commerce platforms by fiscal 2024 (which ends in March). Given the company's current momentum, there's every reason to believe Alibaba will reach those targets.The luxury goods market was valued at $307 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow to $446 billion by 2025, according to management consultancy company Bain. The problem for luxury brands is that there are a lot of them, and the shift to e-commerce is making it more difficult for smaller brands to stand out. Farfetch is in business to solve that problem. The company has 1.9 million active users and more than 1,200 brands and boutiques selling on its platform.Brands are attracted to the platform because it simplifies the process of fulfilling orders. Farfetch offers a range of services, including fulfillment, marketing, payments, and other tools to help brands grow their businesses.The attractive aspect of Farfetch's business is that it doesn't carry a lot of inventory relative to traditional luxury goods companies. This makes Farfetch appealing to investors for its relatively asset-light business model, which should lead to plenty of profits as the business scales.The long-term vision of founder Jose Neves is to reinvent how people discover and shop for luxury goods. The recent stellar growth trend in gross merchandise volume (GMV) shows that Neves is on to something big. On a currency-neutral basis, GMV increased by 40% year over year in the third quarter. This is a deceleration from 50% growth in the first quarter due to a promotional sales environment, but as those growth rates reveal, the long-term opportunity is massive relative to the company's $2.9 billion market cap.Profits are nonexistent at this point, but this shouldn't concern investors at this . The third quarter revealed a year-over-year improvement in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin, as management continues to guide the business to profitability. As the company reaches more consumers and expands the inventory selection on its marketplace by bringing in more brands, the benefits of scale will kick in, and costs should come down.The stock has fallen dramatically over the last year, but it was richly valued coming out of the IPO about a year ago. If Farfetch can convert its inventory-light business model to a double-digit operating margin over time, the stock's current price-to-sales ratio of 3.5 could be undervalued.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

The Chinese market has significant regulatory limitations, and it can be difficult to cater to local tastes in other markets around Southeast Asia and East Asia. But there is much to be gained since these markets (China in particular) are some of the  in the world.'s experience in China shows just how hard it can be. After spending billions of dollars in establishing a foothold, the company still couldn't win against local ridesharing favorite Didi Chuxing. Uber ended up  in exchange for equity in Didi in an admission of defeat.  has taken a somewhat different approach in Asia and has achieved a surprising level of success. Here's how they did it.There were several directions Booking could have gone to establish its presence in Asian markets, but the company has chosen to partner with local e-commerce leaders. Booking's partnerships have involved making equity investments in exchange for access to a large user base.Booking's Chinese partnerships with , , and Didi Chuxing are likely as much about avoiding the burden of Chinese legal issues with accessing China's population of over 1 billion. The partnership with Singapore-based Grab gives Booking access to users across Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, as well as other areas.Data source: Booking Holdings.What's in it for the Asian platforms? More options for users. While Ctrip and Meituan-Dianping have many travel options for domestic hotels and flights in China, they lack Booking.com's deep inventory of international travel options in greater Asia and around the world. And providing more features (such as travel) makes the online platforms more valuable to the users -- creating a win-win proposition for Booking and its Asian partners.In addition to drumming up more business for Booking, the partnerships have provided some nice gains on its equity investments.\u00a0In Booking's annual report, it notes an unrealized gain of over $400 million on its Ctrip investment. The company's $450 million investment in Meituan-Dianping is now worth about $1 billion -- a cool 120% return in just one year.Didi Chuxing and Grab are not yet public, so it's hard to determine if Booking has made money on these investments, but . Both ridesharing companies have strong market positions and are still growing.Booking's equity investments in its Asian partners were as strategic as they were financial. One of the nice things about this arrangement is that the company has multiple ways to win.Image source: Getty Images.By all accounts, the Asian market for booking online travel is growing really fast. In 2018, more than 130 million Chinese residents traveled internationally. This is just a small fraction of the  for travel booking today, but Chinese international travel is expected to become a large portion of total travel by 2050. Booking also has a nice \"call option\" on Southeast Asian travel through its partnership with Grab and its ownership of Asian travel booking website Agoda.com.This all spells lots of growth for Booking coming out of Asia. The company's partnership approach has enabled it to establish a strong presence in the region that should benefit it for years to come.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

It\u2019s one of those things that seem to have no end, shaking just about everyone\u2019s confidence.   So then, with Aurora Cannabis, might we be seeing something similar? Could this be the time to make a buy? Or, could this be more like a  or Pets.com?Well, I\u2019m in the optimist camp.True, this is not to ignore the nagging problems. And yes, they are considerable. The legalization of cannabis in the Canadian market has not lived up to the lofty expectations (again, this is a parallel to the dot-com glory days). Keep in mind that governmental authorities have been agonizingly slow, especially with licensing of retail outlets. To make up for this, black market activities have become a major factor.As for Aurora Cannabis in particular, the company has had some of its own self-inflicted wounds. Let\u2019s face it: management has been too aggressive with its spending. It also looks like it has missed opportunities to strike strategic financings.However, while all these are serious problems, the markets have been factoring all this into Aurora\u2019s stock price. The result is that the market cap is a much more palatable $2.6 billion, which is not bad for a premier company in the space.Even with the challenges in the Canadian market, it is still a nice source of growth. In the latest quarter, revenues for Aurora spiked by nearly 140% to $22.4 million. The company also has a decent amount of cash in the bank at $316 million.But next year there will be another catalyst for growth in the Canadian market \u2013 that is, Cannabis 2.0. This is when it will be legal to sell hemp-based edibles.Now the predictions are wide, with some estimates at over $2 billion. But even if it is half this, it should provide a nice opportunity for Aurora.The company is prepared for this, having invested in offerings like vapes, gummies, chocolates, mints, cookies and so on. There should also be help from Aurora\u2019s strategic advisor, Nelson Peltz, who is one of the world\u2019s top investors for consumer stocks. Some of his positions are in companies like  (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:), and  (NASDAQ:).It also should be noted that Aurora is not just in the recreational cannabis space. The company actually has a diverse platform, which should help it deal better with market conditions. For example, Aurora has been able to build a strong medical business, with more than 40 researchers who have conducted a long list of clinical trials and case studies. The company currently serves about 84,000 patients and has a global platform that which reaches about 25 countries.On the latest , Aurora CEO Cam Battley had this to : \u201cThe past few months have been challenging for the broader cannabis industry, between issues of governance, evolving consumer demand, and provincial retail bottlenecks. There\u2019s been no shortage of negative news. That said, I want to reiterate that our view of the opportunity in the Canadian and global cannabis industry is still extremely robust.\u201dI think he is spot-on. Taking the long view of things is the way to approach companies like Aurora. This means there will continue to be lots of stomach-churning volatility. But we are still in the early days with cannabis \u2013 and more importantly, Aurora is positioned to be a winner.Tom Taulli is the author of the book,\u00a0.\u00a0Follow him on Twitter at\u00a0.\u00a0As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ripAdvisor\u2018s (NASDAQ: TRIP) hotel revenues have been on a declining trend in the last few years, having lost more than $100 million in revenues since 2015.

However, the two companies are quite different and their financial results show it.The key difference between Booking Holdings and Expedia is the markets they serve. Expedia derives a majority of its business from the United States while Booking\u00a0Holdings primarily operates in Europe. At first blush, this might seem like a minor detail, but it is crucial to understanding the financial performances of the two companies.Although online travel booking websites help users book a wide variety of accommodations including flights, rental cars, and local excursions, commissions on hotel rooms provide them with the vast majority of their profits due to higher commission rates. Websites like Expedia.com can collect as much as a 20% commission on the price of a hotel accommodation.But the hotel markets in Europe and North America are quite different. While the United States is dominated by chains such as  and  the European hotel market is primarily served by smaller boutique hotels. Large hotel chains control tens of thousands of rooms and centrally negotiate their contracts with online travel agencies, which allows them to secure more favorable contract terms and lower commission rates.As a result, Expedia on average collects much lower commissions on its hotel business than Booking Holdings, which is a big reason why the Europe-centric company delivers higher profit margins.Image Source: Getty Images.The other major difference between Booking and Expedia is their go-to-market strategy. Expedia was built around a patchwork of website properties  including Hotels.com, Orbitz, and Travelocity. By contrast, Booking Holdings still generates most of its revenue from its namesake Booking.com platform.Branding matters. In Europe, Booking.com is a more dominant platform. There are certainly competitors, but it has a larger market share than similar websites in other regions. As a result, most of Booking.com's traffic comes from users who go to it directly, rather than being directed to it by a search engine. This significantly reduces its paid advertising costs.Expedia certainly gets a lot of direct traffic to its website, but user behavior in North America tends to start with search engines like . For this reason, , again resulting in lower profit margins. This has also created a more intense competitive environment where Google can direct search traffic to competing websites.For these reasons, Booking's more unified website strategy is a superior business strategy.Over the last 10 years, Booking Holdings has delivered greater revenue growth than Expedia, as well as greater earnings-per-share growth. data by Delivering superior EPS growth is easy when a company is significantly more profitable. A higher proportion of Booking's marginal revenue growth falls to the bottom line as compared to Expedia. What's more, Booking has been using a . Over the last 12 months, it has repurchased $8.7 billion worth of its own stock and has billions remaining in its current buyback authorization. And reducing the share count further enhances Booking's EPS growth.Superior financial results have translated into superior  for Booking Holdings. data by Investors are usually rewarded when they invest in businesses with better financial models. In this case, Booking Holdings has a superior model to Expedia due to its geographic focus and its single-brand strategy.

Fourth quarter profits for Disney came in higher than expected. This comes just a few days, Jason, before the much anticipated Disney+ video streaming service launches. I have to believe that unless you're a direct competitor, there is a lot to like in this report.There is a lot to like. Remember, it wasn't all that long ago we were talking about Disney's reliance on ESPN, and how that was a bit of a risk given the change in the media space and competition out there. I think going through this release, going through this call, to me, they've put any of those concerns to rest at this point. And when you look at the amount of content that they're going to be bringing into your living room over the course of the next decade, the amount of content that Disney is going to control is astounding. My living room, too?Your\u00a0living room, too. I defy you to tell me this isn't a great value, Ron. And you're our value guy.Yeah, I am.\u00a0\u00a0The numbers itself, we talk often about how Disney makes its money so many different ways. This quarter was no exception. The studio segment, operating profit was up 79% thanks to strong performance from , , much to Mac's chagrin. I know he wasn't a big fan of . Also . Parks, operating profit up 17%. But like you said, this really is all about the rollout of Disney+, how they're going to integrate that. They've got a deal with \u00a0that's going to open them up to 20 million households as well. If you're a Verizon FiOS subscriber, you'll get a year of that Disney+ on the house. There are a lot of reasons to be excited. Hulu was a big point of the call. Go back a couple of quarters, you didn't hear Hulu all that often. Now, they're mentioning Hulu more than they're mentioning ESPN. You see the direction they're going.Yeah, but here's the thing. They're not making a ton of money off of Disney+, at least not yet. And there's so much expectation baked into Disney's stock price, where it is today, about the success of Disney+. Now, do I think Disney+ is going to succeed? Yes, of course. And it's really going to be precipitated on how much they're able to increase that price as time goes on, and how sticky those customers end up being. So, it's great. They're running out with Disney+ now. The whole intention is to get as many people into that service as they can initially, and then slowly raise the price over time to the point where it is then a huge driver of profit for them. It's not there yet.\u00a0So\u00a0are you, Emily Flippen, saying Disney is overvalued here? [laughs]\u00a0I am not saying it's overvalued! I am simply saying that there are expectations there. And the expectation is that they do have some pricing power with Disney+.I think she's spot on there. Chris, we had talked a lot leading up to this, probably the biggest risk is the execution risk, right? I mean, they roll this platform out, and if the infrastructure doesn't work, if this BAMTech acquisition doesn't prove to be as prescient as we thought it would be, I mean, that's going to be a big problem. But they have definitely tested this thing ad nauseum to try to make sure there's not going to be any hiccups. And to me, that really does remain the biggest risk, but it does sound like they're addressing it.It is worth remembering, to your point, that we are just a few weeks away from 2020, and the original launch for this streaming service was over a year and a half ago.\u00a0That is true. That is true. But, you know, all good things do take some time. And to that point, they really led up to the very last minute here in just getting on the Fire platform. And that matters, because, I mean, Amazon Fire is one of the leading streaming services out there.\u00a0Speaking of video streaming, real quick, Jason, Roku, that stock has had a great year. It had a bad week. Down 17%. Third quarter losses really overshadowed the revenue growth.Yeah, I mean, when you look at the actual streaming platform space, we're talking about Amazon Fire, Roku is the other big player in that space. And so I think the market was reacting to a little bit of a pullback on EBITDA guidance for the quarter. Understandable, but Roku is making a lot of investments, and they are pivoting away from being the device maker and seller and more to becoming the platform. That page out of the book of Bezos, right? Make more money from us using the device as opposed to buying the device. They are executing. There's a big market out there, particularly internationally, when you look at that ad-supported video-on-demand market. It's just going to take some time. I think the stock price, it looks a little bit more attractive today, perhaps, than it did at the beginning of the week, and that's alright.\u00a0Shares of Zillow up more than 10% on Friday after the company's loss in the third quarter was smaller than expected. Emily, management says Zillow Offers, which is their home-flipping business, is going to generate $1 billion in revenue. Are you buying?I have not been a huge fan of Zillow's business model transition. That's not to say that I don't think the real estate industry is ripe for disruption. I think there is. But there are a lot of players that are ahead of Zillow. Zillow's Offers business, which is part of their home segment, is really what the entire company is revolving around at this point. They buy homes on the market, fix them up if needed, then resell them for a profit. The problem is, there is no profit yet. It's important to note that while there was significant revenue growth -- 117% year over year, largely driven by this home segment -- that raise of guidance for, I think, $1.25 billion in revenue from the home segment, that's gross. What they're doing is, they're recognizing gross revenue. That's where they're recognizing the entire selling price of that home as their own revenue, and then taking out the cost of selling it, before they get to the profit. It does make that number look a little artificially big. But, you get a better idea about the really low margins that exist on this business.\u00a0 As was my question -- any guidance on margins, have they offered? They're not profitable yet, but they are saying that they want to be profitable in the home segment without including ancillary revenues. It's expected to be within the next couple of years. It's not quite sure. It's such a growing industry that they really don't know. But the idea is, \"Look, we don't have to do your mortgage to be profitable on that transaction. We want to be profitable on the home itself.\" They definitely seem like they're one step closer to that goal today than they were yesterday, at least for investors. I'm not sure if I'm really sold. There are, like I said, so many businesses in this space. But I do think it's an interesting business. It's just, admittedly, a much, much lower margin one than the one they were in before.It sounds like there are a lot of \"ifs\" in there.There are a lot of ifs. I mean, we were talking about last week, I think it was, about, hey, when are they going to be profitable? Zillow is another company. They've just strung this story out for so long. I just want to know when they're going to be profitable.I'm not buying it. From housing to video games. Activision Blizzard's third quarter results were fueled by strong sales of  and . Take-Two Interactive's second quarter revenue came in 74% higher than a year ago. You tell me, Ron, what stood out to you?There's similar stories here with better-than-expected results, but weak guidance for the coming holiday quarter, which was a little troubling to me. The other main difference here is, Take-Two actually posted really impressive growth in revenue and earnings, while Activision, which is in the middle of what they're calling a transition year, had declining revenues and earnings. So, a pretty big difference there. Both companies dealing with this tough competition from online free-to-play games \u00e0 la and games like that, . So it is a tough environment for these guys right now. I don't like to see that guidance for the coming quarter.\u00a0Any chance they're sandbagging just a little bit going into the holiday quarter? They would not be the first companies to do that.\u00a0Yeah, I think it's appropriate to be conservative here. If you want to go as far as sandbagging, sure. I think some appropriate conservatism makes sense.Match Group posted\u00a0solid growth in the third quarter, thanks in part to Tinder, but guidance for the fourth quarter was lower than Wall Street was hoping for, and shares of Match Group sold off more than 10% Wednesday morning. Although, Emily, the stock really recovered most of those losses later in the week.Which, it really should have. That immediate sell-off was a little bit ridiculous, because if you actually look at their reports, virtually all of their numbers were up. I mean, the most important ones, which is engagement on their platforms, really exceptional results. I mean, Tinder, obviously being Match Group's most well-known and popular platform. They're saying that people are on average using their app more than five times a week. That number's gone up over the years. They're aggressively expanding into new markets like Japan and India, where they're seeing lots of success with OK Cupid. So there's lots of areas for them to continue to grow. They had an impressive 38% year over year growth rate in average subscribers. That's on top of a 9% year over year increase in average revenue per subscriber. So, lots of great numbers here. A little bit light on guidance, but not nearly justifying a 10% sell-off.\u00a0Boy, there's nothing like the energy of youth, is there? The idea of using a dating app five times a week just sounds exhausting.It's funny, if you go through the call, you'll notice that management commented on the fact that among young users, more than 50% say they feel lonely. They see that as an opportunity. I saw it as a little bit depressing. Kind of makes you wonder why wants to spin this thing off, right? IAC has a big stake in Match, and I'll tell you what, they have proven time and time again to be so resilient. I mean, I think, you look at that competitive space, the way that stood up to Amazon, I think Match stood up to Facebook the same way. Really, it's a compelling business.The Gap\u00a0is looking for a new CEO. Art Peck is stepping down after four years and a half\u00a0in the corner office. During that time, Gap's stock has gone from $42 to Friday's price of lower than $17 a share. Ron, they've got an interim CEO, but the main job is open if you're looking for one. Son of the former founder is back in on an interim basis. I'm actually surprised it took this long for Peck to leave. I thought maybe when they announced the spin-off of Old Navy, they would take that opportunity to put new folks in place. But better late than never. I think this certainly makes sense. The problem is, is that Gap continues to deteriorate. And the bigger problem is that Old Navy's not doing that well, with comp sales down 4% this quarter. That spin-off doesn't look as attractive as maybe it did a few months ago or a few quarters ago. So far, we haven't heard anything related to the fact that that spin-off is going to be put on hold. Right now, I think it's plowing ahead. However, they've got to get the merchandising right there. They've got to get merchandising right in all their stores, whether it's Banana Republic or Gap, Gap being pretty much the worst of them, with comp sales down 7%. They had to lower guidance. This is not going well. It's time for some significant changes at the top. I'm glad to see they're making them.Do they also have inventory problems as well? I think of The Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, I think of them as, maybe not the most fashionable brands, but certainly reliable.If you go into any of those stores, you'll typically see 40% off the whole store. That's an indication that they have inventory problems and they need to be promotional to clear it out. Last thing before we move on. 2019 is going to be a record year in terms of CEOs leaving. Is it just harder to be a public company CEO in the age of social media, among other things?I think investors have less patience, and it gets harder for CEOs to take the longer view. There's more pressure. Activist investors have stepped in in a number of these cases and said there has to be a change at the top, so companies are following through there. So, I do think it's more difficult. In the old days, you could probably stick around for 10 or 20 years with a board that's entrenched and not really putting too much pressure on you.Shows\u00a0like ours probably don't help.Rough week for travel stocks. , the parent company of Priceline, TripAdvisor and Expedia\u00a0all issuing third quarter reports. All three stocks falling this week. Though, to be fair, Jason, Booking Holdings down around 8%. You look at Expedia, TripAdvisor, those things down to the tune of 30%.\u00a0Six\u00a0little letters, guys. Six little letters did it all. G-O-O-G-L-E. Man, I tell you, Google is really causing these travel companies to take a step back and try to figure out how to deal with their dominance in search, because that is how so much of that traffic gets to where they want to go. TripAdvisor, I mean, they're just waving the white flag. That's the point of the $3.50 special dividend. That's the point of the share repurchases, reassessing the business. I think the best thing they can do at this point is shop that business around, sell it, and do right by shareholders in some capacity.Expedia, bigger business. They've already made that leap into being an OTA. Still difficult for them to combat Google and their dominance in search.\u00a0Booking.com is the winner of the three. Certainly, the biggest network. And I think we've seen time and time again, they continue to invest in the service, in the app, in the website, making sure that people go back to booking.com or its properties, as opposed to going to Google and searching for stuff. So they're a little bit more resilient on that front.\u00a0But, yeah, I mean, when you look at it as a whole, it's a very competitive space. It's a huge market opportunity. But you're seeing very clearly Google and booking.com are turning into really the best ways to play it.Yeah. And it's not just Google, either. When you look at these businesses, a lot of their sales, the higher-margin sales are actually hotels and vacations, these sorts of things. And more and more hotels are trying to get people to book on their own website. So there's just less incentive for customers, people like you or I, to actually go and use one of their platforms to book vs. using Google or using just their own platforms.Jason, I know that TripAdvisor is a smaller company than it used to be, but it's still $4.5 billion. Who do you think is going to buy TripAdvisor at this price? Or, do you think that maybe an Alphabet looks at them and thinks, \"Well, if they get a little bit smaller, maybe we'll put down some money\"?I\u00a0mean, given the content, booking.com and Facebook are always companies that seem like they could be good fits. But they've introduced this joint venture partnership with trip.com in China to grow the presence out there. I think that could be a company under the radar, probably off lot of people's radars there, they could think, \"Hey we roll this thing in for cheap and get a lot of free content and then build out this additional side of the business that focuses more on the side of the world.\"Should investors be worried that all this is happening in a time when the economy in the United States is doing relatively well?\u00a0Oh, absolutely! Yeah. I mean, you would hope these businesses, particularly these businesses that are profitable and make so much cash, you'd want to see them performing well. But the market's telling us something.Uber\u00a0lost $1 billion in the third quarter. Shares down more than 10% this week, Emily.Yeah, there's a lot wrong with the Uber story. Honestly, you can get that anywhere. There's so many problems -- Really! Google search Uber and you'll see the problems that are associated with this company. [laughs]\u00a0I mean, not only are there just fundamental ways that the company, in terms of their margin profile and how they make money, but there's lawsuits now against how they pay their drivers, there are questionable legal practices. Lots of concerns here. And honestly, like I said, you can get that anywhere. So I'm going to give you the bull case for Uber, because I feel like there's so much pessimism out there that people forget just how ubiquitous Uber truly is. While I'm not saying to buy it, all of those are very legitimate concerns, nonetheless burning $1 billion last quarter, I think Uber actually has a decent amount of pricing power that's going largely unrecognized by the market right now. That's not just associated with the Uber name and saying that you'll \"grab an Uber,\" but it actually goes down to the fact that this is essentially an oligopoly, at least in the United States. As we see with most oligopolies, it comes down to some sort of price fixing, and it's going to result in higher prices for people who use ride-shares. We've already seen Uber stop rider incentives. They're increasing the prices. What's your alternative? We've all become so entrenched in the ride-sharing culture that we'll pay the higher prices. I think it's just a matter of time for Uber before they work out the profitability picture. But I don't think they're just down and out like people may have you think.My question is, do higher prices accrue to the driver, which is a major problem, of drivers being underpaid? Or, does it actually flow through to the company and result in increased profitability? What you'll notice is that Uber, different to the way that Zillow reports, they report net. Their revenue is reported after they pay their drivers. And it does, in some places, accrue to the driver. Naturally, Uber is trying to prevent that as much as possible. But, we'll see. Over this quarter, their revenues were up 30%. Obviously, some of that is coming down to their own revenues, which is reported in that. Shares of Papa John's up 8% this week on a surprising third quarter report. Ron, for the first time in a while for Papa John's, I mean surprising in a good way.Perhaps a turnaround has begun here. Certainly, the stock price this year would indicate it, up 55% this year. Comparable sales in North America turned positive for the first time in nearly two years. Up 1%, not huge, but still up. International comp sales up 1.6%. Adjusted earnings up 10%. Looking pretty good here. New CEO, Rob Lynch, made several top-level changes. Five executives, including a new CFO, will be coming on board. They put in a very impressive guy named Max Wetzel as chief commercial and marketing officer. You've got my buddies over at Starboard Value with a $200 million investment, now have the chairman role as well as the director role on the board there. They're looking at the menu, the recipe, they're baking that garlic sauce into the crust now, which I'm not a fan of, but more power to all those who are. This could be an interesting one for the next few years.\u00a0Is that Max Wetzel of Wetzel's Pretzels?\u00a0 I don't think it is. He's formerly from PPG. I just want to go on record here, I mean, I think I said midway through the year here, right when Shaq came on board, I was calling the bottom there. I said it's nothing but blues skies for Papa John's, I'm liking what I'm seeing.Never bet against Shaquille O'Neal.\u00a0[...]David Kirkpatrick has spent his career covering technology. In 2010, he wrote  best-seller . Earlier this week, I caught up with David to discuss the latest headlines involving Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\u00a0Let me start with the political ads. As I'm sure you've seen, Jack Dorsey coming out recently and saying, \"We're not doing this anymore. It's just not worth it to us.\" Mark Zuckerberg on the one hand said, \"Yeah, political ads are going to make up less than 0.5% of our revenue in 2020, but we're still doing it.\" And I guess my first question is, do you think he's going to change his mind?I actually doubt that he's going to change his mind. I have my reasons for that. I think if he was going to do it, he would have done it already, because he's been under such extraordinary pressure from so many corners, and he's doubling down, really. He's not yielding at all.Why do you think that is?Well, I have a cynical explanation. He says it's because he believes in freedom of speech. But, as many commentators have pointed out, there's a difference between freedom of speech and, as we say, freedom of reach. When you're advertising on Facebook, you're essentially buying reach. It isn't the same as having the right to speak when you're having the right to promote what you say. I think, in the opinion of pretty much everyone that I can see, except for a number of Republican Party supporters and commentators -- and that's an important distinction -- people are pressuring Zuckerberg to change this policy. But it is significant, it is widely believed that if he were to change his policy, it would be a negative for Donald Trump's political campaign, for the President's reelection, and probably for conservatives generally. So, here's my cynical theory, unfortunately. I hope I'm wrong, but I'm afraid the evidence suggests that it's probably true: Facebook doesn't want to offend the ruling power. If they were to change their policy now, it would be perceived by the White House in particular -- and we know you don't want to get on the wrong side of that guy -- as a fundamentally hostile act. And, at a time when even many Republicans -- notably John Hawley and others, Senator from Missouri -- and some of the people in some federal regulatory agencies are making noises about increased regulation of social media, Facebook, internet giants, I think the calculation is, if you get the White House mad at you right now, you are in business jeopardy, at least in jeopardy for much harsher regulatory treatment, possibly break-up. And I'm afraid that that is probably the way they're thinking.I want to come back to the regulatory stuff in a moment. But let me ask you about Sheryl Sandberg. She's been credited with a lot of Facebook's commercial success. In your book, you wrote about her ability to really get Facebook focused on its ad business. To what extent, if any, do you think Sheryl Sandberg deserves blame for the current state of Facebook?Well, it's a very tough question. Who's really responsible for any one thing inside that black box is hard to say. I mean, she is in charge of ads. So, presumably... but, then again, Mark is ultimately in charge of everything. And Cheryl works for Mark. So I think we can reasonably assume that whatever Cheryl does is what Mark wants Cheryl to do. And Cheryl is enormously effective. I mean, we've got to remember, she essentially built the best business that anybody's ever built for per dollar of revenue in terms of the profits per dollar revenue. You've never seen a more profitable scale business machine than Facebook. Sheryl Sandberg built that entirely from whole cloth. She is a master businessperson. Mark's very grateful to her for that. Really, a lot of his wealth is attributable to that. But I honestly think the buck stops at Mark Zuckerberg on every matter at Facebook, literally and figuratively.One business initiative of Facebook's that's got a lot of attention this year is Libra, the cryptocurrency. I think it's fair to say that Libra has hit some snags with and , among others, saying they're not going to be part of this initiative. What is the state of Libra right now? If I was at a sports book in Vegas, should I be betting on Libra to even happen?No. I would be very surprised if Libra happens at all in any near term. Maybe a redesigned, much different, less ambitious version could come about over some very lengthy period of time. Mark Zuckerberg has said he's not going to launch it anywhere in the world unless he gets the blessing of U.S. regulators, which really surprised me when he said that. Up to that point, he had made it sound like he wouldn't launch it here or in Europe unless he got the support of regulators in those geographies. Some of us were assuming he would launch it in a place like Vietnam or some other relatively remote country, where it might be a better received, and might be more needed -- I actually think Libra is a good idea, by the way, in many ways. Not so much because it's a cryptocurrency. I think that's the mechanism. But, in order to have a global transaction tool that can increase financial inclusion, and particularly serve the remittances market globally, that is a really desperately needy marketplace. Many, many immigrants -- and there's hundreds of millions of them -- are sending money around all the time, and they pay ridiculous, usurious fees. And I do believe Facebook wants to help that. That's one of the things about Libra that I really like.\u00a0But I think they've managed and launched it very clumsily.\u00a0Going back to, quickly, the issue of Sheryl Sandberg, my understanding is that she opposed the announcement of Libra at the time it was announced, believing that Facebook's reputation was not good enough to embark on a fundamentally new initiative of this scale and controversial nature. But, she did not prevail. Mark and David Marcus instead prevailed. They wanted to do it regardless. There's a point in Sheryl Sandberg's favor, probably because she was right. It shouldn't have been done now, because it's getting universal opprobrium from the people that have to approve it. If it's really true that they're not going to launch it until they get U.S. regulatory approval, they're not going to launch it, because that ain't coming anytime soon.We've talked a little bit about the scrutiny that Facebook is getting from the federal government. The same can be said of Amazon and Alphabet. Meanwhile, you've got and , the two biggest public companies. They appear to be in less danger than the other three in terms of onerous regulations, breakups, etc. When you look at the big tech companies in the United States, who do you think is in the greatest amount of danger in terms of being forced to break up? Is there one that you think is the most likely to pre-emptively, if not break itself up, at least spin off a major part?Well, Amazon is a company that wouldn't mind breaking itself up, is my own impression and belief. I think Amazon's AWS could be separated from the rest of the company relatively cleanly. There are those who believe, who are relatively well-informed, that that's what the company actually even intends to do at some point. It's been said that AWS might be worth as much as $500 billion on its own. That may be an exaggeration, because we don't know all the numbers there, but it's a hugely successful business in the center of the global economy, and more and more critical parts of companies and governments are depending on it. And it's a very fast-growing business. So, there's an easily separable part of a major tech platform. I think it could happen.\u00a0Who's most vulnerable to having imposed on them? Facebook. I mean, I personally oppose breakup as a tool. I don't think it's really rational. I think it's too punitive in its feeling and I don't really think it would solve the problems. It's not because I think, as they say at Facebook, they're going to be stronger if they can all stick together and use all the same software. If they really cared about that, which is their argument, that they're more powerful at combating misinformation, etc., when they have all their networks under one roof and they can collectively row the same boat -- if they really cared about that, they could be helping , too. They could be using the tools that they've developed for the entire industry, and making them, basically, public, to some substantial degree. I'm surprised, frankly, that Facebook has not volunteered to do that, because their public reputation is so negative, they need better PR, and that would be a great move. In any case, there certainly is an impulse -- and Elizabeth Warren talks about it, and even Donald Trump has made noises like he wouldn't totally oppose it... again, I think he does everything for political reasons, for his own personal benefit, the President. So, he might decide he wanted to hurt these people. That's when it might happen. I don't think it would happen, probably, under most other circumstances. And I don't think it would happen to Google. And I don't think it would happen to Apple.It's funny, because you think back 20 years ago, when Microsoft, from a market cap standpoint, was a much smaller company than it is today, they were squarely in the crosshairs of the government. And even some of the words that are being used today to describe Mark Zuckerberg -- words like ruthless, stubborn -- they were being used 20 years ago to describe Bill Gates.Oh, yeah! I was there. I definitely was covering tech at the time, so I remember that.Think about Gates now -- he's honored and revered for his philanthropic work. He's one of the most respected corporate leaders in the world. 25, 30 years, hence, do you think that's what the future holds in store for Mark Zuckerberg? At some point, he just hands the reins off to someone else, and he goes to start his foundation?There's\u00a0not a whole lot of likelihood that he is going to hand the reins to somebody else in the near term. He just is too passionately joined at the hip with his creation, and it's too important to him to let somebody else do that. It's unilaterally his own decision. Nobody's going to make him leave. I really don't think he would want to leave in any near term. Do I think he could resuscitate his reputation by giving away a large percentage of his $75 billion in wealth intelligently? Yes, I think he could. I think, you can do penance for a lot of sins with enlightened philanthropy. But the thing that's more amazing to me about Gates and Microsoft is that the company itself is now perceived as the most responsible, conscientious, law-abiding, non-harmful of the tech giants. Nobody would even suggest breaking up Microsoft now, and their market cap is bigger than the others most days. So, yeah, I mean, I think that's amazing. Gates got out at a good time. He's so brilliant in terms of understanding social issues, and he's such a scientist in the way he studies things. He's really known what to focus in on. I don't know if Zuckerberg would do it that way. Frankly, I think Zuckerberg should spend his time remediating the problems and the harms at Facebook before he goes out and starts curing the problems of the world. Remedies are generally short, and if he started doing some very high-profile stuff in some very important areas, he would be applauded for it.Last question, and then I'll let you go. I know it's a busy time for you. What should we be watching with Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg in the next 12 months? What are you going to be focusing on to give you an indication of what the following three to five years are going to mean, either for the direction of the business or for Mark Zuckerberg's reputation?I think, the issue you started with, of political ads, the whole issue of political disinformation, which I discussed, the whole role that Facebook plays in what many would say is damaging democracy -- and not just in the United States, this is in pretty much every democratic country in the world, or formerly democratic countries. If you look at the rise of autocracy around the world, in Turkey, Hungary, Brazil, Philippines, to some extent India, Poland, Brexit, Trump in the United States, and some of the people that he's surrounded himself with, Facebook has played a big role in a lot of that, and the bad sides of some of that. The key thing I'm always looking at the company for is to see, what are they going to do to try to reduce the harm that they're causing to global democracy? I worry about it. I worry about it tremendously. I don't think they worry about it enough, although I do think they worry about it a lot more than they used to. I think they would like to come up with the answer that would allow them to get us to stop worrying about it, so that we would be impressed with them. The problem is, they don't want to sacrifice a lot of revenues in the process, and profits. Nothing much that they've done to remediate some of their social harms has really been salient in affecting their business results. I think the thing that would most impress me and everybody is if they took gestures for social benefit that actually were not to their commercial benefit. I don't rule out the possibility that it might happen. Luckily, with Zuckerberg as unilateral power-wielder, it could. He could wake up one morning and decide to do that. I think Wall Street pressures him very hard not to do that. You guys are the investing guys, and I'm sure your listeners and readers probably would prefer he not do that, also, to be honest. It's kind of a conundrum and I don't think the world has a clear path forward for these companies to be both profitable and not causing social harm.It's always good talking to you, David!

Ron Gross, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?I'm looking at , BOMN. Just a radar stock for me here, not a recommendation. Financial holding company with operations in advertising and insurance, sometimes compared to an early stage . Been public for only a couple of years. Market cap of $500 million, little bit over. Small-cap stock, for sure. Run by two guys who are co-president, co-chairman, co-CEO. It's a billboard company. 52% of the company's assets are billboards. They have 2,900 billboard structures, and they also have an insurance business that primarily writes surety policies. Reasonable valuation at only 1.6X book value.Steve, question about Boston Omaha?Where does this name come from? How are Boston and Omaha connected in any way?One of the CEOs lives in Boston, and the other one's in Omaha.Jason Moser, what are you looking at?Yeah, well, you know it probably as the PDF company. I am taking a look here at , ticker ADBE. Actually looking at it for my augmented reality service here. They have a new product called Adobe Arrow, which is allowing designers to design and share augmented reality experiences. So a neat part of the business that's starting to grow out. But you've already got this really well-established subscription business that, I mean, it's brought us to a $140 billion market cap at this point. Subscription revenue is the overwhelming driver for the business, and those subscriptions go anywhere from one month to 36 months and everywhere in between. So, just, I like the trend toward digital media. And the stock, while it's at 35X free cash flow today, it's a company that deserves that premium, I think.Steve, question about\u00a0Adobe? We use a ton of Adobe products. I'm recording on Adobe Audition right now. Do you think there's any way that they will unwind the subscription thing? A lot of producers and media folks don't like having to pay a monthly fee.Understanding that's the case, I have a hard time seeing that they would actually do that because it really does help drive a lot of money for them to continue to invest in that business and provide us with better tools to produce this awesome content that we're bringing to our members and listeners every week.Emily Flippen, what are you looking at?Well, I'm looking at the largest shopping day in the entire world, and no, Black Friday has not come early. This is Singles Day on Monday, 11/11. Singles Day in China launches. One company I think is poised to benefit well from that is , ticker BZUN. Often called the of China, although that's not a one-to-one comparison, Baozun helps manage the e-commerce presences for international and domestic brands in China.Steve, question about Baozun?Do you think we'll see a big spike in this stock once this trade war stuff gets resolved?I think it's possible, although Baozun has admittedly relatively limited influence with the trade war. It'll be interesting to see, though, if the Chinese economy slowdown affects Singles Day at all.What do you want to add to your watch list, Steve?\u00a0Well, I own Adobe, and I think I would add more because I just love that. Alright, Ron Gross, Jason Moser, Emily Flippen, thanks for being here! That'll do it for this week's show! Our engineer is Steve Broido. Our producer is Mac Greer. I'm Chris Hill.

One of those is the travel industry, as it's sensitive to both consumer vacation spending and business travel activity. And while a recession hasn't made itself manifest, a slowdown for the economy could still be a contentious event.That has shown up in '  numbers this year. Growth has tapped the brakes, but the leading online travel agent and merchant platform is still doing just fine. In fact, in spite of signs of slowdown, the company still sees plenty of travel-related activity going on around the globe. No recession here ... yet.Gross bookings -- the total value of travel services and accommodations booked on one of the company's sites, including Booking.com, Agoda, Priceline, KAYAK, and OpenTable -- increased 4% to $25.3 billion in the third quarter. When excluding the effects of negative foreign currency exchange rates, gross bookings grew 7%.Image source: Getty Images.While not the double-digit increase in years past, it's in line with what management has been telling investors to expect for some time. After all, this is by far the world's largest travel booking company. Plus, the company has had numerous headwinds to overcome this year, including the U.S. government shutdown that kicked off 2019, general political turmoil around the globe, a strong U.S. dollar compared to other currencies (which reduces revenue when the currency is converted to greenbacks), and generally higher competition from upstarts as a developing world economy becomes increasingly mobile.Nevertheless, management said the average consumer around the globe is healthy and still making trips. Gross bookings in Q3 equated to a 4% increase in revenue, and earnings per share adjusted for one-time items surged 20% higher. Paired with the first half of 2019, Booking is putting together another solid run.Data source: Booking Holdings.Of course, not all was perfect. While the average consumer appears to be unbothered by global economic uncertainty, there were areas of weakness. Specifically, Europe continued to be a sluggish performer, as was China (slowing economic growth) and Hong Kong (due to the ongoing political demonstrations against China).Still, Booking's business is a small percentage of the total global travel industry. But simply opening up a travel website doesn't cut it anymore. Booking is pushing the  concept hard -- a one-stop shop for all of a traveler's needs. Interwebsite cooperation is paying off as Booking and its myriad of services -- covering travel, accommodation, food, and experience arrangements -- integrate with each other to unify a vacationer's trip.One example of a new way Booking is moving the needle in this regard is with its Grab partnership, the Southeast Asia ridesharing service. Grab is using Agoda.com and Booking.com to link hotel and accommodation listings on its app, helping those catching a ride find a place to stay as well. A similar partnership is going on with ridesharing service Didi Chuxing in China. Though small right now, apparently the integrations are paying off. Management said it wants to replicate these deals in other parts of the world, adding yet another type of transportation service to its repertoire.Booking Holdings is thus undeterred by chatter of a possible recession on the horizon.

Go ahead, gentlemen. -- Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.We executed well in our busiest quarter of the year as we booked 223 million or almost a quarter of a billion room nights, which is up 11% year-over-year and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. We are pleased that room night growth has been reasonably consistent this year. We produced over $5 billion in revenue and approximately $2.5 billion in EBITDA, which are year-over-year increases of approximately 7% and 8% respectively on a constant currency basis.While we believe these financial results show that we have meaningful size and scale, we note that against a very large global travel market opportunity, we are still a small share of the marketplace, which means we have substantial opportunity in front of us. I am pleased that our performance this quarter delivered better-than-expected room night growth, driven by solid growth in our direct channel, though I note that we continue to witness slower growth in our pay channels. And while we look to find ways to drive growth through the pay channels, we will remain disciplined and will invest only if we like the quality of traffic and the associated return on investment.We remained firmly in execution mode as we work to deliver against our goal of extending our lead in core accommodations market through key initiatives in customer acquisition, merchandising, our payment platform and improving the selection of properties on our websites. We expect these initiatives to improve customer conversion and drive incremental growth from our existing demand channels. We continue to execute against our long-term strategy of building the connected trip with Booking.com recently launching a fleet offering in certain European countries. The launch is still in its very early days and we will continue to make product enhancements and improve the customer experience to create what we believe will be a better offering over time.We remain excited as our long-term vision of the connected trip is being translated into new Booking.com services. We believe the connected trip has tremendous potential to create a more robust travel ecosystem that will result in greater loyalty and engagement for Booking.com's very large active customer base and it is an opportunity for our large supplier base to merchandise their offerings.In conjunction with priceline.com, agoda has also launched a flight product that is initially focused on select countries in the APAC markets, which we believe will complement its existing accommodations offering. I am proud of our inter-brand cooperation development of this product, which demonstrates how we are able to leverage our deep travel expertise across our company to build new services. We look forward to introducing other areas of collaboration across the brands in the future.We are also excited to announce our partnership with Grab is now showing tangible benefits to our customers. One of the goals of the partnership is to give Booking.com app users access to the largest fleet of drivers across eight countries in Southeast Asia, providing our customers traveling in these countries a frictionless experience removing language and currency barriers. Right now Booking.com app users can access Grab services in Singapore. And we will be expanding this service to Indonesia and Thailand by the end of the year and to the remaining markets by early 2020. Another point to note about the partnership is Grab previously introduced a connection to hotel bookings through its own Grab app using both agoda and Booking.com.In our alternative accommodations business, Booking.com continues to build richer content for both its customers and supply partners. Booking.com recently announced a series of new tools and product enhancements specifically designed to help professional short-term rental partners more effectively market and simplify the day-to-day management of their properties on Booking.com's platform. In terms of our listings count, Booking.com's total alternative accommodation listings now stand at over 6.2 million as of September 30, a key goal continues to be improving both the quality and variety of our listings in this area. We are encouraged with the progress in alternative accommodations business and continue to witness growth outpacing our overall business, while maintaining solid profitability.In regards to the overall global travel market, we believe it is generally healthy, but see some mixed results in geographies throughout the world. Europe remains stable, but is still impacted by somewhat sluggish GDP growth, which is consistent with what we have seen throughout most of the year. Southeast Asia continues to grow nicely. However, markets like China and particularly Hong Kong are placing pressure on our overall growth rate due to certain macro events. International travel to the United States has been negatively impacted by a strong dollar. Like this year has shown though, our global scale has helped us navigate a tricky macro environment and we remain confident that we will continue to do so in the future.In conclusion, I am very pleased with our performance in the third quarter and we remain confident that the efforts we are making now will support the long-term growth prospects of the company. I want to thank our over 26,000 employees for their hard work and dedication during the busy third quarter, providing unparalleled service to both our customers and supplier partners around the world.I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden for the detailed financial review. -- Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the third quarter and then discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.Now for our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 11% for the quarter exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Our room night growth in Europe continues to exceed our expectations this quarter despite a macro environment that remains cautious. Room night growth rates for the rest of the world also exceeded our expectations and grew approximately in line with Europe in Q3. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were down about 3% year-over-year in Q3 on a constant currency basis, which was a large decline than our guidance of down about 2.5%. The year-on-year ADR decline was impacted by decreases in rates within several key markets such as the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong as well as an increased mix to faster growing lower ADR markets. The increase in pressure on ADRs as seen in the second half of the year is influenced by lapping about a 1% growth in ADRs in the second half of last year and by a number of macroeconomic driven factors including less travel in key international cargos due to trade and political issues as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar.Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q3 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately three percentage points versus last year. We estimate that changes in FX rates impacted gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and EPS growth in Q3 by a similar amount. Q3 gross bookings grew by 4% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 7% on a constant currency basis, coming in above the high-end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $5 billion and grew by 4% in U.S. dollars and about 7% on a constant currency basis. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable grew by 12% in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $2.5 billion, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance range and was up 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and about 8% on a constant currency basis.Proposed marketing expense declined 2% year-over-year, which helped drive leverage of about 150 basis points in the quarter. This leverage was driven by an increased mix in room nights from the direct channel, which continues to grow faster than our pay channels. While we'll keep working to grow our direct channel over time, we continue to see performance marketing channels as an efficient way to acquire customers and we will maintain our approach to spend rationally in these channels.We spent $124 million on brand marketing in the quarter, which represented a decline of 22% versus Q3 last year, contributing about 80 basis points of leverage. As we mentioned on our Q2  in August, we are refining and focusing our brand spend in the second half of this year. Sales and other expense grew 13% versus Q3 of last year and contributed about 50 basis points of deleverage, mainly due, primarily due to the growth of our payment platform at Booking.com. Sales and other grew slower than merchant gross bookings of 36% in the quarter due to lower growth in certain payment-related expenses. Personnel expense came in slightly lower than our forecast and contributed a small amount of deleverage in the quarter.Finally, G&A expenses increased 41% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. Note that non-GAAP G&A expenses in Q3 last year excluded a $23 million travel transaction tax charge which negatively impacted GAAP results in the prior year. Non-GAAP G&A expenses contributed about 120 basis points of deleverage in the quarter, driven by a $29 million year-to-date impact from the French digital services digital services tax as well as an additional $10 million related to travel transaction taxes from prior periods. Our non-GAAP EPS was $45.36, up 20% versus the prior year. Adjusted for currency, non-GAAP EPS grew about 24% in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 18.8% in Q3, which is lower than the prior year due to a provision of the tax act which was clarified in Q4 of last year. Our 10% lower share count in Q3 benefited EPS in the quarter.On a GAAP basis, operating income increased by 5% and GAAP operating margin increased by 70 basis points compared to Q3 last year. Q3 GAAP net income amounted to $1.95 billion or $45.54 per share, up 23% from Q3 2018. Our Q3 GAAP net income includes $49[Phonetics] million of pre-tax unrealized losses on our equity investments in Ctrip and Meituan and $72 million of FX remeasurement gains on our Eurobonds. We excluded these unrealized losses and remeasurement gains from our non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of 17.5% for the quarter, which decreased from 21.1% in the prior year due to beneficial adjustments made in Q3 2019 related to the tax act that was excluded from our non-GAAP results and from the factors I mentioned that impacted non-GAAP tax rates.In Q3, we generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow, which decreased 6% compared to Q3 last year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.8 billion, which decreased by 4% compared to the prior year, mainly due to seasonal effects from a higher mix of merchant revenues and the impact this has in the third quarter due to a high concentration of check-ins. During the course of the year, we expect the growth of our merchant business will be a modest positive driver of cash flow. We purchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q3, bringing the amount remaining under our $15 billion repurchase authorization to about $12.9 billion at the end of the quarter. We continue to expect to complete this authorization in the next two to three years, assuming stable business and market conditions. We ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in cash and investments and $8.6 billion of outstanding debt.Before turning to our guidance, we note that the returns from our growth investments for the year are tracking in line with what we said last quarter and we still expect these investments to impact EBITDA growth for the full year by a few percentage points.Let's now turn our attention to Q4 guidance. Foreign exchange rates are expected to negatively impact year-over-year growth rates for gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS by approximately 1.5 percentage points. We use a dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.11 when setting our Q4 guidance. Our Q4 outlook does not anticipate any change in the macro environments. Based on where we are in the quarter and looking at all other factors, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 6% to 8% in Q4. We forecast gross bookings to grow 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis in about 150 basis points less in U.S. dollars. Our Q4 forecast assumes constant currency ADRs for the company will be down about 4% driven by the same factors that impacted Q3 ADRs.A number of these factors are occurring in Asia and Asia is a seasonally larger quota in Q3. We forecast Q4 revenue to be up 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis and by about 150 basis points less in U.S. dollars. Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.21 billion and $1.235 billion, which is approximately flat year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We are forecasting continued leverage from the performance marketing expense line in Q4, reflecting lower volumes in pay channels, our continued focus on acquiring high quality traffic. We expect to see continued leverage of brand spend in Q4. Although we've reduced our brand spending in the second half of the year, we still expect to grow our brand spend for the full year.We expect growth in personnel expenses to reduce EBITDA growth by several percentage points in the quarter due to unexpected lower year-end reversal of bonus accruals than we experienced last Q4. Sales and other expense is expected to grow slower than merchant bookings growth, but faster than overall revenue growth. We are forecasting Q4 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $21.50 to $22 even. Normalizing for constant currency, we estimate Q4 non-GAAP EPS to decrease year-over-year by approximately 1% to 3%. This range for Q4 implies a full year constant currency non-GAAP EPS growth rate of about 13%, which is in line with our full year expectation for low double-digit growth.Our non-GAAP EPS forecast for Q4 includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 19%, which is significantly higher than Q4 last year due to one-time adjustment of approximately $72 million in Q4 2018 related to a provision of the tax act that was clarified by regulatory guidance issued in Q4 of 2018. If we exclude the one-time benefit from Q4 last year, our EPS growth in the quarter will be about 7% higher. We expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19% compared with 18.3% last year. Our Q4 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of approximately 42.2 million shares, which is 9% below Q4 of last year.We forecast GAAP EPS between $20.40 and $20.90 for Q4. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a tax rate of approximately 19%. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBIT, EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuations in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.We will now take your questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks. Two questions please. Could you talk about whether you're seeing any pressures in SCO channels whether that's become less viable for you as a source of traffic? And then, Glenn, you talked about paid marketing channels and trying to diversify among them. Could you talk about how you do that. I know this is something that the company has looked to do for many years. Just how many options are there in order to do that? Thanks a lot. -- Hi, Mark. Well, regarding SCO, we saw some headwinds in the SCO channel did create some modest pressure, but it's a small channel for us. Your second question, I wasn't quite following. I don't recall saying something. So could you say that again? -- I think early on you talked about paid leads were coming in a little more slowly than maybe you would want it or that less ideal. I think this is something that for a while you've been looking for faster channels or paid, high quality paid leads. Can you just talk about whether your ability to find those. How do you find faster growth paid leads? -- Yeah. Okay, I see where you're coming. Actually what we said, I know I figured out what you're saying. We've talked about this for some time that there has been a deceleration of the pay channels that's been going on for a long time. Now we'd like to obviously find -- we'd like to find more customers from those channels. My point being more importantly that no matter what we're doing, we're going to try and maintain our discipline and only do it when we see the right ROIs. There's obviously lots of things that I want always work to improve their paid channels, particularly in terms of trying to increase conversion is the primary thing you can do. And there are also things and looking out in different ways where we want to shift the money among the different paid channels. These are dynamic markets, as you know. And what we do will influence what other people do. So it's always a bit of the strategy gain going on. But you've seen our results so far and we're pleased with where we are right now with the pay channels. -- Okay. Thanks, Glenn.Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays Capital. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking the question. So first, what is driving the outperformance in the Europe room night growth versus your expectations. The macro data points, at least if you look at the industry third party sources appear to be sluggish and also the commentary from suppliers kind of seem to be the same. Is there a counter cyclicality aspects that's benefiting your room night growth or would you just attribute it to better execution during the quarter? And then the second question sounds like the partnership is -- drive is off to a good start and is doing really well. How are you planning to replicate similar strategies in some of the developed markets. Are there more broader partnership-based opportunities that you would look at that? Thank you very much. -- Sure. So I don't think we're in the area of counter cyclicality yet. We mentioned at the beginning that we see the travel industry in general around the world, I used the word generally healthy. So we're not in an area of recession that we then stimulate some type of counter cyclicality. So I think your other point of good execution, I'd like to ascribe a lot of that just to good execution and give a shout out to our 26,000 employees who are executing very, very well.In regards to the Grab partnership, I agree I'm pleased with what we're doing there. I like what's happening there. It's obviously very small still, but it's growing and going the right way. And as you know, about the same time we made a deal with DD. And I mentioned, we're going to bring that went out similarly in the sense of being able to provide a seamless frictionless ground transportation solution for our customers in China and other places where DD operates over time. And also the other way, the same with Grab is being able to expose our offerings of hotel accommodations, home accommodation, all the other things that we're going to offer to the very, very large customer base that DD has.And of course, what we want to do is go out and replicate that in other parts of the world with other players and that's what our affiliate or strategic partnership teams are going out and doing and I'm pleased with the progress they're making in that area. -- Okay. Thanks, Glenn.Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks a lot. So it seems like you've last few quarters been settling into a nice kind of stable growth rate recently on nights and top-line. So with that as a backdrop, can you tell us how you're thinking about investment in non-ad operating expenses as you move forward into 2020? Thanks. -- We've talked in the past about the importance to grow our business, having a balance between the amount of money that we're going to invest to help grow out the future, at the same time maintaining discipline to provide an appropriate bottom-line return for our shareholders. We're just continue to do that and that's the way we do it. And we've talked many times about some of the things that we want to build. We've talked a lot about the connected trip and how we see in the long run, that's the winner for us the differentiator the thing that will make customers come back because they will see a better experience, improve the loyalty, lower the amount of money that we have to spend on the advertising spend. These are all things that we are continuing to work on and we're going to maintain that balance. -- Okay. Thanks, Glenn. And then just a quick follow up on Mark's question about SCO. You mentioned, it's a small channel for you, can you help us put a finer point on that. Is it safe to assume that SCO is a single-digit percentage of your overall revenue? Thanks. -- I think I'm going to stick with my qualitative term, small. -- All right. Thanks, Glenn.Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks. Two, if I can. First, Glenn, you all have made couple of investments in rideshare companies over in Asia, you've got a good history of leveraging M&A. Any interest in making more investments in the rideshare space. There is some public public assets on sale, would it make sense to use some of your capital to do more in the rideshare space?And then secondly on the payment side, I think you all have said it's kind of shifted from a drag to neutral and then eventually it will be a tailwind to EBITDA next year. Can you kind of talk about how that will flow through the P&L. Is that just basically higher effective revenue as you start to charge for payments more broadly, offsetting the cost? And then what kind of profit center do you see payments becoming as the merchant business scales over the next few years and get your rhythm on the payment side? -- Well, in regards to the first question, I think we're all familiar that we don't discuss potential M&A transactions publicly. So I'll have to pass on that one. And I'm going to pass over to Dave in terms of talk about how the funds flows work and why the numbers will be what they will be. -- Yeah. Lloyd, on the payment side, as you know, there are many moving parts. There are multiple different aspects of revenue in the payment stream and there are multiple aspects of costs. And essentially as we've discussed, we've been using this both to help the business and as a marketing tool, but also building the all the mechanics then to be able to optimize both sides of that equation, revenue and cost as the payment platform builds. So next year, we do expect payments compared to this year should be a contributor to EBITDA growth. And it will come from both sides, both the higher revenue recovery and also through better cost efficiency as you roll the platform out, as we generate more scale, as we continue to refine the underlying structure of the product.As we just -- as we said long-term, we certainly view that it can be not only a contributor to EBITDA growth, but also a profit center, but we don't want to quantify that right now. And as we go into next year, we'll probably give you a little bit more color as to how the payments business has progressed as a percentage of our mix, but it's continuing to increase nicely from the approximately 10% of Booking.com we talked about in 2018.Your next question comes from the line of the Naved Khan of SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Yeah. Thanks a lot. Just a couple. So I think, Glenn, in passing you had mentioned that maybe the Hong Kong and rest and maybe some travel restrictions in parts of Asia were a drag on the growth. I would think that having a global business like yours, people basically switch destinations if want to travel. So on the whole are you seeing that as still a drag, how does that play out? And then on the connected experience side, I guess you're testing this on the ARR bookings in Europe with one or two partners. How does -- how do these partners kind of different from KAYAK in terms of how they go to market with you? -- So the first one, you're absolutely correct in terms of a global company like ours, we do get some benefit when one particular area becomes a place that people don't want to travel to. There will be a certain portion that will shift to another place and we will get that business. That being said, another percentage of that business will unfortunately not travel, they had a specific reason to travel that region or they just decided that they just didn't want to travel I would say on what they wanted to do and now they're not going to do it. So there is a drag even though we are global. And I'll point out that some of the areas which we mentioned in the last Q are still going on.The China outbound to the U.S. is still down from where it was a couple of years ago. That is a drag. We had good business there. Certainly, we've all seen on TV what's going on in the Hong Kong and that also is a drag on the economy. And there are other places like that. So while we enjoy the benefits of a global business, there is no doubt that we would do better without these types of problems.In regards to your other question about ARR in Europe, we have been experimenting with lots of different ways KAYAK is one of the ways in the past, we had a click out to part of a company called key Traveli that was -- their offerings called Gotogate. And we now have a more accomplished, more fulsome relationship with Traveli in doing a much more true integrated seamless type ARR product. The difference between doing a matter with KAYAK and having actually integrated as a true OTA offering enable us as the connected trip. You see it was all that data that we get from the actual conversion, all the booking data, all the things the person is doing to be able to offer them some seamless and we like to talk about holistic offering. So one of the benefits something like this is you can offer connected trip car rental or other types of ground transportation much more efficiently.And I would point out just as a separate and this is not related to the ARR product because that is relatively recent. But one of the things I'd like to see, I like that we've seen recently is what's going on in our rental cars business. And if you look at the statistical summary at the end of our release, you'll see that this recent quarter, we've had a nice uptick in that car rental and that is partially due to the connected trip what we are now offering that car rental much more connected with our Booking.com accommodations customers. So that's another one of those instances where I see the connected trip become -- beginning to come to fruition and see what we really can do. -- That's great. Thanks guys.Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Glenn, I have two. So the first one, sort of a bigger picture question to you. You sort of talked about how you're witnessing slower growth in paid channels for a little while now. You guys look at so much data, you have such good visibility into the market, why do you think that's happening. Is it because you're seeing a deceleration in people coming online and why is that happening, are you seeing fewer clicks to bid for. What do you think is driving this and what do you think could cause a reacceleration in paid channels over time? And then the second one on the alternative accommodation business. Any update or help on sort of how big that business is now and how to think about its contribution to growth from a room night perspective? Thanks. -- So talking about the pay channels, certainly as people went online years ago, there is a much larger number of people I think who were particularly in the area that we really have some more sweet spot, to Europe and other developed areas. We jumped online when they went to these pay channels. A lot of those people are already there. Now you start going to other areas is the world, people are going online, but they may not perhaps go to some of our traditional pay channel areas.I'll give you a perfect example. We talk a lot about China is a great opportunity for us for the long run. Google does not operate in China. So all those new people coming online to buy travel, we've got to find another way to get them. So there would be an example and there are other places like that. So I think that's probably the primary reason for it.Whether or not this will reaccelerate, let me know if Google is going to start having a full service in China, in other areas. That's one of the things that we know it's in the end what's most important for us to get customers to come to us directly. We've talked about this a lot in the past is one of the things I think is very important for us to have our own future is to create a service that is so wonderful so good that people just naturally will come back to us directly. And we will not be dependent on other -- we will not be as dependent on other sources of traffic. What was your second question? -- Then alternative combination, sort of how to think about, any help on it. It's sizing from a room night perspective or contribution to growth in the quarter? -- Well, we continue to talk about it grows faster than our core hotel business and we're pleased about that. In terms of actual sizing, we gave you some data a couple of quarters ago, we're not updating that right now. And in terms of the overall industry, I mean there is a lot of data around the world and I'll save the swing from the people who give the lowest estimates to the people with the highest estimates is a pretty wide range. So I wouldn't even attempt to try and come up with which one or where is the exact true number. We know it's a big business and we know it's an area that's important for us for the future and that's why we continue to devote time, resources and money to it. -- Great. Thanks Glenn.Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- So Glenn, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit about how the operating environment in Southeast Asia may be changing especially as it regards to agoda, I mean you've been there for some time now and it seems like around you online connectivity, adoption of e-commerce and payment frictions are all coming down in the region which we can see if we should service tailwinds. Are there any structural constraints that you can see that may slow the rate of adoption of online travel in the region? And secondarily, just wondering how the consumers there behave. Is there a greater propensity to buy packaged products versus hotels and air ticket separately, which may be informing your decision to I guess invest in what is more of an intermodal product? Thanks. -- So I would say that Asia in general is one of the opportunities for us for a very, very long time to continue to build out our business and have good growth. And one of the ways one could look at that is Boeing and Airbus both put together some very detailed project -- 10 year projections I believe, they are even further perhaps. And you just look at the number of planes that they are going to expect to be delivered there. Another way you could do is look at the number of airports being built in the region. And those things all show that travel is going to continue to be a growth industry in that part of the world, one.Two, the different ways that people buy in Asia and Asia is obviously somewhat of a generic term, it's different in different countries. What's happening in Japan is very different than let's say what's happening in Vietnam. But there are some similarities that I would say that we look at, and one is that price is very, very important. It is a very competitive world out there in terms of price. Also interesting, and I think we're all familiar with this is that many people who are just coming online are skipping desktop entirely. Everything is lived on the phone and that's very, very important.The next thing is the super apps that are prevalent there are very important in terms of how you're going to try and get busy. If you're not part of one you're at a disadvantage. I would also say that it's not just the super apps, but you see people who go to many different apps to compare price because price [Indecipherable] actually download numerous different travel apps and then go through each one. Not the most effective or efficient way to find out what the lowest price is, but people do do that. These things are really important. And I would say that it's something we're going to continue to do. David, anything else you -- David, do you want to add anything? -- Yeah. The only thing I'd add is that while alternative payment methods is certainly something that's a function, that's happening. You see happening around around the world, you see more of them in Asia and the ability to transaction in multiple currencies pay-in pay-out in different currencies, particularly pay-in. So the travel point of view in alternative payment methods is a factor that is more prevalent in Asia than elsewhere. -- Absolutely correct. I mean people in the developed areas of the world use credit cards, people in developing worlds are using all different payment products and it's very important that we be able to use every single one because our customers are used to using those, they want to use those. And if we don't have them, they will go somewhere else. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Thank you. A couple of questions. It looks like pretty good ad leverage in the quarter. Just how do you feel about the advertising situation as you look forward as far as your ability to drive direct traffic and need to spend and maybe ramp up the brand campaign again? And then second on ADRs, obviously a headwind in Q4. Are there any events or areas that really showed an inflection in ADR growth and something that would tell you this is very temporary and could rebound. Just wondering how to think about that for 2020? Thank you. -- So I'll talk about the advertising, David could talk about ADRs. So in terms of brand advertising and I've talked about this in the last quarter. I would like us to be doing better. We are not spending as much at the beginning of the year I may have thought we would have. But as I've always said, we're going to be careful with our shareholders' money. We're not going to spend blindly. We're going to always test and learn. And if I don't see the results that we want them, we're not going to spend until we get it right. So I'm a little disappointed where we are. That being said, it's OK. It's not terrible. It's just not as great as I would like it to be.I am very pleased that we have a new CMO at Booking.com, he has been there for just a few months. And I am looking forward to working with him very closely to [Indecipherable] we've made a creative and better campaigns in a way that we will achieve greater results for our brand marketing. And that brand marketing is not only TV brand marketing, it's video, it's all the different things that one does in terms of producing a good brand campaign and I'm looking forward to doing this going forward. -- Yeah, Justin. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a little bit more color on what's going on with ADRs because there are a number of factors, I mentioned a couple in my prepared remarks, but let me give you a little bit more flavor. So in the third quarter, constant currency, we saw about 3% decline, in the fourth quarter we're expecting about 4%. When we look at that, about half of that decline is due to lower rates in key countries. And the ones I call out would be U.S., Japan and Hong Kong being the largest contributor to that piece of it. And about half of the decline is due to a mix shift toward lower ADR countries away from higher ADR countries.Now some of that is affected by macroeconomic factors and those are impacting both rate and mix, and I'll describe what they are and I'll give you a flavor as to how we think they are actually playing out relative to just underlying trends. So for example, less China into the U.S. is impacting ADRs in the U.S. with less inbound international travel. So is less and less expensive travel from Europe into the U.S. due to the strong dollar. So factors driving U.S. ADRs on the right level. Less travel from South Korea into Japan is impacting ADRs in Japan. And of course travel into Hong Kong generally is down considerably that impacts both occupancies and ADRs there. But these economic factors are also impacting mix as well, it will impact -- they impact mix with less travel into higher ADR markets I mentioned U.S. and Hong Kong and more travel to some of the lower ADR markets, for example, other markets in Southeast Asia.So you can put it all together and their manufacturers are impacting these global ADRs. It's difficult to be exactly precise, but we estimate about half of what we're seeing in the second half of this year is driven by external macro factors and about half of it is due just to underlying changes in our business. And remember also, we're comparing against two quarters where we saw unusual ADR increases last year. So you kind of put all that together and you say, adjusted for that compare, our constant currency ADRs are down about 2% in Q3, about 3% in Q4, about half of that we can attribute to macro external factors that should normalize over time. -- Great. Thank you, David. Thank you, Glenn.Another question from the line of Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I just wanted to ask if anything has changed just in terms of your role as you're Booking.com CEO as opposed to the CEO of the overall group, if anything has changed or just how you're thinking about the business? And then any early learnings around the flight offerings in some of the newer geographies that you're in? Thanks. -- So I'll answer the second one first. The flight thing is so early, it's literally just a couple of what we -- there is nothing to be said about that yet, but I hope to be able to talk more about it in the future. In regards to the new role being both the CEO of Booking Holdings and Booking.com, we talked about that in the last call and one of the things I pointed out was because of my experience and bring all the companies are part of this organization in to be part of what was originally just priceline.com and knowing all the management teams and knowing what's good and what needs some help and where the strengths and weaknesses are personalize the management teams, I felt that I would have a better opportunity to try and bring together the company closer and help us work more efficiently with all of our assets. And I'm pleased to say that I love the way things are beginning to come out the way is good for our customers and our suppliers and our shareholders too. And I pointed out in my prepared remarks that agoda and priceline working together created that flight offering for agoda right now.And I mentioned a little bit of the nice thing that we're seeing in our car rental business where by integrating rental cars into the Booking.com operation, beginning to see some upticks there. I can go on and on and we're going to do -- I mentioned that we're going to have more of this cooperation come up with new services because the connected trip requires us to be able to use all of our assets together. I've always talked about the reason OpenTable was not because we just wanted to have a reservation system, a restaurant reservation system, but because we know every single customer traveling needs to find a place to eat because they're not eating at home. And by putting these things together, all the data we have from the Travelport, all the things we know about what they like in terms of where they like to eat at home from OpenTable and creating merchandise offerings to these customers in a holistic seamless way is just a much, much better experience than going from site-to-site-to-site.We have a center in Tel Aviv that has a whole bunch of machine learning experts, AI geniuses who are coming up with different ways to put together the different offerings. And we're going to continue to push that forward and that will create. And I said it earlier tonight about the differentiated service that will be able to bring people back with more loyalty, to enjoy a better experience that is being experienced before. That's what I'm so excited about. And seeing it to start come to fruition is just thrilling. -- Great. Thank you.Another question from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open. -- Thanks so much. Maybe a few follow ups on some of the topics you've talked about on the call tonight. In terms of avenues of investment on the marketing side, how are you differentiating between driving desktop traffic versus mobile traffic and within mobile web versus app and where you're seeing the highest ROI as you think about some of those channels across investing versus driving conversion?And then going one layer below to conversion, what is sort of the big differentiators you're seeing that drive higher conversion when you do see traffic to your properties. Is it the payments mechanism, is it depth of inventory, especially shared accommodations or is it some of what you talked about on the experiences of the local side that might be areas where you want to invest additional layers to drive more conversion as we look out not only end of this year, but out over the next couple of years? Thanks so much guys. -- Well, we're not going to disclose much in terms of where we're putting the marketing money and which ones are giving us the best ROIs, I think you'll understand our reticence to do that. in terms of conversion, I haven't actually done -- look at the data, but I'm going to make a bet that the thing that gives the highest conversion is having a great price. That's probably the number one thing that you can improve, conversion which offer a better price. I'm not sure how much more detail I can really go into, I'll differ. If there's anything you want to add, David? -- No. I mean conversions are multi-faceted facts. I mean obviously people look for choice, they look for companies, they look for support, they look for quality reviews, they look for just the quality and the trust of the site and the products and there's a lot of good data science that goes on behind testing all those and they all have a factor. Good news is that there are many levers that we can pull to continue to improve conversion. And as Glenn said, price and value is a key ones of all. -- And I'll just -- with what Dave said. And one of the things again that you'll -- that we do do and I think it is one of the advantages of being a very large player who can afford lots of data scientists and there's been a lot of money in trying to figure out what is the best personalization for a traveler and whether this person has come before or even not, but we know something about cohort to be able to really offer them something that is what they want to buy and that's something that's very important because if you just throw up a search result that has no relevance to what they really want, you're not going to get much of a conversion. But because of the data we have, we have more data probably than most any other travel player around, we use that in a way to make sure that we're offering up to our customer what they want and that's how you can help create that higher conversion. They're happier, it was an easy way for them to get what they wanted that builds the loyalty, they come back, we get more data.And again, circling back to the connected trip, the more we learn about our customer, the more we're able to then present to them all the things they wanted to know. If it's a leisure trip, what other things to they need. If it's a business trip, what things do they need. And that is just such an advantage of a smaller player and it's an advantage over any individual supplier in the travel ecosystem because they only see a small portion in their data of what the person was. So even the largest hotel chain doesn't know anything about their customer in terms of what sort of ground transportation they wants or what sort of restaurant reservations they like to make or what kind of air they generally want to do and what kind of attractions they want. That's the advantage that a full OTA like us has. -- Great. Thank you.Another question from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. Glenn, I guess at some level this is a little bit more of a philosophical question, but it relates to the answer that you gave on the brand ad spend question. But you grew revenues 4% this quarter, it wasn't that long ago that the company was growing 25% given the margins you're generating and what you're spending on buybacks, it's clearly not a question of resources. Are the incremental returns on investment that bad, are you OK with long-term growth at these levels or is there a path back to 20% growth that you could see the company getting to? -- Well, I don't want to go to any specific number, but I do believe that it's important we create services that people want to come back and that we can accelerate, I'd like to do that, that's part of the reason we're making these investments. And I think in the long run, the thing is creating that great service that gets us loyalty from the people who currently come and keep coming and then creating that brand marketing if you'll know about this better system and come to us and then use it. It's one of those things that in these network economies that when you create something that really is differential and better, the uptick can be very, very rapid. So hopefully, and I believe we will be able to do this, creating these better services, creating this better experience, being able to provide an opportunity for all of our suppliers, this incredible breadth of suppliers and all different parts of the travel ecosystem offering them an opportunity to reach out to our customers in this merchandising ways, different packages, different types of prices, different types of value and being able to present it to on the other hand our demand side, which is so huge make it so much better that then create that flywheel effect and start cranking up again, that's what I'd like to see. -- Okay. And is there -- is it -- I mean anything you can add just sort of on what you are seeing in terms of the incremental returns in the areas of investment, I mean particularly on brand advertising this as a percentage of sales, this is the lowest you've spent in I think nearly three years given how important you've called out driving direct traffic is. I guess I'm just surprised that you haven't tried to push that a little bit further? -- Well, I guess -- and you asked for philosophically and I'll go back to that then. Philosophically I'm against wasting money. And I want to make sure that we're getting the return for the money we spend. And again, our brand campaigns are fine, they're just not as good as I'd like them to be. So when I say I'm disappointed, I'm not saying the return, I want the same [Indecipherable] there could be. Some of the brand health metrics that we've seen have been good, some have not been as good. I am very excited though about our new CMO. He had nothing to do with the old campaigns, these are new things that we're working on now and I'm looking forward to seeing some good results in the future with him. -- Okay, great. Thanks, Glenn.Next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Thanks guys. You talked to these questions, but maybe I just want to parse out a little differently. David, you highlighted direct traffic is growing faster than paid. And Glenn, you talked to the importance of number of times on the call, the importance and the continued focus on direct traffic. How would you assess the magnitude and/or the quality of your direct traffic and the initiatives that you're exercising there. How much runway or leverage do you feel you have to execute against getting more direct traffic into you? Thank you. -- Brian, in terms of just quantification, I mean just to recap, I think everybody knows us, but we've been clear that for a while direct traffic has continued, has been over 50% of our bookings and continues to increase from that data point. So that's where it is from a sizing point of view and continues to move nicely each quarter. I don't think we have -- for the capital where we think that can go. There will always be a mix. We think that's, as we said, the performance channels, albeit growing more slowly are very efficient way for us to capture new customers and we like what we see there. When we see growth opportunities, we lean into them and we think it's a combination of both. And of course as Glenn said, the more we build, the better flywheel, the better the conversion will be from those performance led customers into direct customers and repeat customers. So that's the way the business have operates, but it's not really a lot of new data to give you other than reiterate the points that we've already made. -- Great. Thank you, David.Next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on one. In the U.S., I mean how do you view the opportunity of sort of getting more for by owner or that last year that inventory that's a little -- has little more friction in bringing that over to your side or would that help your brand campaign in the U.S.? Then any commentary on Ctrip investing in TripAdvisor? Thank you. -- So we talked in the past about how we think we are under index in terms of the single property owner in the U.S. And we know that's an area where we need to add inventory to have a fully competitive source inventory against people who want that type of a place to stay. And we came to work on that, we have, obviously, we have a lot of different ways that we try and bring people on to the site and get -- making less burdensome to have people come on. That's what we're going to continue to do. It's blocking and tackling and we're slowly building it out. So that's the best I can say there. It continues to grow as we continue to add that type of inventory into the website and the inventory.In regards to the Ctrip deal that we saw announced, we continue to create partnerships ourselves. And we have a good partnership with Ctrip and they sell our hotels and we make money, we're happy about that. We also though said agreement with Meituan, which is Ctrip's big competitor and we have good business or have a good relationship with them too and we have a relationship with DD, which is another Chinese player. And we have, as you know, we invested in Grab, as I talked about earlier and we've put an investment into another APAC player Serko down in New Zealand. So we continue to make those kind of investments and partnerships. It is not surprising than our competitors or other people in the space would also be thinking about doing those type of deals, et cetera. And I don't begrudge anybody who wants to improve their own position that is the obligation of any corporation to try and improve their business for their shareholders and I suppose that's what they've done, but I have no details exactly about what the deal is, so I really can't comment on the specifics. -- Thank you.Your last question comes from the line of James Lee of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. -- Question. Glenn, is there any way you can give us an update on your current transition to the merchant business model here and what is the coverage now relative to total market at this point? And maybe help us understand which regions you are seeing success? And do you also expect U.S. hotel partners to adopt this model soon? And just curious given the slowdown in the market, is this business model giving you the price control to help you to be more resilient during the current environment? Thanks. -- Well, let me talk about the resilience about the -- in the travel business in general. In the past when there have been slowdowns, the distributors have achieved greater success because of the need for the suppliers to get more customers. So that is something that we believe will happen again when and if there is a true slowdown. As I pointed out, the industry is still I believe a generally healthy around the world with pockets that we've described earlier.I do believe that in the long run, the growth in the industry will continue to exceed GDP by a few points and that is the way we always play it out. So there's going to be always some ups and downs in the long run. But yes, we may gain a little more when there is a recession and when occupancy rates are very, very high, there obviously is less need for a person, a distributor like us. But in the long run, we will continue to provide greater services and greater benefits to both sides of this two-sided marketplace that will allow us to achieve the success that we think we should. And David, anything about the merchant stuff? -- Yeah. James, on merchant, and obviously just to clarify that the shift we're talking is that kind of rollout of the merchant platform of Booking.com, at agoda and priceline and we do a lot of business on the merchant already today. And we -- Booking.com, we continue to make progress. We have -- we gave you a data point a couple of quarters ago as to how many countries we're live in, we're continuing to add to to that. We're continuing to add merchant capabilities in the U.S. and make those available to a wider range of our property partners here as well. So continuing to grow, as I mentioned earlier, mix increasing from 2018, but we're not going to give you a new data point on that just yet, at some point in time, we'll give you an update.So we're pleased with how that is progressing and we are pleased with how it is giving us some additional flexibility in the business. And of course, it's very important to underpin a lot of what Glenn talks about with the connected trip because if you want to really have a connected trip, you want to also be able to connect in aggregate the way that you pay for that and also be able to do things around packaging, pricing, payments et cetera through an immersion platform provides a mechanism for that as well. So we are pleased with it, it's making progress today and it will be a bigger driver for us in the future. -- All right. If I may ask a follow up question, and Glenn maybe help give us an update on your view on China, I know you've been bullish for a long time now given the fact that looks like global payments happening in China that allow you to work with DD as a way to provide additional service to Chinese consumers domestically. And maybe help us understand what other steps that you're taking to improve your service. Is it more the customer segment type of strategy where you feel you have an edge in certain segment or consumer within China or is it more of the blanket strategy to go after big TAM in China specifically? Thanks. -- So, and we've said this many times, how important China is in the long run. And yes, there is some economic headwinds in China right now that have impacted travel in general there. And certainly, we've talked a little bit earlier about some of the outbound impacts. We have a multi-legged approach and we do everything from building out our own brands there to partnerships with OTAs like see Ctrip or Trip.com as it's now known or Meituan or ground transportation like DD or many other B2B players where there is places where we can get customers. We have almost 1,000 employees in China. We are doing all different types of brand marketing and other ways to trying to get people to see our services and get people to come to us directly or as I just said, we also get customers through the B2B method too.I will emphasize though, China is a very competitive marketplace. And we have to always be trying to create the best services with good prices to be successful there. But we're going to continue to develop and work there because we do know that for the long run, we need to create something that will be something that the customers in China who want to use. And I'm pleased with where we sit right now. And I hope we continue to grow in the future.So thank you, everybody very much. I'd like to say that we're pleased with the quarter. We're excited about the future. And we look forward to talking to you again in the New Year. Thank you very much.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Go ahead, gentlemen. -- Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.We executed well in our busiest quarter of the year as we booked 223 million or almost a quarter of a billion room nights, which is up 11% year-over-year and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. We are pleased that room night growth has been reasonably consistent this year. We produced over $5 billion in revenue and approximately $2.5 billion in EBITDA, which are year-over-year increases of approximately 7% and 8% respectively on a constant currency basis.While we believe these financial results show that we have meaningful size and scale, we note that against a very large global travel market opportunity, we are still a small share of the marketplace, which means we have substantial opportunity in front of us. I am pleased that our performance this quarter delivered better-than-expected room night growth, driven by solid growth in our direct channel, though I note that we continue to witness slower growth in our pay channels. And while we look to find ways to drive growth through the pay channels, we will remain disciplined and will invest only if we like the quality of traffic and the associated return on investment.We remained firmly in execution mode as we work to deliver against our goal of extending our lead in core accommodations market through key initiatives in customer acquisition, merchandising, our payment platform and improving the selection of properties on our websites. We expect these initiatives to improve customer conversion and drive incremental growth from our existing demand channels. We continue to execute against our long-term strategy of building the connected trip with Booking.com recently launching a fleet offering in certain European countries. The launch is still in its very early days and we will continue to make product enhancements and improve the customer experience to create what we believe will be a better offering over time.We remain excited as our long-term vision of the connected trip is being translated into new Booking.com services. We believe the connected trip has tremendous potential to create a more robust travel ecosystem that will result in greater loyalty and engagement for Booking.com's very large active customer base and it is an opportunity for our large supplier base to merchandise their offerings.In conjunction with priceline.com, agoda has also launched a flight product that is initially focused on select countries in the APAC markets, which we believe will complement its existing accommodations offering. I am proud of our inter-brand cooperation development of this product, which demonstrates how we are able to leverage our deep travel expertise across our company to build new services. We look forward to introducing other areas of collaboration across the brands in the future.We are also excited to announce our partnership with Grab is now showing tangible benefits to our customers. One of the goals of the partnership is to give Booking.com app users access to the largest fleet of drivers across eight countries in Southeast Asia, providing our customers traveling in these countries a frictionless experience removing language and currency barriers. Right now Booking.com app users can access Grab services in Singapore. And we will be expanding this service to Indonesia and Thailand by the end of the year and to the remaining markets by early 2020. Another point to note about the partnership is Grab previously introduced a connection to hotel bookings through its own Grab app using both agoda and Booking.com.In our alternative accommodations business, Booking.com continues to build richer content for both its customers and supply partners. Booking.com recently announced a series of new tools and product enhancements specifically designed to help professional short-term rental partners more effectively market and simplify the day-to-day management of their properties on Booking.com's platform. In terms of our listings count, Booking.com's total alternative accommodation listings now stand at over 6.2 million as of September 30, a key goal continues to be improving both the quality and variety of our listings in this area. We are encouraged with the progress in alternative accommodations business and continue to witness growth outpacing our overall business, while maintaining solid profitability.In regards to the overall global travel market, we believe it is generally healthy, but see some mixed results in geographies throughout the world. Europe remains stable, but is still impacted by somewhat sluggish GDP growth, which is consistent with what we have seen throughout most of the year. Southeast Asia continues to grow nicely. However, markets like China and particularly Hong Kong are placing pressure on our overall growth rate due to certain macro events. International travel to the United States has been negatively impacted by a strong dollar. Like this year has shown though, our global scale has helped us navigate a tricky macro environment and we remain confident that we will continue to do so in the future.In conclusion, I am very pleased with our performance in the third quarter and we remain confident that the efforts we are making now will support the long-term growth prospects of the company. I want to thank our over 26,000 employees for their hard work and dedication during the busy third quarter, providing unparalleled service to both our customers and supplier partners around the world.I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden for the detailed financial review. -- Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the third quarter and then discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.Now for our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 11% for the quarter exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Our room night growth in Europe continues to exceed our expectations this quarter despite a macro environment that remains cautious. Room night growth rates for the rest of the world also exceeded our expectations and grew approximately in line with Europe in Q3. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were down about 3% year-over-year in Q3 on a constant currency basis, which was a large decline than our guidance of down about 2.5%. The year-on-year ADR decline was impacted by decreases in rates within several key markets such as the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong as well as an increased mix to faster growing lower ADR markets. The increase in pressure on ADRs as seen in the second half of the year is influenced by lapping about a 1% growth in ADRs in the second half of last year and by a number of macroeconomic driven factors including less travel in key international cargos due to trade and political issues as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar.Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q3 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately three percentage points versus last year. We estimate that changes in FX rates impacted gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and EPS growth in Q3 by a similar amount. Q3 gross bookings grew by 4% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 7% on a constant currency basis, coming in above the high-end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $5 billion and grew by 4% in U.S. dollars and about 7% on a constant currency basis. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable grew by 12% in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $2.5 billion, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance range and was up 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and about 8% on a constant currency basis.Proposed marketing expense declined 2% year-over-year, which helped drive leverage of about 150 basis points in the quarter. This leverage was driven by an increased mix in room nights from the direct channel, which continues to grow faster than our pay channels. While we'll keep working to grow our direct channel over time, we continue to see performance marketing channels as an efficient way to acquire customers and we will maintain our approach to spend rationally in these channels.We spent $124 million on brand marketing in the quarter, which represented a decline of 22% versus Q3 last year, contributing about 80 basis points of leverage. As we mentioned on our Q2  in August, we are refining and focusing our brand spend in the second half of this year. Sales and other expense grew 13% versus Q3 of last year and contributed about 50 basis points of deleverage, mainly due, primarily due to the growth of our payment platform at Booking.com. Sales and other grew slower than merchant gross bookings of 36% in the quarter due to lower growth in certain payment-related expenses. Personnel expense came in slightly lower than our forecast and contributed a small amount of deleverage in the quarter.Finally, G&A expenses increased 41% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. Note that non-GAAP G&A expenses in Q3 last year excluded a $23 million travel transaction tax charge which negatively impacted GAAP results in the prior year. Non-GAAP G&A expenses contributed about 120 basis points of deleverage in the quarter, driven by a $29 million year-to-date impact from the French digital services digital services tax as well as an additional $10 million related to travel transaction taxes from prior periods. Our non-GAAP EPS was $45.36, up 20% versus the prior year. Adjusted for currency, non-GAAP EPS grew about 24% in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 18.8% in Q3, which is lower than the prior year due to a provision of the tax act which was clarified in Q4 of last year. Our 10% lower share count in Q3 benefited EPS in the quarter.On a GAAP basis, operating income increased by 5% and GAAP operating margin increased by 70 basis points compared to Q3 last year. Q3 GAAP net income amounted to $1.95 billion or $45.54 per share, up 23% from Q3 2018. Our Q3 GAAP net income includes $49[Phonetics] million of pre-tax unrealized losses on our equity investments in Ctrip and Meituan and $72 million of FX remeasurement gains on our Eurobonds. We excluded these unrealized losses and remeasurement gains from our non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of 17.5% for the quarter, which decreased from 21.1% in the prior year due to beneficial adjustments made in Q3 2019 related to the tax act that was excluded from our non-GAAP results and from the factors I mentioned that impacted non-GAAP tax rates.In Q3, we generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow, which decreased 6% compared to Q3 last year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.8 billion, which decreased by 4% compared to the prior year, mainly due to seasonal effects from a higher mix of merchant revenues and the impact this has in the third quarter due to a high concentration of check-ins. During the course of the year, we expect the growth of our merchant business will be a modest positive driver of cash flow. We purchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q3, bringing the amount remaining under our $15 billion repurchase authorization to about $12.9 billion at the end of the quarter. We continue to expect to complete this authorization in the next two to three years, assuming stable business and market conditions. We ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in cash and investments and $8.6 billion of outstanding debt.Before turning to our guidance, we note that the returns from our growth investments for the year are tracking in line with what we said last quarter and we still expect these investments to impact EBITDA growth for the full year by a few percentage points.Let's now turn our attention to Q4 guidance. Foreign exchange rates are expected to negatively impact year-over-year growth rates for gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS by approximately 1.5 percentage points. We use a dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.11 when setting our Q4 guidance. Our Q4 outlook does not anticipate any change in the macro environments. Based on where we are in the quarter and looking at all other factors, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 6% to 8% in Q4. We forecast gross bookings to grow 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis in about 150 basis points less in U.S. dollars. Our Q4 forecast assumes constant currency ADRs for the company will be down about 4% driven by the same factors that impacted Q3 ADRs.A number of these factors are occurring in Asia and Asia is a seasonally larger quota in Q3. We forecast Q4 revenue to be up 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis and by about 150 basis points less in U.S. dollars. Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.21 billion and $1.235 billion, which is approximately flat year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We are forecasting continued leverage from the performance marketing expense line in Q4, reflecting lower volumes in pay channels, our continued focus on acquiring high quality traffic. We expect to see continued leverage of brand spend in Q4. Although we've reduced our brand spending in the second half of the year, we still expect to grow our brand spend for the full year.We expect growth in personnel expenses to reduce EBITDA growth by several percentage points in the quarter due to unexpected lower year-end reversal of bonus accruals than we experienced last Q4. Sales and other expense is expected to grow slower than merchant bookings growth, but faster than overall revenue growth. We are forecasting Q4 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $21.50 to $22 even. Normalizing for constant currency, we estimate Q4 non-GAAP EPS to decrease year-over-year by approximately 1% to 3%. This range for Q4 implies a full year constant currency non-GAAP EPS growth rate of about 13%, which is in line with our full year expectation for low double-digit growth.Our non-GAAP EPS forecast for Q4 includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 19%, which is significantly higher than Q4 last year due to one-time adjustment of approximately $72 million in Q4 2018 related to a provision of the tax act that was clarified by regulatory guidance issued in Q4 of 2018. If we exclude the one-time benefit from Q4 last year, our EPS growth in the quarter will be about 7% higher. We expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19% compared with 18.3% last year. Our Q4 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of approximately 42.2 million shares, which is 9% below Q4 of last year.We forecast GAAP EPS between $20.40 and $20.90 for Q4. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a tax rate of approximately 19%. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBIT, EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuations in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.We will now take your questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks. Two questions please. Could you talk about whether you're seeing any pressures in SCO channels whether that's become less viable for you as a source of traffic? And then, Glenn, you talked about paid marketing channels and trying to diversify among them. Could you talk about how you do that. I know this is something that the company has looked to do for many years. Just how many options are there in order to do that? Thanks a lot. -- Hi, Mark. Well, regarding SCO, we saw some headwinds in the SCO channel did create some modest pressure, but it's a small channel for us. Your second question, I wasn't quite following. I don't recall saying something. So could you say that again? -- I think early on you talked about paid leads were coming in a little more slowly than maybe you would want it or that less ideal. I think this is something that for a while you've been looking for faster channels or paid, high quality paid leads. Can you just talk about whether your ability to find those. How do you find faster growth paid leads? -- Yeah. Okay, I see where you're coming. Actually what we said, I know I figured out what you're saying. We've talked about this for some time that there has been a deceleration of the pay channels that's been going on for a long time. Now we'd like to obviously find -- we'd like to find more customers from those channels. My point being more importantly that no matter what we're doing, we're going to try and maintain our discipline and only do it when we see the right ROIs. There's obviously lots of things that I want always work to improve their paid channels, particularly in terms of trying to increase conversion is the primary thing you can do. And there are also things and looking out in different ways where we want to shift the money among the different paid channels. These are dynamic markets, as you know. And what we do will influence what other people do. So it's always a bit of the strategy gain going on. But you've seen our results so far and we're pleased with where we are right now with the pay channels. -- Okay. Thanks, Glenn.Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays Capital. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking the question. So first, what is driving the outperformance in the Europe room night growth versus your expectations. The macro data points, at least if you look at the industry third party sources appear to be sluggish and also the commentary from suppliers kind of seem to be the same. Is there a counter cyclicality aspects that's benefiting your room night growth or would you just attribute it to better execution during the quarter? And then the second question sounds like the partnership is -- drive is off to a good start and is doing really well. How are you planning to replicate similar strategies in some of the developed markets. Are there more broader partnership-based opportunities that you would look at that? Thank you very much. -- Sure. So I don't think we're in the area of counter cyclicality yet. We mentioned at the beginning that we see the travel industry in general around the world, I used the word generally healthy. So we're not in an area of recession that we then stimulate some type of counter cyclicality. So I think your other point of good execution, I'd like to ascribe a lot of that just to good execution and give a shout out to our 26,000 employees who are executing very, very well.In regards to the Grab partnership, I agree I'm pleased with what we're doing there. I like what's happening there. It's obviously very small still, but it's growing and going the right way. And as you know, about the same time we made a deal with DD. And I mentioned, we're going to bring that went out similarly in the sense of being able to provide a seamless frictionless ground transportation solution for our customers in China and other places where DD operates over time. And also the other way, the same with Grab is being able to expose our offerings of hotel accommodations, home accommodation, all the other things that we're going to offer to the very, very large customer base that DD has.And of course, what we want to do is go out and replicate that in other parts of the world with other players and that's what our affiliate or strategic partnership teams are going out and doing and I'm pleased with the progress they're making in that area. -- Okay. Thanks, Glenn.Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks a lot. So it seems like you've last few quarters been settling into a nice kind of stable growth rate recently on nights and top-line. So with that as a backdrop, can you tell us how you're thinking about investment in non-ad operating expenses as you move forward into 2020? Thanks. -- We've talked in the past about the importance to grow our business, having a balance between the amount of money that we're going to invest to help grow out the future, at the same time maintaining discipline to provide an appropriate bottom-line return for our shareholders. We're just continue to do that and that's the way we do it. And we've talked many times about some of the things that we want to build. We've talked a lot about the connected trip and how we see in the long run, that's the winner for us the differentiator the thing that will make customers come back because they will see a better experience, improve the loyalty, lower the amount of money that we have to spend on the advertising spend. These are all things that we are continuing to work on and we're going to maintain that balance. -- Okay. Thanks, Glenn. And then just a quick follow up on Mark's question about SCO. You mentioned, it's a small channel for you, can you help us put a finer point on that. Is it safe to assume that SCO is a single-digit percentage of your overall revenue? Thanks. -- I think I'm going to stick with my qualitative term, small. -- All right. Thanks, Glenn.Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks. Two, if I can. First, Glenn, you all have made couple of investments in rideshare companies over in Asia, you've got a good history of leveraging M&A. Any interest in making more investments in the rideshare space. There is some public public assets on sale, would it make sense to use some of your capital to do more in the rideshare space?And then secondly on the payment side, I think you all have said it's kind of shifted from a drag to neutral and then eventually it will be a tailwind to EBITDA next year. Can you kind of talk about how that will flow through the P&L. Is that just basically higher effective revenue as you start to charge for payments more broadly, offsetting the cost? And then what kind of profit center do you see payments becoming as the merchant business scales over the next few years and get your rhythm on the payment side? -- Well, in regards to the first question, I think we're all familiar that we don't discuss potential M&A transactions publicly. So I'll have to pass on that one. And I'm going to pass over to Dave in terms of talk about how the funds flows work and why the numbers will be what they will be. -- Yeah. Lloyd, on the payment side, as you know, there are many moving parts. There are multiple different aspects of revenue in the payment stream and there are multiple aspects of costs. And essentially as we've discussed, we've been using this both to help the business and as a marketing tool, but also building the all the mechanics then to be able to optimize both sides of that equation, revenue and cost as the payment platform builds. So next year, we do expect payments compared to this year should be a contributor to EBITDA growth. And it will come from both sides, both the higher revenue recovery and also through better cost efficiency as you roll the platform out, as we generate more scale, as we continue to refine the underlying structure of the product.As we just -- as we said long-term, we certainly view that it can be not only a contributor to EBITDA growth, but also a profit center, but we don't want to quantify that right now. And as we go into next year, we'll probably give you a little bit more color as to how the payments business has progressed as a percentage of our mix, but it's continuing to increase nicely from the approximately 10% of Booking.com we talked about in 2018.Your next question comes from the line of the Naved Khan of SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Yeah. Thanks a lot. Just a couple. So I think, Glenn, in passing you had mentioned that maybe the Hong Kong and rest and maybe some travel restrictions in parts of Asia were a drag on the growth. I would think that having a global business like yours, people basically switch destinations if want to travel. So on the whole are you seeing that as still a drag, how does that play out? And then on the connected experience side, I guess you're testing this on the ARR bookings in Europe with one or two partners. How does -- how do these partners kind of different from KAYAK in terms of how they go to market with you? -- So the first one, you're absolutely correct in terms of a global company like ours, we do get some benefit when one particular area becomes a place that people don't want to travel to. There will be a certain portion that will shift to another place and we will get that business. That being said, another percentage of that business will unfortunately not travel, they had a specific reason to travel that region or they just decided that they just didn't want to travel I would say on what they wanted to do and now they're not going to do it. So there is a drag even though we are global. And I'll point out that some of the areas which we mentioned in the last Q are still going on.The China outbound to the U.S. is still down from where it was a couple of years ago. That is a drag. We had good business there. Certainly, we've all seen on TV what's going on in the Hong Kong and that also is a drag on the economy. And there are other places like that. So while we enjoy the benefits of a global business, there is no doubt that we would do better without these types of problems.In regards to your other question about ARR in Europe, we have been experimenting with lots of different ways KAYAK is one of the ways in the past, we had a click out to part of a company called key Traveli that was -- their offerings called Gotogate. And we now have a more accomplished, more fulsome relationship with Traveli in doing a much more true integrated seamless type ARR product. The difference between doing a matter with KAYAK and having actually integrated as a true OTA offering enable us as the connected trip. You see it was all that data that we get from the actual conversion, all the booking data, all the things the person is doing to be able to offer them some seamless and we like to talk about holistic offering. So one of the benefits something like this is you can offer connected trip car rental or other types of ground transportation much more efficiently.And I would point out just as a separate and this is not related to the ARR product because that is relatively recent. But one of the things I'd like to see, I like that we've seen recently is what's going on in our rental cars business. And if you look at the statistical summary at the end of our release, you'll see that this recent quarter, we've had a nice uptick in that car rental and that is partially due to the connected trip what we are now offering that car rental much more connected with our Booking.com accommodations customers. So that's another one of those instances where I see the connected trip become -- beginning to come to fruition and see what we really can do. -- That's great. Thanks guys.Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Glenn, I have two. So the first one, sort of a bigger picture question to you. You sort of talked about how you're witnessing slower growth in paid channels for a little while now. You guys look at so much data, you have such good visibility into the market, why do you think that's happening. Is it because you're seeing a deceleration in people coming online and why is that happening, are you seeing fewer clicks to bid for. What do you think is driving this and what do you think could cause a reacceleration in paid channels over time? And then the second one on the alternative accommodation business. Any update or help on sort of how big that business is now and how to think about its contribution to growth from a room night perspective? Thanks. -- So talking about the pay channels, certainly as people went online years ago, there is a much larger number of people I think who were particularly in the area that we really have some more sweet spot, to Europe and other developed areas. We jumped online when they went to these pay channels. A lot of those people are already there. Now you start going to other areas is the world, people are going online, but they may not perhaps go to some of our traditional pay channel areas.I'll give you a perfect example. We talk a lot about China is a great opportunity for us for the long run. Google does not operate in China. So all those new people coming online to buy travel, we've got to find another way to get them. So there would be an example and there are other places like that. So I think that's probably the primary reason for it.Whether or not this will reaccelerate, let me know if Google is going to start having a full service in China, in other areas. That's one of the things that we know it's in the end what's most important for us to get customers to come to us directly. We've talked about this a lot in the past is one of the things I think is very important for us to have our own future is to create a service that is so wonderful so good that people just naturally will come back to us directly. And we will not be dependent on other -- we will not be as dependent on other sources of traffic. What was your second question? -- Then alternative combination, sort of how to think about, any help on it. It's sizing from a room night perspective or contribution to growth in the quarter? -- Well, we continue to talk about it grows faster than our core hotel business and we're pleased about that. In terms of actual sizing, we gave you some data a couple of quarters ago, we're not updating that right now. And in terms of the overall industry, I mean there is a lot of data around the world and I'll save the swing from the people who give the lowest estimates to the people with the highest estimates is a pretty wide range. So I wouldn't even attempt to try and come up with which one or where is the exact true number. We know it's a big business and we know it's an area that's important for us for the future and that's why we continue to devote time, resources and money to it. -- Great. Thanks Glenn.Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- So Glenn, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit about how the operating environment in Southeast Asia may be changing especially as it regards to agoda, I mean you've been there for some time now and it seems like around you online connectivity, adoption of e-commerce and payment frictions are all coming down in the region which we can see if we should service tailwinds. Are there any structural constraints that you can see that may slow the rate of adoption of online travel in the region? And secondarily, just wondering how the consumers there behave. Is there a greater propensity to buy packaged products versus hotels and air ticket separately, which may be informing your decision to I guess invest in what is more of an intermodal product? Thanks. -- So I would say that Asia in general is one of the opportunities for us for a very, very long time to continue to build out our business and have good growth. And one of the ways one could look at that is Boeing and Airbus both put together some very detailed project -- 10 year projections I believe, they are even further perhaps. And you just look at the number of planes that they are going to expect to be delivered there. Another way you could do is look at the number of airports being built in the region. And those things all show that travel is going to continue to be a growth industry in that part of the world, one.Two, the different ways that people buy in Asia and Asia is obviously somewhat of a generic term, it's different in different countries. What's happening in Japan is very different than let's say what's happening in Vietnam. But there are some similarities that I would say that we look at, and one is that price is very, very important. It is a very competitive world out there in terms of price. Also interesting, and I think we're all familiar with this is that many people who are just coming online are skipping desktop entirely. Everything is lived on the phone and that's very, very important.The next thing is the super apps that are prevalent there are very important in terms of how you're going to try and get busy. If you're not part of one you're at a disadvantage. I would also say that it's not just the super apps, but you see people who go to many different apps to compare price because price [Indecipherable] actually download numerous different travel apps and then go through each one. Not the most effective or efficient way to find out what the lowest price is, but people do do that. These things are really important. And I would say that it's something we're going to continue to do. David, anything else you -- David, do you want to add anything? -- Yeah. The only thing I'd add is that while alternative payment methods is certainly something that's a function, that's happening. You see happening around around the world, you see more of them in Asia and the ability to transaction in multiple currencies pay-in pay-out in different currencies, particularly pay-in. So the travel point of view in alternative payment methods is a factor that is more prevalent in Asia than elsewhere. -- Absolutely correct. I mean people in the developed areas of the world use credit cards, people in developing worlds are using all different payment products and it's very important that we be able to use every single one because our customers are used to using those, they want to use those. And if we don't have them, they will go somewhere else. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Thank you. A couple of questions. It looks like pretty good ad leverage in the quarter. Just how do you feel about the advertising situation as you look forward as far as your ability to drive direct traffic and need to spend and maybe ramp up the brand campaign again? And then second on ADRs, obviously a headwind in Q4. Are there any events or areas that really showed an inflection in ADR growth and something that would tell you this is very temporary and could rebound. Just wondering how to think about that for 2020? Thank you. -- So I'll talk about the advertising, David could talk about ADRs. So in terms of brand advertising and I've talked about this in the last quarter. I would like us to be doing better. We are not spending as much at the beginning of the year I may have thought we would have. But as I've always said, we're going to be careful with our shareholders' money. We're not going to spend blindly. We're going to always test and learn. And if I don't see the results that we want them, we're not going to spend until we get it right. So I'm a little disappointed where we are. That being said, it's OK. It's not terrible. It's just not as great as I would like it to be.I am very pleased that we have a new CMO at Booking.com, he has been there for just a few months. And I am looking forward to working with him very closely to [Indecipherable] we've made a creative and better campaigns in a way that we will achieve greater results for our brand marketing. And that brand marketing is not only TV brand marketing, it's video, it's all the different things that one does in terms of producing a good brand campaign and I'm looking forward to doing this going forward. -- Yeah, Justin. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a little bit more color on what's going on with ADRs because there are a number of factors, I mentioned a couple in my prepared remarks, but let me give you a little bit more flavor. So in the third quarter, constant currency, we saw about 3% decline, in the fourth quarter we're expecting about 4%. When we look at that, about half of that decline is due to lower rates in key countries. And the ones I call out would be U.S., Japan and Hong Kong being the largest contributor to that piece of it. And about half of the decline is due to a mix shift toward lower ADR countries away from higher ADR countries.Now some of that is affected by macroeconomic factors and those are impacting both rate and mix, and I'll describe what they are and I'll give you a flavor as to how we think they are actually playing out relative to just underlying trends. So for example, less China into the U.S. is impacting ADRs in the U.S. with less inbound international travel. So is less and less expensive travel from Europe into the U.S. due to the strong dollar. So factors driving U.S. ADRs on the right level. Less travel from South Korea into Japan is impacting ADRs in Japan. And of course travel into Hong Kong generally is down considerably that impacts both occupancies and ADRs there. But these economic factors are also impacting mix as well, it will impact -- they impact mix with less travel into higher ADR markets I mentioned U.S. and Hong Kong and more travel to some of the lower ADR markets, for example, other markets in Southeast Asia.So you can put it all together and their manufacturers are impacting these global ADRs. It's difficult to be exactly precise, but we estimate about half of what we're seeing in the second half of this year is driven by external macro factors and about half of it is due just to underlying changes in our business. And remember also, we're comparing against two quarters where we saw unusual ADR increases last year. So you kind of put all that together and you say, adjusted for that compare, our constant currency ADRs are down about 2% in Q3, about 3% in Q4, about half of that we can attribute to macro external factors that should normalize over time. -- Great. Thank you, David. Thank you, Glenn.Another question from the line of Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I just wanted to ask if anything has changed just in terms of your role as you're Booking.com CEO as opposed to the CEO of the overall group, if anything has changed or just how you're thinking about the business? And then any early learnings around the flight offerings in some of the newer geographies that you're in? Thanks. -- So I'll answer the second one first. The flight thing is so early, it's literally just a couple of what we -- there is nothing to be said about that yet, but I hope to be able to talk more about it in the future. In regards to the new role being both the CEO of Booking Holdings and Booking.com, we talked about that in the last call and one of the things I pointed out was because of my experience and bring all the companies are part of this organization in to be part of what was originally just priceline.com and knowing all the management teams and knowing what's good and what needs some help and where the strengths and weaknesses are personalize the management teams, I felt that I would have a better opportunity to try and bring together the company closer and help us work more efficiently with all of our assets. And I'm pleased to say that I love the way things are beginning to come out the way is good for our customers and our suppliers and our shareholders too. And I pointed out in my prepared remarks that agoda and priceline working together created that flight offering for agoda right now.And I mentioned a little bit of the nice thing that we're seeing in our car rental business where by integrating rental cars into the Booking.com operation, beginning to see some upticks there. I can go on and on and we're going to do -- I mentioned that we're going to have more of this cooperation come up with new services because the connected trip requires us to be able to use all of our assets together. I've always talked about the reason OpenTable was not because we just wanted to have a reservation system, a restaurant reservation system, but because we know every single customer traveling needs to find a place to eat because they're not eating at home. And by putting these things together, all the data we have from the Travelport, all the things we know about what they like in terms of where they like to eat at home from OpenTable and creating merchandise offerings to these customers in a holistic seamless way is just a much, much better experience than going from site-to-site-to-site.We have a center in Tel Aviv that has a whole bunch of machine learning experts, AI geniuses who are coming up with different ways to put together the different offerings. And we're going to continue to push that forward and that will create. And I said it earlier tonight about the differentiated service that will be able to bring people back with more loyalty, to enjoy a better experience that is being experienced before. That's what I'm so excited about. And seeing it to start come to fruition is just thrilling. -- Great. Thank you.Another question from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open. -- Thanks so much. Maybe a few follow ups on some of the topics you've talked about on the call tonight. In terms of avenues of investment on the marketing side, how are you differentiating between driving desktop traffic versus mobile traffic and within mobile web versus app and where you're seeing the highest ROI as you think about some of those channels across investing versus driving conversion?And then going one layer below to conversion, what is sort of the big differentiators you're seeing that drive higher conversion when you do see traffic to your properties. Is it the payments mechanism, is it depth of inventory, especially shared accommodations or is it some of what you talked about on the experiences of the local side that might be areas where you want to invest additional layers to drive more conversion as we look out not only end of this year, but out over the next couple of years? Thanks so much guys. -- Well, we're not going to disclose much in terms of where we're putting the marketing money and which ones are giving us the best ROIs, I think you'll understand our reticence to do that. in terms of conversion, I haven't actually done -- look at the data, but I'm going to make a bet that the thing that gives the highest conversion is having a great price. That's probably the number one thing that you can improve, conversion which offer a better price. I'm not sure how much more detail I can really go into, I'll differ. If there's anything you want to add, David? -- No. I mean conversions are multi-faceted facts. I mean obviously people look for choice, they look for companies, they look for support, they look for quality reviews, they look for just the quality and the trust of the site and the products and there's a lot of good data science that goes on behind testing all those and they all have a factor. Good news is that there are many levers that we can pull to continue to improve conversion. And as Glenn said, price and value is a key ones of all. -- And I'll just -- with what Dave said. And one of the things again that you'll -- that we do do and I think it is one of the advantages of being a very large player who can afford lots of data scientists and there's been a lot of money in trying to figure out what is the best personalization for a traveler and whether this person has come before or even not, but we know something about cohort to be able to really offer them something that is what they want to buy and that's something that's very important because if you just throw up a search result that has no relevance to what they really want, you're not going to get much of a conversion. But because of the data we have, we have more data probably than most any other travel player around, we use that in a way to make sure that we're offering up to our customer what they want and that's how you can help create that higher conversion. They're happier, it was an easy way for them to get what they wanted that builds the loyalty, they come back, we get more data.And again, circling back to the connected trip, the more we learn about our customer, the more we're able to then present to them all the things they wanted to know. If it's a leisure trip, what other things to they need. If it's a business trip, what things do they need. And that is just such an advantage of a smaller player and it's an advantage over any individual supplier in the travel ecosystem because they only see a small portion in their data of what the person was. So even the largest hotel chain doesn't know anything about their customer in terms of what sort of ground transportation they wants or what sort of restaurant reservations they like to make or what kind of air they generally want to do and what kind of attractions they want. That's the advantage that a full OTA like us has. -- Great. Thank you.Another question from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. Glenn, I guess at some level this is a little bit more of a philosophical question, but it relates to the answer that you gave on the brand ad spend question. But you grew revenues 4% this quarter, it wasn't that long ago that the company was growing 25% given the margins you're generating and what you're spending on buybacks, it's clearly not a question of resources. Are the incremental returns on investment that bad, are you OK with long-term growth at these levels or is there a path back to 20% growth that you could see the company getting to? -- Well, I don't want to go to any specific number, but I do believe that it's important we create services that people want to come back and that we can accelerate, I'd like to do that, that's part of the reason we're making these investments. And I think in the long run, the thing is creating that great service that gets us loyalty from the people who currently come and keep coming and then creating that brand marketing if you'll know about this better system and come to us and then use it. It's one of those things that in these network economies that when you create something that really is differential and better, the uptick can be very, very rapid. So hopefully, and I believe we will be able to do this, creating these better services, creating this better experience, being able to provide an opportunity for all of our suppliers, this incredible breadth of suppliers and all different parts of the travel ecosystem offering them an opportunity to reach out to our customers in this merchandising ways, different packages, different types of prices, different types of value and being able to present it to on the other hand our demand side, which is so huge make it so much better that then create that flywheel effect and start cranking up again, that's what I'd like to see. -- Okay. And is there -- is it -- I mean anything you can add just sort of on what you are seeing in terms of the incremental returns in the areas of investment, I mean particularly on brand advertising this as a percentage of sales, this is the lowest you've spent in I think nearly three years given how important you've called out driving direct traffic is. I guess I'm just surprised that you haven't tried to push that a little bit further? -- Well, I guess -- and you asked for philosophically and I'll go back to that then. Philosophically I'm against wasting money. And I want to make sure that we're getting the return for the money we spend. And again, our brand campaigns are fine, they're just not as good as I'd like them to be. So when I say I'm disappointed, I'm not saying the return, I want the same [Indecipherable] there could be. Some of the brand health metrics that we've seen have been good, some have not been as good. I am very excited though about our new CMO. He had nothing to do with the old campaigns, these are new things that we're working on now and I'm looking forward to seeing some good results in the future with him. -- Okay, great. Thanks, Glenn.Next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Thanks guys. You talked to these questions, but maybe I just want to parse out a little differently. David, you highlighted direct traffic is growing faster than paid. And Glenn, you talked to the importance of number of times on the call, the importance and the continued focus on direct traffic. How would you assess the magnitude and/or the quality of your direct traffic and the initiatives that you're exercising there. How much runway or leverage do you feel you have to execute against getting more direct traffic into you? Thank you. -- Brian, in terms of just quantification, I mean just to recap, I think everybody knows us, but we've been clear that for a while direct traffic has continued, has been over 50% of our bookings and continues to increase from that data point. So that's where it is from a sizing point of view and continues to move nicely each quarter. I don't think we have -- for the capital where we think that can go. There will always be a mix. We think that's, as we said, the performance channels, albeit growing more slowly are very efficient way for us to capture new customers and we like what we see there. When we see growth opportunities, we lean into them and we think it's a combination of both. And of course as Glenn said, the more we build, the better flywheel, the better the conversion will be from those performance led customers into direct customers and repeat customers. So that's the way the business have operates, but it's not really a lot of new data to give you other than reiterate the points that we've already made. -- Great. Thank you, David.Next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on one. In the U.S., I mean how do you view the opportunity of sort of getting more for by owner or that last year that inventory that's a little -- has little more friction in bringing that over to your side or would that help your brand campaign in the U.S.? Then any commentary on Ctrip investing in TripAdvisor? Thank you. -- So we talked in the past about how we think we are under index in terms of the single property owner in the U.S. And we know that's an area where we need to add inventory to have a fully competitive source inventory against people who want that type of a place to stay. And we came to work on that, we have, obviously, we have a lot of different ways that we try and bring people on to the site and get -- making less burdensome to have people come on. That's what we're going to continue to do. It's blocking and tackling and we're slowly building it out. So that's the best I can say there. It continues to grow as we continue to add that type of inventory into the website and the inventory.In regards to the Ctrip deal that we saw announced, we continue to create partnerships ourselves. And we have a good partnership with Ctrip and they sell our hotels and we make money, we're happy about that. We also though said agreement with Meituan, which is Ctrip's big competitor and we have good business or have a good relationship with them too and we have a relationship with DD, which is another Chinese player. And we have, as you know, we invested in Grab, as I talked about earlier and we've put an investment into another APAC player Serko down in New Zealand. So we continue to make those kind of investments and partnerships. It is not surprising than our competitors or other people in the space would also be thinking about doing those type of deals, et cetera. And I don't begrudge anybody who wants to improve their own position that is the obligation of any corporation to try and improve their business for their shareholders and I suppose that's what they've done, but I have no details exactly about what the deal is, so I really can't comment on the specifics. -- Thank you.Your last question comes from the line of James Lee of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. -- Question. Glenn, is there any way you can give us an update on your current transition to the merchant business model here and what is the coverage now relative to total market at this point? And maybe help us understand which regions you are seeing success? And do you also expect U.S. hotel partners to adopt this model soon? And just curious given the slowdown in the market, is this business model giving you the price control to help you to be more resilient during the current environment? Thanks. -- Well, let me talk about the resilience about the -- in the travel business in general. In the past when there have been slowdowns, the distributors have achieved greater success because of the need for the suppliers to get more customers. So that is something that we believe will happen again when and if there is a true slowdown. As I pointed out, the industry is still I believe a generally healthy around the world with pockets that we've described earlier.I do believe that in the long run, the growth in the industry will continue to exceed GDP by a few points and that is the way we always play it out. So there's going to be always some ups and downs in the long run. But yes, we may gain a little more when there is a recession and when occupancy rates are very, very high, there obviously is less need for a person, a distributor like us. But in the long run, we will continue to provide greater services and greater benefits to both sides of this two-sided marketplace that will allow us to achieve the success that we think we should. And David, anything about the merchant stuff? -- Yeah. James, on merchant, and obviously just to clarify that the shift we're talking is that kind of rollout of the merchant platform of Booking.com, at agoda and priceline and we do a lot of business on the merchant already today. And we -- Booking.com, we continue to make progress. We have -- we gave you a data point a couple of quarters ago as to how many countries we're live in, we're continuing to add to to that. We're continuing to add merchant capabilities in the U.S. and make those available to a wider range of our property partners here as well. So continuing to grow, as I mentioned earlier, mix increasing from 2018, but we're not going to give you a new data point on that just yet, at some point in time, we'll give you an update.So we're pleased with how that is progressing and we are pleased with how it is giving us some additional flexibility in the business. And of course, it's very important to underpin a lot of what Glenn talks about with the connected trip because if you want to really have a connected trip, you want to also be able to connect in aggregate the way that you pay for that and also be able to do things around packaging, pricing, payments et cetera through an immersion platform provides a mechanism for that as well. So we are pleased with it, it's making progress today and it will be a bigger driver for us in the future. -- All right. If I may ask a follow up question, and Glenn maybe help give us an update on your view on China, I know you've been bullish for a long time now given the fact that looks like global payments happening in China that allow you to work with DD as a way to provide additional service to Chinese consumers domestically. And maybe help us understand what other steps that you're taking to improve your service. Is it more the customer segment type of strategy where you feel you have an edge in certain segment or consumer within China or is it more of the blanket strategy to go after big TAM in China specifically? Thanks. -- So, and we've said this many times, how important China is in the long run. And yes, there is some economic headwinds in China right now that have impacted travel in general there. And certainly, we've talked a little bit earlier about some of the outbound impacts. We have a multi-legged approach and we do everything from building out our own brands there to partnerships with OTAs like see Ctrip or Trip.com as it's now known or Meituan or ground transportation like DD or many other B2B players where there is places where we can get customers. We have almost 1,000 employees in China. We are doing all different types of brand marketing and other ways to trying to get people to see our services and get people to come to us directly or as I just said, we also get customers through the B2B method too.I will emphasize though, China is a very competitive marketplace. And we have to always be trying to create the best services with good prices to be successful there. But we're going to continue to develop and work there because we do know that for the long run, we need to create something that will be something that the customers in China who want to use. And I'm pleased with where we sit right now. And I hope we continue to grow in the future.So thank you, everybody very much. I'd like to say that we're pleased with the quarter. We're excited about the future. And we look forward to talking to you again in the New Year. Thank you very much.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At Expedia, revenue and gross bookings were up just 9% year over year during its third quarter, and growth in room-nights slowed to 11%. Most measures of earnings fell compared to year-earlier levels, as expenses were up double-digit percentages overall. Expedia also predicted tough conditions would last throughout the remainder of the year, cutting guidance.Booking has a lot in common with Expedia, and that explains the move downward in sympathy. Booking has also seen some of the same trends of slowing growth rates in its own core business.

The online travel booking specialist\u00a0earned $22.44 per share on $3.9 billion in sales last quarter, and beat consensus earnings estimates with a stick.But one analyst doesn't see much chance of a repeat.Image source: Getty Images.This morning, investment banker Merrill Lynch took an axe to Booking's rating. Although the analyst left its price target of $2,160 intact, it noted that with Booking shares within just \"6% of our $2,160 PO,\" it no longer sees enough potential for profit to keep the stock at buy, and so downgraded Booking Holdings to neutral instead. \u00a0Merrill has two main reasons for its pessimism:On the plus side, \"street booking/room night estimates\" suggest a \"modest acceleration\" in demand next year, an improvement after \"3 years of deceleration.\"One positive factor doesn't outweigh two negatives, however (or at least not in Merrill's opinion). For that reason, the analyst is lowering its rating on Booking Holdings stock.Should you be scared?Booking Holdings isn't.Merrill's misgivings notwithstanding, when Booking issued its own guidance back in August for what to expect in Q4, management reminded investors that it's now transitioning into its \"peak travel season.\" And while the slowdown Merrill mentions is real -- Booking warned that sales could be as much as 8% below Wall Street's estimates at the time -- pro forma earnings guidance was nonetheless significantly Street predictions, and up from Q3 2018 levels as well.Since those earnings came out, of course, analysts have largely been persuaded over to Booking's management's point of view and have raised their estimates. Consensus projections now call for the company to grow its sales nearly 6% year over year to $5.07 billion, and to earn more as well -- $44.52 per share pro forma, or 18% better than last year. \u00a0Of course, the downside to Booking persuading Wall Street that things are going to work out just fine is that the stock has now become more expensive. After jumping 6.5% in response to the company's Q2 report, shares have gained an additional 5% in the three months since.Result: At $86.6 billion in market capitalization, Booking Holdings stock sells for a not-cheap valuation of 22.5 times earnings today, heading into Q3 results that are expected to come out next week. \u00a0Granted, if all works out as planned, and Booking succeeds in growing its earnings 18% in Q3 -- defying Merrill's predictions -- the stock's premium price may turn out to be justified. The company\u00a0, after all, sport better  than its net income usually reflects -- $4.6 billion in \"cash profits\" generated over the past year, versus $4.2 billion in \"accounting profits.\"Still and all, hard as I try to make the numbers work, even under optimistic scenarios Booking Holdings shares look at best fairly valued to me, and probably a bit overpriced for an 18% growth rate. My best advice at this point, therefore, is to take Merrill Lynch's advice:Step aside for the moment, wait, and hope Wall Street overreacts to a \"poor\" or \"mixed\" earnings report. If Booking Holdings stock suffers a big enough pullback next week, it could become cheap enough to buy into once again.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the second quarter of 2019 alone, S&P 500 companies spent almost $165 billion on share repurchases - and that was 26% less than the record high spent in Q4 2018.But it's still a big number. \"While the decline is significant compared to 2018, it remains higher than the pre-2018 levels,\" writes Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Buybacks yield several benefits. Among them, given the simple math of calculating earnings per share (EPS) - total earnings divided by total shares outstanding - buying back shares can \"juice\" the EPS figure. Moreover, they tilt supply and demand in shareholders' favor. If a company takes shares off the market, in theory, it should make the remaining ones worth more.But are stock buybacks a reason to buy? Not on their own. But they are one of several material signs - dividend programs, , intelligent capital expenditures - that a company is putting its stock in a position to succeed.Here are six stocks to buy that have spent considerably on stock buybacks over the past few years. Importantly, all six stock picks sport additional fundamentals that should help them make the most of a tailwind as they continue to reduce their share counts.\nMarket value: $396.4 billionDividend yield: 0.7%Q2 buybacks: $2.2 billion5-year buybacks: $31.9 billionPayments processor Visa (, $177.63) would be a fine and welcome addition to most portfolios on its fundamentals alone. The world's largest payment processor - Visa boasts 3.3 billion cards in use across more than 200 countries - has grown its revenues at a compound average annual rate of nearly 10% over the past half-decade. Better still, its earnings per share have grown by roughly 20% annually over the same time frame.Stock buybacks have lifted that number; Visa has spent $31.9 billion on repurchases over the past five years (not including the most recently reported Q3, in which Visa bought back another $2.7 billion in shares). But its actual profits still have advanced by a little more than 17% annually. It's the perfect combination of share repurchases augmenting solid operations.Visa bought back 20% of its shares over the past five years, and remains committed to share repurchases. At the start of the year, Visa announced an $8 billion buyback plan. It's also a relentless dividend grower. In its recently released Q3 report, the company announced it was upgrading its payout 20% to 30 cents per share, starting with the December distribution. That's 150% higher than where it was the same time five years ago.The heavy spending on buybacks and dividends isn't throttling back its growth potential, however. \"We think investors underestimate the top-line growth potential for Visa given the world market where 85% of transactions are still done in cash,\" research firm CFRA writes.\nMarket value: $86.8 billionDividend yield: N/AQ2 buybacks: $2.7 billion5-year buybacks: $18.0 billionBooking Holdings (, $2,042.80) might just be the biggest internet travel company that you've never heard of. But you've certainly heard of its brands. Booking used to be known as Priceline, which many Americans are familiar with. But the company changed its name in February 2018 to reflect the Booking.com property, which is based in Amsterdam, covers nearly 155,000 destinations in 227 countries and territories, and operates in 40 languages. Booking Holdings' properties also include Kayak.com, Agoda.com and Cheapflights, among others.BKNG has materially reduced its share count over the past five years, from just about 52 million shares in 2014 to around 42.8 million as of the second quarter of 2019. This reduction alone would have boosted EPS by 18% even if total profits were flat. But Booking has generated oodles of organic growth - earnings per share shot 111% higher between 2013 and 2018, or roughly 16% annually on a compounded basis.Admittedly, airlines and hotels now have the technological prowess to connect directly with their customers. So they have less of a need for intermediaries such as Booking. But the company boasted 213 million room nights booked in the second quarter - that's volume that hotels and airlines simply can't walk away from.Seemingly putting a dent in that argument are analysts' projections for the next couple of years. The pros see revenues improving by 4.5% this year, then accelerating to 8.6% growth in 2020.ValueLine analyst Michael Lavery approves of the May 2019 acquisition of Venga, which along with Booking's OpenTable brand diversifies the company's revenue sources and strengthens its position in the restaurant business. \nMarket value: $159.6 billionDividend yield: 2.8%Q2 buybacks: $3.5 billion5-year buybacks: $49.2 billionCitigroup (, $73.09), America's third-largest bank by assets, will have reduced its share count by more than 25% by the end of the year if ValueLine projections hold up. Earnings per share, bolstered by these stock buybacks, are exploding. The company reported a profit of $2.20 per share in 2014, and is expected to earn $7.60 per share this year.The company also has spent billions repairing the damage done to its dividend during the Great Recession. Citigroup paid out $5.40 per share back in 2017, but whittled its dividend down to a penny per share within a couple years. It started rehabilitating the payout in 2015, which has recovered to 51 cents per share - near its pre-Recession payout once you include Citigroup's 1-for-10 reverse stock split in 2011.Investors haven't been hot on Citigroup shares, however. Their 47% gain over the past three years is just about on par with the rest of the financial sector. The company's stock trades at a thin 8.5 times forward-looking earnings estimates, and at less than book value. Both metrics are cheaper than even scandal-plagued Wells Fargo ().CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon admits that Citigroup is \"most exposed versus direct peers to a slowing global economy,\" but he still thinks things are moving in the right direction. \"On Oct. 15, we raised our 12-month target by $6 to $76 ... as we think C is showing improved execution and strength in U.S. market.\" He also noted the Federal Reserve's June approval of the company's 13.3% dividend increase and $17.1 billion, 12-month share repurchase program.\nMarket value: $1.09 trillionDividend yield: 1.4%Q2 buybacks: $4.6 billion5-year buybacks: $72.5 billionMicrosoft (, $142.83) is a trillion-dollar company whose stock is sprinting around like an energetic small cap. This year has seen MSFT shares appreciate by more than 40%, driven by growth not just in its Azure cloud business, but also its core More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, Surface and gaming, among other things.Both of those segments deliver roughly a third of revenues each, as does its third division, Productivity and Business Processes, which includes businesses such as Office and LinkedIn.It's an interesting, diverse portfolio, and one that's growing across the board. Productivity and Business Processes' revenues have expanded by 38% over the past two fiscal years; Intelligent Cloud, by 42%; and More Personal Computing, by 16%. Interestingly, though, Microsoft has figured out how to squeeze more from the MPC segment, whose operating profits have spiked by 45% in that same time.Shifts such as taking its Office productivity software to cloud-based subscriptions, and entering the cloud infrastructure business, have bulked up margins from 25.4% in fiscal 2014 to 29.3% in fiscal 2019. That has enabled Microsoft to continue showering cash on shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.MSFT bought back almost 600 million shares during that time and raised its dividend by 64%. That doesn't include its recently reported first quarter for fiscal 2020, which saw Microsoft improve the payout by another 11% and buy back another $4.9 billion in shares.Looking ahead, 26 analysts have produced ratings on MSFT stock over the past three months, and all 26 have been Buy recommendations. That includes Stifel, Mizuho and Deutsche Bank analysts, who touted a Department of Defense contract award to Microsoft's Azure, over competitor Amazon.com's () Amazon Web Services, that could be worth up to $10 billion over a 10-year period. Deutsche Bank's Karl Keirstead called the DoD's announcement a \"huge upset victory\" for Microsoft and poked fun at the department's release language, calling it a \"rather understated phrase to announce what could be the largest cloud contract in history.\"\nMarket value: $200.5 billionDividend yield: 3.0%Q2 buybacks: $4.9 billion5-year buybacks: $53.4 billionCisco Systems (, $47.24) was the ultimate go-go stock as the tech bubble built during the turn of the century. It couldn't make network and switching gear fast enough. Investors couldn't get enough of its stock.The bubble popped, of course, and so did CSCO, which is now worth less than 40% of its 2000 highs. But that hardly tells the whole story since then. Cisco's still growing - as is its dividend - and investors have driven the stock up by nearly double over the past five years.The knock on Cisco - and it's justified - is revenues. They've improved, but only by about 2% compounded annually, and they've been lumpy. Here's a look since 2014: $47.14 billion, $49.16 billion, $49.25 billion, $48.00 billion, $49.33 billion and a decent move to $51.90 billion in fiscal 2019.But the company is squeezing far more profit out of its sales. Margins, while every bit as lumpy, have improved from 18.3% to 22.4% during that same time. Profits have grown by nearly 12% on a compound annual basis.Shareholders have benefited not just from higher share prices, but a much fatter dividend. The payout is 84% better than it was five years ago. Meanwhile, Cisco has spent more than $50 billion over the past half-decade on share buybacks, repurchasing roughly 815 million shares to reduce its count by more than 15%.Looking ahead, Wall Street expects profits to grow by mid- to high single digits over the next couple of years. Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani even believes CSCO shares could reclaim their tech-bubble highs, laying out an $80 multiyear target. \"We think CSCO remains an attractive asset to own given the company's positioning in a growing and profitable product market, increasing software/services mix, M&A tailwind, and a favorable shareholder return profile,\" he writes.\nMarket value: $1.1 trillionDividend yield: 1.3%Q2 buybacks: $18.2 billion5-year buybacks: $247.5 billionThe world sometimes seems divided into two vocal camps: Those who think Apple's (, $243.29) best days are behind it, and those who think Apple's best days are ahead of it. And whatever camp someone is in, they're rarely convinced the other position has any merit.One thing that neither side can contest, however, is just how much Apple values stock buybacks. The company repurchased $18.2 billion worth of shares in Q2 alone, bringing its five-year total to $247.5 billion through 2019's midway point. For perspective, with that amount of money, Apple could've bought Walt Disney (), Coca-Cola () or UnitedHealth Group (), the nation's largest health insurer.Take your pick.If ValueLine's estimates for the current year hold, Apple will have reduced its share count by a little more than 23% over the past half-decade. That has helped lift the company's EPS, which have expanded by 110%, or almost 16% on a compound annual basis, over the past five years. (However, analysts expect a small pullback in profits for the fiscal year to be reported after the Oct. 30 closing bell.)With , the company is turning to its Services division. Here, an installed base of nearly 1.5 billion devices (including well more than 900 million iPhones) will enable Apple to sell all manner of services. It has long been distributing third-party apps and music, but it's expanding into a new streaming service (Apple TV+), games (Apple Arcade) and digital media subscriptions (Apple News+). Services, which made up 21% of sales in the June quarter, sports an estimated gross margin of 64%, versus 30% for hardware.Expect some of the extra profits generated from the growth of Services to head back to more stock buybacks. \"We like AAPL's net cash position of $102 billion ... with our view of annual free cash flow potential of $60 billion plus supporting aggressive share repurchases,\" writes CFRA analyst Angelo Zino.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n early trading on Friday, shares of Skyworks Solutions topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 6.6%.

Travel around the globe has expanded dramatically in recent decades, with a rising consumer class in many emerging markets adding new travelers to the market at a breakneck pace. Moreover, the success of airlines over the past decade has helped to spur greater capacity to allow people to go where they want more conveniently. Meanwhile, the rise of the internet has forever changed the way people do commerce, and allowing people to arrange for travel online has become a fast-growing business.Booking Holdings is at the intersection of the travel and e-commerce trends. As the leading online travel website, Booking has put together a strong combination of businesses under a single corporate roof. Starting with its Priceline \"name your own price\" travel website, Booking has made acquisitions like international hotel specialist Booking.com, online travel website aggregator tool KAYAK, and restaurant reservation service OpenTable. Booking.com was arguably the most important acquisition the company made, and that led it to change its name from Priceline Group to Booking Holdings in 2018.Growth at Booking has slowed recently, worrying some who follow the online travel giant. Much of the drop in revenue growth has come from the strong U.S. dollar, to which Booking is particularly susceptible because of its extensive international business and exposure to foreign currency movements.However, the company still has ambitious plans to expand. , as it's made substantial investments in companies such as online travel platform , food delivery app provider , and ride-hailing specialist Didi Chuxing. China's economy has slowed recently, but its growth is still considerably faster than you'll find in many other parts of the world, and the nation's huge population makes it too fertile a source of potential business for Booking to ignore. Moreover, a strong presence in China would give Booking a base from which to capitalize on other opportunities across Asia.Early in November, Booking Holdings will give investors its latest reading on how it's doing financially. Those watching the stock expect the online travel giant to post earnings growth of around 18% for the key late-summer season, with revenue gains of roughly 6%. Shareholders will want to keep an eye on the key metric of room nights booked, as Booking gave guidance three months ago that third-quarter growth in that category would come in around 6% to 8%.Historically, Booking has done a good job of surpassing the guidance it's given investors, and that's why now's a good time to take a look at the stock. The online travel industry has a lot of tailwinds that should help it grow around the globe, and Booking's already extensive international presence makes it the most likely company to reap the rewards as more people around the world discover the joys of travel.I'm well aware that it sounds insane to suggest that an iron ore miner on the verge of bankruptcy a few years ago is a great stock to buy now. Yet as much as the specter of an impending recession and global trade slowdown looms large over commodities, there is a compelling reason to think that U.S.-based iron ore producer Cleveland-Cliffs is a great stock to own right now.Much of the investment thesis in Cleveland-Cliffs comes down to its management team that took a bloated and unprofitable business and turned it into a resilient cash-generating operation in a matter of three years. The company has reduced its total debt outstanding by more than half from its peak in 2013, it has started to invest in new growth businesses, it has\u00a0, and it's had the financial flexibility to buy back $250 million in shares so far this year. data by Despite the monumental changes Cleveland-Cliffs management has implemented over the past few years, the company's stock still trades as though the company is in deep financial distress. Shares trade at 2.5 times earnings, and current prices aren't that far off where they were when the company was discussing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\u00a0I don't have any deep insight into where iron ore prices are going from here. Fortunately, little of the investment thesis in Cleveland-Cliffs has to do with the future of iron ore prices. The iron ore market is much more nuanced than the spot price of iron ore pellets, and there are some inherent advantages to owning more than 55% of the U.S. iron ore market. What's more, this management team has seen this company through a lot more than just weak iron ore prices. With shares trading at such a low valuation, Cleveland-Cliffs looks like a great value stock today.\u00a0Over the past seven months, you probably couldn't dream up a more nightmarish investment than . And while many still have a lot of growing up to do, one niche marijuana middleman is already profitable and de-risked from a lot of the supply issues plaguing the Canadian landscape. Say hello to . like MediPharm take cannabis and hemp biomass and, based on the scope of contracts signed with their clients, provide resins, distillates, concentrates, and/or targeted cannabinoids. These are also businesses that may offer white-label manufacturing and packaging services.What makes extraction providers so exciting is that Canada, which became the first industrialized country to legalize recreational marijuana in October 2018, officially legalized derivative pot products on Oct. 17, 2019. Derivatives are products such as edibles, vapes, cannabis-infused beverages, concentrates, and topicals, and they'll . Because derivatives offer  better margins than traditional dried cannabis flower, these alternative consumption options are a must-have for all Canadian pot growers.But here's the thing: Not every marijuana stock has the ability or the capacity to process cannabis or hemp on site. That's where MediPharm Labs comes into play. Its Barrie, Ontario, facility will soon be able to handle 300,000 kilos of annual processing capacity, with an eventual push to 500,000 kilos per year. Thus far, the most notable deal MediPharm has landed is with . In exchange for $30 million over an 18-month period, MediPharm is supplying Cronos with concentrates.Aside from the fact that extraction-service providers like MediPharm are the go-to middlemen for pot stocks, the contracts these extraction companies sign are typically 18 to 36 months in length. Thus, they provide predictable cash flow over the intermediate term in a fast-growing yet nascent industry with little certainty.Despite beginning operations last November, MediPharm  in the second quarter. As the company's expansion capacity ramps up, it should quickly and easily build on its profit momentum. Given the importance of derivative products over the long run for the cannabis industry, 22 times next year's earnings per share looks to be a veritable steal for MediPharm Labs.All businesses use data to make decisions, but raw data is useless unless it is captured, organized, and stored in an efficient and searchable database. This need has driven many of the largest companies on the planet to rely on database providers such as\u00a0\u00a0for decades.\u00a0But legacy databases are having a hard time keeping up with the needs of modern-day businesses, since we now capture  amounts of\u00a0data that can't be stuffed into neat columns and rows. Think photos, videos, and audio files. The rise of e-commerce and cloud computing is also putting a strain on traditional databases that they were never\u00a0designed to handle.These factors are causing enterprises to seek out alternative solutions like never before, and MongoDB\u00a0is seizing the opportunity like no one else.MongoDB built its database system from the ground up to solve all of the shortfalls of legacy solutions. MongoDB's software is open-source and free to download, and it can capture, store, and organize data in almost any type of format. The database is also distributed, which makes it easy to split it across lots of low-cost servers, eliminating the need to buy certain types of expensive hardware.\u00a0These benefits explain why more than  have already downloaded MongoDB's software. That's wonderful news for investors, because\u00a0MongoDB uses a \"freemium\" model to drive growth. Developers can easily download MongoDB's software and play with it until they become comfortable. However, they get only a limited amount of storage space. Unlocking more requires them to become paying subscribers.MongoDB has the numbers to prove that its strategy is working brilliantly. Its customer count more than doubled to 15,000 in the most recent quarter. The company's net annual recurring revenue expansion rate, which tracks same-customer\u00a0subscription revenue from between periods, has remained above 120% for more than four years in a row.\u00a0That helped drive 67% revenue growth to\u00a0$99.4 million in the most recent quarter. These numbers are impressive, but the exciting part is that they're still small when compared with the company's true potential. The global database software market hauls in\u00a0$64 billion in revenue each year and continues to grow. By contrast, MongoDB expects to generate less than $400 million in annual sales during the current fiscal year. That means it hasn't even captured 1% of its addressable market opportunity yet.The biggest knock against investing in MongoDB is that it's still losing money -- its net loss was $37 million last quarter --and that its valuation is sky-high, with shares currently trading for more than 20 times trailing sales.\u00a0Investors need to keep those risks in mind. But my view is that the company's growth opportunity is so massive that it still makes sense to take a small position today and add to it over time.Those might sound like empty words, but I recently added MongoDB to my personal portfolio, so my money is where my mouth is. I like stocks that are leaders in a fast-growing market that's in its infancy. The Trade Desk fits that bill perfectly.This company provides a software platform for advertising agencies to buy ads from more than 500 billion digital opportunities every day. This software-based model is called programmatic advertising.There's no question that The Trade Desk is a leader in the programmatic advertising market. AdExchanger named its platform the \"Best Demand-Side Technology\" earlier this year, while the ClickZ Marketing Technology Awards named The Trade Desk as \"Best Demand Side Platform\" for 2019.The Trade Desk's opportunity is ginormous. The global advertising market should be close to $725 billion this year and is projected to grow to $1 trillion by the middle of the next decade. Programmatic advertising will probably total only $34 billion in 2019. But it should make up most of the market in the not-too-distant future, growing at a rate five times faster than the overall advertising market.I especially like The Trade Desk's prospects in connected television (CTV), which includes streaming TV services that are ad-supported. The company signed a deal in August with \u00a0that  Amazon will allow advertisers to place ads on apps that use the Amazon Fire TV platform through The Trade Desk and one other third-party platform.\u00a0My view is that the Amazon deal is only one of many opportunities that The Trade Desk will seize in CTV. As the digital and programming advertising market expands, The Trade Desk should be able to deliver sizzling growth for long-term investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2022 put at the $1360 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $70.00.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.2% return against the $1360 commitment, or a 2.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to BKNG's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $1360 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Booking Holdings Inc sees its shares fall 32.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $1290.00 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $70.00 from $1360), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.2% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Booking Holdings Inc, and highlighting in green where the $1360 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2022 put at the $1360 strike for the 2.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Booking Holdings Inc (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $2018.97) to be 28%.

The fact is, every successful investor goes through a losing streak or a period of underperformance.

The market value of those shares ($121.6 million) accounted for 30.0% of the  in assets listed by HMC.It\u2019s important to remember that the $121 million investment is a small part of the endowment fund\u2019s total portfolio. In 2018, for example, public equities accounted for 31% of the entire endowment. Yet, because HMC has invested most of those funds through outside investment managers, very few of its overall investments appear in SEC filings.\u00a0Nonetheless, the parent of Google is HMC\u2019s largest holding in its 13-F. In May, I listed \u201c.\u201d Of those reasons, I would say that my three favorite reasons in no particular order would be healthy revenue growth, Google Cloud, and its massive free cash flow.\u00a0Despite generating 33% of the online global ad revenue, it is still growing them at more than 30% a quarter. It is this kind of healthy revenue growth that\u2019s led to  in trailing 12-month free cash flow, allowing it to reinvest in growth businesses such as Google Cloud.\u00a0When it comes to generating profits and cash flow, there aren\u2019t many stocks better at it than Alphabet.\u00a0\t\n\t\t   \tThe maker of iPhones is HMC\u2019s second-largest holding at 506,683 shares worth $100.3 million.

It has since scaled that back to less than a third of its original holdings. Apple stock has gained 33% in the 21 months between the end of 2017 and the end of September, an annualized return of almost 19%, not including dividends.\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor Wayne Duggan recently highlighted the fact that  for Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 has been very positive with pre-order activity in China, almost double what it was a year ago.\u00a0With more than 65 million iPhone users in China in need of an upgrade according to analysts, Apple skeptics might want to tone done their rhetoric a little.

They include , , Stripe, , and 's\u00a0MercadoPago.  had , and this week,  joined the detractors. According to media reports,  and  turned down offers from Facebook to become founding members. The two Wall Street firms were worried about running afoul of money-laundering rules.When Facebook first announced Libra in June, it had high hopes for its cryptocurrency, which it's betting will transform the way the world handles money. With Libra, consumers will be able to send money to friends and family and make digital purchases by firing off a message or sending a photo.Libra will be operated by a nonprofit group based in Switzerland that will oversee the cryptocurrency, which runs on blockchain technology. Facebook still stands to make a lot of money from the endeavor, though. Its digital wallet Calibra will be used to store and exchange the digital tokens. Libra will also give Facebook new revenue streams if people use the digital currency on Facebook's platforms.Source image: Getty Images.Facebook wasn't prepared for the fierce criticism its efforts faced. With the  already embroiled in data and privacy scandals that resulted in it paying a $5 billion fine to the Federal Trade Commission, lawmakers, privacy groups, and regulators wondered how it would protect the users of its cryptocurrency. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the now-defunct political consulting firm accessed the data on 87 million Facebook users without their consent, is still fresh in the minds of many. If Facebook has its way, Libra would become the preferred payment method for its more than 2 billion monthly active users. Would their data be any safer?In July, Rep. Maxine Waters, the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, along with several other lawmakers, sent an open letter to Facebook calling on the company to halt its Libra plans. The lawmakers expressed concerns about the fact that Facebook was creating an \"entirely new global financial system\" that was located in Switzerland and one that is aimed at rivaling the U.S. dollar. The lawmakers cautioned that if this cryptocurrency was left unchecked, it could put the financial stability of the U.S. and countries around the globe at risk.The increased attention Libra received from lawmakers was enough to spook the likes of PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa among the others that withdrew. But that was not the only problem Facebook faced as it headed into the signing of the Libra Association Charter this week. It's also likely delaying the launch as it navigates the regulatory landscape. The hoped-for celebration when Facebook scheduled the signing of the charter turned out to have a dark cloud hanging over it.Despite all the odds against it, Facebook is forging ahead, pulling out all the stops to convince the world's skeptics that it is capable of controlling a digital currency that can't be regulated. Its latest attempt: warning regulators of the impending danger from China if Libra fails.David Marcus, the Facebook executive heading up the Libra initiative, told Bloomberg that China is moving ahead with its own digital payments system, which could have global appeal. That could be a big threat to the U.S. if regulators drag their heels in approving Facebook's digital coin. He painted a picture of an environment five years hence in which a large portion of the world won't have to worry about sanctions from the U.S. because they will have a digital currency waiting in the wings.Whether that argument will resonate remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Facebook is going to have to do a lot of work if it wants the world to be comfortable with it controlling an unregulated and anonymous digital token.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Booking Holdings is the larger of the two, yet together they have consolidated a duopoly in online travel bookings in the U.S. and Europe, with offerings across hotels, plane tickets, home and vacation rentals, rental cars, and other travel products.When you're looking at the two names, it might seem as though Expedia is clearly the better stock. After all, it not only trades at a lower forward P/E ratio of 16.2 to Booking Holdings' 17.8, but Expedia also seems to be growing faster than Booking at the moment: Data source: Booking Holdings' and Expedia's second-quarter filings.However, there is more to Booking and Expedia than meets the eye.One reason investors might want to give Booking Holdings the benefit of the doubt is that it has more European and Asian exposure, and is thus more affected by currency swings. On a constant currency basis, Booking Holdings grew Q2 2019 bookings 10% and revenue 14%, which means it actually slightly surpassed Expedia. Negative currency movements last quarter makes Booking Holdings' growth slower than Expedia's. If the recently strengthening U.S. dollar reverses course, Booking Holdings' growth metrics would proportionally improve.Additionally, Booking Holdings has more room to grow domestically. On the recent , CEO Glenn Fogel said, \"The U.S. is a great opportunity for us because we're under indexed. And that's something that we recognize, a need to do better and to try and get more than our fair share is what we always want.\" Yet besides this currency issue, there's an even bigger reason Booking may have an advantage over Expedia.Booking Holdings has invested significantly in China. Image source: Getty Images.The real reason that Booking Holdings might be valued higher than Expedia is its superior investment track record, specifically with its minority investments in China. While the Chinese market has been difficult for both Booking Holdings and Expedia to penetrate, Booking has invested aggressively in leading  in the travel and mobility spaces. These include the following:Data source: Booking Holdings quarterly report, Crunchbase.Ctrip is the leading online travel agent site in China. Meituan-Dianping is the leading food delivery app and local deals platform in China (which just . Didi Chuxing is the leading ride-hailing platform in China. In addition, Booking recently invested in Grab, a leading ride-hailing platform and food delivery service in Southeast Asia, and even more recently invested in Yanolja, a Korean hotel booking platform.For those unaware, investors in private companies often take preferred stock, which gives the company priority over equity investors. These preferred shares often convert to equity for a company's IPO. Therefore, the preferred stock investment in Didi, for instance, could eventually be valued higher should the company go public.All of these investments add up to a formidable Chinese and Asian portfolio for Booking of over $3 billion. While Expedia has also made international investments, it hasn't been in China, and they consist of a smaller $120 million stake in  , a Latin American travel platform, and a $350 million investment in southeast Asian travel platform Traveloka.Expedia hasn't had as much investment success as Booking. The company's investment in Despegar has lost about half its value since Despegar went public,  and Traveloka's CTO resigned late last year, issuing a  about the company's culture upon departure. Expedia also owns a majority stake in  . Trivago is a public company in its own right, but its results are consolidated with Expedia's. Trivago has also lost over half its value since going public.While Expedia's current headline numbers appear superior to Booking Holdings' numbers, it's not so cut-and-dried. Expedia could make for the better choice for some investors, given its U.S.-centric model, small dividend, and lower valuation. However, those willing to bet on the growth of China and international markets should probably look at Booking Holdings, despite its seemingly inferior growth. At the very least, Booking has proven to be the better investor in other companies, and this likely accounts for its premium over Expedia.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Only 2017 was better.\u00a0To meet the demand of younger campers, Airstream offers the Nest, a compact trailer that costs just $46,000 to buy, making the open road a more cost-effective alternative to buying a cabin or staying at a five-year hotel on every vacation.\u00a0Source: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com\n\tYou can call millennials a lot of things but don\u2019t call them lazy.\u00a0According to CB Insights\u2019 report, 76% of millennials exercise at least once a week, more than Gen Xers at 70% and boomers at 64%. Millennials are dropping close to $7 billion each year on gym memberships, double what Gen Xers and boomers do.\u00a0Naturally, you\u2019d think I\u2019d recommend a fitness club chain such as Planet Fitness (NYSE:), whose stock\u2019s done well since going public in 2015.\u00a0However, the capital requirements of fitness facilities make them terrible investments when the economy sours.\u00a0So, I\u2019d rather bet on a company like Lululemon (NASDAQ:), that\u2019s making sure millennials not only are dressed to perform while exercising, but they look good doing it.\u00a0Lululemon reported Q2 2019 results September 5 that were off-the-charts good.\u00a0\u201cExceptional\u201d 2Q results further demonstrate that Lulu is the \u201cpremiere retailer in our (and likely any) coverage universe and is deserved of a premium valuation,\u201d  Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser. \u201cBest-in-class\u201d execution and customer engagement, including a new loyalty program which has so far only launched in four North American cities, and innovative product offerings should continue to drive \u201ctop-tier results.\u201dWith the company expecting double-digit earnings gains each year until at least 2023, the sky is the limit for LULU stock.\u00a0Source: Shutterstock\n\tWhile it can be stereotyping to say all millennials thrive on experiences rather than buying stuff, they do indeed like to travel.\u00a0\u201cAn Airbnb study from 2016 showed that many millennials prioritize saving for their next trip over paying off debts or saving to purchase their first home,\u201d CB Insights report stated. \u201cAnother found that 21% of millennials would accept a lower salary if it meant they could travel more frequently.\u201d\u00a0However, just because they want to travel, doesn\u2019t mean they want to do it in the same manner as their parents.\u00a0Therefore, for travel companies to be successful, they\u2019ve got to provide a combination of unique experiences, budget prices, and excellent customer service; three things that aren\u2019t easy to deliver.Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:), which used to be known as Priceline, increased its roster of available homes and apartments on its Booking.com website in 2018 by  to 1.75 million. At the same time, Booking.com\u2019s hotel portfolio increased by just 10% to 436,000.\u00a0The push toward a pre-pay business model where alternative accommodations are paid for ahead of time as opposed to at the time of hotel stay, is in large part being driven by the millennials desire to stay somewhere more authentic or local.While it makes Booking\u2019s business a little trickier, it\u2019s the wave of the future, and much better for cash flow.\u00a0\u00a0Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com\n\tIf you want to please millennials and you operate in the restaurant industry, you\u2019ve got to be fast because Gen Y is always on the go.\u00a0According to the CB Insights report, 40% of millennials eat on the go, significantly higher than either Gen Xers at 26% and boomers at 19%. Not only that, but millennials want a good deal with that tasty burger to go.\u00a0One of the biggest trends in the restaurant industry at the moment is plant-based meat, also known as Meat 2.0. Shake Shack (NYSE:), whose stock is up 114% year to date through September 10, is one of the fast-casual dining establishments to jump on meatless burgers.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s sold the Shroom Burger for years, a fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese and served on a bun. That said, it still hasn\u2019t embraced the Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:) movement as other concepts have.\u00a0But it\u2019s working on it.\u00a0\u201cI think we\u2019re going to keep an eye on that, but the meat substitute is not as interesting to us right now,\u201d Shake Shack CMO Jay Livingston  Ad Age in August. \u201cWe\u2019re really interested in creating, like a veggie experience that people are super excited about. We\u2019re kind of figuring out what that might look like right now.Business is good at Shake Shack.\u00a0It is the 90th largest restaurant chain in the U.S. Its same-store sales rose 3.6% in the second quarter with overall revenues growing by 31% due to more store openings. It plans to open as many as 60 locations in 2019, which should help keep SHAK stock moving higher in 2020.\u00a0Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\tOn the one hand, the fact that millennials love coffee is excellent news for Starbucks (Nasdaq:), whose U.S. stores had seen several quarters of slower than average same-store sales growth before breaking out in the third quarter with a  increase in U.S. comps.\u00a0On the other hand, millennials are predisposed to try boutique coffee roasters, which Starbucks is not.\u00a0To make matters worse, Starbucks released revised 2020 guidance September 4, that suggests its earnings growth next year won\u2019t meet its \u201congoing growth model of 10%.\u201dHowever, much of the slowdown has to do with one-time tax benefits in 2019. The company itself continues to do just fine.\u00a0\u201cI would say that we\u2019re firing on all cylinders from an operating performance perspective with the focus and discipline necessary to drive growth at scale for a company like Starbucks and our long-term double-digit EPS growth model is fully intact,\u201d CFO Pat Grismer  recently while speaking at the Goldman Sachs\u2019 Global Retailing Conference.\u00a0Furthermore, as a result of its stock generating a year to date total return of 42% through September 10, Starbucks has made $2 billion in share repurchases this fiscal year instead of next year so that it can deliver on its promise of share repurchases delivering  in 2019.\u00a0While SBUX stock might get knocked around from time to time, it\u2019s operationally one of the best companies in America.\u00a0Oh, and millennials love their cold drinks.\u00a0Source: DenisMArt / Shutterstock.com\n\tThe global frozen food market is projected to grow to $290 billion by 2021.\u00a0Two stats suggest that millennials are driving a frozen food renaissance: First, millennials spent 9% more on frozen foods per trip to the grocery store in 2017 than other demographics. Furthermore, frozen food sales in the U.S. in 2018 grew for the first time in five years, thanks in large part to millennials.\u00a0Frozen foods meet the millennials desire to eat healthy, fast, and relatively inexpensively.\u00a0One company that\u2019s benefiting from the resurgence in both frozen foods and plant-based meats is Kellogg (NYSE:), the company better known for Special K and Frosted Flakes.\u00a0However, between its Eggo and Morningstar Farms brands, Kellogg\u2019s managed to increase frozen sales by  in the second quarter ended June 29, only 50 basis points less than its snacks division, which counts Pringles and Pop-Tarts amongst its brands.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On September 4, the company introduced Incogmeato by MorningStar brands, a portfolio of products that are both ready-to-cook and frozen including a plant-based burger and Chik\u2019n tenders and nuggets.\u00a0\u201cWe know that about three-fourths of Americans are open to plant-based eating, yet only 1 in 4 actually purchase a plant-based alternative,\u201d  Sara Young, General Manager, MorningStar Farms, Plant-Based Proteins. \u201cWe know the number one barrier to trying plant-based protein is taste. These consumers are still seeking the amazing taste, texture, and sizzling qualities of meat but want a better alternative for themselves and the planet.\u201dThey\u2019re expected to be available early in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\tMillennials have the highest student loan debt of any previous generation. Combine this with the fact the cost of living is rising faster than it has in the past decade, and it\u2019s no wonder millennials are willing to try personal finance apps that help them save money that they can use to pay down debt.\u201cOne of the most popular verticals for personal finance tech is banking. In one survey, 71% of millennials said that they would rather go to the dentist than listen to what a bank has to tell them \u2014 a sentiment driven largely by poor customer service and poor technological integration,\u201d stated the CB Insights report on millennials.However, rather than recommend a bank that uses technology, I\u2019m going to suggest Intuit (NASDAQ:), the granddaddy of fintech companies.\u00a0Most investors are probably familiar with Intuit\u2019s main products: QuickBooks and TurboTax. The former focused on small businesses and the latter on taxpayers of all sizes. In fiscal 2019, it generated  in free cash flow from $6.8 billion in revenue. I love companies that grow their free cash flow each year by double digits.\u00a0Intuit does this by investing in R&D. In fiscal 2019, it spent  on new products and innovation, approximately 18% of its annual revenue. It plans to spend most of this money improving its existing products.\u00a0One free Intuit product that millennials use quite frequently is , and while other apps get higher ratings, the fact that a $69 billion company develops it ought to be comforting to most.Long term you can\u2019t go wrong with INTU.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at , one standout is the ProShares UltraPro S&P500 (Symbol: UPRO) where we have detected an approximate $52.7 million dollar outflow -- that's a 4.0% decrease week over week (from 23,750,000 to 22,800,000).

It's fair to say that Expedia is rooted more in a traditional model, where it operates as a sort of digital travel agent. The company also owns VRBO, which lets people rent private residences, and it has integrated that brand into a number of its other properties.In this segment of, host Shannon Jones talks with guest Dan Kline about how Expedia and Booking Holdings stack up. To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our\u00a0. A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they\u00a0have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0quadrupled the market.*\u00a0David and Tom\u00a0just revealed what they believe are the\u00a0\u00a0for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0to learn about these picks!Let's switch gears and talk about the other major player in this space, and that's Expedia, ticker EXPE. It's sporting a market cap right now of $19 billion. Smaller than Booking Holdings, but nonetheless a major player in this space. What can you tell us about Expedia, and how is it different from Booking Holdings? The companies are very similar, but I think it's fair to say that Expedia is more rooted in the traditional, let's call it a digital travel agency model. You go to a site, it shows you a bunch of choices, gives you the brands, and you book in a traditional way. Now, they own sites that don't do it that way. Hotwire is a blind bid site. But Orbitz, Travelocity, even CheapTickets, a lot of their sites are based in the old school model, just in a digital way. That said, they also own VRBO, which is Vacation Rental by Owner. I don't remember if that's actually their name anymore, but that's how it started. VRBO is an Airbnb-style service built around vacation homes or places you would stay on vacation, where you can go in and say, \"I want to go to St. Petersburg, Florida. Can I rent a home for a week? I want three bedrooms, two bathrooms, I'd like a pool to be there,\" and it comes back and gives you prices, and it facilitates the transaction through generally not a brand, but a person. And they've integrated VRBO, which they bought for $3.9 billion along with HomeAway in 2015. They've integrated that into a lot of their core product, where, when you're looking for travel, it might also show you options or give you the option to choose options that are not traditional hotels, but residences or other properties that are through VRBO. So, it's a similar but different business model. This actually intrigues me the most about Expedia because they have been putting so much focus on VRBO. I've personally used VRBO. I've used Airbnb before. This alternative accommodation market is continuing to grow. The fact that they have this under their brand and are really tapping into that, especially, I think, with a lot of millennial travelers who are looking for that home-like appeal, but aren't necessarily wanting to spend a ton of money, I think that niche right there is definitely met with Expedia and VRBO. I think, from Expedia, even though they're a smaller player -- granted, I guess you could say they've been hurt, too; their revenue and their bookings are, I guess you could say, stagnant at this point, Dan.Yeah. In the most recent quarter, their bookings are up. Both companies follow a similar pattern, which is logical. It's also worth pointing out, Priceline does, on some occasions, or, various booking.com sites, offer you, let's call them Airbnb-style rentals. It's just in an unbranded way. The advantage that Expedia has is, VRBO, whatever you want to call it, it's a brand name, it's something you trust, it's integrated into their product. And as someone who travels a lot, it reminds you that that's an option. Sometimes when I visit the office, I travel with another Fool, usually Matt Frankel or Maurie Backman, both of whom have appeared on the show. When I do, sometimes it might come up and say, \"Hey, you could rent this two bedroom condo that's walking distance from there.\" And you go, \"Ooh, that'd be nice. Have a kitchen, a refrigerator, a living room, that'd be great.\" So, integrating it that way gives them another tool, another reminder, another way to get it done. And it's helped them. Their revenue has inched up $3.2 billion in the most recent quarter, that's up about 9%. Bookings are up 11%. That said, net income has been up, but it's maybe not as strong as you'd like it to be.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ:BKNG) and  (NASDAQ:EXPE) are the two largest online travel agencies (OTAs) in the world.

This year has been a hectic one for IPOs, with companies such as  , ,  , and  going public so far. The year is far from over though, with many companies potentially going public in the next four months.Image source: Unsplash.These three companies plan on going public soon and should definitely be watched by investors.Airbnb has taken the hotel and hospitality industry by storm. Launched over 10 years ago, it now hosts over 2 million people a night, for a total of 400 million people since the company was founded in 2008. Airbnb is available in 191 countries, 100,000 cities, and offers roughly 6 million different places to stay. Thanks to its cheap and easy-to-use service, Airbnb has become a household name.In 2018, Airbnb saw a 62.5% increase in guest arrivals, with Mexico City and Beijing up 79% and 91%, respectively. Even though Airbnb is a privately traded company, reports have shown that in 2018's third quarter, Airbnb turned over $1 billion in revenue, with some analysts expecting revenue to hit $8.5 billion by 2021. A portion of this growth comes from Airbnb's more recent venture, Airbnb Experiences. Launched over three years ago, this service offers over 5,000 experiences in 60 cities across the globe, growing 2,500% in 2018. Unlike many companies that have gone public recently, Airbnb has also reported a positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the past two years. This has been aided by the experiences segment, with some experiences earning more than $200,000 each.The growth of Airbnb has not gone unnoticed by traditional competitors such as   and  , which now face a significant threat. A recent survey from Morgan Stanley indicated that 42% of Airbnb users had replaced a traditional hotel service with Airbnb's digital service. This is no surprise, with hotels costing 6% to 17% more than an Airbnb.While Airbnb has not yet announced when it intends to go public, an IPO is certainly on the table for the end of 2019. In a statement, co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk said: \"We have already said that we are taking the steps to be ready to go public in 2019. That doesn't mean we will go public in 2019.\"Apoorva Mehta, CEO of the popular grocery delivery company Instacart, said at the start of this year that \".\" Founded by a former Amazon employee, Instacart reached an $8 billion valuation in 2018 after raising $271 million in funding last November.While online grocery shopping makes up only 10% of consumer spending, the industry has seen significant growth in recent times. From 2016 to 2018, the online grocery market doubled, and it is expected that between 2018 and 2023, the market will quadruple, with 1 in 5 Americans predicted to buy groceries online.Although Instacart's revenue and profitability are not publicly disclosed, the company appears to be growing. Founded in 2012, Instacart now serves over 15,000 grocery stores in 4,000 cities and has formed partnerships with companies such as , ALDI, Sam's Club, and  Canada. As of 2018, Instacart had over 30,000 customers and has been investing heavily in research and development, announcing the opening of a second R&D headquarters in Toronto, Canada.In an industry as explosive as online grocery shopping, Instacart faces great competition from companies such as Walmart, , and . These popular companies have already carved out a name in the space, and it is apparent that customers will use their delivery service first. According to a study by Second Measure, Walmart -- one of Instacart's largest competitors -- has 62% more online shoppers. Amazon, through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh, currently makes up 30% of all online grocery shopping, and Target's Shipt saw 92% more orders in January 2019 compared to January 2018. Despite such intense competition, Instacart may have a significant role to play, providing smaller, regional retailers with logistical expertise and e-commerce options.SmileDirectClub is another company that will definitely go public in 2019 after filing a form S-1 in August. SmileDirectClub provides clear teeth aligners, a replacement for traditional train-track-style braces. Unlike their main competitor, 's  Invisalign, however, SmileDirectClub's aligners can be fitted either at home or in \"SmileShop\" stores, and thus cost roughly 60% less than Invisalign.This affordability and ease of use has made them a significant threat to Align, which actually owns 19% of SmileDirectClub. Despite being part owners, their relationship has not always been healthy, with Align forced to close its physical stores due to a non-compete violation with SmileDirectClub. A deal struck last year between SmileDirectClub and  will see the products offered in hundreds of CVS stores across the U.S. This partnership will increase customer awareness for SmileDirectClub and should prove to be a big success against competitors.SmileDirectClub recently received a valuation of $3.2 billion and has had over 300,000 customers since its founding in 2014. With the global orthodontics market set to reach $2.6 billion in 2023, it is no surprise that SmileDirectClub has a lot of room to grow, especially at a time when consumers demand things cheaply and efficiently. In 2018, SmileDirectClub's revenue grew 184% to $398 million.Although SmileDirectClub has a unique position in the market and is seeing huge revenue growth, investors should be wary as dentists have taken issue with its product. Dentists have filed complaints in 36 states as they believe the process of teeth straightening is an important medical procedure and requires numerous checkups. Government intervention in the dental industry could prove to be dangerous for SmileDirectClub's business model. Nevertheless, this soon-to-be-public company is seeing impressive growth, and investors should definitely keep a close eye.Image source: MyWallSt.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0 Priceline being just one of the brands under the Booking Holdings umbrella. They've also got the Priceline version, agoda.com in their international reach. Right now, Booking Holdings is in over 230 countries, so they've got a pretty massive footprint. Some of the other brands, I think you mentioned them, you've also got Open Table, rentalcars.com. They've also got KAYAK. KAYAK is interesting to me for a couple of reasons, but I'd say more so because KAYAK operates as really an aggregator of a lot of these online travel sites. The reason why this stands out to me, Dan, is because I've heard Google, I've heard and other major players are also really beefing up their efforts in this space. So, when I hear that they do have some sort of aggregator, I do get a little bit excited. But what are your thoughts around KAYAK?KAYAK, which I use a lot, becomes almost an extra party in the transaction. If I book travel through Priceline, Priceline gets a cut from the airline or the hotel. If I book travel through KAYAK, what happens is, I put in the parameters of where I want to go, and I pick, \"Gee, yeah, I'd like to look on Priceline, I'd like to look on Orbitz, I'd like to look on four or five others,\" and KAYAK brings up these other sites, and it shows me all my different options. I would assume they get paid a small cut if I book. So, it becomes even more slicing up the pie in different ways.I find KAYAK is a very useful tool for figuring out where the baseline is. Like, I want to travel to this place on this date and stay at this level of hotel -- roughly, what's that going to cost me? Oh, OK, it's $900. Then maybe I'll use other tools to figure out if I can get a cheaper deal. But you need to know what the price range is. Like, flying indirect is going to cost way less than flying direct; some of those things. It's really about doing your homework and doing research.I don't love KAYAK as a business because I don't see it really being a tool where you complete your travel deal all that often. And the company does not break down each individual segment of its business. But, it is very useful, and it does fit very well with the rest of the family. Booking Holdings, as an investor, as I'm looking at financials, I know they started the year pretty weak. A lot of the earnings, apparently some weakness in the European markets. Again, Booking has a massive international presence, particularly in Europe, where you see a lot of those boutique hotels that oftentimes, just due to scale and resources, aren't going to have staff that can list those hotels across all these different sites. So, you've got somewhat of a sticky model, especially in those European markets. So, we saw some weakness there at the start of the year. But it sounds like the most recent quarter, though, we were starting to see some signs of improvement.I guess the question I would have for you, Dan, is, is Booking Holdings right now still a slow growth story? Or is it really just a value stock right now? I mean, they've gotten hammered. It's both, kind of. They are going to grow slowly, but I think there is a major storm cloud facing not just Booking but also . It's that every brand has an incentive to create a one-on-one relationship with customers. My travel partner of choice, I would say, is . And one of the things you notice with Southwest is, they do not appear on any of these websites. That's not 100% true, but in general, they only sell direct to consumers. If I want to fly Southwest, I book through Southwest -- meaning Southwest keeps all the money, they don't have to pay a third party, and that in theory helps them keep their price down. If you've seen the recent commercials, they are pushing you to go to their app, promising you the best price, or that they'll give 25% back if you find a better price. That's a little tricky, too, because they won't give you a better price if you made a blind bid, because you already have the room, you can't get rid of that blind bid deal.So I think there's a negative headwind here that more and more companies, whether they be airlines or hotels, are going to start finding ways to create that one-on-one relationship. It used to be, you'd pay a lot more going into a hotel or airline website to book. That is still sometimes true, but there's not a lot of logic in that, because when there are all these alternative sources -- so, I worry about booking.com and Priceline and their ability to operate as a middleman when middlemen may become less necessary.Such a great point. Just looking at their Q2 numbers, revenue was up 8.9% year over year. Looks like they brought in $3.8 billion. I think one of the metrics that matters, though, especially for those that are diving into this stock -- and, Dan, I know you've been watching this -- it really comes down to their actual bookings. The bookings is where you should really be focused. Yeah. The great news is, they booked 12% more rooms. On the other hand, their income stayed about the same. That means that they're being squeezed on the edges. They're either taking less money as a way to offer consumers lower prices to sell more rooms, or their partners are striking harder deals. They don't really explain which one it is. It could be both of them. You want to see growth in how many rooms they sell because the more rooms also means the more of a habit it is. I actually go to Priceline first when I'm booking hotels. When I'm booking travel or plane flights or rental cars, they are not the first place I go. So, you want to see the habit build. You want to see more people use it. On the other hand, you'd like to see them make more money when they effectively sell more units. Exactly. But I have to wonder with this industry in general, and investing in this space, it seems like it's only going to become increasingly crowded moving forward. I mentioned some of the bigger players, but you also have smaller players. Can you expect to see low-single-digit top line growth for most of these companies moving forward? Do you think, in addition to all the things that you mentioned that are actually putting pressure on there, that this is just an overhang on the industry itself? Booking is forecasting between 2% and 4% growth for the full year. That's fine. And they may be able to, as a company, figure out how to lower expense. Obviously, they have a huge technology investment, but they don't have inventory. They don't need a lot of things once they get to a certain place. So, they might be able to increase profitability. But, yeah, I think there's increasing competition for where and how you book travel. I got my mail today, and this is going to sound ridiculous, but I had four different direct traveler offers. Two from cruise lines, one from an airline, one from a middleman service. It's like everyone is pelting you. There's new competitors coming in. There's new ways to aggregate. There's new ways to incentivize. So, if you're Priceline, if you're booking.com, you have to constantly be adding new sites or new services in order to cut off people who are offering comparable things. Something Priceline has dabbled in is offering different deals after a certain time of night, meaning, \"Hey, it's 7:00, I don't feel like driving all night, I'll grab a hotel room. Hey, here's what the deals are.\" Well, they're doing that because there's other start-up competitors that, specifically, that's their business. It's like late night hotels, and you're going to pay less because you're not going to be there for 12 hours, but the hotel is going to make some money on a room that otherwise might have gone unoccupied. So, you have to keep innovating, and that's a drag on your eventual ability to just make money. Yeah. On top of that, you really have to spend to build the brand awareness. For a lot of these online travel sites, it's ultimately becoming a commodity. For me, when I am looking to book travel, I don't necessarily care which site I'm on; I'm looking for the best price. Whatever is the best price, on whatever site I can find, is who I'm going to go with. You don't necessarily have that strong brand loyalty, so it's really about spending on advertising costs to build brand awareness instead. Yeah, and it's really to capture customers. We've all seen the endless Priceline ads. There's plenty of booking.com ads. The reality is, once I've input my credit card somewhere, it's a lot easier for me to purchase there. I don't currently have a credit card with, say, hotels.com, which is an Expedia brand, which we'll talk about soon. So I might find a great price there, but if Priceline's pretty close, I might book through Priceline just because I don't want to have to type in all my information and remember that I have a credit card another place. The reality is, advertising is all about driving someone to make that first purchase, and if that first purchase goes well, that probably becomes another tool in your arsenal where it's much easier to use it. That's partly why I use Priceline for rental cars sometimes. Sometimes I book through Southwest, where you don't have to pay until you pick up the car; sometimes I book through Priceline, where, depending how you bid, you may pay when you pick it up, or you may pay, if you do a blind bid, beforehand. But those are the two companies that have my credit card. I'm not necessarily going to go search out a slightly better deal but have to go through it all again.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n this week's episode of , host Shannon Jones and Motley Fool contributor Dan Kline scuba dive into the travel industry, especially focusing on how its two biggest players compare to the other.

That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0to learn about these picks!Welcome to , the show that dives into a different sector of the stock market every single day. Today is Tuesday, August the 20th, and we're talking . I'm your host, Shannon Jones, and I am joined via Skype by Foolish contributor, travel guru, I think you've got about a million titles now, Dan. Dan \"the man\" Kline is joining us today. Dan, how's it going? [laughs]\u00a0It's good! I actually saw you for about 30 seconds a week ago. All of 30 seconds, we were able to make happen while you were here at Fool HQ.I don't think the listeners understand just how busy Shannon is on any given day. [laughs]\u00a0That's so true. And I was pushing it for that 30-minute stretch. I was pretty sure I was late for a meeting with Tom Gardner at some point. But, I wanted to make it happen, because it's\u00a0always good to see you, Dan.\u00a0I'm really excited about today's show. Last time on the  show, we basically kicked off summer travel season by diving into cruise operator stocks. Today's show, we're going to continue on that travel theme, especially as we approach Labor Day, the unofficial end of summer. We're going to be talking about online travel booking stocks, and maybe get a few tricks of the trade from traveler guru himself, Dan Kline while we're at it. We'll dive into two of the major online travel and reservation sites, Booking Holdings and Expedia. Two companies, Dan, they control over 70% of the online travel market. That is huge to me.Yeah. I will say, both companies have made travel easier and harder. Back when I first started traveling for business -- I'm 45, my first business trip came when I was 20, so you can do the math there. A lot of years ago. We called a travel agent who had magic tools in front of her, probably some sort of computer, and figured out what the best price was for what we were trying to do. Now, when I book travel -- and I travel two or three times a month; I come up there usually once a month -- when I book travel, there's always this nagging suspicion that I've somehow left money on the table because when you look at the various properties owned by Booking, which include Priceline, KAYAK, booking.com itself; or Expedia, which owns Expedia, Hotwire and a whole bunch of other things, there's all sorts of different ways to book travel, and it's not always easy to figure out which one to use. And that benefits these companies.That's a good point. Let's actually dive right into Booking Holdings. This would be the largest of the two. Actually, just from a market cap standpoint, it has a market cap of $82 billion right now. The company previously known as Priceline, and it's gone through a couple of name changes. Now it's known as Booking Holdings, ticker BKNG. Dan, I was looking at Booking Holdings. 2019 hasn't necessarily been a great year for them so far. At one point, they were down nearly about 20% off of their highs from 2018. But, tell us first, what is Booking Holdings? They've got a lot going on.\u00a0They're a collection of travel sites; in addition to that, they own Open Table, which is somewhat of an outlier, though it's obvious to see how restaurant reservations and travel match up pretty well. But, their core sites in the U.S. are booking.com, which is kind of a traditional travel site -- you go to booking.com and you say, \"I want to visit Orlando a week from now. I'd like to stay in a hotel, and I don't want to make any stops.\" And it gives you the best pricing or the most convenient pricing -- it actually gives you multiple options. Sometimes it's the cheapest, and the cheapest can be really strange, like, you leave from one airport and fly home to another. And, you can pick cheapest or best, and all sorts of different options.\u00a0Priceline is a travel bidding site. This is actually my site of choice. What happens on Priceline is, you can go in and you can see what's available and what the prices are. Then, you have a couple of other options. Priceline is famous for its Name Your Own Price tool. What that means is, I can say, \"You're showing me hotels in Alexandria, Virginia downtown. The cheapest hotel is the Westin for $199 a night.\" That's where I usually stay. \"I don't think that's the best deal I can get.\" So, you have two options. You can go into Express deals. Express deals will show you the area of the hotel, how many stars it is, and what its rating is -- basically, do people like it or not, on a 0% to 100% scale. And you can say, \"Alright. I want a three-star hotel, Alexandria, Old Town, I don't care what it is,\" and you get it, and it comes back, and it's one of four hotels because there's only a few in the area, and you're relatively happy with it. Or, you can do Name Your Own Price, which doesn't show you any price. You say, \"Alright, I want a three-star hotel,\" same thing, \"downtown, Old Town, Alexandria. I'm only willing to pay $75 for it.\" And you put that offer in, and it might come back to you one of three ways. It can reject your offer. They might come back and say, \"Hey, nobody's willing to sell it to you for $75. But if you increase your offer to $92, you have a really good chance.\" In fact, I've almost always gotten my room when it does that. The third choice is, it comes back and says, \"Hey, you didn't get it,\" and you have the option to go in and make some changes. You can lower your star rating, you can add another area, you can change your dates. And it becomes this game of, how low will the hotel go? Same thing for airfare. And, when it comes to airfare, there's certain parameters. You can say, \"No redeyes.\" But, if it's a short trip, you might find yourself booking tickets that leave late Monday night and really early Wednesday morning, and it minimizes your trip. So you have to be really careful, but I find that it's an area where you can save a lot of money if you're not married to one particular brand or another. Dan, I have to ask -- I've never used Priceline, but in using that service, the Name Your Own Price tool, what's your success rate when you submit a price? Would you say 90% of what you submit gets accepted? What does that look like, percentage-wise? If I'm using Name Your Own Price, it's probably 60/40. That said, I'm only going to use Name Your Own Price in an area I know really well. For example, Alexandria is not a big city. When you look at how Priceline in its full disclosure area breaks it up, you can see that there's four to five three-star or four star-hotels that are sort of close to the office. The farthest one away is a little bit far in the winter, so you might want to take an if it's snowing or it's really cold out. I know the area, and nine months out of the year, if I do a blind bid, I know that yes, I want to get the Westin or one of the two or three hotels very close to the office; on the other hand, I won't be upset if I get the one that's about 1.25 miles away. So, I know the area; I know every possible hotel it's going to put me in; and I'm comfortable doing a blind bid.\u00a0Sometimes I'm less comfortable doing a blind bid. Maybe I got rejected on one and I need to expand my area, or I couldn't get the Express deal I wanted, and I want to try different things. In those cases, you really just have to do your homework. Look at what's around, figure out what the brands are. You can see what was just booked. And sometimes, if you do the Express deal, it gives you little hints, like, \"You've stayed here before.\" Well, if I've only stayed at one hotel in that area, I know what it is. If I've stayed at two or three, you have to think, \"Gee, did I like all those hotels?\" When I stay out by Baltimore near the casinos, there's three or four hotels of the same star range, and two of them are walking distance and two of them are not, and sometimes I'd really prefer being walking distance, so it makes sense to not do a blind bid and to book something when I know what it is.\u00a0So, you have to be very, very strategic, and you have to do your homework.\u00a0Got it. So, Priceline being just one of the brands under the Booking Holdings umbrella. They've also got the Priceline version, agoda.com in their international reach. Right now, Booking Holdings is in over 230 countries, so they've got a pretty massive footprint. Some of the other brands, I think you mentioned them, you've also got Open Table, rentalcars.com.

I would assume they get paid a small cut if I book. So, it becomes even more slicing up the pie in different ways.\u00a0I find KAYAK\u00a0is a very useful tool for figuring out where the baseline is. Like, I want to travel to this place on this date and stay at this level of hotel -- roughly, what's that going to cost me? Oh, OK, it's $900.

Let's switch gears and talk about the other major player in this space, and that's Expedia, ticker EXPE. It's sporting a market cap right now of $19 billion. Smaller than\u00a0Booking Holdings, but nonetheless a major player in this space. What can you tell us about Expedia, and how is it different from Booking Holdings? The companies are very similar, but I think it's fair to say that Expedia is more rooted in the traditional, let's call it a digital travel agency model. You go to a site, it shows you a bunch of choices, gives you the brands, and you book in a traditional way. Now, they own sites that don't do it that way. Hotwire is a blind bid site. But Orbitz, Travelocity, even CheapTickets, a lot of their sites are based in the old school model, just in a digital way. That said, they also own Vrbo, which is Vacation Rental by Owner. I don't remember if that's actually their name anymore, but that's how it started. Vrbo is an Airbnb-style service built around vacation homes or places you would stay on vacation, where you can go in and say, \"I want to go to St. Petersburg, Florida. Can I rent a home for a week? I want three bedrooms, two bathrooms, I'd like a pool to be there,\" and it comes back and gives you prices, and it facilitates the transaction through generally not a brand, but a person. And they've integrated Vrbo, which they bought for $3.9 billion along with HomeAway in 2015. They've integrated that into a lot of their core product, where, when you're looking for travel, it might also show you options or give you the option to choose options that are not traditional hotels, but residences or other properties that are through Vrbo. So, it's a similar but different business model. This actually intrigues me the most about Expedia because they have been putting so much focus on Vrbo. I've personally used Vrbo. I've used Airbnb before. This alternative accommodation market is continuing to grow. The fact that they have this under their brand and are really tapping into that, especially, I think, with a lot of millennial travelers who are looking for that home-like appeal, but aren't necessarily wanting to spend a ton of money, I think that niche right there is definitely met with Expedia and Vrbo. I think, from Expedia, even though they're a smaller player -- granted, I guess you could say they've been hurt, too; their revenue and their bookings are, I guess you could say, stagnant at this point, Dan.Yeah. In the most recent quarter, their bookings are up. Both companies follow a similar pattern, which is logical. It's also worth pointing out, Priceline does, on some occasions, or, various booking.com sites, offer you, let's call them Airbnb-style rentals. It's just in an unbranded way. The advantage that Expedia has is, Vrbo, whatever you want to call it, it's a brand name, it's something you trust, it's integrated into their product. And as someone who travels a lot, it reminds you that that's an option. Sometimes when I visit the office, I travel with another Fool, usually Matt Frankel or Maurie Backman, both of whom have appeared on the show. When I do, sometimes it might come up and say, \"Hey, you could rent this two bedroom condo that's walking distance from there.\" And you go, \"Ooh, that'd be nice. Have a kitchen, a refrigerator, a living room, that'd be great.\" So, integrating it that way gives them another tool, another reminder, another way to get it done. And it's helped them. Their revenue has inched up $3.2 billion in the most recent quarter, that's up about 9%. Bookings are up 11%. That said, net income has been up, but it's maybe not as strong as you'd like it to be.Yeah. I think, what we saw even in that home rental segment, they are still struggling. There's concerns, especially with competition like Airbnb out there. And then also, listening to the conference call, there was a decision to streamline a lot of its brands to further emphasize Vrbo. I think that will likely hurt the stock in the short term, although I do think over the long term, it makes sense to put more emphasis, especially when it comes to SEO, and getting an optimized ranking on Google Sites, because Google is both friend and foe in this space. So, I think, short-term headwinds for Expedia, but long-term, their renewed focus in this space makes sense.Yeah, and there's a short-term, let's call it legislative problem. The whole concept of renting out your home for a short-term basis has been dealt with in a lot of tourist markets, or some of the bigger cities, but the vast majority of the country still has to decide how it's going to handle it. I know that in my building -- I live in downtown West Palm Beach, Florida -- you are only allowed to rent your property 11 times a year, and it has to be for at least a month. Some people rent for shorter terms and find clever ways around it by writing the lease for a month; and some people just flaunt the rules. That's going to become an issue. There's going to be taxation, there's going to be pushback from hotels. And for the next two or three years, I expect there to be a little bit of instability in that business as you see certain cities crack down, certain cities lighten up. But, that is all going to get worked out, largely because you can see where the economy is going. We're past the point where this whole gig economy -- and Airbnb and Vrbo fit into that, with an individual renting out their home to make extra money, for the most part. That's all going to happen. So, the near-term outlook is maybe a little bit uneven for that business. The three to five-year outlook is that this is going to be a growth area, and Expedia owns one of the two names that matters in the space. Yeah. That entire segment -- houses, apartments, non-hotel-like properties -- make up about 20% of all accommodations out there. You could see this certainly gaining traction over time. You made a great point about the regulatory landscape. Very similar to with Uber and . They're plowing ahead, and regulations then have to catch up. So I think, yeah, in the short term, you're going to continue to see some headwinds there.\u00a0Dan, if you had to pick as an investor between Booking Holdings and Expedia, which would you say is your top pick?I'm going to go and point out that I wouldn't invest in either for the reason I spoke of before. I think every brand that I'm regularly a customer of is going to figure out how to have a direct relationship with me. That is going to cut away some of my business from third-party booking services. If I had to pick, I believe in the Priceline branding more than I believe in the Expedia travel agent model. I think people want a deal, and I don't think the core Expedia offering offers a deal. There's convenience, and it's a very good product, the technology is great, but Priceline is somewhat of that lottery, where you might save a lot of money. And just for that reason, I'd be more inclined to do that. But honestly, I wouldn't invest in either one.Yeah, I can see the argument on both sides. I think if I had to choose one, it would probably be booking.com. I think that massive global presence -- granted, it's no longer a growth story. There's not a growth story for Expedia, either, right now. But I think that massive European presence, and their partnerships that they're making with OTAs in China, as well, are intriguing to me. I think, as Booking tries to strengthen its network effects through acquisitions, and really trying to stand up a lot of these other verticals that they're going after, the concern for me is, with so many different brands -- this even applies to Expedia -- how do they make sure that they stay focused? At one point, Booking was even into mortgages, they were doing gas. I do worry about that over time. But I'd say, just given the size and the scale, and having that, especially when you're competing with the likes of Google and Amazon, I would probably give the hat tip to Booking. To give a last thought, we mentioned Open Table. Booking owns Open Table, which is a restaurant reservation service. They make money by the restaurants paying them, I don't know if it's per booking or there's a monthly fee, but it's a different model. What they've been doing recently is integrating Open Table into Priceline. Probably other services as well, but I've seen it at Priceline. So when you go in to look at your hotel room, you have a button right there that says, \"show nearby restaurants.\" And it shows them in Open Table. And you can very easily make a reservation. It takes some of the guesswork out of, \"Gee, how far from my hotel is that restaurant?\" And you can see that becoming a platform, where it integrates across a lot more areas, that gives an added value to what Priceline, what booking.com, what all their other services are doing in general. It's kind of an outlier of a product, but it actually strengthens the whole brand. And frankly, it makes a lot more sense than being the Priceline of mortgages, which I think they were at one point.Yeah, totally true. And, they're also doing this attractions business, where they're trying to generate some revenue off of some of the activities and tours and things that you do when you go to some of these cities. They're certainly trying. Again, this is not a growth story. I think, if you're an investor, as long as you recognize, this isn't really a growth story right now, it's going to be slow-going. But all in all, I think staying away until we get a better idea of what is going to happen on the competitive landscape makes the most sense.I'm with you on that.

The markets for buying and selling penny stocks is illiquid, easily influenced, and highly speculative -- all factors that make successful penny stock investing difficult. If you're looking for high-upside stocks and are willing to take some risk, three Motley Fool contributors have companies you should consider before buying penny stocks:  , \u00a0, and \u00a0.\u00a0 I know firsthand just how . I focused exclusively on buying them when I started investing because I mistakenly believed it was better to own lots of shares of a $1 stock than just a few shares of a\u00a0$100 stock.\u00a0My instincts were dead wrong. Nearly every single \"cheap\" stock I bought ended up losing me money. Why? Because they tend to be lousy businesses that aren't profitable and have no competitive advantage. Wall Street punishes these bad businesses by knocking down their share price to under $1.I later learned that the price of a single share is meaningless. It doesn't matter if you own one share or 1,000. What matters is how much capital you have invested in a company and\u00a0.\u00a0Consider Booking Holdings, the parent company of popular travel sites including Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com, Agoda.com, and more. One share of this company costs $1,952 right now,\u00a0so the old me would have instantly written this company off as \"too expensive.\" However, Booking is expected to earn $101.98 in profit per share in 2019, and that number is expected to jump to\u00a0$115.76 in 2020. Some quick math shows that shares are trading for . That's cheaper than the average company in the.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Booking Holdings is still in growth mode, too. Market-watchers expect Booking's profits to grow by more than 12% annually over the next five years. That's a very respectable number for a business currently valued at more than $80 billion.I know it can be a psychological challenge to buy a share of stock when it looks on the surface to be so \"expensive,\" but  needs to learn to look past the share price and make decisions based on the company's underlying value. Booking Holdings is a great example of that principle in action.Penny stocks have a certain allure to risk-seeking investors, because their low prices and high volatility create an opportunity for big, quick returns.However, long-term investors are better off avoiding the kind of pump-and-dump, fly-by-night names often found among penny stocks. Instead, growth-seeking bargain-hunters may want to look at ANGI Homeservices, which has fallen to less than $10 a share and seems to offer considerable upside potential.Created in 2017 from the merger of\u00a0's\u00a0 HomeAdvisor and Angie's List, ANGI Homeservices is now the country's biggest marketplace for home services including plumbing, painting, general contracting, and small jobs such as house cleaning. The company has also delivered solid growth through the first half of this year, with revenue up 18%, and appears to have a good foundation from which to build a network of sustainable competitive advantages, as the company provides a valuable service connecting buyers and sellers of home services. The company should also see a long-term tailwind over the next 10 or 20 years as more millennials, who grew up with the internet, become homeowners.Nonetheless, the market has been skeptical of the stock, and shares fell to a post-merger low recently, after the company slashed its EBITDA guidance in its , because of challenges related to search-based marketing. Those issues, which centered on Google traffic that came from paid rather than free clicks, seem largely fixable and temporary. That means now looks like a great time to scoop up some shares of ANGI Homeservices, with the stock down 57% over the past year, as the long-term value proposition and growth strategy are very much intact.\u00a0Some investors flock to penny stocks with the allure of dream-like overnight returns. Many of those investors choose to overlook that penny stocks  to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, making them much more risky and speculative. If you're willing to accept such risk and volatility from a stock, take a look instead at a stock such as NIO, a Chinese premium electric-vehicle (EV) maker that offers high-risk, high-reward returns but meets more stringent rules and regulations to trade on the NYSE. data by It's been a tough ride for NIO investors since the company's initial public offering. NIO's business has faced headwinds that include a decline in China's passenger vehicle sales on a year-over-year basis for 13 of the past 14 months, although electric vehicles have been slightly more resilient to the slowdown, increasing U.S. and China trade tensions that has made everything more uncertain, and a battery recall that included 4,803 of its ES8 cars.While trade tensions and China's automotive slowdown are out of NIO's control, it has managed to complete its battery recall in roughly half of its original projected timeline and believes August sales will rebound for a much stronger month. The company is also well positioned as a premium EV maker in China, which in 2018 accounted for more than half of global EV sales, at 1.2 million units. In 2025, it's anticipated that China's EV sales will hit 5 million units and that by 2040 will account for almost 70% of global vehicle sales. That's a serious growth story.\u00a0NIO has hit a speed bump over multiple challenges, but there's no denying the premium EV maker has huge upside, as China's EV market is poised to surge in the coming decades.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The operator of online travel booking websites including booking.com, kayak, and Priceline has shown solid growth for the past two decades. 2019 has seen growth slow at the company, leading the stock t0o trade off by as much as 20% from its all-time high in 2018. The company is taking advantage of the dip in stock price to buy back stock -- will this strategy pay off for shareholders?When Booking turned in its , investors were relieved to see the company beat expectations, but that didn't change the fact that growth has slowed significantly from the mid-teens rate of 2018. The company reported revenue growth of 8.9% and  growth of just 2.1% in Q2 2019 compared with Q2 2018.Data source: Booking Holdings financial reports. as key contributors to the slowdown in revenue growth. Because Booking generates most of its sales internationally but reports its financial statements in U.S. dollars, a strengthening dollar decreases the value of its revenue after considering currency conversion. The company noted that revenue growth would have been 14% if currencies had not fluctuated from the prior year.The company's paltry 2.1% operating income growth was pinned on a combination of rising paid advertising costs and investments being made to build out new technology capabilities and products. Buying key travel terms on search engines such as Google (owned by  is not as cost-effective as it once was for spurring growth. In addition, Booking has been investing in its payments platform and initiatives to improve its non-hotel bookings capabilities, such as apartment sharing and local activities. These investments have caused expenses to grow faster than revenue for the time being.Image Source: Getty Images.Despite the headwinds from foreign currency conversion and investments being made in the business, Booking is still riding the long-term tailwind of growth in online travel bookings driven by an increasing desire for people around the world to travel and the growing preference to make accommodations online, as opposed to offline. This is evident from the 11.8% growth in room nights booked, a strong indicator of organic growth. However, the company has cautioned investors of low guidance, implying a continuation of sub-10% growth through the balance of the year.While growth has recently slowed for Booking, it still generates a healthy amount of cash flow. In recent years, the company has used some of this cash flow to buy back its own stock, reducing its share count and helping to grow earnings per share. data by As the company's stock price has faltered over the past year, it has doubled down on . For the first six months of 2019, Booking spent $5.5 billion on share repurchases, more than twice the $1.9 billion it spent on repurchases during the first half of 2018.By stepping up purchases of its own stock, Booking is signaling that it believes its stock is cheap and worth buying at current levels. Of course, reducing the share count also has the effect of improving growth in earnings per share because of the smaller denominator. This can help Booking show continued strong EPS growth, even if organic earnings growth is tepid.Investors have apparently reset their expectations for lower growth at Booking . Q2 2019 saw current headwinds mute revenue growth, while the company put a damper on its margins by spending aggressively on investment initiatives.Looking out over the long term, Booking still has growth tailwinds from a rise in travel spending. The current slowdown most likely will turn out to have been a bump in the road. If that's the case, the aggressive buyback program at the current stock price will be looked upon favorably and accelerate the recovery in the stock price.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We'll dive into two of the major online travel and reservation sites, Booking Holdings and Expedia. Two companies, Dan, they control over 70% of the online travel market. That is huge to me.Yeah. I will say, both companies have made travel easier and harder. Back when I first started traveling for business -- I'm 45, my first business trip came when I was 20, so you can do the math there. A lot of years ago. We called a travel agent who had magic tools in front of her, probably some sort of computer, and figured out what the best price was for what we were trying to do. Now, when I book travel -- and I travel two or three times a month; I come up there usually once a month -- when I book travel, there's always this nagging suspicion that I've somehow left money on the table because when you look at the various properties owned by Booking, which include Priceline, KAYAK, booking.com itself; or Expedia, which owns Expedia, Hotwire and a whole bunch of other things, there's all sorts of different ways to book travel, and it's not always easy to figure out which one to use. And that benefits these companies.That's a good point. Let's actually dive right into Booking Holdings. This would be the largest of the two. Actually, just from a market cap standpoint, it has a market cap of $82 billion right now. The company previously known as Priceline, and it's gone through a couple of name changes. Now it's known as Booking Holdings, ticker BKNG. Dan, I was looking at Booking Holdings. 2019 hasn't necessarily been a great year for them so far. At one point, they were down nearly about 20% off of their highs from 2018. But, tell us first, what is Booking Holdings? They've got a lot going on. They're a collection of travel sites; in addition to that, they own Open Table, which is somewhat of an outlier, though it's obvious to see how restaurant reservations and travel match up pretty well. But, their core sites in the U.S. are booking.com, which is kind of a traditional travel site -- you go to booking.com and you say, \"I want to visit Orlando a week from now. I'd like to stay in a hotel, and I don't want to make any stops.\" And it gives you the best pricing or the most convenient pricing -- it actually gives you multiple options. Sometimes it's the cheapest, and the cheapest can be really strange, like, you leave from one airport and fly home to another. And, you can pick cheapest or best, and all sorts of different options.Priceline is a travel bidding site. This is actually my site of choice. What happens on Priceline is, you can go in and you can see what's available and what the prices are. Then, you have a couple of other options. Priceline is famous for its Name Your Own Price tool. What that means is, I can say, \"You're showing me hotels in Alexandria, Virginia downtown. The cheapest hotel is the Westin for $199 a night.\" That's where I usually stay. \"I don't think that's the best deal I can get.\" So, you have two options. You can go into Express deals. Express deals will show you the area of the hotel, how many stars it is, and what its rating is -- basically, do people like it or not, on a 0% to 100% scale. And you can say, \"Alright. I want a three-star hotel, Alexandria, Old Town, I don't care what it is,\" and you get it, and it comes back, and it's one of four hotels because there's only a few in the area, and you're relatively happy with it. Or, you can do Name Your Own Price, which doesn't show you any price. You say, \"Alright, I want a three-star hotel,\" same thing, \"downtown, Old Town, Alexandria. I'm only willing to pay $75 for it.\" And you put that offer in, and it might come back to you one of three ways. It can reject your offer. They might come back and say, \"Hey, nobody's willing to sell it to you for $75. But if you increase your offer to $92, you have a really good chance.\" In fact, I've almost always gotten my room when it does that. The third choice is, it comes back and says, \"Hey, you didn't get it,\" and you have the option to go in and make some changes. You can lower your star rating, you can add another area, you can change your dates. And it becomes this game of, how low will the hotel go? Same thing for airfare. And, when it comes to airfare, there's certain parameters. You can say, \"No redeyes.\" But, if it's a short trip, you might find yourself booking tickets that leave late Monday night and really early Wednesday morning, and it minimizes your trip. So you have to be really careful, but I find that it's an area where you can save a lot of money if you're not married to one particular brand or another. Dan, I have to ask -- I've never used Priceline, but in using that service, the Name Your Own Price tool, what's your success rate when you submit a price? Would you say 90% of what you submit gets accepted? What does that look like, percentage-wise? If I'm using Name Your Own Price, it's probably 60/40. That said, I'm only going to use Name Your Own Price in an area I know really well. For example, Alexandria is not a big city. When you look at how Priceline in its full disclosure area breaks it up, you can see that there's four to five three-star or four star-hotels that are sort of close to the office. The farthest one away is a little bit far in the winter, so you might want to take an if it's snowing or it's really cold out. I know the area, and nine months out of the year, if I do a blind bid, I know that yes, I want to get the Westin or one of the two or three hotels very close to the office; on the other hand, I won't be upset if I get the one that's about 1.25 miles away. So, I know the area; I know every possible hotel it's going to put me in; and I'm comfortable doing a blind bid.Sometimes I'm less comfortable doing a blind bid. Maybe I got rejected on one and I need to expand my area, or I couldn't get the Express deal I wanted, and I want to try different things. In those cases, you really just have to do your homework. Look at what's around, figure out what the brands are. You can see what was just booked. And sometimes, if you do the Express deal, it gives you little hints, like, \"You've stayed here before.\" Well, if I've only stayed at one hotel in that area, I know what it is. If I've stayed at two or three, you have to think, \"Gee, did I like all those hotels?\" When I stay out by Baltimore near the casinos, there's three or four hotels of the same star range, and two of them are walking distance and two of them are not, and sometimes I'd really prefer being walking distance, so it makes sense to not do a blind bid and to book something when I know what it is.So, you have to be very, very strategic, and you have to do your homework.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shares of  stock -- the company formerly known as  -- are surging, up 7.3% at $1,955 (yes, you read that right) as of 12:40 p.m. EDT Thursday after the purveyor of online reservations for hotels and plane tickets reported estimate-busting earnings for its fiscal second quarter of 2019 last night. \u00a0Expected to earn $22.71 per diluted share on sales of $3.85 billion, Booking instead reported that it earned $23.59 (pro forma) on sales of $3.9 billion, a clear earnings \"beat.\"Image source: Getty Images.Well, maybe not clear. When calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (), Priceline's earnings for the quarter were actually only $22.44 -- and to its credit, this is the number that Booking Holdings highlighted in its report. GAAP profits grew 11% year over year, faster than the company's 9% sales growth.That being said, Wall Street analysts like to back out certain items from earnings reports, making it easier for companies to \"hit their numbers.\" They gave their estimates for Booking's profits in pro forma format -- and Booking dutifully \"beat earnings\" by that same standard.And things should only get better from here, at least from the perspective of profits. As CEO Glenn Fogel pointed out in Booking Holdings' report, the company is now preparing to move from \"a solid start to the summer travel season\" and transition into \"our peak travel season\" -- when the money should really flow.In the third quarter, Booking believes it could earn anywhere from $42.60 to $43.60 per share (GAAP) and from $43.60 to $44.60 (pro forma), with sales up anywhere from 4% to 6% over Q3 2018 levels. Taken at the midpoint, that pro forma guidance exceeds the $43.97 per share that Wall Street will be looking for, though Booking's guidance is below the 8% growth Street analysts predict.How will Wall Street react if per-share result happens?

Online travel giant  has seen its growth rates slow steadily over the past several years, but it's also done a good job of managing short-term expectations and then consistently exceeding them.Coming into Wednesday's second-quarter financial report, Booking Holdings investors were comfortable with the idea that sales and earnings growth would slow from past levels, but they still wanted to see . Booking did give investors more than they were expecting, and that was enough to satisfy them heading into the key summer travel season.Booking Holdings had solid gains in the second quarter. Revenue of $3.85 billion was up 9% from year-ago levels, and that exceeded the 6% growth rate that most of those following the stock were expecting to see. Adjusted net income inched higher by 2.4% to $1.03 billion, but a big reduction in share count lifted adjusted earnings to $23.59 per share, easily outpacing the consensus forecast among investors for $22.71 per share.Image source: Booking Holdings.The fundamental performance that Booking Holdings got from its component businesses showed some signs of new life. Hotel room-nights booked rose nearly 12% year over year to 213 million, which was a faster pace than the company has seen recently. Rental car days were up for the first time in four quarters, rising 1.2% to 21 million, and Booking sold 2.4% more airline tickets.Overall, gross travel bookings were up 5% to $25.0 billion. Most of Booking Holdings' revenue growth came from the merchant side of the business, where the top line grew 35% year over year. Some of that merchant revenue gain came about as a result of a correction in the timing of about $53 million that was previously deferred in the first quarter of 2019. The much more modest rise of less than 2% in agency revenues stood in stark contrast to the merchant numbers, and advertising revenue split the difference with a 9% rise.CEO Glenn Fogel didn't have a lot to say about the results. \"Booking Holdings executed another strong quarter,\" Fogel said, \"as we witnessed a solid start to the summer travel season.\" The CEO lauded the performance of the key hotel segment during the period.Booking knows that the critical part of its 2019 performance lies dead ahead. As Fogel put it, \"As we move into our peak travel season, our teams are focused on delivering exceptional service to all of our customers and partners around the world.\"As we've seen countless times before, however, Booking Holdings' guidance didn't set a particularly high bar. The company sees gross travel bookings in the third quarter rising just 1.5% to 3.5%, with sales set to rise 2% to 4%. Room nights booked should climb at a 6% to 8% pace, and Booking is looking for adjusted net income of between $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion for the period. That would work out to adjusted earnings of $43.60 to $44.60 per share, and that's in line with investor projections for $43.97 per share.Booking Holdings shareholders looked happy about the results, and the stock climbed almost 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement. So far, the online travel giant has done an exceptional job of managing the inevitable slowdown in growth rates that comes from assuming a . If it can continue to do so, then shareholders will continue to celebrate quarters like this one -- even if the growth Booking enjoys is just a shadow of what it saw earlier in its existence.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company generates its revenues through two advertising products: Travel and Local.Travelzoo operates across three geographical segments: North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, which contribute 61%, 32% and 7% of the total revenues, respectively. North America and Europe segments are recognized as the company\u2019s core operations and have been reporting nearly flat revenues for the last three years.The Asia Pacific segment has been a drag on the company\u2019s growth and profits since it was reacquired in 2015. Though the number of members has remained flat at around 3.5 million, total revenues from the Asia Pacific segment have declined by 20% in the last two years. Moreover, the segment\u2019s continued losses have been weighing on the company\u2019s operating profits, which declined from 17% in 2014 () to 5% in 2017.Over recent quarters, Travelzoo\u2019s management has hired a consulting firm in China to revive its Asia Pacific operations. While the Asia Pacific segment has clearly been on the decline over recent quarters, the trends in the core business have been much more unpredictable, with revenues as well as expenses swinging considerably from one period to the next. These spikes in the core business\u2019 profitability are primarily responsible to the sharp price changes.In fact, the company\u2019s stock has followed the trend of the overall operating margin quite closely, as highlighted in the chart below.

That  is home to many of the country's most successful businesses, including e-commerce titan\u00a0and fast-food giant\u00a0. But what defines a , and which ones dominate their industries?Below, we'll answer those key questions and take a closer look at the 10 biggest consumer discretionary stocks on the market.Image source: Getty Images.A consumer discretionary stock is a business that markets goods or services to people with money to spend over and above their baseline needs. Put another way, it's a company that deliveries luxuries or products that aren't considered essential to a household's monthly budget.Consumer discretionary stocks differ from \"\" on that key point because staples sit in non-negotiable spending categories like personal hygiene, groceries, and home cleaning. Discretionary purchases, on the other hand, involve categories such as travel, home improvements, and eating out. Basically, if it's something that you'd cut out of your budget during tough economic times, it's discretionary.The segment is made up of 11 industries, including non-grocery retailing, household durables, e-commerce retailing, automobiles, hotels, restaurants and leisure, and apparel. Together, these account for $5.5 trillion of  as of mid-2019 to make them fourth in size out of the 11 broad sectors that constitute the U.S. economy. The consumer discretionary segment is far larger than the $3.7 trillion of stocks that comprise consumer staples, but that gap has a lot to do with the fact that markets have been in a long period of expansion. Discretionary stocks tend to fare better during , while consumer staples hold up particularly well during .If investor attraction to these stocks could be boiled down to one factor, it would be growth. Consumer spending powers most economic growth in the U.S. economy, and so companies that operate in this segment can see long periods of rising sales. Their often-premium services command high prices, too, and that fact can translate directly into robust earnings growth.A major drawback to that positioning is that these businesses can endure sharp slowdowns during industry downturns. Thus, investors must be prepared to tolerate  as part of natural industry boom-and-bust cycles that don't apply as much to consumer staples.Here are the 10 largest companies in the consumer discretionary segment, as ranked by market capitalization, or the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock.Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Market capitalization data as of July 27, 2019.Here are some important things for investors to know about each of these consumer discretionary giants. has come a long way since CEO Jeff Bezos launched a tiny website in the late '90s with ambitions to disrupt the book industry. It has gone on to reshape global retailing and routinely accounts for nearly half of all online sales.As opposed to a \"staples\" retailer like , which dedicates a huge portion of its selling space to groceries, Amazon's  is consumer electronics. It traditionally hasn't made much profit from these sales, with most of its earnings going right back toward building out the massive distribution network that's required to put most of the population within its one-day shipping fulfillment window.Yet investors still love this stock, in part because of the lead it is building in a massive industry that has many years of market-beating growth ahead. Consider that the e-commerce segment has roughly doubled as a percentage of the broader retailing world in the 10 years between 2009 and 2019, but in that time Amazon's annual sales have rocketed higher by over 800%. There could be decades of further growth for Amazon given that e-commerce sales still only sit at about 10% of the broader retailing industry. illustrates some of the biggest risks (and benefits) of investing in a consumer discretionary stock. The retailer saw its sales and profitability metrics slump in the wake of the 2008-2009 Great Recession as consumers  to help shore up their finances. Revenue and operating profit margin both declined 40%, and the company chose to hold its dividend steady for a period of almost three years to compensate. Since then, though, shareholders have benefited from growth for ages, with annual revenue on pace to almost double in the decade ending in 2020 to roughly $120 billion.The investor attraction to this business is clear when you compare it to its closest rival, Lowe's (see No. 7 below). Home Depot routinely  on key growth metrics like customer traffic, market share, and sales. It churns far more profit out of each sales dollar, too. Home Depot's management team is famously adept at allocating capital, including by aggressively repurchasing shares in recent years. These assets serve investors well, whether or not the housing market is in a cyclical upturn.The restaurant industry is famously brutal, with a sky-high failure rate, razor-thin profit margins, and shifting consumer tastes that always threaten to crush a given business. Yet  has parried these challenges as it captured, and defended, the fast-food crown over the last few decades.Part of the allure of this business comes from its unparalleled scale and brand power. There are 36,000 restaurants sprinkled across almost every country in the world, after all. And Mickey D's near-staple status in consumers' food budget is reflected in the fact that the Big Mac recently celebrated its 50-year anniversary and is still a core menu item. The chain also avoids many of the financial risks inherent in this industry by operating under a .McDonald's isn't immune from shifts in consumer preferences and lately has had to make major changes to its menu to introduce fresher ingredients and more premium food and drink options. It has also poured resources into remodeling and upgrading its stores, including by adding online ordering and delivery functionality. Yet the fact that McDonald's can spend  on that growth initiative in a single year helps illustrate just how hard it would be for smaller rivals to challenge the fast-food leader.A leader in athletic apparel,  earns money by producing and marketing footwear and clothing to athletes around the world. The company routinely outgrows smaller industry peers, in part because its global scale allows it to spend billions on advertising and marketing, or what management calls \"demand creation\" expenses. These include sponsoring events like the World Cup and the Olympic Games and signing up world-class professional athletes as brand ambassadors. Nike spent $3.7 billion on marketing support in fiscal 2018 alone.The company relies on innovative product releases across its dozens of sub-brands (including Air Jordan, Converse, and React) to drive sales growth. Increasingly, those products are being marketed  through Nike's app and websites rather than through its retailing partnerships with companies like . This shift promises to lift  over time because direct sales are about twice as profitable as wholesale sales.Many companies, including \u00a0and , have targeted the same consumer niches as Nike. However, as long as the company maintains its innovative lead, its  make it difficult to take away any of its market share. has built a global empire by making premium coffee drinks seem more like a staple part of consumers' budgets than a luxury, once-in-a-while splurge. The beverage giant rewarded investors handsomely along the way, too, with its phenomenal growth powering a  for shareholders in the 22 years following its 1992 IPO.The company's growth opportunities are much smaller today given that its stores already blanket the core U.S. geography, as well as many international markets. But it would be a mistake to believe that Starbucks can't continue delivering for shareholders.The chain has several major expansion initiatives in the works today, including repeating much of its U.S. growth success in China and using mobile ordering and delivery to dramatically boost its addressable market. Its success ultimately rests on its ability to continuously  by delivering a cafe experience that consumers value enough to make a part of their daily routines. Starbucks hasn't wavered far from that ambitious goal through its first few decades as a public company, and that success suggests more gains ahead for the business -- and the stock.Spending on vacations tends to rise sharply during economic boom times, and , formerly known as Priceline Group, is a major beneficiary of that bounce. Through its network of travel booking sites including Booking.com, Priceline, and Kayak, it earns commissions on everything from hotel stays to flights and rental cars. The company has seen phenomenal growth in recent decades thanks to several major trends, including the shift toward self-directed vacation bookings over the use of travel agencies. Booking Holdings reported $14.5 billion in revenue in 2018, up from $12.7 billion the previous year.Its tech roots mean that Booking Holdings must continuously improve its e-commerce shopping experience, which mainly occurs through desktop and mobile devices. Its major assets that contribute to this experience include a large portfolio of bookable rooms, flights, and restaurant reservations; competitive prices; and a smooth purchasing process supported by customer reviews. In some years, spending on these priorities might . However, Booking Holdings shareholders can be reasonably confident that these investments will continue paying off by delivering market share gains in this attractive industry. has a well-deserved reputation for consistently playing catch-up with industry leader Home Depot. But the retailing chain is an attractive business in its own right. Some of its best qualities include a long track record of growth and profitability through every part of the growth cycle -- and a dividend growth streak that's unmatched in the industry.Yes, Lowe's customer traffic and profit margins trail Home Depot's metrics routinely enough that investors can't assume the company will ever truly challenge its chief competitor on these points. Still, that performance gap often means the stock is available at a relative discount, both in terms of  and  valuations. That factor lessens the risk that investors will overpay when seeking exposure to the home improvement industry.Lowe's efforts to improve on its operating performance have  with the appointment of CEO Marvin Ellison, who was a highly placed executive at Home Depot for many years. Yet even if the chain continues to trail its peer, investor returns will be bolstered by the retailer's , which has plenty of room to grow given its modest payout ratio. \u00a0Like Starbucks,  straddles the line between consumer staple and consumer discretionary stocks. After all, the owner of the TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods brands has achieved growth through a wide range of selling environments, with comps rising in each of the last 23 years. That impressive streak is a testament to its off-price selling model, which takes advantage of inventory mismatches in the industry to offer high-quality merchandise to shoppers seeking deep discounts.A perennial worry on Wall Street is that TJX Companies' buying opportunities will dry up, either due to robust industry growth or better inventory management on the part of full-price peers. But that issue hasn't impacted the business, either during boom times or during retailing downturns. Investors can credit that success, in part, to the chain's flexible -- and constantly changing -- product mix. Customers visit the stores expecting a treasure-hunt atmosphere, and so they aren't disappointed when items come and go from the shelves.TJX's management team believes the chain still has room to significantly expand its store base, and its growth outlook is further bolstered by the fact that e-commerce represents just a tiny fraction of its annual revenue.

Since used products so easily meet most consumers' needs, and because new car purchases often require financing, these are among the first products that people cut out of the budget during stressful economic times.

The reasons lie not so much in the acts themselves, but rather what they signal about what preceded them.Stock splits, in which the share count rises and the price falls by a proportional amount, usually are done to lower the price per share and increase liquidity, which is a move that often happens after a stock's price has gone up. In contrast, reverse splits decrease the share count and increase the stock price. This usually happens after a stock has fallen by a lot. Often, a reverse split is done to stave off a de-listing from the stock exchanges; for instance, if a stock's share price falls below $1.Thus, should \u00a0 investors be worried about its recent reverse split? On July 5, the fintech loan marketplace underwent a 1-for-5 reverse split, decreasing its share count by 80% while boosting its share price from around $3 to roughly $15.However, here's why I think Lending Club is the rare case in which investors shouldn't panic over a reverse split.Lending Club executes a reverse-split. Image Source: Getty Images.One of the most frequent reasons companies choose to execute a reverse split is to avoid de-listing on major exchanges. However, this usually happens when a stock falls below $1 per share. In contrast, LendingClub's stock, even after its  from its 2015 IPO, had been rather resilient around the $3 per share mark for the better part of a year.Additionally, a stock only usually falls that far when a company has a significant amount of debt and bankruptcy is a possibility; however, that's not a concern for LendingClub. In fact, according to the company's recent summer , LendingClub has $373 million in cash. When added to the company's securities and consumer loans it's holding for sale, its total net cash and securities come to $671 million. That's half of the company's $1.3 billion . Additionally, while LendingClub has been unprofitable for the past few years, management expects the company to become profitable in the second half of 2019. So if avoiding de-listing isn't the reason, what is? In the press release, LendingClub CFO Tom Casey said, \"As we drive toward our profitability goal, we have a number of simplification and efficiency efforts under way. We are pleased that the reverse stock split will have the dual benefits of both reducing our cost basis and also opening up the stock to new investors.\"Of these two reasons, I think opening the stock to new investors is the main reason behind the move. Many institutions are prevented from buying stocks that are under $5, due to the perception they are risky, and that they line the pockets of brokers. While the effect of having a stock under $5 , there are likely some slight negative aspects.Additionally, LendingClub is looking to reduce costs for both itself and its investors. For investors, some (though not all) brokers charge commissions on a per-share basis, meaning trading more shares of LendingClub stock at a lower price could be more expensive than trading fewer shares at a higher price.Companies also have to pay the New York Stock Exchange annual listing fees on a per-share basis, amounting to $0.0011 per share.  At the end of the first quarter, Lending Club had about 434 million shares outstanding. After the reverse split, Lending Club will have around 87 million shares. The reduction should thus save Lending Club roughly $380,000 per year -- about the same amount as a salary for a C-suite executive.While a reverse split is usually a sign of trouble, that's not always the case. Famously, Priceline, now called  , executed a 1-for-6 reverse split  after the tech bubble burst; it's now valued at  its post-split stock price. LendingClub management will have a chance to explain the move, along with other cost-savings initiatives, on its  on Aug. 6. In fairness, LendingClub has actually executed quite well over the past couple of years, but investors still aren't buying the stock. Maybe a reverse split and second-half profitability will be what it needs to get going.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Go ahead, gentlemen. -- Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We are pleased to report that we produced a solid quarter, with 213 million worldwide room nights booked, which is up 12% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Our year-over-year non-GAAP revenue grew by 7% in U.S. dollars, but was up about 12% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 5% in U.S. dollars and about 10% when adjusted for FX, which was above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We are seeing encouraging signs in our business as we extended our global leadership position and accommodations and continued to execute against our long-term strategic vision of building a connected trip for our customers to become the global leader in travel and experiences.Today, we operate the largest online marketplace for accommodations, with the greatest global reach and scale. In the first half of the year, we produced over $50 billion in gross bookings and over 430 million booked room nights. We're investing against a large opportunity in the global accommodations market and are developing capabilities like payments, merchandising and loyalty, and expanding our focus in important customer and geographic segments. Our objective for payments is to provide all relevant payment options to customers and partners to power a frictionless global marketplace. This will benefit us by supporting key market growth, enable the connected trip, facilitate merchandising, and attract unique supply.To share, Booking.com's merchant transaction continues to steadily climb as customers can now pay Booking.com in over 45 countries, which represents about 80% of its focus markets. Enabled by the rollout of our payments platform, we have been pleased with the early results of our investments and merchandising capabilities. We view merchandising as an important part of our customer value proposition, which we believe will result in increased loyalty to our brand. Focusing on increased customer acquisition, frequency and loyalty, remains a significant growth opportunity for our core accommodations business. In these areas, we are continuing to focus on our mobile experience, expand the reach of our Genius program and offer incentives to bring customers to our site directly. We feel good about our progress here with both mobile and direct bookings going faster than our consolidated rate.These capabilities become more important as we continue to witness slowing pay channels. We are driving a deeper focus on specific accommodations segments that will strengthen the business and we believe will drive greater growth. Booking.com has built one of the largest alternative accommodations platforms, with approximately 6 million listings as of June 30. We are making good progress building greater supply choice in this segment, where we believe we have the best customer experience with all of our properties being instantly bookable with no consumer fees. We are also developing new capabilities to capture growth in other accommodation segments such as business travelers and destination-specific choices, such as ski and beach accommodations.We remain focused on select geographic opportunities such as the U.S., where we are continuing to promote our brand to drive awareness in this important market. We believe it is still too early to fully assess the current brand campaign, but we note that while we see solid direct new business or traffic growth, we would like to see faster progress in this region. In the longer term, we will meet our customer needs by building distinctive capabilities around the connected trip, removing friction along the entire travel journey. An early step was to integrate Rentalcars.com with Booking.com. Not only is Rentalcars.com operating a leading online rental car marketplace, but it is also building capabilities to book all forms of ground transportation. Today, we provide pre-booked car service in approximately 800 cities globally.Another step was to begin building out an attractions offering at Booking.com, which was accelerated with the acquisition of FareHarbor. FareHarbor is bringing more attractions online and now has over 100,000 bookable activities globally. Booking.com is utilizing this platform and to date, offers attraction in over 280 destinations. Booking is also providing the ability to have someone book experience even if they do not have an accommodation reservation. And while the number of destinations where someone can do this is small, as we're just starting out, we expect to grow the number of these markets over time. Attractions are an important part of the connected trip, and we're pleased with the very early data that shows, on average, customers have used our attractions product increase their frequency of combination bookings.Again, these are initial findings, but we like what we see to date. As a group, we have tremendous assets that we can utilize to help build the connected trip, and all of our brands will play a critical role in achieving this vision for the company. Priceline has extensive capabilities in the flight product and has recently developed a world-class packaging product that can be leveraged across our brand companies. Agoda brings extensive knowledge of the APAC region and years of data science and machine learning on merchandising. KAYAK's knowledge at operating a multiproduct global meta business helps us to better understand how to better serve our customers. OpenTable's leading online restaurant discovery and booking platform will be an important piece of our connected trip vision.As I commented earlier, we continue to focus on driving growth in accommodations through key initiatives in merchandising, payment, demand channels and inventory. That is job one. We also remain excited about the connected trip to drive loyalty and engagement across many dimensions of our business, which will help support and grow the accommodation business. As we move through our busy summer season, all of our employees are intensely focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience. I would like to thank our over 26,000 employees around the world for their hard work and dedication, especially during this peak travel season. And now I'd like to thank all of our supplier partners, who we are so proud to be associated with. And finally, we send a great thank you to our millions of customers throughout the world, who are out there experiencing the world.I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the financial review. -- Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the second quarter, and then discuss our guidance for the third quarter as well as our focus on the full year. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 12% for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance range. The Q2 room night outperformance was driven by strong growth in June as we saw a greater-than-expected benefit from lapping the low growth rate in June of last year, which was the results of the 2018 World Cup and unfavorable weather in Europe. While the macro environment in Europe remains cautious, our room night growth in the region continued to exceed our expectations this quarter.Room night growth rates for the rest of the world were largely in line with our expectations and continue to grow faster than Europe in Q2. Average daily rates for accommodation, or ADRs, were down about 1.5% in Q2 on a constant-currency basis, which was better than our guidance that's down about 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q2 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately 5% versus last year. We estimate the change in FX rates impacted Q2 gross bookings, revenue and EBITDA growth by a similar amounts and EPS growth rate by about 1% point more. Q2 gross bookings grew by 5% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 10% on a constant-currency basis, coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated non-GAAP revenue for the second quarter was $3.8 billion and grew 7% in U.S. dollars and by about 12% on a constant-currency basis.The shift in timing of the Easter holiday had a little less than a 3 percentage point positive impact on our Q2 revenue growth rate, a slightly greater impact than previously expected. Our Q2 non-GAAP revenue growth rate on a constant-currency basis and adjusted for Easter was about 9%. Advertising and other non-GAAP revenue, which is comprised mainly of KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 9% in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 was $1.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range, and was up 5% year-on-year on a reported basis and up about 10% on a constant-currency basis. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA growth rate on a constant-currency basis and adjusted for Easter timing was about 3%.We remain disciplined with our spending on performance marketing, which helped drive better than expected leverage of about 90 basis points in the quarter. Leverage in the quarter was driven by an increased mix in room nights from the direct channel, which continues to grow faster than our paid channels. While we keep working to grow our direct channel over time, we continue to see performance marketing channels as an effective way to acquire customers, and we'll spend rationally in these channels to optimize growth. As part of our effort to drive more direct traffic to our websites, we increased our spend on brand marketing in the quarter by 41% versus Q2 last year, which contributed about 110 basis points of deleverage. Sales and other expense grew 22% versus Q2 last year and contributed about 80 basis points of deleverage, primarily due to the growth of our payment platform of Booking.com.Sales in other grew slower than merchant gross bookings in the quarter due to lower growth in certain payment-related expenses. Finally, personnel expense came in slightly lower than our forecast and contributed a small amount of leverage in the quarter. Our non-GAAP EPS was $23.59, up 14% versus the prior year. Adjusted for currency and Easter timing, non-GAAP EPS grew 12% in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4% in Q2, which is about in line with the prior year and our estimated guidance. Our 10% lower share count in Q2 benefited EPS growth in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income grew -- increased by 2%, and GAAP operating margin decreased by 215 basis points compared to Q2 last year.GAAP operating income was also impacted by a $53 million favorable adjustment to revenue and a $66 million unfavorable adjustment to personnel expenses. Q2 GAAP net income amounted to $979 million or $22.44 per share, up 11% from Q2 2018. Our Q2 GAAP net income includes $17 million of pre-tax unrealized gains from our equity investments in Ctrip and Meituan, and $19 million of FX remeasurement losses on our eurobonds as well as the 2 adjustments impacting operating income. We exclude these unrealized gains, remeasurement losses and adjustments from our non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of 18.9% for the quarter, which decreased slightly from the prior year. In Q2, we generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, which increased 8% compared to Q2 of last year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 million, which increased by 10% compared to prior year.We repurchased $2.6 billion of our stock in Q2, which completed our previous $10 billion repurchase authorization in early May and reduced the amount outstanding under our new $15 billion repurchase authorization to about $14.2 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to complete this authorization in the next two to three years assuming stable business and market conditions. We ended the quarter with $11.4 billion of cash and investments and $8.7 billion of outstanding debt. Turning to our guidance. I want to briefly walk through some of the facts, as we discussed on the last call that will impact our outlook for the full year, then I'll come back to our guidance for Q3. Starting with our growth investments in 2019. As we discussed over the last 2 quarters, we're investing for growth, customer acquisition, and loyalty. Our new brand campaigns -- our new brand marketing campaigns were launched earlier this year.And while we're encouraged by the continued growth and mixed shift toward our direct channel and by some of the early new visited direct traffic trends we're seeing from our brand campaigns, the short-term return on our brand spending is running below our expectations. As a result, we plan on refining our spending levels on brand marketing in the second half of the year. We remain committed to building our brand. Turning to our merchandising programs. We continue to see positive results and plan to continue these investments. We are pleased with these merchandising results, but they'll take time to scale. Finally, with regard to our customer acquisition incentive programs, we're seeing some positive results and we'll continue to spend on the programs with better ROIs. As we told you earlier in the year, as we look at these growth investments, we'll evaluate and scale the ones that are working, and we'll not hesitate to pull back on the ones that are not.So we're intelligently refining our investments as we move through the year and are confident that these investments will benefit us in the long term. Overall, we continue to expect these growth investments will collectively reduce our EBITDA growth rate by a few percentage points in 2019. We now expect the return on these investments to be similar in the second half versus the first half, but the spending will be less in the second half, which results in a smaller negative impact on EBITDA growth in the second half. This change in our expectations does not have a material impact on our room night growth for the year. Now turning to the mechanical facts that's impacting our outlook. Our guidance for Q3 and the full year is impacted by the French digital services tax, which we expect will reduce Q3 and full year EBITDA by about $25 million and $32 million, respectively.This will reduce our Q3 and full year EBITDA margins by about 50 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively. This expense will be recorded in our G&A line. Using current FX rates assumed in our guidance, gross bookings and revenue growth through to non-GAAP EPS growth will be reduced by approximately 3 percentage points for the full year, which is in line with our outlook last quarter. Finally, our outlook does not anticipate any change in the macro environment. With that context, it remains our expectation that non-GAAP EPS on a constant-currency basis will grow in the low double digits in 2019. We continue to expect to gain share in global accommodations this year. Let's now turn our attention to Q3, which is our largest quarter of the year. Foreign exchange rates are expected to negatively impact year-on-year growth rates or gross bookings and revenue by approximately 2 percentage points, and for EBITDA our non-GAAP EPS by approximately 3 percentage points. We use a dollar-to-euro exchange rate of $1.12 when setting our Q3 guidance.Based on where we are in the quarter, and looking at all other factors, we're forecasting booked room nights to grow by 6% to 8% in Q3. As a reminder, Q3 last year benefited from the unusually late summer bookings season, which resulted in a slightly higher compare in Q3 this year. We forecast total gross bookings to grow 1.5% to 3.5% in U.S. dollars, and to grow by 3% to 5% on a constant-currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant-currency ADRs for the company will be down about 2.5%, which is a greater decline than we saw in Q2 due to lapping of the over 1% increase in ADR we experienced in Q3 of last year. We forecast Q3 revenue to be up 2% to 4% in U.S. dollars and grow by 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis.Q3 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $2.4 billion and $2.45 billion, which represents 2% to 4% year-over-year growth in U.S. dollars or 4% to 6% growth on a constant currency basis. We are forecasting continued leverage from the performance marketing expense line in Q3, reflecting lower volumes in the paid channels and our continued focus on acquiring high-quality traffic. As we refine our brand marketing spend that begins to comp against a higher spending Q3 last year, we expect to see a small amount of leverage from brand marketing in the quarter. Finally, sales and other expense is expected to grow faster than revenue, primarily due to the ramp-up of our payment platform at Booking.com. We are forecasting Q3 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $43.60 to $44.60. Normalizing for currency, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS to grow approximately 18% to 21%. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated tax rate of approximately 19%, which is lower than Q3 of last year due to a provision of the tax act that was clarified in Q4 of last year.We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 19% to 19.5% compared with 18.3% last year. Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 42.8 million shares, which is 10% below Q3 last year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $42.60 and $43.60 for Q3. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a tax rate of approximately 19%. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and an income from any further fluctuation currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, can we open the line for questions, please?Yes, your lines are now open for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. -- Hi. And thanks so much. Can you give us an update on what you're seeing in the environment to start the third quarter, both in terms of room nights growth trends and also advertising ROIs? And help us walk -- help walk us through that comp as you have initially the easier comps on heatwave and then the tough comp later in the quarter. -- Okay. Kevin, let me take that. So I think there's a couple of important things to understand relative to the Q3 guidance. You talked about some of them. Obviously, if you go back to June, we still have the strong guide, strong result in Q2 against relative easy compare. As I mentioned, what happened last year, that delayed summer booking season pushed more bookings into Q3, making a harder compare coming up. I think there's an important ways to step back and kind of look at what's going on across Q1 and Q2 and our Q3 guide because there's been a few normalizing factors. Obviously, Easter had impacts to the positive on Q1 from a room night point of view, and obviously, just the negative in Q2, and then the World Cup and weather has the opposite impact. It helps us to the positive in Q3 and to the negative -- as we said, it's positive in Q2 and then negative in Q3.If you kind of normalize for all those factors, essentially, the normalized room night growth of Q1, Q2, and Q3 projected are all in a similar band. And that's the way to kind of think about what's going on. Obviously, as we move through Q3, the compare gets a little harder because as we said, last year, we saw the majority of the growth in September, but we try and stay away from the kind of enter within the quarter monthly compares and give you a flavor of how the quarter's going to look and just remind you that our approach to guidance hasn't changed. -- Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then if I can ask one other question. Can you just give us an outlook for the digital tax across Europe as you see kind of legislation in other countries, and how you're expecting that to play out? -- Sure, Kevin. So you saw that France passed the tax, and there are a number of other countries that are also lining up to potentially put a similar tax into effect. We are, of course, very disappointed to have seen this. We believe companies should pay their fair share of taxes, but we want those taxes to be done equitably and fairly applied to all companies. So what has been applied does not do that. It's very hard to guess what's going to happen.You may have seen some of the remarks that have come out of the U.S. administration that we're very against the French tax, that believe it is focused primarily against American companies, and there have even been some remarks by the American administration about tariffs against France as a counter. So who knows how this is going to play out? End of the story is we can't write the laws. We can only lobby and express that we do not believe this DST is the right way to go forward to ensure that people are paying their fair taxes. -- Thanks, Glenn, and thanks, David.Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Yeah. I'm sorry, -- I'm so apologize for that. I was on mute. Two things. One, could you just talk about -- the brand advertising, it seems like you're not getting the kind of the results you'd like out of that. And when do you -- is there a time in which you kind of -- is it two years? Is it 1 year? You've been experimenting with brand advertising for well over a year. It's possible that the industry itself just doesn't lend itself well to brand advertising, that performance advertising really is the optimal marketing channel. When do you reach that point of go, no go, or maybe it's never that point? But just talk about what's the backstop in case display or brand advertising continues to underperform for you?And then, secondly, if I could ask, just talk about the synergies between accommodations and activities. Glenn, you mentioned it a little bit, but just briefly, are you seeing cases where you're getting customers that are coming in just for activities and you're able to cross-sell them on combinations? Or is it almost entirely go the other way? Just help us think about how much of an opportunity you could face in the next couple of years from the activities segment. -- Sure, Mark. So in terms of the brand advertising, let's say it's a mixed situation right now, but I think we laid it out really when David talked about it. We always want things to do better, but we've always been very clear in saying that we are a company that believes in experiment, test, see results and adjust if things aren't what we want them to be. So we're going to continue to do that. Though, as David said, we are going to be refining going for the second half of the year, in terms of what the spend will be. I do believe that brand advertising has an important part in the overall way to bring customers to us. Particularly, it brings us direct. And we've talked about this in the past how important it is for us to continue to build our direct business.That is one of our key strategies going forward. And I think if you look at some other people in the travel space, you will see that some who have achieved certain positive results by doing brand advertising. And we talked in the past how we believe that as things become more and more digitally based, brand advertising has the potential for being much more effective in terms of understanding what the ROIs will be. So in terms of when do you say, \"Oh, it's not working. Let's stop doing.\" I don't think that's ever going to happen. I think print advertising is always going to be important for anybody who's in the retail business. I do believe that we need to continue to work on this and improve upon it, and I'm looking forward to us doing that.In terms of your second question about the attractions business, we believe that attractions is a very important part of our connected trip. Nobody goes to a city to sit that he hotel. They want to do things. So we believe that providing something that is seamless, frictionless, easy to use and giving people all the information they need to do things, helps provide a better experience in terms of how they are going to get these attractions. We believe that, and we've seen it very slightly right now, and I said they are very early, but we're seeing benefit from people who have bought an attraction from us, achieved a very seamless, frictionless, easy-to-do thing, and for whatever reason, believe that this is the way we should book travel.And they are coming back more frequently. I don't know how big it will be yet, but I do know that we are pleased with the results so far, and we're going to continue to build on it. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're also slowly beginning to roll out the ability to buy attractions separate from having first bought an accommodation. I don't have any data to come back to you in terms of how much that's going to make people in the future come and sort of cross-sell these accommodation to them, but I do believe that by bringing people all the things they need when they travel, make it a one-stop place to shop, and giving them all the things they need, plus all the customer service that you can bring them in case something goes wrong and being able to fix everything at once, because when things go wrong, they cascade throughout the trip, I believe that provides a better result for the customers and one of the reasons that we will be able build greater loyalty. -- Okay. Thank you, Kevin. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Great, thanks a lot. So I just wanted to dig a little bit into the -- into your commentary, Glenn, about brand spending not being as efficient as you had expected. Is that -- are you referencing the spend you have made in the last 1 or 2 quarters? Or is it the spending that you have been making over the last few quarters, and you realized that it's not where you though it would come out to be? And how do I reconcile that with the fact that your direct traffic is still growing faster? -- Well, I am speaking specifically about the new campaign that we launched at the end of February. And how I reconcile that, the fact that we're still doing well, I guess would be that I'd like us to be doing better. I don't know how else to say that except I'd like to see do better. And again, I'm not saying it's not doing OK. I'm just saying I'd like it to do better. There are certain parts when you look at our brand health metrics that are good, and you look at some that you would like them to be better. As we said, we're always going to test and learn, and this is just another way that we're going to do it. -- Understood. And then a follow-up, if I may. On your outlook for the third quarter, what are you baking in, in terms of the macro environment and another Brexit deadlines sort of looming in October? -- Well, we take all factors when we're putting together our guidance, and we do it the same every quarter. We look at everything we can and put everything into the calculations, and this is what we come up with. I will say that we all recognize that there are some interesting things happening right now that may have some negative impacts on travel down the road. And everything from what you've recently seen, certain of those central banks have indicated that the macro environment may be weakening to certain other parts in terms of unrest between certain countries. U.S., China being a big one, and then, certain local things whether it be in Europe or others. So we've put everything together, and this is the number that we came up with.Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks. Two questions, if I can. First, Glenn, you guys have, obviously, strong assets across hotel booking, flight meta search, car rental, restaurants. So when you think about the long-term vision, to what extent are you guys just trying to kind of make the best of the assets you have versus looking at where the product should get to with a clean sheet of paper and kind of building to that vision? And how do you kind of see these things all working together versus maybe building some new things? And what is it going to take in terms of like a tech stack rebuild or otherwise to get there? And then, I guess, just a second one, Glenn, any big changes we should expect at Booking.com as you kind of take the reins as the CEO operating that asset moving forward? -- Yes. So Lloyd, in all things tech, you always would love to start everything with a green field, a clean sheet -- clean piece of paper and do everything with all the newest technology, but nobody ever has a chance to do that. You've already built old things that you now have to retro, refactor, bring things together. The vision is clear that we want to provide our customers with a seamless holistic system that gives and does everything for travel and makes their lives easier and gives more value to them. In certain areas, that's going to be put together fairly easily, and you're seeing it happen already. For example, a simple one, I've talked about it in the past. OpenTable. Now if you use the dining points that you get from OpenTable, you can use those and get a hotel, simple example. We mentioned that Priceline has a great new package product, and we're going to be leveraging that across all of our brand companies.Not that hard to do. Other things are going to require a little more effort, and I can't give you any sort of dollar amounts for investments. I can't give you a time line, but I can say that we have the best possibility, I believe, of anyone to put this together. Scale matters in these things, and we can afford to put the investments and then create this, one. Two, one of the key things to make these systems successful in the end, it's not just the technology, it's all the data you get from all the different parts of the travel ecosystem and put it together, along with the money you've invested and all your machine learning, your AI specialist, who create the personalization that really gives greater value to the customers. So I believe in the end, we have -- I believe we have an advantage over almost anybody. And what was your second question? -- The second question was just, how should we expect things to change at Booking.com now that you're kind of taking the reins as the CEO of that asset in addition to Group CEO? -- Well, it kind of ties to that first question, actually. One of the benefits that I've had is being part of bringing all the different companies into the group. So I know what they do well. I know where our strengths are, and I know how they can work together. And one of the key things is understanding all the senior management and all the different companies and helping us all work together to create this greater system. So that's one of the biggest reasons. The second reason is I want to bring the execution rate faster. I want to make things happen quicker. I believe that urgency is important in this business, and I want to come and bring this new holistic system to our customers faster. -- All right , thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. -- Great, thank you. Maybe one short term and one longer term. David, could you remind us your exposure to Brexit? I think that was one of the factors that maybe that were pushed out of 1Q bookings. Just exposure to the U.K. and how you see a no-deal Brexit? And then longer term, maybe, Glenn, this is for you. You beat bookings by $1 billion the quarter, better room nights. Are any of the longer-term initiatives -- I know you said branding maybe not as well, but merchandising is working, really making a difference at this point and give you encouragement on a longer-term basis? -- Okay. Sure. Justin, sure. So let me go to Brexit first. We've not disclosed how much the U.K. is. I think a couple of years ago, we went back in 2016 and said it was less than 10% of our business. And broadly, that's not too bad a data point to think about. What we see happening simply in these situations is around an event people might slow down, and they get nervous. But after the event, they kind of recover. So we saw that in the early part of the year that went. It looked like there was a Brexit going to happen in the early part of the year into the U.K. We saw a bit of a slowdown, then we saw a nice rebound in the market when it looked like that was being pushed off. So I think we do see some short-term sentiment changing around the actual event itself.Obviously, there's 2 factors today. There's what level of uncertainty is great. And then if there's any impact to the currency, does that devalue the pound? Does that make it more expensive for British travelers to go overseas? But generally, our experiences have been short term in nature and they rebound quickly. So it's hard to give a precise number. But as Glenn said, we kind of looked at all those things. Right now, of course, that's looking like a Q4 thing rather than a Q3 thing, but it's something that we're watching quite carefully. -- And in terms of what our investments to date and what we think that's done in terms of our result, for us, I think we have so much upside still ahead of us. We really haven't started to get the great benefits I believe we're going to get at what we're trying to create and all the things that we're spending money on. And I can give you some examples of things that I see down the road, and they all come together. And we've talked a little bit about attractions already. I believe that is a big win. Not a lot of people are using it yet. Yes, we have over 100,000 different things people can do. Yes, we have more cities, but that 200 and something locations, that's relatively small compared to the world, but even more so the awareness of it. So we're going to be pushing that out.The thing I mentioned about that ground transportation, I believe when you can provide a much more efficient, seamless way to get that ride from your home to the airport, to the hotel, and then to do things, I believe that's going to help increase things.When I look at things like we've talked about our investments in Grab and DiDi, we have not yet rolled out those apps that will enable the people to be able to get around very efficiently using the Booking.com or the Agoda apps. So there's so many things down the road that we have not yet begun to actually see the results in the top and bottom lines. And I am just very encouraged about the future. -- Great, thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I have 2. Glenn, just to go back to sort of the connected trip and sort of your comments about frequency. You mentioned it a little bit, in the previous question, but we've seen OpenTable partner with Caviar and GrubHub and UberEats. Just talk to us about how you think about potentially using food delivery a high-frequency purchase potentially helping the overall booking business grow faster in the U.S. Is that potentially a way to grow it even better than branded advertising? And the second one, a couple of quarters ago, you gave us an update on the size of the alternative accommodations business. We think it's growing pretty quickly. Any help at all on how fast that business is growing? Or how large that piece is becoming in the overall room nights? -- So let me just do the second part first because that's relatively easy. We haven't given any more disclosure about that. I should say they're still growing faster than our other -- our main hotel business. So that's about the only color I can give you to date on that. In regards to OpenTable, there are really 2 things to think about here. There's the thing I've always talked around the past. The reason we bought OpenTable, and we always joke about it and I say it all the time, that 100% of our customers, when they're traveling, don't eat at home. So this is a great service to provide to them. But the other thing which you mentioned, which is something a little different, and it actually is an important thing, and that is the awareness factor.And if you look at one of the companies that we've made an investment in, in China, Meituan, which really started out with the delivery business, and then moved into the travel business, and using high frequency of food delivery to develop a customer base that was then pushing out of travel, that is a way to help increase the awareness of your travel business. So that is a positive. Now whether better or worse than brand advertising, I don't have ROIs in front of me because we're just rolling it out right now, but I do see that as a way to help increase the awareness of our travel business. And again, also to merchandising opportunities that come to mind in terms of when you have more than one service, you can do all different types of value plays. It helps make people want to continue to come and use your service more often. -- Great, thanks.Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays Capital. Your line is open . -- Great, thanks for taking the questions. So first one, I wanted to ask about the customer acquisition programs like loyalty and referrals? David, you've noted that they are performing better. Are the ROIs on these programs currently comparable with some of the other performance standards? Or when do you think we can reach that? And then how big are these programs currently in terms of driving transactions? And then the second piece of it, also for David, the 12% room night that you reported was very strong, right about your forecast. Clearly, 3Q, as you pointed, is kind of like a unique quarter. Trends were being strong later last year. So should we think of the 3Q guide in the context of extra conservatism for the uncertainty in the back end that you haven't seen this year? -- Okay. Let me take 2 those questions, Deepak. So now I commented on the customer acquisition programs. So if you remember, they were one of the 3 areas that we were investing. We talked about the -- a few points of EBITDA growth investments would cost us this year. And there was one of the 3 areas, with obviously, merchandising and brand being the other 2. As I mentioned, we see positive results on some of those programs, not all of them, but we're always moving our spend toward the ones that have the higher ROIs. We're not in a position to make a comparison here between the different brands, but positive ROI compared to our expectations.And then also, for obvious reasons, we're not going to sit here and tell you exactly which ones are working or not either, and you wouldn't want us to either think either as members of our environments. But we're pleased about the ones that -- we rolled out a number of them. We've obviously pulled some back. We've focused upon some. The ones that we are now focused upon are doubling down on we think our ROIs and our driving growth. As I mentioned, the early stages, in totality, these investment programs, they're not making a huge difference to our room night growth this year.I talked about the fact we now expect the returns are going to be more similar across the first half and the second half. So now that's the color I can give you on the customer acquisition programs. Back to Q3 room night guide, I'm not going to repeat what I said on the first -- on the answer to the first question. I've covered a number of points on that, but I think that what you should assume is that our approach to guidance hasn't changed. We cannot look at everything in front of us, and I think we are consistent in terms of how will we call our guidance and what our expectation is vis-a-vis guidance. I'd say, obviously, these year-on-year compares when you are looking at comparing unusual events make our process just a little bit harder.And obviously, we were pleased to the positive in June, and we know we have a strong compare coming up against us in September. But as we said, we cannot factor all into account, plus the macro things that Glenn talked about, and give us -- and give you our best view of guidance taking those things into account and try to be consistent in terms of how we do that vis-a-vis our expectations.Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Hi, This is Dae Lee on for Doug. Just a question on reducing friction. You talked about it a lot. And you talked about the ways you could do that across kind of a trip. But looking more specifically on the accommodations side, are there consumer pain points that you think you could help improve going forward? I assume payments help there, but are there other areas where you see opportunity? And then, turning to accommodation. In the past, you talked about wanting to onboard more single unit supply. Could you give us an update on how you're doing there? -- So in terms of reducing that friction, and you mentioned payments there is a very important area, people want to pay in different ways, but not every accommodation has the ability or even once have the ability to accept payment that way. As you know, Booking.com grew up on an agency platform where the customer paid at the desk, at the hotel, at the end of the stay. That doesn't work so well. If somebody wants to use M-Pesa or Paytm, and I can go through an incredibly large number of different payment methods. We removed that friction. Somebody can come to us and use the payment method they want, and we're then able to pay to accommodation an easy way. So right away, that's removing a part of the friction that goes much beyond that.And so, for example, in the attractions, when somebody has already booked a hotel with us in Booking.com and then goes to get an attraction, I've used the service, and I'm looking at something to do, I just one click, my payment method is already in the Booking.com system. I don't have to do anything else. So when I'm going, I'm just showing a QR code at the place of attraction, and I'm through the line. Much easier. Really removes that issue. And even more so, you can do all friction merchandising we talked about, suppliers that want more demand can offer up to us lower prices that we can then push out to our customers and bring more demand to those suppliers. Lots of ways to play with that.So I think there are all different ways, and I think that's one of things down the road that again will give people a reason to be using our service throughout their travel trip. Regarding single properties, we haven't given any more data about that. But it's doing well. Look, we know how important it is. We know it's critical, to continue to have an incredible breadth of different types of alternative accommodations, and I'm pleased with what's being done around the world on that, but I don't have a specific number to give you on that. -- Got it. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question. Maybe building on some of the questions from earlier in the call. Glenn, if you look out past 2019 and probably more qualitatively than quantitatively, when you look at the different buckets of investments you're trying to make and you're thinking about some of the yield and the momentum around those investments, what's sort of the medium to longer-term thinking about the investments where, while it might be early to think multiyear, you'd rather lean in and you're seeing better than expected returns.And investors should think of those as areas that are going to continue to be a neutral-to-rising area of focus for incremental investments, and how you think about balancing sort of margins versus the revenue yield that comes from those investments on a multiyear view? -- Yes. We always try and maintain a good balance. In any investment we make, we're always looking at what's the return? How fast? And is it something that we should spend more or less on and continue to modify as we go throughout? As you get further out trying to make what you think you're going to end up spending in terms of things, it's very hard to know now, but I do want to give confidence to our investors that our historical record of always being careful with our funds and using it appropriately is something that should give them comfort.That being said, we know that there is a bit of a race for this connected trip. We know that our competitors are trying to build something very similar. We know that people who are very large suppliers talk about being able to bring other services with them, too, and you look at people who may not be considered to be classic competitors of ours, but are very, very big in the travel space, are also talking about putting these things together. Given that, if we see the opportunity to increase spend, if we're getting the return that we like, we may accelerate, but these are things we'll see down the road. -- Thanks so much, Glenn.Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks. Just looking at the guidance for Q3, there's about a 300 basis point delta between your guidance for gross bookings and your guidance for room night growth. And we've seen that sort of widening over the last few quarters. Just curious if you can give us a sense of sort of what's behind that? Is it a question of mix? Is it a question of access to specific types of inventory within hotels? Any sort of insight that you could share with us on what's driving that? -- Sure. So this is David. Let me give you the answer to that. So the main driver in that difference in Q3 is ADRs, which, as I mentioned -- which we're down 150 basis points in Q2 and we're forecasting to be down 250 basis points in Q3. The underlying trends are actually quite similar, but in Q3, you've got this additional compare of a year ago when we actually had a rather unusual increase in ADRs. They're up over 1% year-on-year. So then the real question is kind of what's driving those ADRs in Q2 that are kind of more consistently running into Q3 and excluding that kind of lapping effects. And there's basically 3 factors that are driving those ADRs. One, is some local rate and pricing pressure, some geo mix factors, where some of the lower ADR countries are growing faster than some of the higher ADR countries around the world.And then, we're also seeing some kind of rate pressure, particularly for people coming into the U.S., where the dollar has been strengthening against the euro in some important destinations like New York and Miami, where European travelers are still going on sort of vacations to those locations, but they may be trading down in the size of the hotel or the star ratings of the hotel that they're moving into because, obviously, the euro has been growing less far in the U.S. So those are the facts that are kind of really driving the 1.5% we saw in Q2. Then you've got this additional lapping factor in Q3 that gives you the difference, which we talked about. -- And sorry, I mean if we look at the industry data, ADRs have generally been increasing. And so is this something that you feel like is unique to bookings customer base and just the mix of customers that you have given your heavy European exposure? Or is there something else that's sort of different between the third-party industry numbers that we all see and what you're seeing in your business? -- Yes. I think it's -- we certainly have some geo mix factors that we have -- obviously, a large percentage of our booking base coming into -- or coming from Europe because we are very global, but we still have a big European presence. And obviously, as the euro has weakened, that has affected some of these factors that we talked about, particularly for people traveling from Europe into U.S. or into other parts of the world like Asia, where currency is kind of pegged more to the U.S. or have done stronger by themselves. So that's what we see happening. I think that the rate that we saw in Q2 is kind of more indicative of the underlying trend that we're seeing. And obviously, to the extent that some of those currency changes start to move the other way, we could see things pick up. But that's what we're seeing. -- Great, thank you.Your next question comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks for taking my question. Just on the earlier comments on one grow faster in the U.S. region, is that more of a supply issue or trying to penetrate more relationships with property managers? Just how do you view the strategy? And then, on digital advertising, I realize it's harder to extract rental growth in Google, but how do you view your social strategy, particularly with Instagram giving some of the location advertising it's offering? And how do you view your social strategy? -- All right. So in terms of the U.S., and I wanted -- look, we want to -- the U.S. is a great opportunity for us because we're underindexed. And that's something that we recognize, a need to do better and to try and get more than our fair share is what we always want. And that's many things we want to do. It's not just a supply in the alternative accommodation, that's one small part of the business. It's all areas. It's the merchandising we talk about. It's being able to provide a payment product in the U.S. for U.S. customers that is effective and efficient. There are many different areas, so I see that as all upside for us, and it's something that excites me.The second thing about the social is interesting because in many parts -- well, in some parts of the world, our usual way of getting demand is not effective. There is no Google in China, for example. So you need to have another strategy, and that many things are social. And we do see more and more people using social as a way to make decisions for travel. And we meet with all the key players in different parts of social, whether the people at Instagram, Facebook, Snap, even Twitter, always looking. What is the best way to try and bring customers to our site?What's the most efficient way with a good ROI? And we're working all the time with them. I will be open and say that is not -- the ROIs are not as effective, and it's not as easy to scale yet as some of our other long-term use channels like Google, for example. That being said, we are going to continue work on it. We're going to continue to work with all these different companies because we do believe that this will be an important leg down the road to bring in demand. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. -- Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. On the room night growth outperformance in 2Q, can you guys be maybe a little bit more specific as to which regions that you guys are seeing strength and why? And also, Glenn, you can comment about this, China outbound travel, what kind of trends are you seeing, especially given the tension between U.S. and China at this point? -- James, this is David. Let me take the first one. I think we're relatively clear where we saw the outperformance versus our expectations in Q2. It was very much in Europe, where we saw most of the impacts from the unusual combination of the unfavorable weather patterns in the World Cup happening in Europe last year. I say that we didn't see all those impacts just in Europe because some -- certain other countries who did well and are very football-centric also had a strong June as well. But the major impact was, again, doesn't compare. The major impact was -- Europe was, in June.And as I mentioned, what's happened now is that we've had lower expectations, lower expectations in both Q1 and Q2 for Europe, but Europe is outperforming in both quarters vis-a-vis our expectations. But we do recognize that the macro environment in Europe remains cautious. And we all read the same headlines and economic outlooks, etc, coming out of Europe and out of the region. But we'd be pleased with our results in Europe at both Q1 and Q2 vis-a-vis our expectation. I think we were relatively clear as to where that was happening. So hopefully that answers the first part, and I'll ask -- hand over to Glenn to talk about China outbound. -- Yes. China outbound, interesting situation. I assume you're aware that 2018, for example, was the first time that China to U.S. was an actual decline, not an increase in terms of total number of Chinese travelers coming to the U.S. Our business definitely is impacted by these type of events, such as U.S.-China trade disputes, and then you see things happening on TV in Hong Kong. You read about things happening in terms of people going from China to Taiwan, from mainland to Taiwan, and there are certain restrictions being put in place there. So all sorts of different things that are impacting the outbound business. Our point, though, is China is a great opportunity for the long run.There's, in the long run, going to be a lot more Chinese travelers outbound, so it's important that one doesn't just pull back because of any sort of short-term blip. We have approximately 1,000 people in China working to make sure we're providing great service to the Chinese travelers. And we'll continue to do what is appropriate to build our Chinese business because we do believe that this will be a long-term benefit to our company. -- All right, great Thank you.Your last question comes from the line of Dan Wasiolek from Morningstar. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the connected trip. I can appreciate not giving any specific date, but building this out, is this a few years? Several years? Somewhere in between? And then I think you mentioned earlier in the call that there might be a period where you might choose to maybe accelerate spend or performance spend. So is it reasonable that there might be a period where that happens? -- Well, I think I'll just cover the second part where the way you said it is correct. We may, and it will depend entirely on what we're seeing in terms of performance ROIs and how fast things are being developed. In terms of your first question, I'm not sure if you'll appreciate the answer, but it is the truth, and that this is a little bit like bridge painting. You're never done. You're never done. You're always going to come with new things to do things better. And that's actually the nature of all type of technological services. And you look at anything that has been created, it's never completely done. You're always trying to improve, and that's what the connected trip will always be.That being said, I do believe in the not-so-distant future, we'll start seeing some real benefit from what we're doing. And that will be something that we'll be able to bring to you with some more concrete data. Okay. I want to thank everyone. Once again, I'm going to tell you how pleased we are about our solid Q2 results. And we remain excited about our future as we execute our long-term growth plans. So thank you very much for joining. And with that, I'm going to turn it back to the operator. -- Okay, thank you.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And during those years, one of the great constants of the podcast has been the five-stock sampler. Every 10 weeks or so, he has picked a new set of five stocks from among those that he actively recommends, and shared it with his listeners. But he doesn't just recommend and forget: He keeps careful score, annually measuring his mini-portfolios against the yardstick of the S&P 500.Turns out, though, that once you've been doing that for four years, the anniversaries start to overlap. So for this episode he's reviewing the results of not one, not two, but three such samplers.In this segment he's looking back one year, to a time when men gathered on the soccer pitch to vie for the one of sport's most prestigious trophies: the World Cup. For this sampler, Gardner picked international companies that he felt benefited from all the things that surround a worldwide sporting spectacle: , , , , and . Today, Gardner will tell us how they've done, and he's joined for his review by senior analyst Simon Erickson, who will talk about a couple of noteworthy developments at each of these companies, and one thing to watch for in their futures.To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our\u00a0.

After all, the newsletter they\u00a0have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0quadrupled the market.*\u00a0David and Tom\u00a0just revealed what they believe are the\u00a0\u00a0for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0to learn about these picks!About Independence Day last year, we picked this five-stock sampler -- Five Stocks Celebrating the 2018 World Cup. It was that time of year, or every four years. I was thinking about international company stocks, companies that benefit from travel and other things that surround the World Cup. My next guest, Simon Erickson, will help us understand what's happening with these companies and how we're doing. Simon, welcome! David, it's a pleasure. Thanks very much for having me. Did you watch the World Cup, by the way? The Men's World Cup last year?I did not. I'm more of a football fan than a soccer fan. I admit I did not watch the World Cup.A lot of people think of soccer as football, but I realize, as Americans, we see an extreme difference. I have to admit, I'm more of a U.S. football than an international football fan myself, but I really do love the World Cup when it pops up every four years for the men and every four years for the women. The U.S. is much better at women's soccer, I've learned, than men's soccer. We didn't even appear, as you'll remember, in last year's World Cup. But these five stocks, they appeared in this five-stock sampler. Now, the actual airing date of this podcast was July 4th, 2018. However, we all know the stock market in the U.S. is not open on July 4th, so all of these prices and this scorecard is dated to the close of the market on July 3rd, 2018. Now, five companies here. Simon, yes, we're back to traditional alphabetical order with the company name. Let's kick it off.Company No. 1 was Booking Holdings. Now, Booking Holdings was called Booking Holdings when I picked it as Booking Holdings last year. Earlier on the show, we talked about it as Priceline. I picked it for a separate sampler then, Simon. But Booking Holdings over the last year, the stock was at $2,060 one year ago. It's down to $1,874 now. So, it made me happier in that early, longer form stock sampler. This one, Simon, the company's down 9%, the market's up 8.2% since then, so we start with a minus 17%. The just losing continues. This hurts meat very badly. Simon, what's been happening? Two developments of note over the last year for Booking? Absolutely, David. And of course this has some international flavor with it, too -- even though Priceline is based here in the United States, booking.com is based over in the Netherlands. An interesting company. Got their name for themselves by first of all booking hotel rooms in Europe. Went on to have this all-inclusive vacation planning platform that also include airfare and even dining. They're getting you to wherever you want to be.One of the first things that stands out as an investor for this company for me is that those travel bookings have been flat the last year, David. We saw travel bookings only up 2% in the most recent quarter, and revenue's only up about 6% over the same time, too. Investors are starting to wonder if vacationers are taking a little bit of a breather on this right now. Of course, it is a very mature platform. It's very profitable.The second thing that I've been watching is, as they've continued to make more and more cash flow, management has been focusing that on buying back shares. They repurchased $8 billion worth of shares in the last year, reduced the share count by 7%, and they just authorized another $15 billion purchase plan for the next two to three years. This is a mature platform. Management is more than happy to return that capital right back to you and me as shareholders.Thank you, Simon. Earlier, Karl Thiel was talking about this company for the other sampler, talking some about the shift in the business toward competition with Airbnb. Now, not as big a name player within that space. That's one thing that we're watching going forward. Simon, what else do you want to point us to as we think about this company going forward from here?Well, this is a platform, David, that does a lot of business, and then it also takes a small cut of every one of those. That's what's known as the take rate, which is very important for investors to keep an eye on. That's the total amount of booking revenue divided by the gross travel bookings that actually take place over the platform. Five years ago, we go back to fiscal 2013, the company made $6.8 billion in revenue, but booked $39 billion of total travel booking. It took about 17% as its take rate five years ago. When we look at that in fiscal 2018, the take rate was about 15.6%. It's gone down a little bit, David, but that's to be expected as you start seeing this packaging those hotels with the airfare with the dining all together. You're getting a lump sum. You're expanding the whole pie, but you're taking a smaller piece of it. Something I've been keeping an eye on as an investor. Thank you, Simon. You're making us smarter. The take rate. I love simple ratios and a phrase that I can understand. That gives us a grip and a handle on this company going forward. It's been one of our big winners. Any  member of any vintage may well own Booking. If you haven't, then you've seen that it's been one of the great winners over the last 15, 20 years for stock market investors. Fingers crossed for Booking, but it started us with a minus 17% with this five-stock sampler.Let's go to company No. 2, ticker DASTY, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. Yep, that's right, I took high school French so I can say Dassault Syst\u00e8mes and know that I kind of have that nailed. I will say that the stock has kind of nailed it. It's been a winner over the last year, the stock up 15%, market up 8%. Simon, happy to say this is back in the plus column now, plus 7%. Not a mega winner, but a really good long-term hold, as we always hope for our services for, in this case,  members.Simon, two develop some note here over the last year for Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. Sure, David. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, which maybe I'll just call Dassault because my French is not as good as yours is -- Just drop the L, Simon. Just go \"Dassault.\" That's it. Dassault. I'll work on it. Dassault. That's it! Beautiful! They're doing simulation software for really complex projects. It's the world's most sustainable company. They got an award for being the world's most sustainable company. They're working on renewable energy projects, smart cities, personalized medicine, all this stuff that's progressive. They're taking all those inputs, simplifying the complexity, and locking in recurring revenue through this simulation software with their customers for decades.The two things I'm watching for this one, David, is first of all, they've got this new business line called 3DEXPERIENCE. They have 200,000 customers that they work with. There's a lot of overlap between those companies. Some could be customers of other businesses that they're working with. So they're trying to create this centralized business hub that connects the dots between the companies that they're already providing the software for. That's something that saw revenue up 24% year over year when the rest of the company only grew 7%. Great new revenue stream for the company there.The other thing that happened just last month was the acquisition of Metadata Solutions. They paid $5.7 billion for a software-as-a-service company that's working on helping companies get through clinical trials. David, that's very similar to which we have as a  recommendation. I think this is a great push as the world is pushing for personalized medicine.Wow, I missed that, Simon. A $5.7 billion acquisition. Now, for most companies, that's a big bite to take. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, the market cap around $41 billion, so I guess you can absorb $6 billion more easily at that size, but that's still a very significant development. Thank you, Simon!All right. What about one development to watch going forward?You nailed it right there, David. This is a company that's made a lot of acquisitions over its history. Almost 50 different companies it's acquired over several decades in business. Of course, when you make a lot of acquisitions, you're holding a lot of goodwill from those acquisitions on your balance sheet. So, the investor in me is looking at this one, and one thing that I'm keeping an eye on is the percentage of total assets that is tied up in goodwill. Five years ago, in fiscal 2013, that number was 21%. Just last year -- which doesn't even include the Metadata Solutions acquisition -- It's about to go higher, Simon, I think it's going higher.27% off of a much larger asset base. So, David, we've got to be careful on this one. If they were to write down any of those acquisitions, it could impair the company's assets.All right. Now, look, I'm just checking. We've held the stock since September 18th, 2009 for members. We're moving up on 10 years. It's up 497%. It's pretty much more than doubled up the market. It's been an awesome company. Really happy for this French company. But you surprised me. I didn't know about the sustainability and the awards and recognition that the company has not only achieved but clearly sought through its actions as a, in this case, French corporation -- it's our only French company on the  scorecard, and an impressive one at that. Well, thank you very much, Simon!Now, it's nice to know the Dassault Syst\u00e8mes has gotten us a plus 7%, but we're still in the losing column as we hit stock No. 3. Stock No. 3 in this sampler is ticker EA. Why was this a stock celebrating the World Cup? Well, that's because Electronic Arts has the most popular video game for soccer fans, the World Cup video game. This has been one of those longtime EA franchises, where it gets a sports game, like, let's say football, like Madden, or basketball, or other sports. And its soccer game is, I think, the front runner for its industry. Anyway, Electronic Arts was at $141 and change a year ago. Right now, I'm sorry to say, it's down to $101. So, the stock is down 28%. This is a really wonderful company that's been a spectacular winner in recent years, but not over the first year of this five-stock sampler. 36.5%, we'll make that minus 37% behind the market.Simon, what is up? Two developments for EA? Right. David, it's kind of a neat company because they've got many of those sports franchises. As you know as well as anybody, sports teams change over year over year. They bring in new players that are rookies, they trade players from their existing lineups. To keep the game fresh, you want to have the most updated version, which is an advantage for a company like EA. They've got 500 million people across the entire world playing their games, which is a huge user base. But the thing that's interesting about this company is, they're playing it in different ways. It's no longer the age of buy the title upfront, one time sale, and then you play it as much as you possibly want to. Companies like EA are actually monetizing more and more over time because it's over high speed internet channels that are digital. That's been much more profitable for the company.The things that I'm monitoring, to answer your question, is how have they been monetizing that recurring revenue stream? EA specifically has something called EA Access, which is where you can actually, for $5 a month, plug your Xbox into the internet, and download and play as many games as you want to, and also get 10% off of those in-game transactions. It keeps that money stream flowing, David. Just today -- talk about a fresh podcast --just today, they have now expanded that to also include the PlayStation 4, which should be launched within the next month. So, it's another revenue stream from that EA Access, continual money coming into the company, and continuing that recurring revenue stream.In-app purchases, really big part of the backdrop of the story for this industry over the last 10 years. Electronic Arts with it sports franchise games in particular have benefited. It's become a way of life for this company, a serious part of this business model. Certainly the FIFA franchise, FIFA '18 is the most recent version of this, Simon. I hope we'll both go out and buy it, even if we don't watch that much soccer, just to support the home team here, my friend. But tell me one thing we should watch going forward for EA here. Let's hope the next year gets better.Sure thing, David. Let's go back in time five years ago, fiscal 2013. The company was doing $1.7 billion of that digital revenue. This is stuff that you do over the internet rather than actually purchase at a retail location. 8% of its sales were being received as operating cash flow. The cash coming in the door was about 8% of total sales at that time. David, you look back this last year, fiscal 2018, the company has doubled its digital revenue. It's doing a lot more business over the internet. But get this -- now, 33% of sales translated to operating cash flow. The company is raking it in as it's gone digital, and that's really good news for shareholders.All right, so we'll trust that things will be better here for EA over the next year than the 28% decline over the past year. We're in the hole going to stock No. 4. Really happy to say, though, that stock No. 4, the ticker symbol is MELI. I picked MercadoLibre on this podcast a year ago this week. It was at $297 a share. Right now, Simon, tipping the scales here at $612. The stock is up 105.7%, way ahead of the market's 8.2%, so we're going to give ourselves a plus 98% in the win column and flip Five Stocks Celebrating the 2018 World Cup, at least through four, of them to a significant win.Simon, what's up with MercadoLibre?David, first of all, I'll do much better with the pronunciation on this one, because my Spanish is better than my French. But the big deal for this one over the last here has been payment volumes. The company is now processing more off-platform payments than they are on-platform payments. Let me explain a little bit about what that means using and as an example. In the early days, you could only use PayPal to buy things on eBay, right? That's an on-platform transaction. But a couple of weeks ago, I was in Toronto, and I was booking s on my mobile phone, and paying for it with PayPal. That's an off-platform transaction that's still processed by that company. MercadoLibre is doing exactly the same thing with Mercado Pago, which is now becoming the standard of digital payment processing for anything in Latin America. Payments were up 72% year over year. It's becoming the de facto standard. I think that's something that's really driving the stock.The second thing that's really interesting that I'm watching is their own in-house logistics network that they're building out. David, sometimes it's really expensive to ship stuff around South America, especially in Brazil. MercadoLibre for a while was offering free shipping in Brazil. They had to back off on that because it was getting too expensive for them to do that. So, what they're doing is similar to what 's doing here in the States, they're actually building out their own logistics infrastructure. They're owning their own trucks, they're hiring their own drivers. Now 20% of the shipments within Brazil are being done with MercadoLibre's own in-house logistics. That's something else on keeping a close eye on. Both of those, very promising developments, as one would expect from a stock up 106% over the last year from $297 to $611. What a spectacular year this has been in the ongoing amazing story of MercadoLibre, the top-performing stock on the historic scorecard. And yes, of course, an active recommendation as of now going forward, which means we like it as much today, probably even more today in terms of our confidence, than when it was first recommended years ago.Simon, one thing to look at going forward for MercadoLibre. David, just like we looked at for Booking, I also want to look at the take rate for MercadoLibre. Because of that, we want to see, is it worth all the effort they put in for processing these payments, and all the effort they put in for doing their own logistics? We want to see what cut is MercadoLibre taking out of the total amount of activity that's taking place on their platform. Go back in time again five years ago, MercadoLibre captured $473 million of revenue off of $7.3 billion in gross merchandise volume. That's a 6.5% take rate in fiscal 2013. David, you can probably guess where that went over the last five years. I'm saying it went up. It definitely went up. The take rate for 2018 was 11.5%. MercadoLibre's getting a higher cut of everything that gets bought over that platform.All right. Thank you, Simon! A lot of people were worried when Amazon started rattling its sabers a little bit, saying, \"We're going to enter Latin America.\" That remains something that Amazon has some commitment to. It's not like Amazon was never there before. But occasionally, that'll scare investors and hurt this stock. But if you've just bought and held, you're really happy. Amazon doesn't seem like it's going to win Latin America. Pretty sure MercadoLibre is. And when you win, you win for a long period of time. It's been an exciting stock.Let's go to our final stock for this five-stock sampler. Appropriately enough, since the World Cup was in Russia, I picked  as the final stock for this five-stock sampler, ticker symbol YNDX. Yandex, up 8.2% over the past year. The market, up 8.2% over the past year. Dead even. We put a zero there. I'll do the final numbers in a sec. But Simon, give us two insights to what's happened to Yandex over the past year. The first bonus insight, David, also is how the company came up with its name. Yandex \"yet another indexer.\" This is kind of Google translated to another country. [laughs] I keep forgetting that. I love that. That's a bonus insight. That's insight A before we get to 1. The first thing I'm looking at is the total number of clicks and the cost per click on their search engine increased over the last year. Cost per click was up 4%. The total number of clicks was up 20%. This is like, you get your cake and eat it, too. You get more volume and you get higher prices. That's a great sign for a company like Yandex that makes money off of that, that they've got organic growth coming from their core platform.David, a fun one for you, too, is the self-driving taxi network they have over there in Russia. Yandex has basically teamed up with and others to provide an autonomous vehicle that not only gives people rides around the country, but it's also delivering food, kind of like Uber Eats that we've gotten used to here in the States. They're still taking a loss in that division. But that was something that grew very quickly. Revenue from that division actually quadrupled in year over year comparisons, and it's now 15% of the company's top line. Something worth keeping an eye on, I think. Thank you, Simon! Yet another index, eh? That's too funny. I keep forgetting that every year, and then I'm reminded of it. So, what is one thing to watch going forward here? This stock sampler is picked for three years, of course, like the others, and we're through year one. This stock's up a little bit from a year ago. What are we watching going forward for Yandex? Sure. First thing is, companies like these, these search engine giants, tend to have a dominant market share. It's really hard to displace something like Google in the States. It's the same thing to replace Yandex in Russia. The market share was, five years ago, 62% of all search in Russia was being done on this platform. It's still at 57%. It's a little lower, but it's still, in my mind, very dominant, David. That's what you would want to see as an investor.The second thing is traffic acquisition costs. How much is Yandex paying others to bring those clicks onto its site? This is something that five years ago was 20% of revenue. In this last year in fiscal 2018, it was only 16% of revenue. That's a really good sign that it's got enough brand recognition, and people are going directly to the site. That, of course, falls to the bottom line much more quickly. That's something you want to see as an investor for a search giant like a Yandex. Simon, thank you very much, not only for your excellent analysis, which it was, but for bringing some positivity to this podcast. It was pretty beleaguered up until now. The final numbers for Five Stocks Celebrating the World Cup, just one year in, these stocks on average up 18.3%; the market up 8.2%; so we're ahead of the market by 10%, which is about how much were down by for our previous five-stock sampler. Take it all in all, one out of three ain't good. I have to say, I'm disappointed by ... maybe it's the time of year. Maybe I'm not working as hard this time of year. I shouldn't blow off my five-stock samplers. I don't know what it is, but we're officially retiring with this podcast the 2016 Brexit inspired stock list that was probably a loser, but we'll see the final numbers by July 13th. We're holding out hope for Five Stocks Riding the Bull Market. We'll need more bull in that ride. But this group, Simon, if this set of companies just keeps treading water, we've got a winner a few years from now, Five Stocks Celebrating the 2018 World Cup.Thank you very much, Simon Erickson! I had a lot of fun.

That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0to learn about these picks!All right, well, the first one up, we're going to go furthest back in time. Three years ago this month, Brexit had just recently happened. I thought about how that could open up Great Britain and its commerce. In general, I had a neutral to slightly positive view of Brexit. Now, I think the world since then has more and more turned against Brexit, it seems. I guess as an American who lives in a country where we went independent from the establishment, went out on our own, and had a pretty great commercial success in the succeeding centuries, I'm about economic freedom. At the same time, though, it's interesting now to look back three years later on what's happened. We won't be talking too much about Brexit. We'll be talking about the five stocks that I picked.Joining me is longtime Motley Fool analyst Karl Thiel. Karl, welcome back to . All right, thank you. It's good to be here.Thank you. And Karl, you and I have worked together on both  and  for ... 15? Twelve? Yeah, I think 15 years.Fifteen years. I'm pretty sure that we decided, if we're going to launch another newsletter after, which was a paper newsletter back then, we needed some more staff. And I think that's how you and I got to know each other, Karl. Am I right? Right from the start, ? That's right.And Karl, as many of you will know, because he was part of a Dream Team earlier this year on this podcast, Karl has specialized in biotechnology. But as I look over the five stocks picked three years ago this month, Karl, I'm not sure I see any biotech in this list of Brexit-inspired stocks. No, indeed. Okay. I've already queued it up. Our listeners know, we're going to be talking about two developments of note and one thing to watch going forward for each of these five stocks. First one up, we always do alphabetical by company name, so first one up is Alphabet. Alphabet three years ago was somewhere around $717. Today, it's at $1,081 as we tape. The stock's up 51%. The market's up -- this is important, we're going to be using this throughout this sampler -- the market is up 36.3% from three years ago. 50.8% is greater than 36.3%. Karl, we're beating the market by, we'll say, 14% with this stock. Alphabet's a company most of use every day, I think it's fair to say. But maybe we don't follow the grander narrative sweep of three years and what's been happening. So Karl, as you looked over Alphabet, what do you see? Two developments of note in these past three years? I mean, it's a pretty sleepy company. Not much happens with Alphabet. Well, it turned 20 in 2018. It's now old enough to drink, I believe. But I really tried to narrow it down to two main things. One I just put under the broad category of political sensitivity, greater political sensitivity around the company. This wraps into the $2.7 billion fine they got from European regulators having to do with using the platform for unfair promotions back in 2017. A lot of attention they got about reentering China after they left China because they weren't willing to do some of the censorship involved. Suddenly became willing to do that again. They also got pressured into canceling their Project Maven, which was this government effort to use artificial intelligence to automatically process military drone footage. And it all came back to the oft-cited \"Don't be evil\" motto that they had, and whether they were really living up to this. I think that's a broad thing for not just Google, but some of the other very, very large companies that are so global and are now being increasingly questioned for the role they play in our lives.The second one I'm going to pick is artificial intelligence, specifically the launch of its Home speaker back in 2016. They are not the leader in this field. That would be with its Echo. I've heard of that company. But they are the No. 2 player, and they're actually gaining scale. I think this is interesting. Voice assistance, according to this statistic that I just saw -- and now I'm not quite sure where I got it from -- voice assistants are now supposedly handling an estimated 40% of all searches. They say that one in six Americans now have one of these speakers. And I think that's growing. That feeds right into their AI effort to deliver better information.Okay. Karl, thank you for filtering down so many things you could have talked about. I mean, Waymo, we didn't talk about that; YouTube. There's too much to talk about. But this is a quick review of a sampler, so I've also asked you to give us one thing to look at going forward. Among many choices, Karl, what do you want to focus some attention on here with Alphabet? I guess, for better or worse, the company still relies overwhelmingly on ad revenue. That's where the dollars and cents comes from. And, let's say competition. has emerged as a major competitor to them. And now Amazon has emerged as a No. 3. They've weathered it all pretty well. I don't think it's any sort of existential threat to them. I think Facebook has taken a lot of share from them, but the market has grown enough that they haven't suffered much. Probably the same with Amazon. But I think that's what I'm going to say we should look at going forward.Okay, great. Interestingly, all three of those companies are active selections of ours in  and . And all of them have been winners. And yes, you're right, they're big companies, and they're under extreme scrutiny at this point by many people, in part just because they are so big, so relevant. They've also been so good for investors, people acting by definition for the long term. And we are shareholders. So, OK, Alphabet's a plus 14%.Company No. 2 is Euronet Worldwide, a company not as well-known as Alphabet, I think it's safe to say, and yet a much better performer. This stock is up 133.5% as of market close this Friday, June 28th. That's a good performance against a 36% gain. So we're getting ourselves 97% in the plus column for Euronet Worldwide. Spoiler alert: this is the best performer in this five-stock sampler. Karl Thiel, two developments of note for Euronet Worldwide. I think the most interesting story for Euronet over the past few years is the thing that didn't happen. They made a hostile bid for back in 2017, outbidding Ant Financial. Ant Financial is the financial arm of . They really went hard on this, claiming that Alibaba basically wasn't as safe on national security grounds to have access to some of this information. MoneyGram's often used by military personnel. And they actually managed to scuttle the deal, but then have not closed it themselves, either. To the best of my knowledge, it's just floating out there. They haven't officially said that they're not interested anymore.Nevertheless, the company has done a lot of acquisitions. That leads into my second point about them, which is that this is a company that has three main lines of business. They have their EFT business, which is a bunch of ATMs --Yeah, ATMs across Europe and some in India, right? This is a global company.Absolutely, yeah, pay attention to the Worldwide part in Euronet Worldwide, not the Euro part. They have their money transfer business. And they have this epay business, which we singled out as being really interesting early on. Online transfer, it seems like it had the potential to maybe be a Venmo-type type thing. Epay has actually a little bit flatlined. It's really been the EFT business, the ATM business, and the money transfer businesses that have grown. That seems to be where they're really focusing their efforts and a lot of their acquisitions.Okay. Karl, any quick thought -- I mean, this stock more than doubled over the last three years, what's the big picture there? Why do you think that happened?I think some of it -- and this is kind of my point to look at going forward -- they have had tremendous growth in the Asia Pacific region, particularly India. Now, some of that is at lower margin. But I think there's a lot of enthusiasm about them really being able to keep a lot of new business in a lot of emerging economies.Okay. We'll leave it right there for Euronet Worldwide -- again, the best performer in this five-stock sampler. Coming right after it alphabetically is, yeah, it's fair to say it's the worst performer in this five-stock sampler, and one that badly harms the ability of this five-stock sampler to continue my record of market-beating five-stock samplers, because the third company we're talking about is Hain Celestial. The ticker symbol on this company is HAIN. Karl, you and I have watched this over the years. This is a company that in , I picked years ago. We have since sold the stock from the service. It was a disappointing loser. Initially a great pick within the organic food space. Really loved Hain Celestial -- Celestial being the tea brands, Celestial Seasonings. Hain Celestial, kind of a conglomerate of healthier foods. But we sold it disconsolately last summer. It hasn't done much since. Karl, this is a look-back three years ago for this five-stock sampler, so we've kept it going for our scoring purposes here.Hain Celestial, picked at $51.50 three years ago. It's down closer to $22 right now, down 57.5% against the market up 36.3%. So, we're going to give ourselves a minus 94% in the -- I wish I could say \"win column -- loss column, pretty much wiping out any good that Euronet Worldwide has done for this five-stock sampler. Karl, two developments of note -- cough, cough, cough, splutter -- for Hain Celestial. To me, what stands out for Hain Celestial is what it hasn't been doing, which is acquiring companies. This is a business that was an acquisition engine. It went out and looked for small brands in the better-for-you food space. And to the best of my knowledge, their last significant acquisition was Better Bean better being back in 2017. Which is stunning. This was all about a growing portfolio of brands within the health food space. Right. I think in some sense, this is now a  world, right? Beyond Meat has no interest in being acquired by anybody. They're doing great on their own. I think related to that, Irwin Simon, the founder and CEO, stepped down after 25 years, replaced by Mark Schiller. There's been some other management turnover, and that may be related to the decision to slow down the acquisitions for now. Okay, yeah. For those who are still -- sometimes people hold onto the stocks that we recommend selling and keep hoping. And sometimes they're right, we'll see. What would be something to watch going forward for Hain Celestial?This is perhaps too vague, but an articulation of a new strategy. I haven't really heard that yet from them. I mean, it's not to go out and buy everything left and right, so what's it going to be? The company has a bunch of good brands, it's doing OK with that, but I'm not sure what their strategy is going forward. And that's what I'm waiting on. Okay. In this world of Beyond Meat and the Impossible Burger and the Awesome Burger and all of the new burgers, how about the Hain Burger? Could that be it? It's worth a try.Would you want to take a bite of the Hain Burger? I am anxious to try all of these new burgers, actually. We had a talk about this on our  podcast a while back. Right, for  members, yes. We are hungry for it. Okay, so, Hain Celestial, let's quickly sweep it off the stage because I don't want to see it anymore. And let's go to stock No. 4. Talk about change. This is a company that changed its name in between when I picked it three years ago this month and today. It used to be known as Priceline, but it's now called . But we're going to keep it in original alphabetic order, so Priceline, now Booking Holdings. The ticker symbol now BKNG. Three years ago this month, it was at $1,338 and change. Today, it's at $1,874 and change. Good news for us, it's up 40%. Not quite as good news for us, the market's up 36%. We can give ourselves a plus 4%. So, this has mostly been treading water, although I don't think any of us is going to be disappointed holding our Priceline that we made 40% over the last three years. Yeah. I think one of the most interesting points about this company is that it is booking.com, not Priceline anymore. Just as a reminder, Priceline bought Booking for $135 million.That's astonishing. One of the greatest acquisitions in travel history. Just a reminder that mergers can be huge value builders. It's obviously been so powerful in this case that Priceline subsumed itself into the Booking brand. That also has come with some management turnover recently with a new CEO and a new CFO, as well.That's certainly one point. The other one is alternative accommodations. Booking is in a dead heat with Airbnb for alternative bookings -- homes and overnight rentals. Which is not, at least if you're like me, that's not usually what I think of the booking.com brand as being. I think of it as being conventional hotels, and obviously, they have properties around rental cars and dining and everything else. But they said that 40% of their active customers booked alternative accommodation properties in 2018.Karl, have you used alternative accommodations in the last two years?Yes. I almost exclusively use Airbnb when I travel.Airbnb is a private company, Karl. That's not our stock pick. How about supporting the home team here?It's even worse than that, actually. We invested in for a long time in , which is not only a home team, but also based in Austin. Although I have used that before. I guess I've been pulled into the Airbnb brand. I will look at Booking next time I have to find a place. All right, it sounds like the wind is changing. Well, for this stock, what's one thing to look at going forward for Booking Holdings?At this point, obviously, online travel booking is not a new idea. It's a pretty penetrated market in terms of getting people to look online. It's really, can they continue to take market share? And to me, that also means moving into new verticals, so looking around their dining and their rental cars. But I would say keep an eye on alternative accommodations and how they keep going for the business.Okay, great. That brings us to stock No. 5 to close out this five-stock sampler from July 13th, 2016, five Brexit-inspired stocks. The fifth company -- well, before I mention the company, if you're doing the math with me, if you're playing along at home, we're ahead right now. We're plus 21% when you sum up those four picks. We're up, we're up about 5% on the market. Stock No. 5 is Tesla, ticker TSLA. Tesla three years ago this month -- as of this taping, anyway -- we picked it at $220.53. Today, Friday, June 28th, closed $223.46, up less than $1 from where it was three years ago. That means it's flat. The market's up 36%. Karl, that plus 21% just went to a, minus 36% overall, 15 alpha points divided by five, we are 3% points behind the market with this five-stock sampler.Now, I'm frontloading all the math here to give the spoiler alert right then. We are losing as we're going to be closing out this Brexit-inspired stock list. But before talking about that, let's go right in on Tesla. Karl, a lot of people follow Tesla. Some people follow Elon Musk more than Tesla. It's almost like he's bigger than this multibillion dollar company. But Karl, two developments of note for Tesla over these last three years.Well, they both make my list. My first point has to be the Model 3. It was unveiled in 2016. It was launched into limited production in 2017. It really hit its stride in 2018, when they finally managed to start doing 5,000 cars a week. Got it down to that $35,000 price point earlier this year. That's been fantastic. I see them all over the place now.Yep. I have one and I love mine. In fact, I also have a Model S because we had some extra cars with kids that were no longer kids driving automobiles with their driving licenses. And eventually I sold a few of those and converted them over to Teslas. I have to admit, I enjoy driving my Model 3 more than my Model S in part because it's a little smaller, tighter. The parking spaces at Fool HQ are annoyingly tight. I think all of us here in Alexandria who come to Fool HQ to go to work all feel that way. So it's natural for me to take the smaller, slightly newer car. Anyway, I agree. That's a huge story for Tesla. And even though they haven't cranked out nearly as many as Elon said they would at this point, it is a spectacular car and a great achievement for this company.What's the second development of note? I'm going to lump this together under the general rubric of Elon Musk's mental health. It was all good and fun back in February 2018, when he was launching Roadsters into outer space. Then in August, he put out the note about taking Tesla private, which launched off an SEC investigation. Funding secured, Karl. Funding secured. [laughs] And he was forbidden from tweeting without having it vetted. He went on Joe Rogan's show there and was smoking pot, and also gave an interview talking about his own struggles keeping it all together while nano-managing the company. I think that became a significant not just entertaining story to watch, but pretty significant for Tesla shareholders, to wonder what it meant for the company. Yeah. Sometimes big personalities and big people, especially if they're micromanagers, which I sure hope Elon isn't, I hope he's not that much of one -- but if we are, and this is true of smaller companies, but usually, the more that person does, the slower that company moves. This is especially true of entrepreneurial, smaller companies. If you have somebody who's trying to do it all out there, it's really hard for that company to scale. Anyway, Tesla has still scaled pretty spectacularly over the time that's been in the public markets. But for this five-stock sampler, it is flat.Now Karl, what's one thing to watch for Tesla going forward? I would put it down to financial health. Back in May, Elon Musk told Tesla employees that the company will run out of cash in about 10 months unless hardcore cost-cutting efforts were made. Now, obviously, the company is still burning through a lot of cash. It's got a fair bit of debt at this point. For a while, he was saying that he didn't think they were going to have to raise anymore. Obviously, that's not true. I'm guessing that Tesla is a little bit of a rough place to work right now. I think they are cutting everything and really, really pushing on the Model 3. The question is, is the Model 3 at extremely low margins cannibalizing Model S sales at better margins? And can they just get over the hump to break even? Because as you say, it's a great car. It's a great product. I think the world's better off if this company succeeds. Yep. Karl, we'll call that the $38 billion question, because that's the market cap as we record this podcast here in the end of June 2019. Well, I've already mentioned the overall performance. If you hear my tone a little down, that's because I'm a little disconsolate that this group of five stocks, which we patiently have followed, updated a few times, including today, this is a market loser from where it was July 13th, 2016. Now, there is a little bit of a silver lining here, because technically, this one's not over. This podcast comes out the first week of July. We won't actually end the horse race until July 13th, 2019. If we can just get a little oomph, a little giddy up here, we do have a chance to cross the finish line with a winner. But we probably won't spend much time reviewing it, we'll just put it back in the homebrew spreadsheet and move on. For now, we're going to say this was a loser. But Karl, you are a winner.

If you're going to pick five stocks at a time, and you're going to do that five times a year, and you're going to review how they do every year after that, and you're going to do a podcast every week and you're still doing that four years later, soon enough, you're going to have enough of these to review that you're going to have to dedicate entire podcasts sometimes just to review past stock picks. See how we did, close the loop, score things. And that's how the Reviewapalooza podcast series works. We did our first ever on February 20th of this year, reviewing three past five-stock samplers all at once. We're doing our next one, reviewing three others, this week on .\u00a0This episode of  is brought to you by The Motley Fool. After all, it is The Motley Fool and talented producers like longtime  podcast producer Rick Engdahl, or pinch hit talented producer Heather Horton, talented producers, the effort to put these up on a website, store them, let you know through social media, it takes a village to make  happens. Thank you to our sponsor, The Motley Fool, for making  possibleWelcome back to . Hi! Thanks so much for joining us. This is a special podcast. It's somewhere like number 211, but if you do the math, we're right on our four-year anniversary. It is the birthday, the birth date, of  the podcast. Four years ago this month, July 2015, we kicked it all off.\u00a0It's our birthday, and I'm really delighted. For those of you who've been with us for all four years, or three, or two, or one, or are just joining this week, welcome to . I love bringing this podcast to you and I've done so for four years now.\u00a0In fact, in celebration of our birthday, I thought it'd be fun to have a weekend extra this coming weekend. Stay tuned. Somewhere Saturday morning here on the East Coast of the United States of America, we'll rebroadcast our very first  podcast. I think it's only like six minutes long. It's entitled . It's just speaking about breaking the rules, you and me. I hope you'll have fun with that and listen back. I'm sure my voice has changed a little bit. I'm sure I'm older. I'm definitely greyer. I'm probably not quite as interesting today as I was back then for that first podcast, but maybe not. Maybe things have gotten better. You and I can be the judge. , coming up. Just a few minutes of your weekend.\u00a0And that's about all the fanfare we have for you this podcast. What I want to say is, I'm really happy to think that our fourth birthday, we're spending time reviewing past stock picks made on this podcast, as I said at the top. This is a Reviewapalooza episode. I think that's so appropriate because I think a unique aspect of  is, on this podcast, we literally pick stocks to beat the market. In a world where many people don't even think you can beat the market, we pick stocks directly. We do so in fun. We have different themes. Sometimes we're less serious than other times. But we're giving you a sample of what The Motley Fool does through  and , two services, our most affordable services, arguably, some of our best performing services that I've worked on for 15-plus years in both cases. It's special that we pick stocks on this podcast. We don't do it every podcast. But when we do, we note the date, the time, we note where the stocks were, and then we follow and we score. I have my own homebrew spreadsheet, initially put together by my talented assistant, Molina Butler. Molina got me started with this spreadsheet. I've got all of our five-stock samplers in there. When that year comes up, that first-year anniversary, we go back and see, how have those stocks done over the last year, or two years later, or three years later? And that's exactly what we're doing this week.\u00a0Right around this time for each of the last three years, I picked a five-stock sampler. It'll be our pleasure -- and I say \"our\" because I have some talented guest stars -- our pleasure to review those with you, see how those stocks have done. We've had some good. Sorry to say, we've also had some bad. You'll be seeing  at its best and worst this week on .\u00a0Now, I should mention, this podcast is actually being taped ... well, last Friday, June 28th, end of the market close. So, all of the stock performance that you're going to hear is all keyed to the close of market last Friday, June 28th. For each of these five-stock samplers, the numbers will have changed by the time you hear this. For at least one of them, we'll be closing it out, sun-setting it, and we'll get the official numbers from that closing date. Because yes, I keep track of all of this in my homebrew spreadsheet.\u00a0All right, and why are we taping this several days before it's airing? Well, the answer is that I'm in China as you listen to this. For the first time, I'm going halfway across the world to mainland China, and also going to be visiting Hong Kong. Looking forward to hanging out with a couple of our Fool team in Hong Kong. Hayes and David, looking forward to having supper with you in our time in Hong Kong. But yes, both this week's podcast and next week's podcast have been pre-taped because I am half a world away.\u00a0By the way, before we really start it this week, let me mention, this is one of our longer podcasts. The reason is, we are reviewing three five-stock samplers. We're going deep on some of these companies. If you love the stock market, I hope you love all that we have for you this week. It is our fourth anniversary so we're blowing out the show a little bit. But of course, through most of our history, and most of our future, we won't go this long for . Thank you for suffering Fools gladly this week!\u00a0Now, for a Reviewapalooza, I've asked three of my favorite analysts, each of them working at , to look over the five stocks. I've got all the numbers and stats, and I've got some thoughts for you. But in each case, I've got an analyst who spends additional time more seriously looking at each of these companies and helping us think about them -- make us smarter, happier, and richer about these companies. And what I've asked each of them to do is, for each of the five companies, present two developments of note -- like what has happened, two developments since we picked it on the podcast -- and then one thing to watch going forward. That's the simple format that we have for each of these five-stock sampler reviews. Two developments of note, and one thing to watch going forward.\u00a0All right, well, the first one up, we're going to go furthest back in time. Three years ago this month, Brexit had just recently happened. I thought about how that could open up Great Britain and its commerce. In general, I had a neutral to slightly positive view of Brexit. Now, I think the world since then has more and more turned against Brexit, it seems. I guess as an American who lives in a country where we went independent from the establishment, went out on our own, and had a pretty great commercial success in the succeeding centuries, I'm about economic freedom. At the same time, though, it's interesting now to look back three years later on what's happened. We won't be talking too much about Brexit. We'll be talking about the five stocks that I picked.\u00a0Joining me is longtime Motley Fool analyst, Karl Thiel. Karl, welcome back to .\u00a0 All right, thank you. It's good to be here.\u00a0Thank you. And Karl, you and I have worked together on both  and  for ... 15? 12? Yeah, I think 15 years.15 years. I'm pretty sure that we decided, if we're going to launch another newsletter after, which was a paper newsletter back then, we needed some more staff. And I think that's how you and I got to know each other, Karl. Am I right? Right from the start, ?\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0And Karl, as many of you will know, because he was part of a Dream Team earlier this year on this podcast, Karl has specialized in biotechnology. But as I look over the five stocks picked three years ago this month, Karl, I'm not sure I see any biotech in this list of Brexit inspired stocks. No, indeed. Okay. I've already queued it up. Our listeners know, we're going to be talking about two developments of note and one thing to watch going forward for each of these five stocks. First one up, we always do alphabetical by company name, so first one up is Alphabet. Alphabet three years ago was somewhere around $717. Today, it's at $1,081 as we tape. The stock's up 51%. The market's up -- this is important, we're going to be using this throughout this sampler -- the market is up 36.3% from three years ago. 50.8% is greater than 36.3%. Karl, we're beating the market by, we'll say, 14% with this stock. Alphabet's a company most of use every day, I think it's fair to say. But maybe we don't follow the grander narrative sweep of three years and what's been happening. So Karl, as you looked over Alphabet, what do you see? Two developments of note in these past three years?\u00a0I mean, it's a pretty sleepy company. Not much happens with Alphabet.\u00a0Well, it turned 20 in 2018. It's now old enough to drink, I believe. But I really tried to narrow it down to two main things. One I just put under the broad category of political sensitivity, greater political sensitivity around the company. This wraps into the $2.7 billion fine they got from European regulators having to do with using the platform for unfair promotions back in 2017. A lot of attention they got about reentering China after they left China because they weren't willing to do some of the censorship involved. Suddenly became willing to do that again. They also got pressured into canceling their Project Maven, which was this government effort to use artificial intelligence to automatically process military drone footage. And it all came back to the oft-cited \"Don't be evil\" motto that they had, and whether they were really living up to this. I think that's a broad thing for not just Google, but some of the other very, very large companies that are so global and are now being increasingly questioned for the role they play in our lives.\u00a0The second one I'm going to pick is artificial intelligence, specifically the launch of its Home speaker back in 2016. They are not the leader in this field. That would be \u00a0with its Echo. I've heard of that company.\u00a0But they are the No. 2 player, and they're actually gaining scale. I think this is interesting. Voice assistance, according to this statistic that I just saw -- and now I'm not quite sure where I got it from -- voice assistants are now supposedly handling an estimated 40% of all searches. They say that one in six Americans now have one of these speakers. And I think that's growing. That feeds right into their AI effort to deliver better information.Okay. Karl, thank you for filtering down so many things you could have talked about. I mean, Waymo, we didn't talk about that; YouTube. There's too much to talk about. But this is a quick review of a sampler, so I've also asked you to give us one thing to look at going forward. Among many choices, Karl, what do you want to focus some attention on here with Alphabet?\u00a0I guess, for better or worse, the company still relies overwhelmingly on ad revenue. That's where the dollars and cents comes from. And, let's say competition. has emerged as a major competitor to them. And now Amazon has emerged as a No. 3. They've weathered it all pretty well. I don't think it's any sort of existential threat to them.\u00a0I think Facebook has taken a lot of share from them, but the market has grown enough that they haven't suffered much. Probably the same with Amazon. But I think that's what I'm going to say we should look at going forward.\u00a0Okay, great. Interestingly, all three of those companies are active selections of ours in  and . And all of them have been winners. And yes, you're right, they're big companies, and they're under extreme scrutiny at this point by many people, in part just because they are so big, so relevant. They've also been so good for investors, people acting by definition for the long term. And we are shareholders. So, OK, Alphabet's a plus 14%.Company No. 2 is , a company not as well-known as Alphabet, I think it's safe to say, and yet a much better performer. This stock is up 133.5% as of market close this Friday, June 28th. That's a good performance against a 36% gain. So we're getting ourselves 97% in the plus column for Euronet Worldwide. Spoiler alert: this is the best performer in this five-stock sampler. Karl Thiel, two developments of note for Euronet Worldwide.\u00a0I think the most interesting story for Euronet over the past few years is the thing that didn't happen. They made a hostile bid for back in 2017, outbidding Ant Financial.\u00a0Ant Financial is the financial arm of . They really went hard on this, claiming that Alibaba basically wasn't as safe on national security grounds to have access to some of this information. MoneyGram's often used by military personnel. And they actually managed to scuttle the deal, but then have not closed it themselves, either. To the best of my knowledge, it's just floating out there. They haven't officially said that they're not interested anymore.\u00a0Nevertheless, the company has done a lot of acquisitions. That leads into my second point about them, which is that this is a company that has three main lines of business. They have their EFT business, which is a bunch of ATMs --Yeah, ATMs across Europe and some in India, right? This is a global company.\u00a0Absolutely, yeah, pay attention to the Worldwide part in Euronet Worldwide, not the Euro part. They have their money transfer business. And they have this epay business, which we singled out as being really interesting early on. Online transfer, it seems like it had the potential to maybe be a Venmo-type type thing. Epay has actually a little bit flatlined. It's really been the EFT business, the ATM business, and the money transfer businesses that have grown. That seems to be where they're really focusing their efforts and a lot of their acquisitions.\u00a0Okay. Karl, any quick thought -- I mean, this stock more than doubled over the last three years, what's the big picture there? Why do you think that happened?I think some of it -- and this is kind of my point to look at going forward -- they have had tremendous growth in the Asia Pacific region, particularly India. Now, some of that is at lower margin. But I think there's a lot of enthusiasm about them really being able to keep a lot of new business in a lot of emerging economies.Okay. We'll leave it right there for Euronet Worldwide -- again, the best performer in this five-stock sampler. Coming right after it alphabetically is, yeah, it's fair to say it's the worst performer in this five-stock sampler, and one that badly harms the ability of this five-stock sampler to continue my record of market-beating five-stock samplers, because the third company we're talking about is . The ticker symbol on this company is HAIN. Karl, you and I have watched this over the years. This is a company that in , I picked years ago. We have since sold the stock from the service. It was a disappointing loser. Initially a great pick within the organic food space. Really loved Hain Celestial -- Celestial being the tea brands, Celestial Seasonings. Hain Celestial, kind of a conglomerate of healthier foods. But we sold it disconsolately last summer. It hasn't done much since. Karl, this is a look-back three years ago for this five-stock sampler, so we've kept it going for our scoring purposes here.\u00a0Hain Celestial, picked at $51.50 three years ago. It's down closer to $22 right now, down 57.5% against the market up 36.3%. So, we're going to give ourselves a minus 94% in the -- I wish I could say \"win column -- loss column, pretty much wiping out any good that Euronet Worldwide has done for this five-stock sampler. Karl, two developments of note -- cough, cough, cough, splutter -- for Hain Celestial. To me, what stands out for Hain Celestial is what it hasn't been doing, which is acquiring companies. This is a business that was an acquisition engine. It went out and looked for small brands in the better-for-you food space. And to the best of my knowledge, their last significant acquisition was Better Bean better being back in 2017. Which is\u00a0stunning. This was all about a growing portfolio of brands within the health food space.\u00a0Right. I think in some sense, this is now a  world, right? Beyond Meat has no interest in being acquired by anybody. They're doing great on their own. I think related to that, Irwin Simon, the founder and CEO, stepped down after 25 years, replaced by Mark Schiller. There's been some other management turnover, and that may be related to the decision to slow down the acquisitions for now.\u00a0Okay, yeah. For those who are still -- sometimes people hold onto the stocks that we recommend selling and keep hoping. And sometimes they're right, we'll see. What would be something to watch going forward for Hain Celestial?This is perhaps too vague, but an articulation of a new strategy. I haven't really heard that yet from them. I mean, it's not to go out and buy everything left and right, so what's it going to be? The company has a bunch of good brands, it's doing OK with that, but I'm not sure what their strategy is going forward. And that's what I'm waiting on.\u00a0 Okay. In this world of Beyond Meat and the Impossible Burger and the Awesome Burger and all of the new burgers, how about the Hain Burger? Could that be it? It's worth a try.Would you want to take a bite of the Hain Burger? I am anxious to try all of these new burgers, actually. We had a talk about this on our  podcast a while back. Right, for  members, yes. We are hungry for it. Okay, so, Hain Celestial, let's quickly sweep it off the stage because I don't want to see it anymore. And let's go to stock No. 4. Talk about change. This is a company that changed its name in between when I picked it three years ago this month and today. It used to be known as Priceline, but it's now called Booking Holdings. But we're going to keep it in original alphabetic order, so Priceline, now Booking Holdings. The ticker symbol now BKNG. Three years ago this month, it was at $1,338 and change. Today, it's at $1,874 and change. Good news for us, it's up 40%. Not quite as good news for us, the market's up 36%. We can give ourselves a plus 4%. So, this has mostly been treading water, although I don't think any of us is going to be disappointed holding our Priceline that we made 40% over the last three years. Yeah. I think one of the most interesting points about this company is that it is booking.com, not Priceline anymore. Just as a reminder, Priceline bought Booking for $135 million.\u00a0That's astonishing. One of the greatest acquisitions in travel history. Just a reminder that mergers can be huge value builders. It's obviously been so powerful in this case that Priceline subsumed itself into the Booking brand. That also has come with some management turnover recently with a new CEO and a new CFO, as well.That's certainly one point. The other one is alternative accommodations. Booking is in a dead heat with Airbnb for alternative bookings -- homes and overnight rentals. Which is not, at least if you're like me, that's not usually what I think of the booking.com brand as being. I think of it as being conventional hotels, and obviously, they have properties around rental cars and dining and everything else. But they said that 40% of their active customers booked alternative accommodation properties in 2018.Karl, have you used alternative accommodations in the last two years?Yes. I almost exclusively use Airbnb when I travel.Airbnb is a private company, Karl. That's not our stock pick. How about supporting the home team here?It's even worse than that, actually. We invested in for a long time in , which is not only a home team, but also based in Austin. Although I have used that before. I guess I've been pulled into the Airbnb brand. I will look at Booking next time I have to find a place. All right, it sounds like the wind is changing. Well, for this stock, what's one thing to look at going forward for Booking Holdings?At this point, obviously, online travel booking is not a new idea. It's a pretty penetrated market in terms of getting people to look online. It's really, can they continue to take market share? And to me, that also means moving into new verticals, so looking around their dining and their rental cars. But I would say keep an eye on alternative accommodations and how they keep going for the business.Okay, great. That brings us to stock No. 5 to close out this five-stock sampler from July 13th, 2016, Five Brexit-inspired stocks. The fifth company -- well, before I mention the company, if you're doing the math with me, if you're playing along at home, we're ahead right now. We're plus 21% when you sum up those four picks. We're up, we're up about 5% on the market. Stock No. 5 is , ticker TSLA. Tesla three years ago this month -- as of this taping, anyway -- we picked it at $220.53. Today, Friday, June 28th, closed $223.46, up less than $1 from where it was three years ago. That means it's flat. The market's up 36%. Karl, that plus 21% just went to a, minus 36% overall, 15 alpha points divided by five, we are 3% points behind the market with this five-stock sampler.Now, I'm frontloading all the math here to give the spoiler alert right then. We are losing as we're going to be closing out this Brexit-inspired stock list. But before talking about that, let's go right in on Tesla. Karl, a lot of people follow Tesla. Some people follow Elon Musk more than Tesla. It's almost like he's bigger than this multibillion dollar company. But Karl, two developments of note for Tesla over these last three years.Well, they both make my list. My first point has to be the Model 3. It was unveiled in 2016. It was launched into limited production in 2017. It really hit its stride in 2018, when they finally managed to start doing 5,000 cars a week. Got it down to that $35,000 price point earlier this year. That's been fantastic. I see them all over the place now.Yep. I have one and I love mine. In fact, I also have a Model S because we had some extra cars with kids that were no longer kids driving automobiles with their driving licenses. And eventually I sold a few of those and converted them over to Teslas. I have to admit, I enjoy driving my Model 3 more than my Model S in part because it's a little smaller, tighter. The parking spaces at Fool HQ are annoyingly tight. I think all of us here in Alexandria who come to Fool HQ to go to work all feel that way. So it's natural for me to take the smaller, slightly newer car. Anyway, I agree. That's a huge story for Tesla. And even though they haven't cranked out nearly as many as Elon said they would at this point, it is a spectacular car and a great achievement for this company.What's the second development of note? I'm going to lump this together under the general rubric of Elon Musk's mental health. It was all good and fun back in February 2018, when he was launching Roadsters into outer space. Then in August, he put out the note about taking Tesla private, which launched off an SEC investigation. Funding secured, Karl. Funding secured. [laughs] And he was forbidden from tweeting without having it vetted. He went on Joe Rogan's show there and was smoking pot, and also gave an interview talking about his own struggles keeping it all together while nano-managing the company. I think that became a significant not just entertaining story to watch, but pretty significant for Tesla shareholders, to wonder what it meant for the company. Yeah. Sometimes big personalities and big people, especially if they're micro managers, which I sure hope Elon isn't, I hope he's not that much of one -- but if we are, and this is true of smaller companies, but usually, the more that person does, the slower that company moves. This is especially true of entrepreneurial, smaller companies. If you have somebody who's trying to do it all out there, it's really hard for that company to scale. Anyway, Tesla has still scaled pretty spectacularly over the time that's been in the public markets. But for this five-stock sampler, it is flat.Now Karl, what's one thing to watch for Tesla going forward? I would put it down to financial health. Back in May, Elon Musk told Tesla employees that the company will run out of cash in about 10 months unless hardcore cost-cutting efforts were made. Now, obviously, the company is still burning through a lot of cash. It's got a fair bit of debt at this point. For a while, he was saying that he didn't think they were going to have to raise anymore. Obviously, that's not true. I'm guessing that Tesla is a little bit of a rough place to work right now. I think they are cutting everything and really, really pushing on the Model 3. The question is, is the Model 3 at extremely low margins cannibalizing Model S sales at better margins? And can they just get over the hump to break even? Because as you say, it's a great car. It's a great product. I think the world's better off if this company succeeds. Yep. Karl, we'll call that the $38 billion question, because that's the market cap as we record this podcast here in the end of June 2019. Well, I've already mentioned the overall performance. If you hear my tone a little down, that's because I'm a little disconsolate that this group of five stocks, which we patiently have followed, updated a few times, including today, this is a market loser from where it was July 13th, 2016. Now, there is a little bit of a silver lining here, because technically, this one's not over. This podcast comes out the first week of July. We won't actually end the horse race until July 13th, 2019. If we can just get a little oomph, a little giddy up here, we do have a chance to cross the finish line with a winner. But we probably won't spend much time reviewing it, we'll just put it back in the homebrew spreadsheet and move on. For now, we're going to say this was a loser. But Karl, you are a winner. Thank you for taking the time to update us on these five fascinating companies, at least several of which I still love. Hain Celestial. Karl Thiel, thank you. Thank you! All right. Time passes from July of 2016.And it became 2017. We flipped the calendar year. But we're right back this time. In this case, it was June 21st, 2017. . Two years ago, this June, the market had been great. We all remember how bad the stock market was in 2008 and 2009. And I'm not sure pundits expected a recovery in 2010. I can't quite remember. But I'm pretty sure nobody was predicting how great the stock market would be in the succeeding seven years. By the time we get, Rick Munarriz, to the summer of 2017, stocks were riding high. Am I right?Yes, definitely. It was a good time for at least these stocks that you see at the time. But, yes, definitely. The market was definitely holding up nicely.I want to welcome, that's the voice of longtime  analyst Rick Munarriz. One of my favorite Fools because even though we've worked together, Rick, on  since its inception in August of 2004, you and I first met in a Rainforest Cafe -- remember that brand? -- back in Orlando somewhere in the mid-1990s.Yes, yes, we met there. It was the grand opening of the very first Rainforest Cafe in World. Now there's like three between the Disneyland and Disney World parks. But yes.Wow! So it kept growing, but the stock didn't seem to keep up with that growth. At least I remember it as one of my poorer stock selections. Yeah, didn't do well. Got bought out by Landry's, the seafood chain, and we've pretty much all forgotten about it now that it's all privately held.Well, all happy memories from the very first day I met you, Rick. Love you. Thank you much for all the great work that you've done. We've had much fun together. We've had many great winners and some great losers, too. We'll have a little bit of both on this list. The Five Stocks Riding the Bull Market. Now, what I remember saying about these is, we're going to intentionally pick stocks that are on fire. These are all stocks -- I'm pretty sure; I haven't gone back personally and listened to that podcast from two years ago, but I'm pretty sure these were all at 52-week highs, probably all at all-time highs. I know they're all sub-$10 billion companies. So, we were going for smaller companies that were on fire. I'm not sure whether I was being cocky and a little too cocksure or not, but I said, we're going to show that you can pick stocks that are on fire, let a few years pass, and you're going to beat the market. So, we're going to see whether or not  from June 21st, 2017, have been as a group a market beater or not.Now, the first one up -- and Rick, this confuses me, because I usually try to do these alphabetical by company name, but for whatever reason, the first one was . So let's start with Zillow, ticker Z. Zillow Group. Two years ago, it was at $48.48 at market close on June 21st. Today, it's at $46.39, which means the stock is down 4.3%. Rick, the stock market since the summer of 2017, since the day we're talking about, was up 20.6%. So, this stock starts out as a minus 25%.Rick, what are two things that have happened to Zillow and Zillow shareholders over the last two years?Obviously, the biggest as far as the model change for Zillow is that they've now got into the home flipping business. They started angling that way two years ago. But now they're going all in with what they call Zillow Offers. You can sell your house to Zillow in a growing number of cities. If you remember those old  billboards, they are that billboard, and they'll sell your pretty houses, too. They'll buy your ugly houses, buy your pretty houses. They sold 414 homes in the first quarter of 2019. Generated $128 million in revenue doing that. It is moving the needle in revenue. The only reason that revenue grew 51% in the first quarter was because of this home flipping business. It's the lion's share of its growth.But on the bottom line, it's just getting off the ground. Basically, its operating costs are matching the prices that it's selling it for. So, it's buying houses, it's fixing them up, it's reselling them, and it obviously has a lot of outlets to sell homes. But it's basically breaking even on that right now at this small scale. And it is taking a loss of about $4,000 on each home because each house does have to pay an interest expense while it's holding the houses, as any home flipper knows. But, that's clearly one big development for Zillow.Yeah, I'm pretty sure we were not talking about that two years ago. Not contemplating that Zillow would enter as a buyer within the business that it had primarily been receiving advertising dollars from people who were realtors who wanted to advertise on Zillow. That still happens, and that's still the bulk of this business, Rick. But that is a huge change for Zillow. I hope it works. We're going to see.What's a second development of note in the last two years? The second development is that the business that we fell in love with years ago, and you were talking about, two years ago, is obviously the Zillow online platform, the real estate agents that get to connect, people get the check what their houses are worth, they get to make connections, they get to daydream where they want to live. That business is actually slowing down. Online revenue rose just 6% in the first quarter. Premiere agent revenue, which was the big driver, the big, consistent source, even when the housing market was down, premier agent revenue was still growing because agents wanted to get noticed, they wanted to get leads even during soft housing markets. That segment only rose 2% over the past year. There has been a slowdown in the online business.All right. So, all of that taken together means that the stock is slightly lower than it was two years ago, which is disappointing because the market's up more than 20% over the same time. Rick, what are we watching going forward here for Zillow? We've always been watching the housing market for Zillow because it matters. But now that it has so much weight -- not only is it a real estate market proxy, it actually holds real estate for several months sometimes. So, it is now more susceptible to any housing slowdown. If you're a shareholder, you could have ignored it in the past because it had been an all-weather housing play. But now it's basically based on what housing prices do because it's buying prices at one time, it's holding costs as it pays interest, it's fixing them up, and if the market housing market goes south on us, Zillow is going to take a bigger hit on these sales. As with Alphabet in that earlier stock sampler with Karl, this is one of those bigger, better known companies. Lots of developments. We didn't even talk about the change in CEO which happened at Zillow within the last two years. Rich Barton, now back as CEO. Very promising development for the company. We'll see. Do you own the stock personally? I own the stock. I do not own it. I've owned it vicariously through The Motley Fool for so many years, but no, I do not own it. Sure, because you're the one who brought this to , Rick. Your byline's on it from years ago. Even though it's been a disappointment these last two years, it has been a great stock pick for  members. I have a lot of hope because this is a three-year game we're playing. We're only two years in. Zillow's just a few percentage points behind the markets. It'll be fascinating to see what happens over the next 12 months for this company.Well, let's keep moving. The next ticker -- did I ... yes, I think I did it in reverse alphabetical order. I decided A to Z is boring, so let's do Z to A with this particular stock list. It was by ticker. So, from Z, we next proceed to the letter W, another single-letter ticker symbol company. Experienced investors, longtime , will probably recognize the ticker symbol W for , the online furniture retailer.Rick, Wayfair, two years ago this month, was at about $75 a share. Today, it's at $146. Makes me and a lot of  really happy. Big smile The stock is up 94%. The market up 21%. So we're going to give ourselves a plus 73%, which really wipes out that minus 25% that Zillow started us with. Rick, two developments for Wayfair. The first development, it's more of a trend development, is that people are getting more comfortable with buying furniture online. Even back to the old Amazon days two decades plus ago, when it was, do I trust buying something online, at the time was mostly media like some CDs and VHS and DVDs. Small media, albums and CDs. But now we get to the point where people are saying, \"I don't mind a big ticket purchase. I don't mind buying a sofa, or something like a house fixture. I don't know how well it's going to look at my house. I'm willing to spend three, four digits on an online purchase.\" And Wayfair's gotten to do it. There were 16.4 million active customers at the end of March, which is 39% more than they had a year ago.Wow! All right, that's No. 1 for Wayfair. What's development No. 2? One development is what hasn't developed, and that is buying furniture is still a big ticket, infrequent purchase. Even though the customer base has grown by 39%, that actually matches the revenue in its last quarter, up 39%. The order size, the order frequency, it hasn't intensified. This isn't like binge viewing, or let's say a meal delivery service, where you get hooked on it, like an or something like that. You're not going to buy a sofa every month just because you love Wayfair. You're definitely just keeping things in check with Wayfair's growth. It's limited to, its audience growth right now is dictating its revenue. That does make sense. It would be a stronger company and even better stock -- again, having almost doubled in the last two years -- if not only were we buying from it regularly, but were increasing our amount of business we're doing. But yeah, how many different beds or sofas do we really need, Rick? So, there isn't that ramp up in terms of frequency from even big fans of Wayfair, and there are a lot out there.All right, how about one thing to watch going forward for ticker symbol W? I want to talk about Wayfair walkout. This is not going to be a political point. I just want to point out that we're recording this June 28th, Friday. Two days earlier, on Wednesday, hundreds of Wayfair employees walked out because Wayfair sold $200,000 of bedroom furniture to a Texas detention facility for migrant children. There was an issue where the employees told the CEO, \"Hey, stop selling to the contractor that's doing this.\" The CEO said, \"I can't control who buys our stuff.\" So they walked out in protest. Again, this isn't a matter of taking one side or the other. That has nothing to do with it. But at least short-term, you'll want to see how this situation plays out from a public relations standpoint. You don't Wayfair's reputation to take a hit. If you look up Wayfair walkout, you're seeing people basically blasting Wayfair, like, \"I won't buy from you again.\" Normally, all these things pass over time. But it's something that you should definitely watch in the near-term, to make sure that Wayfair doesn't lose its great standing that it has right now with consumers. All right, really good point. I appreciate you mentioning that. I hope when we review this for one final time a year from today, that looks like something way back in the rearview mirror. But one never knows. It's worth noticing. I will say, like a lot of our best , companies that are doing important things in the world and are growing and are being noticed tend to be the ones that get this extra scrutiny. Whether it's something much bigger like but even something smaller, but a leader within what it does, people give it extra scrutiny, and they expect more from that company, even when it can't fully control who's buying its product, it ends up in the sights of our popular media. Thank you for pointing that out, Rick. Again, we're grateful for Wayfair overall. A big-time winner over the last two years.That brings us to stock No. 3. Here's where, OK, sure, Heather, play a little bit of sad music.Here's where, right after our best performer, we get our worst performer, which kind of like last stock sampler, basically wipes out the gains of our best performers. Stock No. 3, ticker PI. This company is Impinj, not even spelled properly. Maybe that was a dark sign I should have noticed two years ago. Impinj, two years ago, was about $54.50 at market close on June 21st. Today, $28 and change. We're going to call that minus 47.6% against the market's plus 20.6%. That's a swing of minus 68% in the loss column.Rick, two things happening for Impinj and its shareholders? Obviously, the biggest reason for the stock's setback is that mortality has set in. Revenue for 2016, which was the last full year before the podcast from two years ago, two summers ago, was up 43%. Then that slowed down to 11% in 2017. And it was a decline of 2% in 2018. Revenue turned negative at the tail end of 2017. Because of that, the fear with the RFID tags was always that it would become a heavily commoditized offering. That's pretty much what started to happen. The platform Impinj wasn't enough at that point.Yeah. Radio frequency identification, RFID. This technology where we put little tags on things. It might be a box that's being shipped, or it might be all of the chairs that you have at a large company. Anytime you want to put a little ID on something, those are the RFID tags. They were always commoditized. They were always pennies cheap. But Impinj, and part of the promise of the stock when I recommend it several years ago, disappointingly for  , was that it gave managers access to the data, and a better portal to see all of your assets out there, all of your RFID tags. Unfortunately, this company, which was growing like wildfire as I picked it as one of the two years ago this month, Rick, unfortunately, when all of a sudden, sales growth doesn't just slow, it actually reverses, and the company has a sales decline, that's going to hurt most of our upstart . This stock, cut in half over the last year.All right, that wasn't a great development. Rick, the second development, is this a better development? Or is this another not-so-great development? This will turn your frown upside down, and get you happy again with a pinch. It's all about the starting line here. The stock has actually almost doubled far in 2019. I know it's lost almost half its value in the past few years, but it lost almost three-quarters of its value at the start of 2019. And basically, revenue has bounced around. Its strongest quarter in two years happened in the first quarter of this year. We're at back-to-back quarters of double-digit percentage growth. Obviously, the company is starting to get things back on track. The only difference here is that it came off the double-digit declines from a year earlier, so we're pretty much 2-4% higher than were two years ago as far as revenue growth. So, the company's starting to claw its way back now.All right, yeah. A remarkable move this year. For any members who bought Impinj for some reason, ticker PI, earlier this year, you are really happy. Rick, what's one thing to watch going forward? Obviously, the challenge when you have sandbag growth from a year earlier, which is exactly what's happening with Impinj right now, and you've seen growth north of 30% in this latest quarter, you're thinking, \"Wow, this is so sustainable,\" will it be sustainable a year from now when you're comparing against the 30% plus growth from a year earlier? I think that's what you need to watch here. See if the momentum you continue, if revenue will keep improving year over year, when the comparisons will get more challenging starting later this year.All right, thank you, Rick. That's three of our five stocks. Now, quickly, to recount here: Zillow, a minus 25%; Wayfair, a plus 73%; but Impinj, a minus 68%. Those who are quick at math will recognize that we're minus 30% overall as we hit the final two stocks. Can we get some performance here to make Five Stocks Riding the Bull Market a winner?Stock No. 4, the ticker symbol is PEGA. The company is , the longtime but rather sleepy AI focused company in a world where AI seems to be heating up and increasingly interesting to us all. Alan Trefler, the CEO and founder, was doing AI years ago when it wasn't so cool. Rick, I picked this stock on this podcast two years ago, as mentioned, is one of the Five Stocks Riding the Bull Market, at $60. Today, it's about $71 and change. So we're giving ourselves a plus 19%. The bad news, rounding the market up, the market's up 21%. So, Pegasystems is a minus 2%. It doesn't help, but basically flat, a market performer.Rick Munarriz, give us two developments for Pegasystems.I could give you the two, one after the other, because they're sort of related in this case. The first one is that Pegasystems, they're transitioning to a cloud based subscription sales model. Obviously, we have a lot of cloud based companies -- Yeah, I've heard of that concept before. Software-as-a-service, you're saying? Clouded?Yes, yes, yes. It may ring a bell. But basically, with Pegasystems moving away from the old one-time legacy, you buy the software once, and then you upgrade, like the old , with Microsoft Office versus 365, where everything is like, \"Subscribe! We'll charge you monthly or annually,\" but they'll keep you tied to the subscription, and upgrades come with it. Pegasystems is moving to this cloud based subscription sales model. That is definitely a big shift in how it's doing its business.That leads to the second development in this case, which is that the shift right now is impacting its revenue. If you look at the last quarter, and you saw a 10% decline in revenue in the first quarter of 2019, you would be freaking out, thinking, \"Oh, no, the company's going the wrong way.\" And the company's projecting flat growth for all of 2019. But that's not the case, because actual sales, how you record sales with a subscription model, is different than the one-time sale that you're selling the software and that's a big ticket item. So, annual contract value, which is the metric that Pegasystems and a lot of these companies prefer to use, is actually up 20%. So you can ignore revenue for now. The more important thing is its backlog of business through the annual contract value, which is growing nicely for Pegasystems. Okay. Again, the stock has performed right about where the market's performed over the last couple of years. Rick, I'm hoping that your thing to look for going forward might be a bullish sign, might bring this stock up and bring this five-stock sampler up. But what should we look at for Pegasystems over the next year?I think the key to Pegasystems right now is the Pega Cloud, which is the name of its cloud based subscription program. That's basically the future of Pegasus. It's obvious. A year ago, when it first started out, 50% of its new client commitments were fine with the cloud. The other half were saying, \"No, we want the old way.\" Now it's up to 70%. As more of its clients adapt to the cloud, there'll be a lot of cost savings, the software itself will get more efficient, and we'll give them a predictable revenue stream, which is really what investors enjoy with some of these companies that are based on these enterprise software subscription programs, where it is steady revenue. That's where we're heading for, just as long as it takes off. Wow. So, yeah, Pega Cloud. I guess that makes sense as a brand. I'm hoping this works out like another pick -- back in the day, was not part of the cloud. Adobe as a traditional company, longer standing, like Pegasystems, made a conversion to the cloud, and the rest is history. It's been a great outperformer. So, I'm hoping this is a good sign for Pegasystems. I'm counting on it being a good sign. Let's hope Pegasystems rides higher here, riding the bull market that we hope materializes over the next year.Okay, to our final fifth stock now. We're 32%, summed up, down with these four stocks. Will \u00a0, ticker IRBT, be the rainmaker, will that be the Hail Mary pass, for this five-stock sampler? Well, iRobot two years ago this month was at $101 a share. Today it is at ... $91 and some a share. Rick, unfortunately, this stock's down about 9%. We're going to round it to a minus 30% against the market.I'll do the final numbers in a sec, but Rick, iRobot, a company that you and I have followed for a long time. Two developments of note here the last two years? The biggest development -- well, not the biggest, but a major development; I'm not going to judge which is the bigger of the two or three or the four or whatever -- I think is tariff concerns. Like many companies that make actual hardware products, actual products -- in this case, iRobot makes the Roomba vacuum cleaners, the Bravos and other items, other cleaners, everything -- some of these products are manufactured overseas, particularly in China. Last year, they paid $8 million, once the tariff war started, to get the Roombas back into the U.S. A small sum for iRobot, but it did shift the company's thinking earlier this year to move some of its production away from China. That's clearly a development that'll affect -- it may increase costs as far as production costs, and in general, setting stuff up somewhere else. But over the long haul, it'll make it less prone to any tariff fisticuffs that may happen.Well, I don't think anybody's rooting for the trade wars to last particularly long. It's going to affect iRobot if it does further. Rick, what is your second development of note for this company? This development actually started before your pick, so we already knew this was going to happen. It happened back in 2016, early 2016. iRobot sold off their military robotics division, which used to be a big part of the story years ago when we first initially recommended this stock. Now, it's basically all robotic arms around their consumer products. There's a lot riding on this. And even though it's three years since they sold it off and two years since we mentioned it on the podcast, it definitely hasn't veered from this strategy. It's still consumer-centric. Basically, wants to clean your house, clean your gutters, clean everything it can, clean your pools, in a way that does not have to worry right now with going out and basically slipping out military bombs, defense areas.Yeah. So, again, the stock is 30% behind the market over these last two years. Rick going forward, what's something to watch? Maybe we can get back to even in the next year. We'll see. This could be huge or could be a non-event, but clearly something to watch -- the Terra lawn mower. You're thinking, \"I would want a robot boy mowing my lawn. Who wouldn't?\" And we've been talking about this, dreaming about this, for years. It's finally happening. It's going to be released in Germany. iRobot will be releasing this in Germany later this year, and in beta in the U.S. So, maybe not by this year, but by next year, maybe by the third year, when we get to that point, your lawn will be mowed by a robot. Like Rosie the Robot, except it can actually trim a hedge and stuff like that. I think this is something that could be a very big product, especially with a lot of people wanting to reclaim their time. This is clearly a product that's been in demand for a while. It could be a game changer if it works, and if it works efficiently.All right. What an interesting group of stocks. Dynamic companies. Zillow changing its business model, Wayfair, a huge winner, Impinj, a huge comeback this year from a really dark place last year, the Pega Cloud, and iRobot and its Terra lawnmower. But take it all in all, this group of stocks averages a gain, so that's not bad. We're up 10.2% here. The problem is, the market's up 20.6% We're going to round that to a minus 10% deficit. This, ladies, gentlemen, Fools everywhere, this is the single worst five-stock sampler I have ever picked -- so far, anyway -- on. Rick, I'm really sorry that you had to present that to us. Thanks for slogging through with me.Don't shoot the messenger David.I'm definitely not going to shoot the messenger. I'm the one who deserves to be shot, although don't shoot me yet, because we have another year. And look how dynamic some of these stocks are. Hope springs eternal, not just in the baseball world at this time of year in summer, but hope springs eternal always for patient investors and Fools looking for some of the game changers and  out there. We'll see if any one of these stocks can rise up and bring all the rest along with it, or what happens. I can't wait to review this a year from now. But, yeah, calling a spade a spade, this is a significant loser, this five-stock sampler. Rick Munarriz, thank you again.Thank you.All right. Time creeps on at its petty pace. And there's ...[angelic harps]... the sound of time passing. Thank you again, Heather. We bring the production values for . You don't hear this on other podcasts! Not even on other radio shows, do you? Okay, you do? You mean we're kind of low production relative to a lot of NPR shows? Okay. Okay. All right.So, about Independence Day last year, we picked this five-stock sampler -- Five Stocks Celebrating the 2018 World Cup. It was that time of year, or every four years. I was thinking about international company stocks, companies that benefit from travel and other things that surround the World Cup. My next guest, Simon Erickson, will help us understand what's happening with these companies and how we're doing. Simon, welcome! David, it's a pleasure. Thanks very much for having me. Did you watch the World Cup, by the way? The Men's World Cup last year?I did not. I'm more of a football fan than a soccer fan. I admit I did not watch the World Cup.A lot of people think of soccer as football, but I realize, as Americans, we see an extreme difference. I have to admit, I'm more of a U.S. football than an international football fan myself, but I really do love the World Cup when it pops up every four years for the men and every four years for the women. The U.S. is much better at women's soccer, I've learned, than men's soccer. We didn't even appear, as you'll remember, in last year's World Cup. But these five stocks, they appeared in this five-stock sampler. Now, the actual airing date of this podcast was July 4th, 2018. However, we all know the stock market in the U.S. is not open on July 4th, so all of these prices and this scorecard is dated to the close of the market on July 3rd, 2018. Now, five companies here. Simon, yes, we're back to traditional alphabetical order with the company name. Let's kick it off.Company No. 1 was Booking Holdings. Now, Booking Holdings was called Booking Holdings when I picked it as Booking Holdings last year. Earlier on the show, we talked about it as Priceline. I picked it for a separate sampler then, Simon. But Booking Holdings over the last year, the stock was at $2,060 one year ago. It's down to $1,874 now. So, it made me happier in that early, longer form stock sampler. This one, Simon, the company's down 9%, the market's up 8.2% since then, so we start with a minus 17%. The just losing continues. This hurts meat very badly. Simon, what's been happening? Two developments of note over the last year for Booking? Absolutely, David. And of course this has some international flavor with it, too -- even though Priceline is based here in the United States, booking.com is based over in the Netherlands. An interesting company. Got their name for themselves by first of all booking hotel rooms in Europe. Went on to have this all-inclusive vacation planning platform that also include airfare and even dining. They're getting you to wherever you want to be.One of the first things that stands out as an investor for this company for me is that those travel bookings have been flat the last year, David. We saw travel bookings only up 2% in the most recent quarter, and revenue's only up about 6% over the same time, too. Investors are starting to wonder if vacationers are taking a little bit of a breather on this right now. Of course, it is a very mature platform. It's very profitable.The second thing that I've been watching is, as they've continued to make more and more cash flow, management has been focusing that on buying back shares. They repurchased $8 billion worth of shares in the last year, reduced the share count by 7%, and they just authorized another $15 billion purchase plan for the next two to three years. This is a mature platform. Management is more than happy to return that capital right back to you and me as shareholders.Thank you, Simon. Earlier, Karl Thiel was talking about this company for the other sampler, talking some about the shift in the business toward competition with Airbnb. Now, not as big a name player within that space. That's one thing that we're watching going forward. Simon, what else do you want to point us to as we think about this company going forward from here?Well, this is a platform, David, that does a lot of business, and then it also takes a small cut of every one of those. That's what's known as the take rate, which is very important for investors to keep an eye on. That's the total amount of booking revenue divided by the gross travel bookings that actually take place over the platform. Five years ago, we go back to fiscal 2013, the company made $6.8 billion in revenue, but booked $39 billion of total travel booking. It took about 17% as its take rate five years ago. When we look at that in fiscal 2018, the take rate was about 15.6%. It's gone down a little bit, David, but that's to be expected as you start seeing this packaging those hotels with the airfare with the dining all together. You're getting a lump sum. You're expanding the whole pie, but you're taking a smaller piece of it. Something I've been keeping an eye on as an investor. Thank you, Simon. You're making us smarter. The take rate. I love simple ratios and a phrase that I can understand. That gives us a grip and a handle on this company going forward. It's been one of our big winners. Any  member of any vintage may well own Booking. If you haven't, then you've seen that it's been one of the great winners over the last 15, 20 years for stock market investors. Fingers crossed for Booking, but it started us with a minus 17% with this five-stock sampler.Let's go to company No. 2, ticker DASTY, Dassault Syst\u00e8mesYep, that's right, I took high school French so I can say Dassault Syst\u00e8mes and know that I kind of have that nailed. I will say that the stock has kind of nailed it. It's been a winner over the last year, the stock up 15%, market up 8%. Simon, happy to say this is back in the plus column now, plus 7%. Not a mega winner, but a really good long-term hold, as we always hope for our services for, in this case,  members.Simon, two develop some note here over the last year for Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. Sure, David. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, which maybe I'll just call Dassault because my French is not as good as yours is -- Just drop the L, Simon. Just go \"Dassault.\" That's it. Dassault. I'll work on it. Dassault. That's it! Beautiful! They're doing simulation software for really complex projects. It's the world's most sustainable company. They got an award for being the world's most sustainable company. They're working on renewable energy projects, smart cities, personalized medicine, all this stuff that's progressive. They're taking all those inputs, simplifying the complexity, and locking in recurring revenue through this simulation software with their customers for decades.The two things I'm watching for this one, David, is first of all, they've got this new business line called 3DEXPERIENCE. They have 200,000 customers that they work with. There's a lot of overlap between those companies. Some could be customers of other businesses that they're working with. So they're trying to create this centralized business hub that connects the dots between the companies that they're already providing the software for. That's something that saw revenue up 24% year over year when the rest of the company only grew 7%. Great new revenue stream for the company there.The other thing that happened just last month was the acquisition of Metadata Solutions. They paid $5.7 billion for a software-as-a-service company that's working on helping companies get through clinical trials. David, that's very similar to which we have as a  recommendation. I think this is a great push as the world is pushing for personalized medicine.Wow, I missed that, Simon. A $5.7 billion acquisition. Now, for most companies, that's a big bite to take. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, the market cap around $41 billion, so I guess you can absorb $6 billion more easily at that size, but that's still a very significant development. Thank you, Simon!All right. What about one development to watch going forward?You nailed it right there, David. This is a company that's made a lot of acquisitions over its history. Almost 50 different companies it's acquired over several decades in business. Of course, when you make a lot of acquisitions, you're holding a lot of goodwill from those acquisitions on your balance sheet. So, the investor in me is looking at this one, and one thing that I'm keeping an eye on is the percentage of total assets that is tied up in goodwill. Five years ago, in fiscal 2013, that number was 21%. Just last year -- which doesn't even include the Metadata Solutions acquisition -- It's about to go higher, Simon, I think it's going higher.27% off of a much larger asset base. So, David, we've got to be careful on this one. If they were to write down any of those acquisitions, it could impair the company's assets.All right. Now, look, I'm just checking. We've held the stock since September 18th, 2009 for members. We're moving up on 10 years. It's up 497%. It's pretty much more than doubled up the market. It's been an awesome company. Really happy for this French company. But you surprised me. I didn't know about the sustainability and the awards and recognition that the company has not only achieved but clearly sought through its actions as a, in this case, French corporation -- it's our only French company on the  scorecard, and an impressive one at that. Well, thank you very much, Simon!Now, it's nice to know the Dassault Syst\u00e8mes has gotten us a plus 7%, but we're still in the losing column as we hit stock No. 3. Stock No. 3 in this sampler is \u00a0, ticker EA. Why was this a stock celebrating the World Cup? Well, that's because Electronic Arts has the most popular video game for soccer fans, the World Cup video game. This has been one of those longtime EA franchises, where it gets a sports game, like, let's say football, like Madden, or basketball, or other sports. And its soccer game is, I think, the front runner for its industry. Anyway, Electronic Arts was at $141 and change a year ago. Right now, I'm sorry to say, it's down to $101. So, the stock is down 28%. This is a really wonderful company that's been a spectacular winner in recent years, but not over the first year of this five-stock sampler. 36.5%, we'll make that minus 37% behind the market.Simon, what is up? Two developments for EA? Right. David, it's kind of a neat company because they've got many of those sports franchises. As you know as well as anybody, sports teams change over year over year. They bring in new players that are rookies, they trade players from their existing lineups. To keep the game fresh, you want to have the most updated version, which is an advantage for a company like EA. They've got 500 million people across the entire world playing their games, which is a huge user base. But the thing that's interesting about this company is, they're playing it in different ways. It's no longer the age of buy the title upfront, one time sale, and then you play it as much as you possibly want to. Companies like EA are actually monetizing more and more over time because it's over high speed internet channels that are digital. That's been much more profitable for the company.The things that I'm monitoring, to answer your question, is how have they been monetizing that recurring revenue stream? EA specifically has something called EA Access, which is where you can actually, for $5 a month, plug your Xbox into the internet, and download and play as many games as you want to, and also get 10% off of those in-game transactions. It keeps that money stream flowing, David. Just today -- talk about a fresh podcast --just today, they have now expanded that to also include the PlayStation 4, which should be launched within the next month. So, it's another revenue stream from that EA Access, continual money coming into the company, and continuing that recurring revenue stream.In-app purchases, really big part of the backdrop of the story for this industry over the last 10 years. Electronic Arts with it sports franchise games in particular have benefited. It's become a way of life for this company, a serious part of this business model. Certainly the FIFA franchise, FIFA '18 is the most recent version of this, Simon. I hope we'll both go out and buy it, even if we don't watch that much soccer, just to support the home team here, my friend. But tell me one thing we should watch going forward for EA here. Let's hope the next year gets better.Sure thing, David. Let's go back in time five years ago, fiscal 2013. The company was doing $1.7 billion of that digital revenue. This is stuff that you do over the internet rather than actually purchase at a retail location. 8% of its sales were being received as operating cash flow. The cash coming in the door was about 8% of total sales at that time. David, you look back this last year, fiscal 2018, the company has doubled its digital revenue. It's doing a lot more business over the internet. But get this -- now, 33% of sales translated to operating cash flow. The company is raking it in as it's gone digital, and that's really good news for shareholders.All right, so we'll trust that things will be better here for EA over the next year than the 28% decline over the past year. We're in the hole going to stock No. 4. Really happy to say, though, that stock No. 4, the ticker symbol is MELI. I picked MercadoLibre on this podcast a year ago this week. It was at $297 a share. Right now, Simon, tipping the scales here at $612. The stock is up 105.7%, way ahead of the market's 8.2%, so we're going to give ourselves a plus 98% in the win column and flip Five Stocks Celebrating the 2018 World Cup, at least through four, of them to a significant win.Simon, what's up with MercadoLibre?David, first of all, I'll do much better with the pronunciation on this one, because my Spanish is better than my French. But the big deal for this one over the last here has been payment volumes. The company is now processing more off-platform payments than they are on-platform payments. Let me explain a little bit about what that means using and as an example. In the early days, you could only use PayPal to buy things on eBay, right? That's an on-platform transaction. But a couple of weeks ago, I was in Toronto, and I was booking s on my mobile phone, and paying for it with PayPal. That's an off-platform transaction that's still processed by that company. MercadoLibre is doing exactly the same thing with Mercado Pago, which is now becoming the standard of digital payment processing for anything in Latin America. Payments were up 72% year over year. It's becoming the de facto standard. I think that's something that's really driving the stock.The second thing that's really interesting that I'm watching is their own in-house logistics network that they're building out. David, sometimes it's really expensive to ship stuff around South America, especially in Brazil. MercadoLibre for a while was offering free shipping in Brazil. They had to back off on that because it was getting too expensive for them to do that. So, what they're doing is similar to what Amazon's doing here in the States, they're actually building out their own logistics infrastructure. They're owning their own trucks, they're hiring their own drivers. Now 20% of the shipments within Brazil are being done with MercadoLibre's own in-house logistics. That's something else on keeping a close eye on. Both of those, very promising developments, as one would expect from a stock up 106% over the last year from $297 to $611. What a spectacular year this has been in the ongoing amazing story of MercadoLibre, the top-performing stock on the historic scorecard. And yes, of course, an active recommendation as of now going forward, which means we like it as much today, probably even more today in terms of our confidence, than when it was first recommended years ago.Simon, one thing to look at going forward for MercadoLibre. David, just like we looked at for Booking, I also want to look at the take rate for MercadoLibre. Because of that, we want to see, is it worth all the effort they put in for processing these payments, and all the effort they put in for doing their own logistics? We want to see what cut is MercadoLibre taking out of the total amount of activity that's taking place on their platform. Go back in time again five years ago, MercadoLibre captured $473 million of revenue off of $7.3 billion in gross merchandise volume. That's a 6.5% take rate in fiscal 2013. David, you can probably guess where that went over the last five years. I'm saying it went up. It definitely went up. The take rate for 2018 was 11.5%. MercadoLibre's getting a higher cut of everything that gets bought over that platform.All right. Thank you, Simon! A lot of people were worried when Amazon started rattling its sabers a little bit, saying, \"We're going to enter Latin America.\" That remains something that Amazon has some commitment to. It's not like Amazon was never there before. But occasionally, that'll scare investors and hurt this stock. But if you've just bought and held, you're really happy. Amazon doesn't seem like it's going to win Latin America. Pretty sure MercadoLibre is. And when you win, you win for a long period of time. It's been an exciting stock.Let's go to our final stock for this five-stock sampler. Appropriately enough, since the World Cup was in Russia, I picked \u00a0as the final stock for this five-stock sampler, ticker symbol YNDX. Yandex, up 8.2% over the past year. The market, up 8.2% over the past year. Dead even. We put a zero there. I'll do the final numbers in a sec. But Simon, give us two insights to what's happened to Yandex over the past year. The first bonus insight, David, also is how the company came up with its name. Yandex \"yet another indexer.\" This is kind of Google translated to another country. [laughs] I keep forgetting that. I love that. That's a bonus insight. That's insight A before we get to 1. The first thing I'm looking at is the total number of clicks and the cost per click on their search engine increased over the last year. Cost per click was up 4%. The total number of clicks was up 20%. This is like, you get your cake and eat it, too. You get more volume and you get higher prices. That's a great sign for a company like Yandex that makes money off of that, that they've got organic growth coming from their core platform.David, a fun one for you, too, is the self-driving taxi network they have over there in Russia. Yandex has basically teamed up with and others to provide an autonomous vehicle that not only gives people rides around the country, but it's also delivering food, kind of like Uber Eats that we've gotten used to here in the States. They're still taking a loss in that division. But that was something that grew very quickly. Revenue from that division actually quadrupled in year over year comparisons, and it's now 15% of the company's top line. Something worth keeping an eye on, I think. Thank you, Simon! Yet another index, eh? That's too funny. I keep forgetting that every year, and then I'm reminded of it. So, what is one thing to watch going forward here? This stock sampler is picked for three years, of course, like the others, and we're through year one. This stock's up a little bit from a year ago. What are we watching going forward for Yandex? Sure. First thing is, companies like these, these search engine giants, tend to have a dominant market share. It's really hard to displace something like Google in the States. It's the same thing to replace Yandex in Russia. The market share was, five years ago, 62% of all search in Russia was being done on this platform. It's still at 57%. It's a little lower, but it's still, in my mind, very dominant, David. That's what you would want to see as an investor.The second thing is traffic acquisition costs. How much is Yandex paying others to bring those clicks onto its site? This is something that five years ago was 20% of revenue. In this last year in fiscal 2018, it was only 16% of revenue. That's a really good sign that it's got enough brand recognition, and people are going directly to the site. That, of course, falls to the bottom line much more quickly. That's something you want to see as an investor for a search giant like a Yandex. Simon, thank you very much, not only for your excellent analysis, which it was, but for bringing some positivity to this podcast. It was pretty beleaguered up until now. The final numbers for Five Stocks Celebrating the World Cup, just one year in, these stocks on average up 18.3%; the market up 8.2%; so we're ahead of the market by 10%, which is about how much were down by for our previous five-stock sampler. Take it all in all, one out of three ain't good. I have to say, I'm disappointed by ... maybe it's the time of year. Maybe I'm not working as hard this time of year. I shouldn't blow off my five-stock samplers. I don't know what it is, but we're officially retiring with this podcast the 2016 Brexit inspired stock list that was probably a loser, but we'll see the final numbers by July 13th. We're holding out hope for Five Stocks Riding the Bull Market. We'll need more bull in that ride. But this group, Simon, if this set of companies just keeps treading water, we've got a winner a few years from now, Five Stocks Celebrating the 2018 World Cup.Thank you very much, Simon Erickson! I had a lot of fun. Thanks for having me, David! All right, well, as advertised, one of our longer podcasts, but especially if you're a stock market investor, we put a lot of different company names and stories in play. For you, I hope you loved this podcast. I didn't love it as much as I wanted to because we didn't have all the winners that I'm used to or want. But we learned a lot. These horse races, except for one of them, ain't over yet, so we shall see.Well, next week, it's going to be  Yes, by one  listener's request, we're going to go back to some of our biggest winners and show how they were valued when we first picked them to settle some of the questions many of you will have about buying overvalued stocks. Does that work over the course of time? That'll be fun. I'll be with Jim Mueller, another longtime analyst here. We'll go through some of the best known best performers and see exactly how they were being valued when we first picked them.In the meantime, happy July 4th if you're an American!

The following four stocks, however , could be positioned for outsized gains in various industries:Source: \n\t -27% (NASDAQ:) functions as a defense and security services company. Despite its market cap of just under $50 million, it operates in multiple countries and competes with the likes of \u00a0(NYSE:) and \u00a0(NYSE:) through its Power Systems division.ARTX also serves as a defense contractor and makes products designed for military, homeland security and law enforcement purposes. Considering the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to increase defense spending, Arotech could find itself well-positioned to benefit. GE\u2019s struggles with its Power Division could present an opportunity.However, like all hot penny stocks, this play remains speculative. The company earned a profit of 17 cents per share in 2017. Still, profits grew to 19 cents per share in 2018 and are expected to shrink to 14 cents per share in 2019, so this company has struggled with growth. Likewise, its revenues for 2018 stood at $96.6 million. Even though analysts forecast revenues of $97.08 million for 2019, they remain below the 2014 revenues, which were $103.57 million. Arotech was founded in 1990, so the build-up to these revenue levels has been slow.However, the future beyond 2019 looks more promising. For 2020, analysts predict revenues of $112.74 million, a 16.1% increase. They also believe earnings will come in at 23 cents per share, 64.3% higher than 2019 levels. Nobody predicts a return to $334.25 per share, its split-adjusted all-time high from 2000. However, if the company can match levels of predicted growth, its forward price-earnings ratio of about 8.1 will start to appear very low.Source: \n\t-24%Oklahoma City-based  (NYSE:) is an upstream oil and natural gas producer. As an exploration and production company, times are great when oil prices are high. However, in an environment of low prices, revenue generation becomes a struggle. Chesapeake is the country\u2019s second-largest natural gas producer. Consequently, rock-bottom natural gas prices have weighed on CHK stock.CHK stock traded as high as $31 per share in 2013. The oil price slump of 2014-2016 hit its interests hard. By 2016, CHK had become a penny stock. Although it returned to profitability soon after, it acquired Wildhorse Resources to increase its exposure to oil.However, the costs of that deal coupled with rock-bottom natural gas prices have again taken CHK below $2 per share. Long-term debt, which stood at $9.167 billion at the end of Q1, has also diminished confidence in the company. Chesapeake trades at just over $1.60 per share as of the time of this writing.The key to Chesapeake\u2019s success hinges on survival. Heightening geopolitical tensions could still increase oil prices. Moreover, new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals continue to come online. This will allow Chesapeake to sell its natural gas in Europe and Asia where LNG fetches significantly higher prices. Further, demand for U.S. natural gas abroad could ease the process of asset sales as the company works through its crushing debt load. If this enables Chesapeake to clean up its balance sheet, the price of CHK stock could see massive gains.   -68%Las Vegas-based  (OTCMKTS:) is a marijuana industry holding company. Once limited to vaporizers, it has transformed itself into a full-scale marijuana cultivation construction company. While they had operated only in Nevada, the company landed contracts in California and New York last year.Seeing business come in from across the country shows encouraging signs and could make MCIG one of the top marijuana penny stocks. However, financials also remain sparse. That said, Chairman and CEO Paul Rosenberg took the  of cancelling and returning 30 million shares of common stock that he owned back to the company treasury. This saves the company from having to further dilute the stock to stay afloat. It also signals a longer-term commitment on the part of Mr. Rosenberg.The company saw $1.72 million in revenues in 2016. This grew to $4.78 million in fiscal 2017, and the company made $1.53 million in that fiscal year. The company brought in over $7 million in 2018.The stock enjoys rapidly rising revenues and profits. Still, investors should still treat this as a speculative play. MCIG stock trades around 6 cents per share. It has never traded above $1, though it briefly reached 92 cents per share in 2014. Still, it will need to see more growth before becoming one of the hot penny stocks.The current price stands well above the 5-cents-per-share level where the stock traded for most of 2016. If the company can continue gaining traction, its current $29.5 million market cap could rise much higher.Source: Shutterstock\n\t-9%Dallas-based  (NASDAQ:) has become one of many retailers that have struggled to stay profitable in a changing retail environment. Founded in 1974, the company expanded across the country, operating in 41 states by 2001. During the past few years, the company has been plagued by high turnover in its top management and struggled to remain profitable.Still, the company operates over 700 stores across the U.S., which by itself should make it one of the hot penny stocks. Revenues have been rocky, though. In its  and margins were up more than 30%. For the upcoming quarter, analysts forecast a 2.1% revenue decline as well as losses widening by 30.4% to 30 cents per share.Given that analysts expect net losses for both the current year and the year after, investors should still treat this stock as speculative.Still, a stock price in the $1.63 per share range and a market cap of about $76 million seems low for a company with over 700 stores. Traders should also keep in mind that this stock traded at over $22 per share in late 2014. If management can meet expectations for revenue increases in 2020 and return TUES stock to profitability, those who buy now could enjoy outsized gains from a dramatic comeback.As of this writing, Will Healy is long CHK stock.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2021 put at the $1440 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $74.80.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.2% return against the $1440 commitment, or a 3.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to BKNG's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $1440 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Booking Holdings Inc sees its shares decline 23.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $1365.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $74.80 from $1440), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.3% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Booking Holdings Inc, and highlighting in green where the $1440 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 put at the $1440 strike for the 3.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Booking Holdings Inc (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $1880.24) to be 27%.

Many saw the move as a  to try to keep the business viable, as its stock price had fallen to $0.55 and the company was in danger of losing its right to keep its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange.Reverse splits are a way for companies to get their share prices back up to more reasonable levels. In Blue Apron's case, by having investors trade 15 old shares for each new share, the company will reduce its share count from 100 million to less than 7 million, but each of the shares will be worth roughly 15 times more. That's consistent with how the stock opened following the effective date of the reverse split, as Blue Apron opened Monday morning at $8.25 per share -- exactly 15 times the $0.55-per-share closing price the Friday before.What happens in the long run, though, can vary. In many cases, a renewed higher share price only makes it easier for bearish investors to bet against the company, and the stock continues its decline.

To clarify, that means they have at least $1 million in investable assets. Examples of investable assets include cash, stocks, bonds and funds, among a bunch of other types of investments and financial products.In raw numbers, 7,698,765 out of America's 123,942,960 total households have at least a million dollars in investable assets, according to Phoenix Marketing International (PMI), a firm that tracks the affluent market.Most of these millionaire households are found in and around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago - just as you would expect.

Because finding those value stocks is easier said than done, three Motley Fool contributors suggest taking a look at  ,  , and  . If you're a believer in Buffett's famous quote, \"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful,\" NIO offers an attractive entry point in June. NIO is a leading Chinese premium electric vehicle manufacturer, but thanks to weaker demand after reduced EV subsidies and increasing competition from Tesla, among others, the stock has shed just over 50% of its value since its September 2018 initial public offering.To be fair, there are , and owning NIO isn't for the faint of heart. NIO's first-quarter sales dropped 54% sequentially from the fourth quarter, and April's demand was slower than expected thanks to a . There was also a slowdown of macro-economic conditions in China as well as growing U.S.-China trade tensions. But despite near-term headwinds that have impacted NIO, there's one factor that could set it apart from the competition and enable it to thrive as the China EV sales boom continues: its brand.What most American investors don't realize is how much more NIO's brand expands beyond its vehicles. NIO House facilities have an open showroom to fuel sales downstairs but also boast a members-only space upstairs, where they have a caf\u00e9-like space to work, relax, read in a library, grab something to eat or drink, or even a place to drop their kids off while they shop. Further, NIO also has an app boasting more than 800,000 users as well as a virtual currency gained by engaging with the company's social media content. As , the company's 2017 NIO Day to unveil the ES8 drew more than 110 million views. NIO could become a lifestyle rather than only a vehicle brand.NIO's ES6 SUV.

Better yet, the company's second SUV production model, the ES6, will begin delivery to users during the second half of June, which could provide a sales spark for the company during the second half of 2019.Only time will tell if NIO can rebound from a rough first quarter and near-term headwinds, as well as heavy bottom-line losses. But unlike many competitors, it has a widespread brand that could help it thrive as the Chinese EV market booms -- and after a 50% stock price decline since its IPO, June could prove a great time for long-term investors to scoop up shares.One value stock I keep coming back to is Children's Place, a mostly ignored retailer of children's apparel. Shares of the chain have fallen 19% over the last month after a tough earnings report and trade tensions prompted a gradual sell-off throughout May. With the stock now trading near 52-week lows, Children's Place again looks like an appealing buy.The company is the largest pure-play children's apparel retailer in North America, and following the bankruptcy of chief rival Gymboree earlier this year, it should be in stronger shape once it  the impact of the Gymboree liquidation. Children's Place's first-quarter report was ugly, as expected, as comparable sales fell 4.6%, and adjusted earnings per share fell from $1.87 a year ago to $0.36 as the company absorbed the impact of the closure of Gymboree's 800 locations.While the liquidation will weigh on performance this year, analysts expect profit growth to return in 2020, projecting earnings per share of $8.06, giving the stock a forward P/E of less than 12. Meanwhile, Children's Place has established itself as a strong dividend payer, offering a 2.4% yield and having raised its dividend every year since it initiated it in 2014. The company has also been aggressively returning cash to shareholders through opportunistic share buybacks.While much of the apparel industry has struggled with the shift to online retail, Children's Place has  for such a transition, closing down underperforming locations and building up an e-commerce business that now generates about 30% of its sales.All of those qualities should help the stock recover its recent losses as it starts to put the Gymboree liquidation behind it. Booking Holdings is one of my  positions and biggest winners of all time, so I always take note when this business goes on sale. With shares currently trading for less than 16 times forward earnings, I think they are currently in bargain territory.What's behind the cheap valuation? A number of factors are to blame:When we combine these concerns, it is understandable why traders have marked down the valuation.My view is that Wall Street is too focused on short-term issues and is missing the bigger picture. A rising global middle class should ensure that the long-term demand for travel remains robust for years to come. Booking Holdings also has a long history of making value-adding acquisitions to ensure that its growth rates remain strong (last year's buyouts of the event and attractions booking site  and customer relationship management site Venga could be winners). Finally, management uses its robust cash flow to buy back tons of stock (the diluted share count is down 14% in the last five years).Add it all up, and Wall Street believes that Booking's bottom line will grow in excess of 12% annually over the next five years. If that proves to be anywhere close to accurate, shareholders look poised to continue earning market-beating returns from here.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

A strong U.S. dollar was a big reason revenue fell 3% during the , but even excluding currency exchange effects yielded a mere 3% year-over-year increase. Not exactly an encouraging number for what is supposed to be a high-growth internet enterprise. A slower rate of increase is not so unexpected, though, as Booking is now a huge company and the global leader in online travel accommodations. After many years of double-digit expansion, the company has indicated that building a single service to handle all legs of a trip will keep the growth engine firing. Acquisitions could be the key to making that happen.Booking isn't new to the world of acquisitions. When it was still known as the Priceline Group, the internet company scooped up quite a few rivals and nurtured them into global travel leaders. One is now the company's namesake -- Booking.com -- which it took over in 2005 when it was the hotel reservation leader in Europe at the time. Now Booking.com is the world's largest site for finding a place to sleep. Booking did it again in 2007 when it scooped up Agoda.com, another leader in global accommodations and one of the top travel sites in Asia. The trend has continued over the years, with Booking targeting and taking over fast-expanding start-ups and other disruptors in the world of online travel. Data source: Booking Holdings and Crunchbase. Image source: Getty Images.It's clear that Booking has never deviated from its strategy of making acquisitions, but those takeovers have gotten smaller over the years -- especially relative to Booking's massive size. These small subsidiaries are unlikely to move the needle by themselves, especially considering the more than $14 billion in sales Booking brought in over the last trailing 12 months. Nevertheless, CEO Glenn Fogel alluded to acquisitions playing a key role in his company's strategy during the first-quarter conference call. Is a big deal in the works, or will it be more smaller buyouts? We'll have to wait and see, but Fogel did offer this information: I think the best way to look at this is over the past couple of years, where we've been spending our money, bringing in things that we didn't really have, and I'll just point to our most recent acquisition, which we just closed a couple of days ago, Venga, small acquisition, but it brings in a CRM platform for our OpenTable operation with restaurants. And it makes the idea of how we can provide a personalized experience for a consumer, a diner, it makes it much more powerful in terms of the overall restaurant operating system. Now that is part of our overall strategy of the connected trip. And we've talked about this in the past about providing a service, a value to a traveler. There's much more than just going onto a site and booking a hotel. That's what we're trying to do, is create all these different things, fix them together in a way that provides significantly more value than any single service could do on its own.\u00a0Big or small, what Booking is really looking for when it targets a competitor is technology or a service it doesn't already have. The idea is to build out a connected vacation experience, a single-stop for all traveler needs. Others are racing to the same conclusion. Google parent  recently launched a new revamped Google Trips -- which combines Google Flights, hotel search, events, and attractions -- to handle all aspects of a vacation.  also announced it is purchasing restaurant reservation booking and customer relationship management platform Resy. That's a direct move against Booking Holdings' subsidiary OpenTable and its Venga addition. As for the recent revenue decline at Booking Holdings, management thinks it will be transitory, with a return to growth expected in quarter two. Still, sales are slowing -- at least for the time being -- and the growing arms race to capture travelers' loyalty would indicate the path forward won't be easy. At least Booking is helping lead the charge toward a more connected vacation experience.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Shares rally on investor optimism and management delivers for the quarter. But management also tempers optimism with soft guidance for the next quarter. The stock falls in response. Then the cycle repeats.But that wasn't the case this last time around. Results released last week for the  were  given a few months prior. There were multiple factors at play, but the executive team at Booking has been calling for slower growth for quite some time and those predictions finally happened. But investors need not worry too much about the leader in online accommodations.Data by .One could pass a lot of blame around for the last quarter's performance. A big reason involved a strong U.S. dollar taking a significant cut out of sales -- and therefore profits -- when Booking converted foreign currency back into its home denomination. Excluding currency exchange rates, gross travel bookings (total value of travel services reserved) and resulting revenues would each have been 6% higher than the actual results (see chart below). But even factoring in currency, it was a big drop off. In the first quarter of 2018, gross travel bookings and revenue increased 21% and 25%, respectively. Data source: Booking Holdings.\u00a0YOY = year over year.The upshot is that earnings rose sharply in the quarter due to unrealized investment gains in Chinese travel company Ctrip and food delivery service Meituan. In the recent past, online travel was a fast-growing industry. In many geographies around the globe (like Asia) it still is. However, finding accommodations and other travel services online is not the double-digit growth story it was in developed markets. According to business study group Allied Market Research, the global online travel industry will grow 11% a year through 2022, but that figure is driven primarily by emerging markets in Asia. Booking isn't going at that fast rate (at least not at the moment), so who is picking up those increased sales? Part of it is that travel accommodation businesses have finally gotten serious about their online presence. In a change from just a few years ago, it's now common for hotel chains, airlines, car rental companies, and other travel providers to not only have a direct booking tool of their own but also a rewards program. That serves the purpose of steering travelers clear of third-party vendors like Booking.com, which get a cut of the final sale. And then there's other online travel sites, from the small start-ups trying to capitalize on emerging niches within the industry to new forms of accommodation like Airbnb. Internet juggernauts like 's  Google have been getting in on the action as well. Google\u00a0has been steadily increasing its presence in travel cyberspace over the years and recently unified its various travel offerings under the new Google Trips landing page and app. In short, Booking Holdings' massive success over the years keeps drawing attention, and its peers want a piece of the pie. Image source: Getty Images.The good news is that the online travel industry is still growing. As the largest online booking site, Booking Holdings will continue to benefit from that long-term trend. However, double-digit growth may increasingly become more of an exception than a rule, as management has been warning investors all along. That doesn't mean the reason for owning the stock is dead. To stay one step ahead of the competition, Booking Holdings has changed its strategy from simply being online to filling in the gaps to create a cohesive one-stop online shop for travel. That becomes apparent when you look at some of the recent acquisitions, like last year's\u00a0 (an event and attractions booking site) and customer relationship management outfit Venga -- which it added to OpenTable to round out its offering for the restaurant industry. Nevertheless, it's apparent that competition and a gradual slowdown in the online travel industry is taking a toll on Booking Holdings. Management says there's a plan to deal with that, and growth should be back in the cards next quarter.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Others like sad stories. We all can think of a favorite bedtime story. It's often said of us human beings that we are a storytelling race. The call of the story, the prehistoric campfire where stories were acted out. Huge industries today have been built up just around celebrity stories. Or how about sports? The news, scores, results the stories we remember from our own athletic exploits, however scanty they may be, in my case. Stories, stories, stories.Stock stories. Yep, every stock tells a story. As investors, we get to know our company's mission, maybe know their marketing tag line. That's a story. We follow the share price. We experience highs and lows, sometimes dizzying heights or cavernous losses. Sometimes both. Our experience as investors gives us the long view, the Foolish view, acquaints us with great prosperity-creating stories. Especially look across a portfolio, look up and down your brokerage statement, and I bet you see stories.\u00a0A few times a year, we focus on telling stories. We're a stock market podcast, so these are stock stories. Visiting me around the campfire this week are several talented Motley Fool\u00a0contributors, each of whom has a story to tell. Five stock stories on this week's .\u00a0[...]Welcome back to ! Happy May! Yep, April's over. It's time for May! April was a wonderful month on this podcast. We had a lot of fun last week with our mailbag. In fact, I forgot to play up my overall theme that I was going to do the whole show long. I totally spaced it. But here was, for posterity's sake. I've done every one of these podcasts, a new one a week. As it turns out through, last week, 200 of them. 200 consecutive weeks. Last week was our 200th  podcast and I was going to make a big deal about it. I was going to ask Rick Engdahl to come up with some musical theme, some fanfare, I was going to ask each guest -- because the mailbag was replete with guests, as it always is -- I was going to ask each of them what significance does the number 200 have for you. I was just going to 200 up the entire podcast. We finished the mailbag and I realized I never even once mentioned that that was our 200th podcast. But maybe that's Foolish. Maybe all the other cool kids, the people paying attention to conventional wisdom who count things and are responsible and remember things, maybe that's how they roll. But we're Fools, we do things differently. We completely forget 200th anniversaries.\u00a0And in fact, in conferring with my producer and sidekick, Rick Engdahl, Rick pointed out, hey, round numbers are overrated, aren't they? I mean, do you remember Dow Jones Industrial, it's going to hit 20,000 at some point. Or a certain company's going to go over $1 trillion market cap, but it sounds like something to wait for. And then when it finally happens, people aren't even really remembering it a few weeks later. So let's celebrate the 201st  podcast. For those who've been with us all 201, you definitely deserve a free on yourself, or something, some gesture of thanks for us that we're not actually going to pay for. You get an atta-Fool. We slap you on the back and say thanks a lot! And for those for whom this might be your very first  podcast, welcome! You found us at No. 201.\u00a0I've got queued up stories. In fact, we've built a little campfire that doesn't actually exist right here in the center of our podcast studios here at Fool HQ. There's a little kindling and some embers and an occasional hiss and a pop. In fact, we can generate sound effects to make you feel that. Rick Engdahl? Thank you![campfire sounds -- fire, crickets]You're now in the mood. You're feeling it. We're talking about the stories around stocks. Each of my storytellers this week is bringing a certain stock that they have in mind, a title to their story, and then I hope a good one-line takeaway. Maybe these are didactic stories, morally instructive stories, or maybe they're just pure, silly fun. I'm not really sure. But I have asked each of our storytellers to bring it home with a line that you can remember and take away from this special campfire that we're sharing together.\u00a0This is \"Stock Stories Volume III,\" we last did this series last summer, June 6th, 2018. History will show it was \"Stock Stories Volume II.\" I enjoy doing this at least once a year. Without further ado, let's get started!My first storyteller, my good friend, Aaron Bush. Aaron, welcome!Thanks for having me! I'm so honored to be here on the 201st episode! Isn't that an amazing number?\u00a0It only happens once!Did you know that the number 201 is divisible by three?\u00a0I'd have never thought about that before.\u00a0I know you're very talented mathematically, Aaron, so I wouldn't be surprised if you're aware of this math trick. I know many of our listeners are. If you, dear listener, were not: you can take any number and just add up the digits, and if it's divisible by three, that number is divisible by three. So when I see 201, Aaron, 2 + 0 + 1 equals... 3. Is that divisible by 3?\u00a0Yes, it is.\u00a0And so is the 201st podcast for ! So, yes! Very, very special!So honored!\u00a0We bring our biggest every three. So here we are! Aaron, you brought a story to the table.\u00a0I have. The story I have today is about  , or more specifically, my story with Under Armour. Let us call this story \"I Will Protect This Portfolio.\" [laughs]\u00a0I already get the allusion, because many of us who follow Under Armour remember the whole \"Protect This House,\" which was a big part of their branding, I want to say 10 years ago.\u00a0Has it been that long?\u00a0Maybe 15. It feels like a long time ago. But you would know better than I, Aaron. This is your story, and my memory, I have to admit, is not that great.\u00a0 So, before jumping straight in, let's start with the prologue. I bought my first stocks ever in 2006, 2007, which as history now notes was the calm before the worst stock market storm in decades. To make things worse, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. But as you can imagine, that's a pretty good time period to learn. Aaron, how old were you in 2006? 11-ish. Really knew nothing!\u200b Love it!\u00a0Buying stocks at the age of 11. Keep going! Well, it didn't start very well. At that time, I was using Value Line, using their ratings on timeliness, on safety, opportunity. I decided to buy a bunch of blue chip stocks like and , but also -- super embarrassing to admit now -- a bunch of financial stocks like , , , do I need to go on? So it was rough, rough seas within 24 months of your purchasing? It was. It was very rough! As you can imagine, that didn't end well. I had brutal losses on a bunch of stocks. A bunch of stocks I knew nothing about. Let's go and enter chapter 1 here, where Under Armour comes in. I was still learning, but based on those losses and understanding that I knew very little about those stocks, I recognized that something had to change. So what I decided is that, instead of just using these arbitrary ratings that other\u00a0publications throw out, I would decide to think for myself, look for obviously great companies that I understood. And the first company that comes to mind, for me at that time period, was Under Armour. That was a stock that I bought early 2009. I had just gotten rid of a bunch of those financials stocks. I had more than enough [laughs]\u00a0to do with that at the time. Were you wearing Under Armour as a kid? Were you seeing other kids rockin' the Under Armour logos? Yeah, that's part of it. At the time, the stock was trading for I think a split-adjusted $3. But more importantly, I like the brand. I saw in front of my very eyes the popularity rise right in front of me at school, right as the financial turmoil was going widespread, stealing all the headlines. Under Armour wasn't in those headlines. Despite the crisis, it was actually doing pretty well, and I could see it right in front of\u00a0me.\u00a0So after reflection, I bought some of those stocks, bought some shares in Under Armour. And that that really marked in my mind a radical change in my investment philosophy, from using Value Line and other people's thinking, to looking at my own life, thinking for myself, understanding more clearly what makes for a multibagger, looking for, a lot of times, small companies with long runways, swift growth, and also understanding the importance of what you cannot assign numbers to, the importance of great management -- in this case, Kevin Plank -- and then the power of a great brand, which doesn't show up in the cash flow statement in any way at all.\u00a0For years, this stock was phenomenal. It rose from about the $3 that I purchased it at, split-adjusted, up to about $50 in 2015. For a time I was earning 15X or so the money that I put in. It became very quickly a large percentage of my own portfolio. That's really because Under Armour was rapidly expanding into new countries. They were launching new verticals all the time. They were seizing major partnerships with big athletes. They even had an Olympic deal sometime in there. So what could go wrong, David? Everything was fantastic.\u00a0Well, it turns out, things can go wrong, even with great companies. In 2015, they announced the acquisition of a couple of major fitness apps, including MapMyFitness probably most notably. And that sounds fine until you realize that connected fitness was much more sizzle than steak. That business model really had nothing to do, no direct plugin -- With the apparel industry. Right, with selling apparel, selling shoes. They also completely decimated their balance sheet. They got rid of most of their cash, they took on a ton of debt to buy these apps that ultimately fizzled out. And there were also signs, I think at that time, very early signs that traditional retail could be problematic and decelerate growth one day.\u00a0If you take that, and then also compare it to the fact that the stock was trading for about 80 times earnings at the time, in my mind, I saw a pretty clear mismatch between, \"Man, this isn't as great as everybody seems to think it is,\" and, \"Wow, this is one of the most expensive stocks I see out there right now.\" And I'm a person who's typically OK, buying the stocks a lot of people think are expensive. As am I, and that's part of what we teach on this podcast. And I have to say, Aaron, even though I know that the next chapter of the story is hard times for the company, and in some ways, they might still be mired in chapter 2, if you will, but fortunately, it's not Chapter 11.\u00a0 That is true! I think that Kevin Plank was trying in some ways to get ahead of where the future was going to be, and make investments in a technology platform and transition the company. At least this is what I was saying about this stock. It remains an active recommendation in  today.\u00a0Yeah, I do think a lot of his thinking is still prescient, it was just a mix of bad timing and poor capital allocation.\u00a0Not everything was terrible. But for the sake of this company at that time, it didn't work. So, in a rare stroke of great timing on my part, which almost never happens, and I'm glad I get to tell this story --That's why we're telling stories! The greatest things that we can tell![laughs]I actually sold about 90% of my position in 2015, right near the top. I still own shares in Under Armour today. And I almost never sell like that. But I saw a very clear deterioration in the business paired with that euphoric pricing and it made me paranoid, and it was a paranoia that I couldn't quite shake.\u00a0 Wow! And this was, maybe, your biggest holding, one of your biggest holdings? This was a top three holding. And you shaved 90% of it off right before the fall. Right before the fall! You didn't drop me an email? Let me know? You probably did and I wasn't paying attention!I probably should have, is the better answer.\u00a0I owned the stock all the way through, but I've never shaved the position, and as a consequence, I haven't done nearly as well as you have, Aaron.\u00a0Well, I would say, this is one of the rare times where I timed it well on both sides, buying right in the middle of the financial crisis and being able, in a rare stroke of timing, to be able to pinpoint where trouble was about to begin. That leads to the next chapter, where trouble did strike. A lot of those concerns that I had about how their acquisition of those fitness apps and what it means for their balance sheet and missing the ball on apparel sales and such. The company's growth did decelerate. They did face issues with some of their larger retailers. Largely since 2017, from 2015 to 2017, the stock dropped about 75% or so. Since 2017, it's been the story of them recognizing their mistakes and reorienting the business for their next phase of growth.\u00a0The story isn't over. But they are refocusing on verticals that matter most to them, focusing extra on going direct to consumer, which I think a lot of companies are doing right now. You see that with , for example. And they're ensuring that the right people are in the right roles. You see some leadership shakeups.\u00a0Now, I think a lot of this could have been done earlier. But I do think it is a promising sign that they are willing to admit their mistakes and correct for the future. And as I mentioned, I still do remain a shareholder. Whatever the next chapter is, I do think that Under Armour will be able to hit new all-time highs. I think the company will look different. It might take some patience, but I think it could very well happen.\u00a0All right. So how about the one-line takeaway then, the didactic instructive moment for all of our  listeners?Think for yourself and stay ready to evolve as an investor.I have to vote for that, Aaron. Thank you for sharing that story! A little bit of pattern recognition. I mean, you're describing it as luck. But before I let you go, are there ways you can map what happened there into a more generic or abstract lesson that you can make us all a little bit smarter and have our eyes on something?\u00a0I think a lot of times -- and Peter Lynch is probably the most renowned for saying this, -- just look around in your own life. I think you'll be surprised by what you see, new brands popping up, new services, new products that you're interested in. And a lot of times, especially if you're more an early adopter, you can also become more of an early investor in those companies as well. And there's significant upside.\u00a0I don't think there are as simple of heuristics for when to sell, especially when companies look like they're excelling. I mean, I will stick with what I was saying. Just think for yourself. A lot of times, the herd moves in both ways. It moves toward being really against something to being really for it. And a lot of times, when the herd is super for something and you can start to look at the numbers that things are breaking apart a little bit or you disagree with the strategy, don't be afraid to think for yourself. Sometimes it pays off.\u00a0All right, the stock was Under Armour. The title of Aaron's story, \"I Will Protect This Portfolio,\" which you did, Aaron. Thank you again for the lesson! Think for yourself! Stay ready to evolve!Thanks, David!All right, it's time for stock story No. 2. For this one, I go down to one of my favorite states in the union, one of my favorite people in that state. We're headed to Florida somewhere in and around the Miami area, I believe, and it's my friend Rick Munarriz. Rick, how are you doing?\u00a0I'm doing great, David! Thanks!And are you in fact somewhere around Miami right now? Or are you on the road?\u00a0I am actually in Miami right now, yes.\u00a0How's the weather? I cannot...anytime I fly in, I just see these beautiful blue pools all around as we start to get lower and lower, your beautiful airport there. Throw me some color, some Miami color, Rick!\u00a0I mean, it's beautiful as a tourist -- and it's great to live here, I'm not complaining about living here -- but these wonderful beautiful beaches, nice warm sun, when you live here day in and day out, it does feel hot even over the winter. The grass is always greener on the other side. But I love Florida! [laughs]\u00a0The beaches are always whiter, you're saying, somewhere else?\u00a0 [laughs]\u00a0Well, not that they're whiter anywhere else, I guess when there's snow cover. But for the most part, everything gets old after a while, even beaches and sun and palm trees.\u00a0I guess it's true, even for Miami. Rick, what is the stock you'll be presenting a story about?\u00a0Well, I'm going to take you far away from Florida, I'm going to take you all the way to New Hampshire to talk about . The title of my story is \"Subtraction Is the Best Addition.\" And the story starts with a guy by the name of Chris Rondeau. And he's a college student. He loves to work out, he had his first gym membership when he was 16 years old. So he starts working at the front desk of basically an old gym that was failing, it was bought out by two brothers. And it's sort of fashioned as the very first Planet Fitness. This is in rural New Hampshire, a city called Dover, population of about 30,000. They want to differentiate themselves from every other gym. Even in a town with just 30,000 people, there are a lot of places to work out. So they basically say, \"We're going to work on price because that's always been a pressure point for people. We don't want to be just for die-hard gym workout people. We want to go in and give them a good price.\" So they get a low price.\u00a0But then they found in just a matter of time that instead of becoming this popular mainstream gym, they wound up attracting all the cheapskates at the other gyms. So they said, OK, we don't want that. It's not that we don't mind the lugheads, as they say, the guys and women that really like to work out and pump iron and grunt while they're doing heavy workouts. But that really wasn't what they wanted to be about. So they got rid of the heavy weights. Then they got rid of the smoothie bar. Then they got rid of the day care center, which was going to be controversial. But at the same time, they also got rid of the fitness classes. So all the stuff that your LA Fitness and whatever major fitness brands value with the traditional gym/fitness center, they said, we're not going to do it, we're just going to have great exercise equipment, it's going to be awesome, and we'll just charge $10 a month for it.\u00a0And right away, it resonated. It just started picking up steam. It's not one of these costly things, it's not a hard sell. They're not trying to set you up with a fitness trainer or some long interview. They don't tour you around the place, trying to sell you stuff. There's no smoothie at the end of the day, though they do have free pizza days every once in a while.\u00a0And then along the way, this Chris Rondeau, he becomes a club manager, then he becomes a regional manager, then a VP. And in 2013, 20 years after he was checking memberships at the store, he becomes a CEO.\u00a0 How about that?Planet Fitness went public two years after that. They went public in 2015. I always look at new IPOs, and this is company that intrigued me, even though I'll admit, I'm an LA Fitness member, only because they're about two blocks away from me. I'm know I'm speaking from the wrong side of this argument. But I really enjoy what they're doing. And most impressive to me was how fast they were growing. They have a couple of company stores, but it's mostly franchisees who are pulling the weight here. That was in '16, and they paid out like a $2.78 a share dividend just a year later to distribute stuff as things went out.\u00a0But then the company, when we discovered it on the  end on the side, the stock was actually just about where it was when it went public. So this wasn't some scintillating hot stock out there, I think was actually below the IPO price when we first recommended it. Ever since then, the stock's been on fire. I mean, this is a stock that's basically more than quadrupled since going public. It's at $75 now. This was a stock that was at $16 four summers ago, and even lower than that. It was a broken IPO for a while, and it's clearly done everything right.The most impressive thing to me about Planet Fitness is their comps. You're thinking, comparative-store\u00a0sales, it's a term you usually see with restaurants or with retail stores. But it's important for gym memberships, because this is an industry where people say, \"Oh, it's fickle. People sign up over the holidays. They overeat, in January, they have a New Year's resolution.\" In Time Square, Planet Fitness was a sponsor there right when the ball dropped, there was a big Planet Fitness billboard over the New Year's this year. But it's not the case with Planet Fitness. They've had 48 consecutive quarters of comps [growth].\u00a0So we're now up to 1,742 Planet Fitness gyms located around the country, and they're starting to expand internationally, on a small scale. But this is the same company, the guy who basically started working the desk at one gym is now running the company that's now 1,742.\u00a0And revenue keeps growing. It's double-digit consistently. Last year was its strongest growth in more than four years, with earnings growing even faster. So basically, here's a company that could disrupt the gym system to make it accessible to the 80% of people that wouldn't be caught dead in the gym or signing up for these $60-a-month memberships that are high-pressure, and you're just looking around and saying, \"I don't feel good about myself, everyone here looks so much better than me.\" They have posted across all their gyms \"judgment-free zone.\" They basically try to police that. They know that they're cashing in on young people that are very health-conscious and self-conscious about what they look like, the Instagram selfie generation, and the older people who just want to stay fit. But they don't want people bragging about it or anything like that. So it's just a cool company that has struck a great core, cashing in in rural America, and urban American, basically the whole country, finding their pockets in these strip malls in the suburbs where big retailers are moving out and there's a lot of space for them to come in and get in cheap and basically move over with their 10,000 square feet of heavy equipment. And growing they are. Rick, you brought this stock to . I'm seeing right now, the publishing date of that was January 27th, 2016. We're talking about just over three years. And yeah, the price that day was $11.93. I had forgotten that the company IPO-ed higher than that. Turns out, you don't have to buy every IPO in those first few days or even months. But it's remarkable to watch that ascent, from about $12 a share to about $75, as you mentioned, today. I know it's exceeded your expectations. Mine as well. It's a six-bagger. But a company that illustrates a lot of what we're talking about in , which is finding companies that improve the world, brands that you recognize, often driven -- and I love the story that you told of Dover, New Hampshire. These are real people, flesh and blood, our fellow Earthlings, who are coming up with ideas and building great companies around them and helping out the world. I think Planet Fitness is a lot of what we're about, a lot of what you do as a great stock picker for .\u00a0Rick, let me ask you in closing, what's a one-line takeaway that I as a listener should remember from the story of Planet Fitness?Sometimes the best way to step up as a disruptor is to take a step back. If you want to revolutionize an industry, you don't have to make things more complicated. In the case of Chris Rondeau and everyone at Planet Fitness, they just basically scaled back to the essentials of what a gym is all about. And sometimes that's enough.\u00a0Companies and brands that democratize the world make it simpler. Think about how simple has made computers or made finding good entertainment. You don't have to go down to the store anymore, pay late fees, it's all just a click away, and it keeps getting better seemingly. So these are some of the great companies of our time. And darn it, these are all active recommendations that we have in  and , thanks in part to people like you.

Go!OK, so my story begins around 10 years ago when I was having some minor elective surgery done that meant spending some quality time in the presence of a urologist.\u00a0 [laughs]\u00a0OK.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0I'll just apologize for the TMI for our more sensitive listeners, but it is relevant.\u00a0Sounds like you'd had enough kids at that point.\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0All right, keep going! So, Intuitive Surgical had already been on our scorecard for around four years at that point. But if you recall, 2009, you'll know I wasn't the only person feeling pretty vulnerable that day. The market was in disarray. It just seemed like everything could just drop forever. Intuitive Surgical had been a multibagger for us. You probably remember this well. This is one of your many great picks. Our  original cost point was just under $15 a share. And the stock had run up to a high of around $120. It had gone up like eightfold. And then just dropped.\u00a0Dropped way back to the point that, I think it got back down to around $30. So it was still a nice winner for us, but boy, a lot of money have been taken off the table.\u00a0Yeah, down about 75% doesn't feel good, even we still have a two-bagger! [laughs]\u00a0Right. And to make it perhaps worse than that, by 2009, it was a four-time recommendation. I think one or maybe two of those positions were actually losing money at this point. Anyway, since I had some time on my hands, I was asking the urologist about the da Vinci system, since he also did other kinds of surgery. I wanted to know about its uses. At the time, you may also recall, that really, the da Vinci was finding its way in prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the prostate. It wasn't really being used for a whole lot else in volume, but that was really where it was finding a home. And this urologist who did those surgeries told me, \"No, it's a flash in the pan. It doesn't let you do anything that a competent surgeon can't do themselves. The machines are expensive, you use a lot of expensive accessories with them. It still requires a lot of the same expertise and training. It's not going to be successful.\"I remember that. I'm not going to say that was the party line, because the medical world is full of many different viewpoints and different practitioners and professionals. But it wasn't uncommon back then. Even still sometimes we hear it today, Karl, from people who are surgeons in the field, who say, \"That robot is not necessary. It's expensive. By the way, it might not be something I'm trained on, it might be disrupting my whole field. Maybe I've been around for a few decades doing the work.\" Regardless, that was back then, I would say, probably the dominant viewpoint. It sounded disruptive and a little crazy to have a surgeon use the da Vinci Surgical robot, which was Intuitive Surgical's big product.\u00a0Right. So, sitting there, thinking about this, I know this is a person, obviously, with an expert opinion, and has a heck of a lot more reason than I do to know where the field is going. So that's an influential thing to hear. But I ultimately -- and I hate to say this, but I foolishly have never personally owned Intuitive Surgical. But I was really trying to think about the best way to cover it for members. And we talked about it on the boards at the time, but I ultimately decided that is a single data point, let's dismiss it. This was a guy who was entrenched in a way of doing things. He had a lot of an investment in the expertise that he's already gotten. I'm glad to say that he proved to be a very competent surgeon. [laughs]\u00a0But he wasn't a known thought leader in the field, who maybe would weigh a little more heavily at that.\u00a0So I ultimately ended up deciding, this is a blip, don't take it too seriously. Listen, obviously. Put it out there, let people talk about it. But don't take it too seriously. I don't have to say that, A, the da Vinci did not turn out to be just about doing urological procedures. It's used for a lot more than that. B, the stock is over $500 today.\u00a0I think about this, because it's come up, actually, with our most recent recommendation, , which just went out. I have heard expert opinions from heart surgeons both for and against already. I am very interested to hear what those opinions are and why, but it's not going to necessarily weigh too heavily until it really becomes more than a single data point.\u00a0 Maybe I can guess at it, Karl, but what's the big one-line takeaway for listeners?\u00a0One expert opinion is still just one data point.\u00a0 [laughs]\u00a0Part of the benefit of the discussion boards that we've hosted on fool.com for a few decades now is that a lot of us do just have one data point. It might be our own opinion, or it might be a professional in our life -- a lawyer, a money manager, or in this case, a doctor. It's hard for us to know what anybody else thinks of things until we start to use social media or discussion boards, join a community -- the Fool community is a great one for me anyway -- and hear other people's viewpoints. I think ultimately, the reason that we recommended Intuitive Surgical in the first place is because we heard a wider array of viewpoints and started to realize that this disruptive technology really might change the world. I'm really happy to say yeah, you're right, the stock had gone from $15, where we recommended it, to $120, as you mentioned, then down to $50 at the time you were having that conversation. And today, it's $500 a share. It has absolutely rocked! Thank you for that lesson, Karl! I really do believe that a single data point is just that. I think we owe it to ourselves, especially with our money in our portfolios, to seek more opinions, sometimes ones that might surprise us or be different from our own. All right, so Intuitive Surgical. Karl, your title, \"Disruption Surprises Nearly Everyone, Especially the Disrupted.\" Thank you very much for joining me, once again, on !Thank you!All right, stock story No. 4. Emily Flippen in the house. Welcome back to !Thank you again for having me!I'm delighted to have you again! Emily, I'm tempted to ask you about the market cap of the company you're going to be telling a story about, but we're not going to do that right now.\u00a0 That's good! I don't think I know it! [laughs]\u00a0 [laughs]\u00a0Yeah, right! All right, what is your stock story?\u00a0 Today, I'm going to be talking about a stock that has been a silent performer, that a lot of people, unless you are a hardcore  follower, may not be aware of. Love it! It's . New Oriental Education, yep, a stock that we recommended years ago. As you're mentioning, it's quiet. I have to admit right now, I don't know exactly where the share price is. I think it's been a quiet winner. Maybe that's part of the story. Emily, what's the title of your story?\u00a0The title of my story is \"The Super Short: A Story of Hope, Loss, and Redemption in China.\"Awesome! \"The Super Short.\" It's like\u00a0. Is this a play on words of Michael Lewis' book?It's kind of like\u00a0, but hopefully it doesn't cause a recession and we all come out of it better.\u00a0 [laughs]\u00a0All right. Start!Sure. The year is 2006, and we have a small Chinese education company come public on U.S. markets. Needless to say, the market's been doing well, the valuation looks a little lopsided in their favor, and investors are very fearful. Not just fearful because maybe this is a pricey stock for a company that just teaches Chinese people how to speak English. But, this is a Chinese company, and it's a small Chinese company.\u00a0Lots of questions about, is this even real? Can I believe the balance sheet or the numbers? These kinds of concerns.Exactly! So when they come public, there's a lot of interest, but also a lot of fear. And there's a lot of people out there saying, \"This is clearly a fraudulent company. If it's not just because the company is lying, inflating its numbers, it's because the Chinese government is lying and controlling the company with their back hand.\" It's a company that a lot of investors are extremely nervous about. And if you take the time to go back and read a lot of these articles written about New Oriental Education --Maybe you did that in preparation, I'm not expecting you did, that's above and beyond what we would ever expect on this podcast, because I'm most of the time just shooting from the hip and making up all my stories, in fact -- but, Emily, thank you for going back if you did, because I always think we don't do that enough in our society today. We tend to just, what's the next headline? But we learn so much by remembering what people were saying back in the day.\u00a0Exactly! And if you go back and read these articles, which I definitely encourage anybody who's listening to do, you'll see that things were not looking great for New Oriental. There's a lot of investor fear. And despite the stock having a nice run-up from 2006 -- it did manage to survive our pullback here in the U.S. -- there was still a lot of investor fear for years leading up to this.\u00a0What happened is, in 2012, we got a short report. It was really only a matter of time before a short report on this company came out, or really any small-cap Chinese company.\u00a0Now, when you say \"short report,\" do you mean what I would characterize often as a short attack?\u00a0 A short attack is an aggressive way to say it, but undoubtedly. Muddy Waters reported it. Of course, they are short the stock, so they have economic interest in pushing the stock price down. But this report comes out and says some very egregious things about the company, essentially saying they're lying not only about the way they make money, but about the way they report money. They're lying to their auditors, they're lying to their investors, they're lying to the government. These are huge claims. It sends the stock plummeting.\u00a0I remember we first recommended this stock, it was in fact pretty much this week, just about April 28th, 2010, it was nine years ago, pretty much this week. The stock was at $22 back then. Do you remember where it dropped after or around that 2012 report? It had just been off of its 52-week high, around $32. So, just off that high. Within a matter of days, there was an investigation into their accounting in this short report, which sent the stock down to $11.\u00a0Wow! I had forgotten. That probably hurt. I forgot the pain I was feeling at the time, because we were up 50%, and all of a sudden, we were down 50%, from $22 down to $11.\u00a0Exactly! And needless to say, if you look at a graph of New Oriental Education's stock price today, I dare you to even find that 50% drop. After that drop, the company went on to be a clear outperformer. Now it's at a price of about $95. I think its high was around $108. If you look at this price, it's just a 50% drop, which at the time felt like the end of the world for this company. Accounting errors, lying to the investors -- to turn around and report amazing results for years afterwards, really showing that this was just a blip in an otherwise kind of flawless radar.\u00a0Now, Emily, those who've gotten to know you may remember that you were a Motley Fool intern in the year 2016, and now, happy ending -- a really happy beginning -- you're a full-time employee here at the Fool. But I know you spent some years in China. Did you ever see the New Oriental Education and Technology Group name or brand? Were you aware of the company when you were in China?\u00a0I was aware of it just from a perspective of seeing it around me. I don't think it ever really occurred to me when I was there that this was a public company in the U.S., which, at the time, it was. But it was everywhere. So, hindsight looking back, you think, well, of course it's a legitimate business. I saw the people, I saw the stores, the customers, the teachers, I had friends who worked with the organization on a freelance basis. But hindsight really is 20/20. It's interesting, because while this is just one story about one stock, it can really be applied to how we're seeing Chinese companies today. Going back to reading those articles about New Oriental, I see the same things happening to many of the Chinese companies that are going public recently. There's always questions about, how much can you believe? Are they defrauding investors? Are they lying? Are they even a legitimate business in China? So, it's really funny to see how we see these same concerns rear their head over a decade later. What's the one-liner takeaway that you want us to remember from this story?\u00a0I'd have to say that it's really that history repeats itself. Sometimes that's good, sometimes that's bad. But anytime you're thinking, \"This is the end of the world,\" your stock is down 50%, remember, history shows it's not. New Oriental Education and Technology Group, ticker EDU, which is a pretty good description of what the business does. Even though they were a Chinese company, they were the ones who got EDU on the New York Stock Exchange. And yes, they've been operating for quite a while and very successfully, and Emily, as you mentioned, very quietly. Most people don't know that stock or company even today. And yet it's gone from $22 to around $95 as we speak today, a wonderful long-term hold, which is what we do at  and . That's what The Motley Fool is teaching the world. Play for the only term that counts, the long term. Emily, thank you!Thanks for having me!All right, stock story No. 5. This one's mine. The company is , ticker BKNG. The title of my story, \"I'd Rather Be Lucky and Good.\" Booking Holdings, not a company name that comes trippingly off the tongue. Not one of the better-sounding corporate names. I think it doesn't conjure up images like Disney or Apple for many of us. But if you remember Priceline, which is certainly still a going concern, an important one today, but this is the company that ultimately, buying out booking.com, which was the Priceline, the travel booking platform for Europe, ultimately, Priceline decided to take on Booking's name. So today, we say Booking Holdings for a company that has ownership interests in similar platforms in the United States, in Asia, and in Europe. A substantial and remarkable American company.\u00a0Well, my story begins on May 21st, 2004. Yep, that was the first day that we published our recommendation of Priceline. I picked it that day. What I want you to know now is, I had the thesis completely wrong. At the time, I was thinking that this company, which was coming off of the ruins of 2001 -- it was one of those dot-com dot-bombs. You may remember William Shatner singing in its ads. Priceline was a big deal in the late 1990s. An early mover in the travel space. But 2001 hurt everything. I remember  went from $95 to $7 that year. Priceline was no exception. It had been devastated by the stock market, and perceptions about the internet, and really the staying power of the internet. Like, will this whole internet thing even work? Yeah, people were still wondering that in 2004, when we found Priceline.Now, my wrong thesis at the time was, it was the third player in its industry at the time, and I was thinking, \"This company probably will get bought out.\" So, that's what we wrote up at the time. In fact, since I'm a board gamer, I know many of you know that, I was likening it to the game of Acquire, for those who know. I'm not going to teach the rules of Acquire right now. But suffice it to say that one of the ways to play the board game, the classic board game, the Sid Sackson board game Acquire, is to buy little spaces on the board, little companies, little hotel chains, that you then hope will get eaten, bought out by the bigger hotel chains that are growing on the board in front of you as we lay tiles, because you're investing in each of these chains that we're building together on the board in front of us as we play the game of Acquire. And I thought Priceline was one of those little companies that you want to own the shares of in the game of Acquire because it's going to get bought out.\u00a0Instead, what ended up happening, history will show, is that it became the biggest company and began to acquire others.\u00a0So, while I'm tempted to already give you my one-line takeaway, I'm even more tempted by the notion of giving you a few different takeaways from this one, because I think it's so instructive and rich. But from $23.71 in 2004, the price meandered. It didn't do much. Then, all of a sudden, it started skyrocketing in the late 2000s. By 2010, the stock had hit $193. It was from $23 to $193 as it became the world leader. It was at that moment that we rerecommended the stock. I remember at the time, people were saying, \"Hey, guys, it's already up eight times in value. You think that we should be buying this one here?\" I'm really happy to say that now, nine years later, it's gone from $193 to about $1,866.\u00a0Now, I could tell more about the story, but A, we're late in this podcast anyway; and B, a lot of you already know the business and the nature of what Priceline and Booking are doing. But I do see several lessons I want to share. The first one is, of course, add to your winners. One of the big themes of this podcast in 2018. Say it with me: winners win. It is our very nature as  investors to look for companies that are doing well and add to them. While I'm certainly proud that we recommended the stock way back then, 15 years ago, at $23 a share; in a way, weirdly, maybe, I'm even prouder that we added at $193, seeing where it is today. I think it reminds us how to invest that way.\u00a0And in fact, one of my favorite podcasts we did in 2018 was the \"Six Hows of  Investing.\" You can go back to September 19th, 2018, and hear me go through the six traits that each of us should exhibit as investors, ourselves. One of them, No. 2 specifically, is don't double down, add up, add to your winners, in a world where other people seem to want to double down on their losers. That was clearly here.\u00a0A second quick takeaway: Names change over the course of time. When you tend to hold stocks for long periods of time, the names will change. What started as Priceline is now a different ticker symbol and a different company name. In some ways, it's hard to follow long-term stories when the names change. Investors have a hard time seeing the full graphs on certain sites that'll only show it from BKNG, not back in its PCLN days. Or, I think of one of our better stock picks, Marvel, which was an amazing stock pick for us in . Today, that's Disney. We see that as Disney. So some of the names start to change, especially from those of us who are long-term oriented, by definition, Foolish investors. So there's one.Two more quick lessons. First is: Foolish investing will often, especially when practiced properly over time, blow away your expectations. I had no idea when we picked this stock at $23.71 that it would be anything like what it is today, let alone have a different name and have done as well as it did. But when you stick with our principles, and you find the great companies, and you exhibit the \"Six Hows of  Investing,\" you should be prepared to have your expectations blown away.\u00a0But the one caveat to that is: It really takes time. The classic thing about trying to get rich quick, we have gotten rich, but we haven't done so quickly. But it's a really steady and wonderful way to watch these numbers compound and roll up over time. Foolish investing can blow away your expectations.\u00a0But the real takeaway I want you to get is that you can get the story wrong. I really did. I misread Priceline. But with good habits, your returns can still be oh, so right!All right, there you have it: five stocks and five stock stories. We lead off with Aaron Bush, Under Armour. Think for yourself and stay ready to evolve, Aaron taught us. Second, Rick Munarriz, Planet Fitness. Rick said sometimes the best way to step up as a disruptor is to take a step back. Yep. Some of the companies that are the most powerful today don't make our lives more complex when they disrupt an industry; they make our lives, especially as consumers, simpler. Story No. 3 came from Karl Thiel, Intuitive Surgical. Arguably a little bit of a TMI story, but we're OK with that on this show. Karl did a great job illustrating that one expert opinion is still just one data point. Story No. 4, Emily Flippen brought us New Oriental Education. History repeats itself. And she's right. What people were saying about Chinese stocks 15 years ago -- that they're dodgy -- sounded true 10 years ago as well, and then five years ago, and it's still an argument often made today. It's not to say that Chinese accounting is, in every case, blameless; or that every company in any country is worthy of your investing. But when you're looking for the , the companies that are out front leading new industries, whether it was , which is one of our best  picks ever -- a Chinese company -- or the quiet New Oriental Education that Emily brought for us, history repeats itself. Pay attention!\u00a0And finally, I closed it all out with Booking Holdings, ticker BKNG. You can get the story wrong, but with good habits, your returns can still be oh, so right!\u00a0All right, in closing, if you haven't already, please subscribe to this podcast and all Motley Fool podcasts on iTunes, or Google Play, wherever you find podcasts.

Booking Holdings  -- but there are nine others you may be overlooking.All right, stock story No. 5. This one's mine. The company is Booking Holdings, ticker BKNG. The title of my story, \"I'd Rather Be Lucky and Good.\" Booking Holdings, not a company name that comes trippingly off the tongue. Not one of the better-sounding corporate names.

I had no idea when we picked this stock at $23.71 that it would be anything like what it is today, let alone have a different name and have done as well as it did. But when you stick with our principles, and you find the great companies, and you exhibit the \"Six Hows ofInvesting,\" you should be prepared to have your expectations blown away.But the one caveat to that is: It really takes time. The classic thing about trying to get rich quick, we have gotten rich, but we haven't done so quickly. But it's a really steady and wonderful way to watch these numbers compound and roll up over time. Foolish investing can blow away your expectations.But the real takeaway I want you to get is that you can get the story wrong. I really did. I misread Priceline. But with good habits, your returns can still be oh, so right!All right, there you have it: five stocks and five stock stories. We lead off with Aaron Bush, . Think for yourself and stay ready to evolve, Aaron taught us. Second, Rick Munarriz, . Rick said sometimes the best way to step up as a disruptor is to take a step back. Yep. Some of the companies that are the most powerful today don't make our lives more complex when they disrupt an industry; they make our lives, especially as consumers, simpler. Story No. 3 came from Karl Thiel, . Arguably a little bit of a TMI story, but we're OK with that on this show. Karl did a great job illustrating that one expert opinion is still just one data point. Story No. 4, Emily Flippen brought us . History repeats itself. And she's right. What people were saying about Chinese stocks 15 years ago -- that they're dodgy -- sounded true 10 years ago as well, and then five years ago, and it's still an argument often made today. It's not to say that Chinese accounting is, in every case, blameless; or that every company in any country is worthy of your investing. But when you're looking for the , the companies that are out front leading new industries, whether it was , which is one of our best  picks ever -- a Chinese company -- or the quiet New Oriental Education that Emily brought for us, history repeats itself. Pay attention! And finally, I closed it all out with Booking Holdings, ticker BKNG. You can get the story wrong, but with good habits, your returns can still be oh, so right!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shares of  -- still probably best known for its Priceline website -- jumped more than 7% in early trading Friday, before settling down to something closer to a 1.9% gain as of 11:50 a.m. EDT today.I can't entirely explain the big jump -- but I expect that the relapse to a lower valuation has something to do with the earnings\u00a0that Booking reported Thursday night.Image source: Getty Images.For fiscal Q1 2019, Booking reported a 3% decline in sales to $2.8 billion, with earnings on those sales of $16.85 per diluted share. This was up 37% from last year's Q1 (which may explain investors' initial enthusiasm), but apparently fell just short of analyst estimates (which would explain the subsequent relapse in the share price).Sales for the quarter also fell short of estimates.Despite the earnings and sales misses, CEO Glenn Fogel called Q1's results \"a solid start to the year,\" highlighting Booking's 10% growth in room nights booked during the quarter, illustrating the company's shift from an emphasis on selling plane tickets, to selling hotel reservations.As for why Booking made that change, you need only look to management's guidance for Q2 2019, currently underway. Booking is predicting that revenue from travel bookings -- plane tickets -- will be basically flat year over year, ranging from 1% growth to 1% shrinkage. Hotel reservation revenue, on the other hand, is expected to grow a solid 6% to 8%, averaging out to total revenue growth for the company of 4% to 6%.That actually might come as a disappointment to investors (although they don't seem to realize it yet), because on Wall Street, analysts are still calling for better than sales growth\u00a0in Q2. Similarly, analysts predict Booking will earn $22.44 per share this quarter, whereas management's guidance for  profits from $22.15 to $22.60 ($22.38 at the midpoint) suggests Booking could fall short on profits again three months from now.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

But by end of day on Friday, EXPE stock had recovered to only down 0.8%. Granted, the Friday equity session was bullish in general but the EXPE bulls still earned a pat on the back.Source: Shutterstock\n\tThis morning, the world markets are panicking over President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets over adding the extra leg to the Chinese tariffs, so EXPE stock is revisiting the lows from last week\u2019s headlines. But still, therein lies an opportunity to trade it for the next few months. This morning\u2019s dip in Expedia is not specific to it.  (NASDAQ:) for example is down 4% this morning.I bet that the U.S. and China will eventually come to terms, and soon. So I still have a bullish market-wide thesis to play out into the summer. If so then EXPE has the opportunity to spike to an all time high. No, this won\u2019t be in one candle but rather a breakout that can happen because to the base that this earnings report established.The earnings candle may have already set the bottom floor for bulls, so they will be emboldened to only worry about taking the next breakout line. For Expedia stock, that is around $135 per share. If they can close above it, this could invite momentum buyers. The technical pattern then would be bullish and target the $155 area.There will be resistance along the way at $128, $132 and $135 per share. So the path won\u2019t be easy. EXPE will need the help of a rising equity market. This week is important because of the Uber Initial Public Offering and the potential of a China deal headline. Both of these are catalysts but can cut in both directions as we see this morning.So those who want to bet on the upside potential should also set tight stops below. If the bears can breach Friday\u2019s low, they can target $119 per share zone. That is support and should hold. But if the whole market continues its correction then that too will fail and EXPE could hit $114. These are not forecasts but rather scenarios that are possible.Fundamentally, the earnings report wasn\u2019t a disaster. On the face of it EXPE beat earnings but they missed the sales targets. For a growth company this is concerning, but there were a ton of geopolitical and currency factors in place. So one report isn\u2019t definitive yet.The company sells at a 43 trailing price-to-earnings ratio which is nearly double that of  (NASDAQ:) \u2014 but you get what you pay for. EXPE is up 15% in a year while BKNG is down -17% for the same period.The whole industry is in transition. These were the companies that laid the base for the online transaction, and since then they have competition. Unlike Uber and LYFT where there are only two main players, Expedia now has to contend with hundreds of other competitors who are the suppliers of the travel industry themselves.\u00a0The hotels and airlines themselves will want to cut the deal aggregators like Expedia out where ever they can. And technology\u2019s ubiquity is making this more possible now than ever. This is a trend that won\u2019t likely stop. So EXPE stock has to adapt.Meanwhile, it is too early to call their doom so It is okay to trade their stocks. But this is one that I would not want to trade a trade into an investment. So setting the stop loss guidelines are important for the overall success of it. Also it is best to wait for the breach of short term resistance before taking the positions. $128.60 is an important EXPE stock milestone from Friday.The experts are optimistic about Expedia stock, as they most rate it a buy and it\u2019s only trading at the very low end of their range. So if they are correct, then there is much more upside in the stock. All it needs is that breakout we are watching for here.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of\u00a0.

Go ahead, gentlemen. -- Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We produced a solid quarter, with 217 million worldwide room nights booked, which is up 10% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. As we discussed on our last call, the timing of Easter and foreign exchange rate movements meaningfully impacted our U.S. dollar financial results this quarter. Our year-over-year non-GAAP revenue growth was down slightly in U.S. dollars, but up 6% on a constant currency basis and up about 8% when further adjusting for Easter. Adjusted EBITDA declined year-over-year by 10%, but increased about 6% when adjusting for FX and Easter, which was above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We are pleased with our results for the quarter, and we continue to see encouraging metrics in our business. Our direct channel is growing faster than our pay channels.Our mobile share is increasing, and our alternative accommodation business is growing faster than our overall business. As we continue to execute against a very large market opportunity, we will look to drive shareholder returns through a combination of organic growth investment, share repurchases and opportunistic M&A. As we discussed on our last , we are investing to support the growth in our core accommodation business primarily through brand marketing, merchandising and customer acquisition programs. These investments are aimed at driving long-term top line growth and share gains. We are on target with the launch of our new brand campaigns. And while it's early, we have confidence that they will increase our brand awareness over time. We're also pleased with the early results of some of our merchandising and customer acquisition programs and look to expand these as we move into our busy travel season. Our branding goals include driving greater awareness of our alternative accommodation to listings as we continue to expand and improve our offering here.We were pleased to announce during the quarter that Booking.com passed the milestone of 3 quarters of 1 billion guest stays in its alternative accommodations since 2007. And as of March 31, Booking.com had approximately 5.8 million reported listings in alternative accommodations, which grew approximately 13% year-over-year. More importantly, our individually owned properties represent the fastest category of supply in booked room night growth. This is a key area of our focus for us as we look to provide the broadest possible selection of unique places to stay, which helps drive conversion benefits across our platform. We will continue to utilize M&A and strategic investments to accelerate key growth opportunities. For example, FareHarbor has enabled us to accelerate our growth in the attractions market and has given us key capabilities to build a truly connected trip, where we envision a frictionless customer experience that we believe will enhance loyalty in our accommodations offering. Our strategic investments in China, in broader Asia, accompanied with local marketing partnerships, will continue to help us expand in these key under-penetrated markets, where we believe we can have long-term growth.Finally, in terms of share repurchases, we completed the remaining portion of our $10 billion share repurchase program, buying approximately $4.5 billion to date in 2019. Consistent with our historical approach to share repurchases, we took advantage of the opportunity to invest in our own stock during the quarter. This year alone, we have purchased 5% of our fully diluted shares. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a new $15 billion repurchase authorization that we will look to execute over the next 2 to 3 years, assuming stable business and market conditions. Dave will provide some more color in his prepared remarks, but this new authorization reflects our strong financial position, our high cash flow generation and demonstrates our confidence in the future of the business.In conclusion, we had a solid quarter as our team remains in full execution mode. We'll continue to drive long-term shareholder returns through a combination of organic investment, share repurchases and opportunistic M&A. As you can see, we are actively pulling on all 3 of these levers. We remain absolutely focused on the large global opportunity that lies ahead of us and we'll manage our business with a long-term view to capture it.I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the financial review. -- Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll discuss the operating results for the first quarter, provide an update on our capital structure and then discuss our guidance for the second quarter as well as reports on the full year. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 10% for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance range. We were pleased with our performance considering the slow start in Europe and the growth challenges in our primary performance marketing channels. Despite a sluggish environment in Europe, room night growth rates in the region exceeded our expectations. Our room night growth rates for the rest of the world was slightly ahead of our expectations and grew faster than Europe.Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down about 2% in Q1 on a constant currency basis, which was more than our guidance of down about 1%. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q1 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately 6 percentage points versus last year. We estimate the changes in FX rates impacted Q1 gross bookings, revenue and EBITDA growth rates by similar amounts and EPS growth rate by about 1 percentage point more. Q1 gross bookings grew by 2% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by 8% on a constant currency basis coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $2.9 billion and declined by 0.4% in U.S. dollars and grew by about 6% on a constant currency basis. As expected, the shift in timing of Easter holiday had an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact on our growth rates on our Q1 revenue growth rates.As a reminder, last year, Easter was on April 1 and, therefore, the majority of Easter related to travel revenue was recorded in the first quarter. This year, with Easter on April 21, Easter travel revenue will be recorded in Q2. Our Q1 non-GAAP revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis and adjusted for Easter timing was about 8%. Advertising and other non-GAAP revenue, which is mainly comprised of nonintercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 9% in Q1. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 was $718 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range and was down 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and up about 6% on a constant currency and Easter-adjusted basis. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin of 27%, after adjusting for Easter, was also ahead of our forecast. We remain disciplined with our spending on performance marketing, which helped drive better-than-expected leverage of 250 basis points in the quarter.While we have seen slowing growth across our performance marketing channels, we continue to see these channels as an effective way to acquire customers, and we will continue to spend rationally to optimize growth. As part of our 2019 growth investments as well as our continued efforts to drive more direct traffic to our websites, we increased our spend on brand marketing in the quarter by 61% versus Q1 last year, contributing to about 250 basis points of deleverage. Sales and other expense line grew with version gross bookings growth and contributed 172 basis points of deleverage primarily due to the growth of our payment platform, our Booking.com. Finally, personnel expense came in lower than our forecast and contributed a small amount of deleverage in the quarter. Our non-GAAP EPS was $11.17, down 7% versus the prior year. Adjusting for currency and Easter timing, non-GAAP EPS grew 11% in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 18.9%, which decreased slightly from the prior year and was higher than our estimate for guidance due to discrete items.Our 8% lower share count in Q1 benefited EPS growth in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income declined by 24% and GAAP operating margin decreased by 532 basis points compared to Q1 of last year. Q1 GAAP net income amounted to $756 million or $16.85 per share, up significantly from Q1 2018. Our Q1 GAAP net income included $451 million of pre-tax unrealized gains on our equity investments in Ctrip and Meituan. We excluded this unrealized gains for our non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of 21% in the quarter, which increased from the prior year primarily due to discrete tax provision related to the Ctrip and Meituan gains. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow in the quarter were negatively impacted by a payment of $403 million to the French tax authorities in order to preserve our rights to contest assessment in court as well as an increase of $48 million of income tax prepayments in the Netherlands. We entered 2019 with approximately $4.5 billion remaining from our $10 billion share repurchase program which we announced in May of 2018.In the first quarter, we repurchased another $2.7 billion of our stock under the program. And since the end of Q1, we completed remaining $1.8 billion share purchase reauthorization, reflecting both the buying opportunity and our confidence in the business. We ended the quarter with $12.8 billion in cash and investments and $8.7 billion of outstanding debt. With this authorization complete, we wanted to update you on how we're thinking about our capital structure, our next steps for capital allocation. We believe that our strong balance sheet is a strategic asset as we look to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead in our core online travel businesses and also as we execute our strategy to deliver the full connected trip. Our top priorities are investing in the growth of our business, both organically and inorganically and having the financial resource to enhance our competitive position even in the events of a macro downturn.In April, our Board authorized a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete in the next 2 to 3 years, assuming stable business and market conditions. We intend to fund this authorization as well as future M&A, be it cash on hand, cash flow from operations and additional borrowing capacity consistent with maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings. On a related note, as we have deployed more of our cash, we have decided to move $3.6 billion of cash we were holding in euros into our U.S. cash pool. This means that starting Q2, our $3.75 billion of euro debt will no longer be fully hedged from currency fluctuations for GAAP purposes. And going forward, you'll see these noncash gains or losses in our foreign currency transactions and other line in our GAAP income statements. These euro-denominated liabilities remains economically hedged by our ongoing cash generation from euro-denominated operations.And at maturity, we intend to refinance the debt in euros or repay it with euro-denominated cash flow. As such, we intend to exclude these noncash gains and losses from our non-GAAP financial presentation. Turning to guidance. I want to briefly walk you through some of the factors we discussed in the last quarter will impact the outlook for the year and then I'll come back to our guidance for Q2. Starting with our growth investments in 2019. As we discussed in detail last quarter, we're investing for growth, customer acquisition and loyalty. While it's early days, we're on target with the launch of our brand campaigns. We're also encouraged with the initial results from some of our merchandising and customer acquisition programs. We continue to expect these growth investments will reduce our EBITDA growth rates by a few percentage points in 2019 and there'll be a greater negative impact on EBITDA growth during the first half. Moving to payments at Booking.com.Last quarter, we noted that we do not expect any additional reduction in EBITDA growth from payments this year. We now expect the payments will have a modestly negative impacts on EBITDA growth for this year due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition on the components of merchant revenue. However, we do not expect any additional negative impact on EBITDA growth from payments for 2020. As a reminder, we believe payments provides important advantages in many areas, including merchandising flexibility, a better customer and partner experience, reduced customer service expenses and the ability to coordinate and manage integrated trips. Now to the mechanical factors impacting our outlook. Using current FX rates assumed in our guidance, gross bookings growth and revenue growth through to non-GAAP EPS growth will be reduced by approximately 3 percentage points for the full year, which has greater impact than anticipated on our previous guidance due to the reduction in the euro-dollar exchange rate since we last announced.Additionally, the shift of timing of Easter will impact Q1 and Q2 revenue growth rates. Finally, our outlook does not anticipate any change in the macro environments, which I've previously mentioned remains sluggish in Europe. With that context, it remains our expectation that non-GAAP EPS on a constant currency basis will grow in the low double digits in 2019. We continue to expect to gain share in accommodations in each major geographic region. And we're confident that the strength of our business, reinforced by the growth investments we're making this year, will enable us to achieve this. Let's now turn our attention to Q2. Foreign exchange rates are expected to be in approximately 5 percentage point headwind to year-over-year growth rates in Q2, which we estimate will impact gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS growth rates by similar amounts. We used a dollar-to-euro exchange rate of $1.12 when setting our Q2 guidance.The shift of timing of Easter, discussed earlier on the call, will positively impact revenue growth in Q2. We estimate this timing shift will increase Q2 2019 revenue growth rates by approximately 2 percentage points. Based on where we are in the quarter and looking at all other factors and consistent with our usual approach to guidance, we're forecasting booked room nights to grow by 6% to 8% and gross bookings to be approximately flat in U.S. dollars and grow by 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis. Our future forecast assumes that constant currency ADR as a company will be down about 2%. We forecast Q2 revenue to be up 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and grow by 10% to 12% on a constant currency basis. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate Q2 revenue to grow by 8% to 10%. Q2 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.295 billion and $1.325 billion, which represents approximately flat year-over-year growth. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate Q2 EBITDA growth also to be approximately flat.We are forecasting modest leverage for the performance marketing expense line in Q2, reflecting lower volumes in the pay channels and our continued focus on acquiring high-quality traffic. We expect to continue to meaningfully grow our brand marketing spend in the quarter, which will contribute deleverage to the P&L and more than offset leverage we're expecting from performance marketing. Of course, the benefits from brand marketing will be realized over multiple quarters. Finally, sales and other expense growth is expected to remain elevated and continue to grow faster than revenue primarily due to ramp up of our payment platform at Booking.com. We are forecasting Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $22.15 to $22.60. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate Q2 non-GAAP EPS to grow approximately 7% to 9%. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 19%, which is in line with Q2 last year.We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 19% to 19.5%. Our Q2 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 43.6 million shares, which is 10% below Q2 last year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $21.10 and $21.55 for Q2. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q2 assumes tax rate of approximately 19%. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue or operating profit from the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market, in particular.We'll now take your questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Thanks. I have 2 questions, if I can. First just on the performance spend, it looks like it declined again on a year-over-year basis. Can you talk about how much of that was a function of changing ROI targets versus just not seeing the traffic from some of the pay channels? Or maybe how much was comp-to-revenue from the new acquisition programs? And then second one, as you look to 2Q, are things fairly stable? Anything strange to call out on a bookings in room nights outlook? Wondering if Easter is a bit of a headwind to bookings in 2Q. And then does your guidance assume deceleration for the remainder of the quarter? Anything you can share there would be helpful. -- Okay, Lloyd, let me take it in reverse order so we can remember your first question last. So relative to Q2 guidance and what we are expecting from a room night point of view, we are -- our April room night growth is actually in line with the high end of our guidance range, to answer your question on deceleration. But that was impacted by a little bit of negative impact from the timing of the Easter holiday. So in line with the high end but with some pressure from the timing of Easter with our shifts. In terms of what did we factor in to our Q2 guidance, our approach hasn't changed. We've obviously looked to the macro, as someone said out there, Europe continues to be a little sluggish. But we've taken all these factors in into account, and consistent with our prior practice, that really supports the way we came out with guidance. And then on your first question on the performance marketing spend, we're pleased with our share in those channels. We are -- our ROIs were fairly consistent with what we expected them to be, and that kind of drives the leverage that we're seeing in the performance marketing channel. -- And anything just to add in terms of how much -- how material the comp-to-revenue is from new acquisition programs and merchandising that you can help us think through? -- Obviously, as we go through the year, that's going to increase Q1, nothing particularly material to talk about. We talked about the fact that those investments will ramp during the year, so Q1 will be the smallest impact as we go through the year. -- All right, thank you. Appreciate it.Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. our line is open. -- Hi guys, This is Ben on for Mark. Firstly, just on the alternative accommodations, last quarter you talked about specifically building out inventory in nonurban and single-home vacation destinations in the U.S. Any, like, kind of update on the progress there? Or any relative performance of U.S. versus Europe performance in the AA market? And just secondly, are there any kind of preliminary results you can report from the brand marketing campaign? Any significant upticks in direct traffic to call out? -- All right. Hi Ben., it's Glenn speaking. So we did call out previously about how important we think it is to have the breadth of all types of alternative accommodations. And we marked that in our portfolio. We felt an area we need to grow more was the single-property owner spot. And I'm pleased to say we continue to make progress there. We continue to grow that very fast, but is still a smaller portion of the overall portfolio of alternative accommodation, so there's room to grow there. In regard to brand, we are pleased with the early, early part of our rolling out the campaigns. And I think in any type of new campaign, you need to have some time before you declare victory or not. So we'll say just that it's early, and so far, so good. -- Thanks, Glenn. And any comments on kind of how your AA performance has been in Europe versus the U.S. overall, like in general? -- I don't think we break that out like that, but we've always said how Europe is a bigger portion of our overall business than any other part of the world. And we have pointed out in the past, in terms of awareness, that if you went to somebody on the street and said where can I get a home in the U.S., they probably would not go to Booking.com. But if you were walking in a capital city in Europe, much higher likelihood that they would say Booking.com. -- Thank you very much.Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- I have 2. First one for David. If your April was 8% in terms of room nights booked, I was just hoping you could give a little bit more color in terms of the guide, 6% to 8%. Is there something that you're expecting over the next couple of months? Or is this just kind of your natural expectation for decel that you've kind of had in previous quarters? And then, Glenn, couldn't help but notice that you mentioned the opportunistic M&A, I think, 3 times in your script. I'm curious what kinds of things you guys are kind of considering and looking at, any kind of color there would be helpful. -- Sure. Let me go first on the guidance comments, right, not to repeat what I said, maybe, to put a bit more flavor, right? April was in line with the high end of the guidance range. As mentioned, we had as little bit of pressure in April from the timing of Easter. When we look at our guidance for the quarter, we haven't changed our guidance approach. We are looking at a number of things that are happening out in the marketplace in the macro. There's always some uncertainty out there, they're not really correlating to our guidance. But again, our approach guidance hasn't changed, so don't read anything more into it than that. -- And in terms of opportunistic M&A, as you know, we wouldn't talk about any specific targets or anything of that nature. But you know we built this company over time by bringing in great teams, great products, and that's what we're going to continue to do. And I think the best way to look at this is over the past couple of years, where we've been spending our money, bringing in things that we didn't really have, and I'll just point to our most recent acquisition which we just closed a couple of days ago, Venga, small acquisition, but it brings in a CRM platform for our OpenTable operation with restaurants. And it makes the idea of how we can provide a personalized experience for a consumer, a diner, it makes it much more powerful in terms of the overall restaurant operating system. Now that is part of our overall strategy of the connected trip. And we've talked about this in the past about providing a service, a value to a traveler. There's much more than just going on to a site and booking a hotel. That's what we're trying to do, is create all these different things, fix them together in a way that provides significantly more value than any single service could do on its own. -- Okay, thank you both.Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. -- Thanks a lot. First, just kind of a follow-up on your last comment there. Can you give us more detail on your rollout of the attractions product? That's an area where you've had kind of a pilot in place for a long time, but we haven't seen that broader products. So what can we expect in attractions? -- Sure. Glenn speaking here. So as you know, we've been building out the attraction business now for a while. We went out and we bought a company called FareHarbor, which provides a back-end solution to enable small or medium-sized attraction suppliers to go digital and get onboard. And we talked in the past about more than 100 cities, where you can now get attractions. And the whole idea is to create this frictionless, seamless way for a consumer who's using, say, the Booking.com app to be able to see all the different things you can do in a city because you don't go to a city just to sit in the hotel room or in a home, you do it to do things. And providing this very easy-to-use frictionless thing where you're provided with a QR code that enables you just to go up to some type of attraction and go to it, either it's quicker because we're offering up something like a skip-the-line benefit or it's cheaper. And these are things we can do because of our overall huge demand, we can negotiate with these suppliers and get these kind of benefits for our customers that others may not be able to get. That's the whole idea. Now in terms of rolling it out, we continue to add more cities and more attractions all the time, and I think you'll be able to go to more cities as we roll it out in the near future. -- Thanks. And then just one other question, if I may, on revenue in the first quarter was a little lower than expected despite the strong nights. Can you give us some color on the puts and takes there, and to what extent was that impacted by the merchandising programs? Thanks. -- Kevin, this is David. Let me take that. I think that's really more due to the timing of our -- on room nights. If you think about it, we were speaking to you last at the end of February and, therefore, the beat that we saw in room nights was clearly in the month of March. And those room nights came in later during the quarter, therefore, they have less of an impact in Q1 and more of an impact in future quarters. -- Thanks, David, thanks, Glenn.Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks for taking my question. I guess if you look at last quarter's bookings and this quarter's guidance of 4% to 6% ex FX, so more deceleration there. I'm just trying to think about the long-term growth rates. So could you talk about if there's some unusual factors that you're seeing in 2Q? Obviously, the 2% ADR declines, other things you're seeing? And do you feel like your growth rate can improve from the 4% to 6% level in 2Q over time from here? -- So why don't I start, Justin, and I'm sure David can add some more comment to this. But -- so I think we mentioned a little bit about sluggishness in Europe continues. As we mentioned before, we're a bigger player in Europe than we are in other areas of the world. In terms of your point, which is kind of improved, certainly is not just a macro thing. And I'm going to use that question as an opportunity to, again, lay out what our long-term strategy is. And we believe that providing this interservice, stitching together all these different things, really providing something no one else really can do and then layering on that all of the money we're spending on machine learning experts, using our huge amount of data, our big data analysis to really provide a better thing for the consumer, we believe, and that's why we're doing this is that we can come up with something that actually hits an inflection point at some point, where it really is significantly better to come to Booking.com to do your travel, and that's what we're aiming for. So if you ask me, do I think that's possible? I absolutely believe that's possible, and that's why we're building this stuff. And David, do you want to give anymore? -- Yes. And Justin, just to kind of drill a little bit more into numbers this year, you've got a couple of things going on. Bear in mind, we, of course, didn't guide to the top line for the year. We did give you some guidance on the bottom line, but we do expect to get some additional benefits from our investors who usually move throughout the year. That's one of the factors to think about this year in addition to longer term factors that Glenn spoke about. -- Great, thank you.Next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi. Your line is open. -- Thank you. I have 2, if I could. I was just kind of curious how much of the slowdown in bookings and also the ADR pressure might be not so much a macro factor as it is sort of hotel pricing competition, where we picked up on bookings efforts around early payment benefits and some other efforts that seem more a response to sort of pricing competition. I'm just wondering how much that impact is to accounts for some of the slowdown in bookings and the pressure on ADRs. And then my second question is around the non-GAAP EPS growth in low double digits this year. I believe that you talked about share count declines of about 10%. So is that kind of the way we should be thinking about the non-GAAP EPS growth for this year, ex the buybacks? It's kind of in the low -- the very low single digits. -- So Mark, let me talk about the beginning, and you started up by saying in terms of our hotels, but I think we really have to expand that question into price competition in general. And in previous quarters, we talked about certain areas where particularly Asia where price competition can be very strong. And one of the things that we talked about is building out that merchandise payment platform for Booking.com, so we could have an ability to compete on price when appropriately, but even more so, that whole idea of merchandising. And it's not necessarily just discounting a hotel, which anybody could do and that may not be the thing to do. What you can do instead is package something. So for example, we made that investment into DiDi. We made that investment into Grab in Southeast Asia. And the idea is that a customer comes to us and we can offer them up ground transportation, along with the hotel. And on that merchandise platform, we can do different things with the overall price, the overall cost to the consumer, the way that makes it much more advantageous to that consumer to come to us. So that's why we'll have an advantage in competing in these areas of high competition. And I'm looking forward to that as we continue to rule that out. And David, I don't know, is there anything you want to add there? -- Yes. I think there are a couple of things. So Mark, you asked about daily hours, I can give you a bit more color on that. They were down a little bit more than we expected for the quarter. It wasn't really a full quarter because that's a fairly important rounding factor there, so it's down less than 1% more than we thought, but they were down for the quarter year-on-year by 2%. And there are 2 factors that are really almost equal weighing. One was to do with rate and pricing. I won't necessarily say that was rate and pricing pressure that we were creating, just kind of rate and pricing pressure in the marketplace. And the other was geo mix impact as some of the higher growth countries are some of the country with a lower ADRs. And then moving to your question about non-GAAP EPS constant currency on low double-digit basis, we clearly are going to get benefit from share count reduction this year. I talked to you about a 10% reduction, that was a Q2 share count reduction. Also, we bought very heavily in the first month and that will impact the Q2 share counts.So something a little bit less than that for the full year. But bear in mind that we're also making significant investments this year as well. We talked about the fact that investments we're driving are costing us a few basis points of EBITDA growth rate. So there are a few different things going on in the income statement this year, but you need to kind of look at the investments as well as the share count reduction because they both have an impact upon that growth rate. So I'd say the good news this year, that even though we're making some very significant investments, we're still looking to return low double digit non-GAAP EPS growth constant currency basis in the year, where we're making that level of spend. -- That's helpful, thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a couple about alternative accommodations. Can you just sort of talk about any learnings you've had from commission rate adjustments or take rate adjustments on alternative accommodations? And how should we think about your strategy on take rate in terms of the accommodation space? And then for any other areas of investment, I guess talk to us about how you think about integrating more OpenTable into the platform and maybe driving more attached on non-hotels to the traveler's experience. -- Hi Brian, it's Glenn. So we talked about the alternative accommodations, the take rates are not dissimilar from hotels. We have commented about the cost to us for those type of accommodations, can be higher than a hotel. And we talked the reason is, one, you can't spread your cost, account cost or other things in terms of getting people on board as well as you can with a hotel because you only have really 1 property, so to speak, to get somebody in the room. Even more so, we've mentioned that the contacts for the customer in the accommodations area is higher usually than for the hotels, and that's end up being a cost here, too. So the strategy is always, look, you're in a market, you've got to match up the market, and the more demand you have, the more ability you'll have to get the take rates you want.And as you get bigger and bigger and you learn more about how to do the business, hopefully, you can leverage and lower your cost across the accommodations area. And along with more technology, will also help us -- and I've mentioned in the past, as we continue to develop more technology, particularly in the area of using our natural language processing to help provide automated responses to the customers, the Booking.com chat bot that works so well right now in English. As we continue to develop that, we'll reduce that cost portion of the business. In terms of integrating for OpenTable, I think you've probably heard me talk about this and it's something that I'm very encouraged by, and I'm often frustrated that we haven't done it yet, but I do see it coming out in future because I've always talked about somebody travels, 100% of them are not going to be at home.We need to be able to provide a combined packaged product, something that we're using all the data we have on our customers to provide them with a better, more effective way to give them value. And it's not just for the customer, who's traveling, we've got the customers on the restaurant side. Using our OpenTable platform is a marketing platform for those restaurant tours, and be able to do that because we know who the people are, where they're going, we know their habits. Doing that altogether, I believe, is going to provide a significant benefit for our customers, another reason to make them more loyal to us, make them come back and will repeat. How fast is that going to happen? I hope faster than it has in the past. And that we continue to work with the teams, so I think we'll see some stuff coming down the road in the not-so-distant future, that is encouraging. -- Great, thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question. Maybe following up on a couple of points made during the call so far. How far along are you to where you want to be on realigning your marketing against your longer-term goals? What comes from performance channels versus direct channels lining up against direct traffic and sort of loyalty and reward-type behavior from your core users and growing acquisition but also growing with engine of spend across users on the platform. Just want to understand how far through that process we are and what some of the big friction points you're still trying to solve for that you think line up against your broader goals of how to spend and what kind of ROI you'll get with your broader marketing budget. -- Well, in terms of where we are in the process, we think that -- every day we think where we want to be in terms of the balance between the different ways we're going to spend in marketing, always looking at what's the ROI, what's the long-term benefit that we're getting, what's the return, the loyalty we're going to get out of this people, looking at the data. Historically, we've always been a company that deals with data and what are we getting out of it. Now it's harder with the brand marketing, and it's much harder with a new campaign that comes out and you don't have a lot of response yet.So as I mentioned earlier, we're early in that, but we are -- we absolutely believe that it's important to continue on the path of building out that brand spend and develop that brand awareness, particularly, in the U.S. where we believe we under-indexed, so that people are more aware of the very good service, the very good products that we provide to customers and develop the same type of market share that we have been able to achieve in other areas. That being said, competitors are always making their moves, and it's -- I don't care to use the word I use all the time, dynamic.These markets are dynamic, whether it be paid stuff, whether it be areas and brand, they're always moving and changing and you're always looking of what everybody is doing and matching against that. I think we're good where we are right now. I'm pleased with the ROIs and I think we're going to be fairly steady in the near future. -- Maybe if I can just ask one follow-up. As you've seen some of the performance channels evolve, how are you thinking about what they donate to you in terms of traffic and conversion measured against what kind of ROI you're getting? Are you still in sort of a neutral to declining ROI environment but you can't sort of abandon them from a volume standpoint? How are you thinking about the puts and takes of some of your performance channels with a delivered 2Q? -- I'll say we look at all factors. When we're doing -- we're spending on any part of our marketing channel, we are always looking at all the data we get back in every way, shape or form and determine whether or not this is a good spend, not -- should we spend more, should we spend less and also what's the elasticities at that time. But I'm not going to get into the details of any individual thing. -- And then Eric, I just had -- these channels are all important to us, so it's not one versus the other, it's always both. And we acquire new customers through lease channels and people sometimes move from channel-to-channel so it's a little dynamic. So just want one -- we make that point, it's really always a question of and, it's not a question of or, how we kind of look at these channels. -- Great, thanks guys.The next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks guys. Two questions. So first of all related to the prior one but on the brand marketing side, which inning are we currently with respect to the size of the program? Obviously unlike performance, there's some constraints in how big the program can reach in every market. So I mean, you guys are expecting it to grow in 2Q as well. And are we at -- when do you think we'll be at a run rate where these programs are in sufficient scale in your key markets? And then second on, David, you noted margin pressure from payments is higher than prior expectations for year, is that driven by incremental adoption of payment offerings on higher volumes? Or can you talk about some of the primary drivers of that? Thank you. -- So I'm going to take the first one, and I'm going to say we don't use words like innings. We're a global company and baseball is not actually played in much of the world. So when we talk about it the way you do, I'm going to use football in terms of where you kick the ball. So I'd say, look, it's still first quarter, first half, depending on which -- whether you're playing in a high school game or you're playing out in a world game. So definitely first half and maybe the early part of that. There's a lot of things still to be done. And as I said, this is early in terms of getting a response. But I want to commit again that this is an important area we're going to continue to spend. We may have to change things down the road, but we're going to continue to spend. -- Yes. And Glenn, let me just follow up and answer the question on payment. So let me just kind of recap again what's going on with payments. So last fall, we went through a long explanation on payments in February, and we said we didn't expect any additional reduction in EBITDA growth from payments in 2019. We now expect that this year, payments will have a modestly negative impacts on EBITDA growth for the year. So what's changed? Nothing's changed in terms of the adoption of payments. And the cash flow economics of payments was changed, is due to a change in the revenue recognition timing of a components of merchant revenue we'll not recognize this year. And we expect to start recording some of this revenue again in 2020. So it's a timing issue of revenue recognition. It doesn't change underlying cash flow economics, it's unchanged, the long term economics and really it impact us in 2019, and that's what's going on. -- Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Yeah. Thanks a lot. Glenn, maybe you can give us some additional commentary around the macro. Back in Feb, when you were on the call, it seems like Europe was kind of not that great, and now 2 months out, is your view incrementally better? Or how do you view the European macro? And then I have a follow-up. -- I'm just going to have to stick to it's sluggish. Kind of like compared to the last call it's -- things we'd called out in the past seem to be continuing somewhat, Germany and France, as matter of fact, confidence fell. Germany reduced the full year growth outlook. Brexit, even though we got off the cliff, it still is something in people's mind and I think it also hurts confidence in the U.K. about making decisions. So I can't say more than we believe it's sluggish, and it's not dissimilar. -- Got it. And then follow-up question I have was just on this ADR being down 2% versus your expectation of, I guess, that being down 1%. Is there some kind of dynamics about trade down in terms of what consumers are booking, how they're selecting hotels or places to stay that might not be at the same ADR rate versus previous levels? -- Not specifically. In terms of the mix impact, which is part of the ADR component, it's really more a mix impact. It's impacted by different geographies and where some of the high-growth markets are. Some of the higher ADRs are in the U.S. and Western Europe, some of the lower relative growth markets. Similarly, some of the higher-growth markets, the places like Asia and country like Vietnam have lower ADRs. So that mix impact is a bigger factor than trading up or trading down within a particular local marketplace. -- Thank you, Glenn, thank you, David.Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Thank you. So Glenn, in the emerging markets in Asia, where you may be plugging into the super apps to source demand, how much easier or more difficult do you think it will be for you to get users to come directly to Booking or Agoda, so you don't have to pay for those transactions every single time? And second, you also talked about what's going on behind the scenes between Agoda, alternative accommodations versus hotels, and you're pushed to run your own payments and how these factors may be influencing your agency versus merchant booking growth. -- So regarding the super apps like say, Grab, for example, I don't know because we haven't rolled out the product yet. And we come up with hypothesis, but we don't have data yet to say how easy is it to get people to come direct or not. So I can't answer that until we start getting some data and then we'll have a much better sense. We just have hypothesis. Regarding Agoda, and I think you mentioned their home business, the alternative accommodations for Agoda, is that correct? -- I think -- Agoda versus everything else and the consumer behavior choosing alternative accommodations versus hotels, and you're pushing payments and how that's influencing the merchant bookings growth rate may be at the expense of the agency. -- Yes. So let me -- so I'll talk just about the Agoda payment, I'll let David talk about payment. So one thing people may not be aware is that Agoda has an alternative accommodation product, too. And unlike Booking, where every single property on Booking is instantly bookable, on Agoda, in Asia, with some of their properties, they're not absolutely instantly bookable. And that is because they're localizing in certain areas of Asia, where it's important to have some of the product that is not instantly bookable. So there's a little difference there between the Booking one and the Agoda one. But it's growing nicely. It's much smaller than the Booking.com product, but it is an important part as you probably have seen, out in Asia, the growth in the alternative accommodation market is very, very fast. And I'll let David talk about... -- Yes. In terms of payments, the mix shift is going on, it's driving. And if you just kind of look at our year-on-year growth in agency versus merchant bookings, that growth is being driven by a mix shift toward more payments at Booking.com. Both Agoda and Priceline have had a payment platform for many years, and the mix of payments within their total business isn't dramatically changing. So as I mentioned last year, we went from a relatively small percentage the year before to 10% of the TTV at Booking.com on payments. And we expect it to continue to rise this year. We expect it to move meaningfully higher the next few years as well, but we also continue to believe there are property -- our agency product at Booking.com also remains a very important part of our portfolio. But the mix shift that you're seeing and the impact that payment is having as it's riffling through our income statements is really due to what's happening at Booking.com. -- Thank you.The next question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks. I realize there's been a little bit of discussion around marketing efficiency already, but kind of wanted to dig a little bit deeper into that if we could. For the last -- we went through this sort of 6-quarter period or so where you saw significant leverage on your marketing spend. And for the last couple of quarters, we've started to see deleverage again just in terms of -- looking at this in terms of total advertising spend as a percentage of revenue. In the past when you've had that kind of deleverage, it's driven acceleration in bookings growth or in revenue of risk profit growth back when you reported that. Is there a level that you feel like is appropriate or that you are targeting from a growth perspective in terms of what you're willing to accept on that advertising return? Just really trying to get a sense of now that you've gone through this efficiency effort kind of where the -- where your strategy is now or where your thoughts are in terms of optimizing around that growth and advertising return trade-off. -- Sure. This is David, let me take that. So you're right, we basically had a period of time from late 2017 up through Q3 of '18 where we had a strategy to explicitly optimize the performance marketing spend, ergo improve our ROIs. And you saw some fairly dramatic amounts of leverage as we went through that period of time. For example, Q2 2018 was a great example with over 600 basis points leverage in the performance marketing spend. We essentially lapped the execution of that strategy in Q4 of '18. And so from Q4 of '18 onwards, it's really been a function of against our now more optimized spend that we feel is the appropriate balance between growth and profitability. What opportunities do we see? How much traffic is being presented to us? Where can we find attractive traffic -- good ROIs? Our ROI targets from that point of view haven't really changed.The actual ROIs themselves a function of what happens in these dynamic marketplaces, the amount of traffic that gets presented to us and where the opportunities are. We always look to try lean in and find growth in those channels. So we're always pushing for incremental growth subject to our ROI targets and our ROI returns that we're quite pleased with. So we -- kind of post the big change in optimization, we're now into driving more opportunistic efficiency from those channels. And like everybody else who operates in those channels, we're a function of how much volume they present to us and also what the competitive dynamic is in those channels at any point in time. -- But it sounds like, from what you're saying, the focus is still on efficiencies versus growth. Even though you've stabilized where that sits, stabilizing at this level of growth versus the 20% or so that you had before you started this effort. Is that fair to say? -- Well, I'd say this, our approach to certain channels will be very different from other channels, right? So for example -- and then you can see how those channels themselves are, in fact, responding. Our core search channels are still growing, but we've also experienced declining growth rates to some of those core search channels as we noted prior. Some of the other channels, some of the managed channels, and you can look at the external results, are no longer growing. In fact, quite the opposite way. So a lot of it is resulting in the dynamic of those channels and the growth opportunities presented to us. Once we lap our optimization, once we kind of got to a new ROI targets, we really are pushing against growth at those targets. So we're pushing to -- we aren't pushing to kind of drive the ROI targets up. If you happen to wind up with a higher ROI during a particular quarter, it's because of the dynamics that will happen within the market. So at this point in time, we are looking to push growth consistent with our ROI targets that we feel good about. -- Okay, great , thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Evercore. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Maybe first for David. One of your competitors reported a deceleration in its alternative accommodation segments bookings in the Q1 specifically. And so I know you don't explicitly break out alternative in your reporting, but did you see stable growth in alternative accommodations bookings in the Q1? Or did you, likewise, see a deceleration there as compared to the 4Q? And then secondly maybe for Glenn, you've talked on this call and in the past about investments in your customers, customer acquisition and loyalty programs. Just, can you give me a couple of specific examples of loyalty or customer retention features that are working for you? And just maybe more broadly, what are the things you can do to deliver more value to drive incremental loyalty from customers of Booking Holdings? -- Sure... -- You want to take it first and I'll... -- It was easy because when we've said this several times now, our alternative accommodation business continues to grow faster than our core business. And that's been going on for a very long time. It continues to go on, and we're very pleased with the way we're building out that product. That's the answer to the first one. -- But relative to itself last quarter, is it keeping stable growth? Is it accelerating? Or is it decelerating in the year-over-year growth rate versus prior periods? -- Right. But we don't break out that in that detail, to that granularity. So we'll go to the second one, loyalty. Well, you've certainly seen some of the loyalty stuff and whether it be you're a genius customer at Booking.com where you're getting significantly reduced prices for a hotel, it's one way to do it, or you're over at OpenTable, and you're getting your dining points and you're seeing that. So both of those we love. I'm going to pick 1 out, it's small and just starting, we're just experimenting but I like it, is the fact that you can now use those dining points and you can, instead of using them just to get a cheaper restaurant meal, you can use those to get a cheaper hotel room. That's a perfect thing. And maybe you've actually seen some of the TV ads going out there.That's actually KAYAK is the one doing it with OpenTable, and that's an example where you can do that. Now we've been experimenting with some other things, different services that we have and this deal is primarily with the ground transportation. We have a company called Rentalcars.com, which is more than just rental cars. It's ground transportation, has a lot of good relationship with different types of ground transportation, black cars, ridesharing, et cetera. And we're experimenting with different ways to package the services and give that better value to the customer.

For this reason, many investors are willing to take chances on what they believe to be  Investors in these stocks often lose everything \u2026 but they can also end up earning massive profits from a small amount of investment capital.For example,  (NASDAQ:) (formerly known as Priceline.com) traded as low as $1.08 per share in 2001. BKNG now trades over $1,982 per share. (NYSE:) fell to 60 cents per share in 2002 following the dot-com crash. AMT now sells for about $145 per share.I cannot guarantee such a comeback for any penny stock of today.

Despite its market cap of only $84 million, it operates in multiple countries and competes with the likes of  (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:) through its Power Systems division.ARTX also serves as a defense contractor and makes products designed for military, homeland security and law enforcement purposes. Considering the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to increase defense spending, Arotech could find itself well-positioned to benefit.However, like all hot penny stocks, this play remains speculative. Its revenues for 2018 stood at $96.6 million. Its 2014 revenues were $103.57 million, so this company has struggled with growth. Arotech was founded in 1990, and one of its divisions came into existence in 1971. Hence, the build to these revenues has been slow.The company earned a profit of 17 cents per share in 2017. Still, profits grew to 19 cents per share in 2018 and are expected to grow to 26 cents per share in 2019. This could indicate this company may enjoy some growth. If the company can sustain that growth and speed up its slow growth trajectory, its forward price-earnings ratio of 9.67 starts to appear very low.\n\t\n\t\tSource: Shutterstock\n\t-19.14%Tulsa-based  (NASDAQ:) is an upstream oil and natural gas producer. As an exploration and production company, times are great when oil prices are high. However, in an environment of low prices, revenue generation becomes a struggle.MCEP stock traded as high as $27 per share in 2013. The oil price slump of 2014-2016 hit its interests hard. By 2016, MCEP had become a penny stock, trading as low as 73 cents per share at one point. The stock has struggled to gain traction since then, briefly reaching $1.75, and now trades closer to 80 cents.However, company financials may have begun a turnaround. Revenue fell from $96.91 million in 2014 to $56.1 million by 2016. Although revenues rose to $58.93 million in 2017, analysts estimate revenues will remain below $60 million for both 2018 and 2019.Whether those estimates factor in higher crude prices remains unclear. And at these levels, investors should still consider MCEP stock speculative. However, the stock remained consistently above $20 per share while oil traded above $100 per barrel. If oil can get its mojo back, perhaps MCEP stock will return to 2013 levels and become one of the Street\u2019s hot penny stocks.\n\t\n\t\tSource: Shutterstock\n\t78.2%Las Vegas-based  (OTCMKTS:) is a marijuana industry holding company.

However, financials also remain sparse. The company saw $1.72 million in revenues in 2016. This grew to $4.78 million in fiscal 2017, and the company made $1.53 million in that fiscal year. The company brought in over $7\u00a0 million in 2018.Still, investors should still treat this as a speculative play. The stock enjoys rapidly rising revenues and profits. MCIG stock trades around 78 cents per share. It has never traded above $1, though it briefly reached 92 cents per share in 2014. Still, it will need to see more growth before becoming one of the hot penny stocks.The current price stands well above the 5-cents-per-share level where the stock traded for most of 2016.

During the past few years, the company has been plagued by high turnover in its top management and struggled to remain profitable.Still, the company operates 724 stores across the U.S., which by itself should make it one of the hot penny stocks. Moreover, revenue grew by 1.4% in its  (). Comparable store sales rose by 1.9% in Q2 2019 as well. Investors should also note that the company relocated 58 stores in the last 12 months.However, given that analysts expect net losses for both the current year and the year after, investors should still treat this stock as speculative.Still, a stock price in the $2.25 per share range and a market cap of about $88 million seems low for a company with 724 stores.

At the time, the company was focused on providing a \u201cName Your Price\u201d model for purchasing airline tickets.Yet since then, BKNG has gone through a major transformation, mostly driven by aggressive M&A.

For example, according to , the category is forecasted to hit $1.955 trillion by 2026. This would come to a compound annual growth rate of 12.1%.Some of the driving forces include: the ubiquity of smartphones, the availability of secure payment systems and rising income in emerging markets.So all in all, there are strong tailwinds that should help gin up growth for Booking Holdings stock, especially since it has a broad base of offerings that span key parts of the online travel space.For the most part, it looks like much of the problems are baked into Booking Holdings stock. After all, the valuation is fairly low at current levels, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio at about 16X or so. This is reasonable in light of the company\u2019s strong positioning and brands in core markets. Such advantages are difficult for companies to replicate.Besides, the company continues to generate substantial cash flows, which allow for healthy buybacks and acquisitions.

Going forward, we expect the company to sustain this momentum and generate around $12.5 billion in revenues in 2019, which would represent year-on-year growth of nearly 11%.Expedia's stock price is up more than 10% since the beginning of 2019. We have maintained our  , which is slightly ahead of the current market price. We have created an interactive dashboard on  , which outlines our forecasts for the company. You can modify our forecasts to see the impact any changes would have on the company's earnings and valuation, and see all of our  .Looking at full-year 2019 revenues, we forecast $9.6 billion in revenues for the core OTA business, nearly $1.3 billion for the HomeAway business, over $900 million for Trivago, and over $600 million for Egencia. We estimate a take rate of around 11% for 2019, which is similar to the figure for the past few years. This, combined with a gross booking forecast of $87.5 billion, should help generate OTA revenue of $9.6 billion in 2019. In addition, Expedia now expects its consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth to be in the range of 10-15% in 2019. To add to that, Expedia also expects cloud expenses to increase from $141 million in 2018 to around $250 million in 2019. The company continues to leverage its data-driven approach to marketing optimization while continuing to aggressively drive its global expansion plans. We expect this to drive the company's value in the near term.Turning to Expedia's expenses - we expect the company's expenses to increase by nearly 4% in 2019. Among the expense components, the company expects a significant decline in cost of sales and technology and content expenses compared to 2018. This is largely due to increased investment in cloud, customer operations cost related to new details at Expedia Partner Solutions, HomeAway's shift to becoming a merchant of record on more of its transactions, and continued investments in product enhancements across the company. On the other hand, the company expects SG&A costs to increase in 2019, reflecting the cost rationalization efforts at Trivago.What's behind Trefis?

Specifically, Telsey warned that rising competition from both  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) and  in an already stiffly competitive booking market were reasons to move to the sidelines on the stock. Consequently, Telsey slapped a Market Perform rating on BKNG stock, with an $1,800 price target, implying limited upside over the next twelve months.Source: Priceline.com\n\tThis downgrade makes sense, for the most part. Booking.com faces some big challenges on the competition front. Alphabet and Airbnb are just two of many, many competitors which look positioned to take share from Booking\u2019s suite of travel and reservation platforms over the next several years. Also, growth at Booking is already slowing, and margins appear largely maxed out.As such, there are reasons to be worried about BKNG stock over the next several years.But, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d stay on the sidelines with this name. The stock is pretty cheap. Indeed, it\u2019s cheap enough to reasonably make the argument that shares are already priced for bad news. Going forward, it won\u2019t be all bad news. Yes, competition is rising. Yes, growth is slowing. But, there are also still very big secular tailwinds at play here which should keep Booking\u2019s revenues and profits on a healthy uptrend.If so, BKNG stock should rise from here, meaning it\u2019s time to get cautiously bullish, not move to the sidelines.Broadly speaking, the fundamentals underlying BKNG stock are good enough.Sure, there are a handful of negatives at play here. Namely, when you look at Booking\u2019s suite of platforms (Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, and OpenTable), you get this feeling that those are yesterday\u2019s favoring booking platforms. Today, it seems a lot of people are using Google for flights and hotels, while  and other sharing apps are the new hot things in the car rental market. Meanwhile, Airbnb is still taking share in the accommodations market. That\u2019s largely bad news for BKNG stock, too.You also have continued competition from the likes of  (NYSE:), , and many others.Overall, there are a bunch of current and new competition in the bookings industry, the sum of which will gradually take share from Booking\u2019s suite of platforms.Having said that, this share erosion won\u2019t kill the Booking growth narrative. The whole bookings industry is growing by leaps and bounds, thanks to multiple secular tailwinds. First, you have the big experience economy shift wherein consumers globally are valuing experiences (eating out, traveling, staying at cool hotels, etc.) over products. Second, there are global urbanization and digitization trends at play around the world which are likewise increasing the size of the global bookings market.As such, Booking can afford to lose market share in the global bookings market, yet still grow at a \u201cgood enough\u201d pace to keep investors happy. That\u2019s exactly what will happen over the next several years. Market growth tailwinds will offset share erosion headwinds, and Booking\u2019s revenue and profit growth will remain on a healthy uptrend.The bull thesis on BKNG stock centers around the fact the stock isn\u2019t priced for good enough growth. It\u2019s priced for worse. But, good enough growth is exactly what will happen, and as such, the stock has healthy upside potential from here.Breaking that down, BKNG stock trades at just 17-times forward earnings today. That is a multi-year low valuation, and about 15% below the stock\u2019s five-average forward multiple of 20. BKNG stock is also trading at a significantly below-average trailing sales multiple, trailing EBITDA multiple, and trailing cash flow multiple.Meanwhile, revenue growth is running in the high-single-digit to low-double-digit range. Margins are largely stable. Buybacks are happening. Assuming this growth profile largely persists over the next several years, Booking projects as a double-digit profit grower for the foreseeable future.Under conservative modeling assumptions (slowing revenue growth, slight margin expansion, and relatively muted buybacks), I think this company can do about $170 in EPS by fiscal 2025. The market doesn\u2019t seem to want to pay 20 forward earnings for this name anymore. But, a market average 16 forward multiple seems too conservative given the secular tailwinds. Splitting the difference, an 18 forward multiple at scale seems reasonable.Based on an 18x forward multiple, a reasonable fiscal 2024 price target for BKNG stock is around $3,060. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target of $1,900. That implies nearly 10% upside over the next several months.Booking Holdings will face some serious competitive challenges over the next several years, the sum of which will create share erosion headwinds for the company. But, those share erosion headwinds will be largely offset by bookings market growth tailwinds. This offset will allow revenues and profits to stay on a healthy uptrend. So long as this persists, BKNG stock has room to rally from today\u2019s relatively depressed valuation.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long GOOG.\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t's not hard to see stocks that trade at mere pennies and imagine the types of returns you'd get if shares were to rise to the price of an average candy bar. News can sometimes cause  to post big gains, and companies in this highly volatile category can even see dramatic valuation swings for seemingly no reason at all. As exciting as that is,  actually tend to be pretty terrible as investments.Whether you're looking for huge growth potential, more conservative value plays, or a risk-to-reward profile somewhere in between, you'll tend to fare much better by seeking companies that are backed by appealing businesses and offer an appropriate degree of visibility into what the future might hold. It's tough to get that with the large majority of penny stocks, so these three Motley Fool contributors have identified three companies that offer much better prospects. Read on to see why they think  (NASDAQ: BZUN) ,  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , and  (NASDAQ: GRMN) could be big winners.Image source: Getty Images. (Baozun): The Chinese tech sector is a great starting point if you're seeking huge returns and are willing to take on the higher degree of risk that comes with that territory. Baozun is an e-commerce stock that offers big long-term upside, and I think its risk-to-reward dynamic is one that is actually very favorable for patient investors -- and certainly better than you're likely to get with the vast majority of penny stocks.With a market capitalization of roughly $2 billion and a business that's putting up good results and has a long runway for growth, Baozun still offers investors big growth potential. The company provides customizable e-commerce websites for major Western brands that are looking for a no-hassle way to quickly enter and scale their businesses in China's hot e-commerce market. That's an appealing niche to be operating in -- even if the market is less bullish on Chinese tech stocks than it was a year ago.Baozun shares hit a lifetime high of $67 per share last summer but have dipped to the $36 range as China's slowing economic growth and volatility for the country's technology stocks prompted a retreat. Last year growth for the Middle Kingdom's online retail market came in at 24% year over year -- that's a good bit slower than the 32% year-over-year growth that the country's e-commerce market posted in 2017. However, that's also far from being a bad economic backdrop to be operating in, and China still accounted for more than half of the world's e-commerce spending last year.Investors should expect some bumps in the road, but Baozun's trajectory looks appealing. The company has a leading position in its industry niche, and partnerships with bigger and more powerful Chinese tech and e-commerce platforms including  's T-Mall,  , and  's WeChat suggest that its business can continue to grow along with the titans of the industry rather than be cannibalized by them.E-commerce is only going to get bigger, and for investors who are looking to benefit from the rise of online retail or just looking for attractively priced growth stocks,  . Shares trade at roughly 23.5 times this year's expected earnings. You want the opposite of a volatile penny stock to invest in? Are you clever enough to realize that  , so long as it's earning enough to justify the price? Last question: Are you sitting down?Because I'm about to recommend a stock that costs more than Its name is Booking Holdings, but it's a stock you probably know better as Priceline. Priced at $1,715 per share, it doesn't look cheap on the surface, but with more than $83 a share in earnings, Booking Holdings actually sells for a P/E ratio of just 19.3, and a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of just 15.8.(For context, the average stock on the S&P 500 right now costs more than  times earnings.)In other words, Booking Holdings actually  cheap, relative to most other stocks. It's also a whole lot more robust than most other stocks. Over the 22 years since its foundation, Booking Holdings has steadily marched out and snapped up most of its most dangerous competitors, brought them in-house, and incorporated them into its business. Today, with brands ranging from Priceline and Kayak (plane tickets) to Booking.com (hotels) to OpenTable (restaurant reservations) to RentalCars.com (I'll give you three guesses), consumers need look no further than Booking Holdings to find a one-stop shopping destination for just about any need they might encounter when traveling.And investors need look no further than Booking Holdings to find a better investment than penny stocks. Investors have pushed shares of Garmin up to new highs recently, but they still might be underestimating the growth potential of this impressive business. The consumer electronics specialist just celebrated a  of record sales and improving profitability in 2018, and market share wins in areas stretching from smartwatches to marine GPS navigators demonstrate two important things about the business. First, it has a broad-enough portfolio to take those inevitable sharp consumer demand shifts in stride. The recent stampede away from cheap fitness trackers toward high-functioning smartwatches barely hurt the broader business, after all, while causing huge problems for peer  .Second, Garmin's strength isn't confined to just mass-market consumer products. Some of its best growth lately is coming from aviation and marine-based devices, which also happen to carry company-leading profit margins.These strengths, plus world-class R&D and marketing competencies, have allowed Garmin to grow steadily since 2015 even through crashing demand for automotive GPS devices and value-priced fitness monitors.

While the occasional mega IPO heads our way once in a while, we've now got a backlog of huge \"unicorn\" companies ready to hit the public markets. And that makes them important stocks to watch. Unlike the past, where these companies needed funding to grow their business, these IPOs are a way to bring in a new set of investors and cash out the long-time investors that are looking to ring the register.There are at least  ready to hit the market over the next year, but that may not be a good thing for stocks. The stock market is all about supply and demand. The more supply we bring in, the lower prices goes. The higher demand, the higher the price.Thanks to this basic principle, we can conclude that, short of investors moving more cash to their brokerage account or investment managers raising more funds, they will have to sell some of their holdings to get a piece of the IPO pie. When it's one or two IPOs, the market can usually work its way through it. But this number of upcoming IPOs could create a sag on the market.That doesn't mean the stock market will collapse or that individual stocks will get cut in half because of it. But this cooling effect can really turn off sentiment. Here are some stocks to watch as the markets address this year's IPO backlog.If  is  , it will beat a lot of others to the market. With its IPO valuation likely somewhere between $20 billion and $25 billion (and perhaps even higher once trading starts, assuming we just get a  ), it won't be the biggest IPO to hit the market.However,  will be when it barges through the gate with a swollen valuation in excess of $100 billion. Some estimates have pegged its valuation at more than $120 billion, larger than  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) combined.When a company like this comes public, it can have a big overhang on other names. Of course, this overhang isn't guaranteed, but when fund managers need to free up $500 million here or $2 billion there to get an allocation, they're going to hit up their \"source of funds stocks,\" like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ).If they have a $10 billion stake in GOOGL or Apple, who's to say they don't shave them down by 10% to free up some capital to get their hands on Uber? When we see this from dozens of firms, it can have a nasty overall effect. is reportedly eyeing a valuation between $12 billion and $15 billion, although a sliver deal could certainly send the stock surging higher with little regard to valuation.That could cause fund managers who have lost in  (NYSE:  ) to sell and try to make up their losses in Pinterest. How about  (NYSE:  ), which is down 12% over the past 12 months and down more than 43% over the past five years?Even Facebook, which has been doing quite well lately, could come under pressure. Long-term fund managers or investors in the name may be tempted to ring the register after such a solid rally. Those who were trapped at higher prices before the bottom fell out may want to bail soon too.I wouldn't worry about FB too much in regards to the Pinterest IPO,  . With Lyft, Uber and others coming though, it could feel the heat.The Lyft IPO will come before the Uber IPO, while Slack is reportedly looking for a $10 billion valuation when it goes public. You can see that it doesn't take an 800-lb. gorilla (Uber in this case) to sap money from other stocks. We can see it in the accumulation of mid-sized upcoming IPOs.When tech-focused investors need to raise funds for the $25 billion IPO of Lyft, $10 billion IPO of Slack and $12 billion to $15 billion IPO of Pinterest, you can see where selling becomes a necessity.Like Apple and FANG,  (NASDAQ:  ) could act as a source of funds for Lyft and Slack, the latter of which is more in-line with Microsoft's business than Lyft. They are may not directly overlap and MSFT may not feel any needle-moving competitive pressure from Slack, but the IPO could jar investors away from this long-time winner.Tech in generally, via the  (NASDAQ:  ) or otherwise could come under pressure too. Maybe investors sell  (NASDAQ:  ), the long-time winner that has badly outperformed since Q4. Perhaps it's  (NASDAQ:  ) or even a name like  (NASDAQ:  ).After raising $1 billion at a $31 billion valuation,  is no small-time private company. The  added to its lineup when it acquired HotelTonight for $465 million.While it would be untrue to say that Airbnb is ruining the hotel market - it's not - the platform has certainly changed how vacations are done. It has impacted the hospitality market, as well as real estate prices in certain markets.But if Airbnb comes along at a $40 billion valuation or more, vacation accommodation sites could see selling pressure. Why own  (NASDAQ:  ) amid its downtrend and heavy European exposure when someone can own Airbnb instead? Or perhaps consider swapping  (NASDAQ:  ), owner of VRBO and HomeAway, to get a piece of Airbnb.As good as these companies are, we could see funds lighten up on them or swap them out when Airbnb hits the market.Unlike Airbnb, Lyft, Uber and some of these other well-known IPOs, Palantir has quietly amassed a huge valuation, with some suggesting it could go public at a $41 billion. That's a massive number, even as the need for cyber security continues to grow.Cyber security is oh-so-important thanks to the rising complexity of seemingly every device and consumer product - from TVs to SUVs - and the subsequent increasing need to protect them. There's also corporate technology, personal information, data centers and other areas that are creating high demand for cyber security.But if Palantir demands a $35 billion-plus valuation when it goes public, it will cause fund managers to free up capital from  .How about  (NASDAQ:  ), one of the largest and most well-known cyber security players in town. Already $20 off its high, shares are still up almost 50% from the lows a few months ago.

But what does that mean for investors in  (NYSE:  )?With Levi coming back on the market, what better stock to lighten up on than VF Corp, maker of both Wrangler and Lee jeans. Sales and earnings growth  , at 12% and 19.7%, respectively.However, at 20x this year's earnings and after a 27% rally in the stock over the past few months, it wouldn't be surprising to see this name (or other apparel stocks) come under pressure.This one is a double-hit, with both  and  eyeing an IPO this year. Just last month, DoorDash raised capital at a $6 billion valuation, while Postmates filed for its IPO in February with a $1.85 billion valuation.Assuming we tack on a premium to DoorDash's numbers, we could be talking about $10 billion between these two names. That may spell trouble for  (NASDAQ:  ) which has a $2.9 billion valuation and  (NYSE:  ) with its $7.1 billion market cap.Increased competition squeezes these companies' top line and margins, but the more stock comes to the market could weigh on the prices as well. A portfolio manager will likely only want so much exposure to names like this. So they're unlikely to own both GrubHub and DoorDash, and if they do, they'll have to own the stocks in smaller amounts to limit their risk.These IPOs aren't a guarantee to weigh on GRUB and YELP, but it's certainly possible that they will. And this isn't all doom and gloom, but it's worth being aware of the risk that these stocks could come under pressure if these upcoming IPOs flood the market.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Editor\u2019s note: This story was previously published in January 2019.

Founded in 1974, the company expanded across the country, operating in 41 states by 2001. During the past few years, the company has been plagued by high turnover in its top management and struggled to remain profitable.Still, the company operates 724 stores across the U.S., which by itself should make it one of the hot penny stocks. Moreover, revenue grew by 1.4% in its . Comparable store sales rose by 1.9% in Q2 2019 as well. Investors should also note that the company relocated 58 stores in the last 12 months.However, given that analysts expect net losses for both the current year and the year after, investors should still treat this stock as speculative.Still, a stock price in the $2.25 per share range and a market cap of about $88 million seems low for a company with 724 stores. Traders should also keep in mind that this stock traded at over $22 per share in late 2014. If management can maintain revenue increases and return TUES stock to profitability, those who buy now could enjoy outsized gains from a dramatic comeback.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he March 29 deadline looms.That's the date that the United Kingdom is set to leave the European Union, making Brexit official. However, Prime Minister Theresa May and the British Parliament have yet to secure a departure deal with the EU that sets key regulations around trade and immigration, because lawmakers have repeatedly rejected the agreements that May forged with the EU.If no agreement is approved by the deadline, the U.K. would experience a so-called \"hard Brexit\" putting trade rules in place that predate its involvement in the EU, and the country would lose tariff-free access to trade partners in the European bloc. Numerous companies have warned about the consequences of such a move;  and KFC have said there could be food shortages if the country leaves without a deal.While the consequences of a hard Brexit could affect many businesses across the board and potentially damage the British economy, three companies that are particularly vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit are  (NYSE: F) ,  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , and  (NYSE: KO) . Let's take a closer look at each one.Image source: Getty Images.While rival  sold its European operations in 2017, Ford stuck with the  , where it lost $398 million last year. The company could get hammered by a hard Brexit.Ford is already the U.K's top-selling auto brand, and it hasn't minced words about the Brexit threat, saying in January to Sky News (a  subsidiary) that a no-deal Brexit \"would severely impact Ford's operations in the U.K. and across Europe.\" The company is already cutting jobs in the region, and predicted that a hard Brexit would cost it $800 million in 2019.Not only is the auto industry dependent on complex international supply chains, but the sector is also sensitive to macroeconomic trends, selling both commercial vehicles to businesses, and passenger cars, which are big-ticket items for consumers. Ford said the massive loss would result from trade delays, slower economic growth, tariffs, and a weaker British pound. The carmaker also said the absence of a deal could lead to further job losses, and the possibility of its British plants closing.In February, Ford made contingency plans to move production away from the U.K. \"Such a situation would be catastrophic for the U.K. auto industry and Ford's manufacturing operations in the country,\" the company said. Other automakers with significant exposure to the risks of Brexit, including Jaguar Land Rover and  , have issued similar warnings.Shares of Booking Holdings, the world's largest online travel agency and parent of online travel brands Booking.com, Priceline, and KAYAK, tumbled after its recen  report on worries about a slowdown in its European business. Booking CEO Glenn Fogel warned on his company's  that Brexit \"is obviously creating a tremendous amount of uncertainty,\" adding that consumers were anxious about how travel regulations might be affected by a no-deal Brexit. British travelers could face passport issues, and a currency devaluation could also dissuade them from visiting the Continent. The potential economic headwinds weigh on the entire travel industry, which is sensitive to macroeconomic trends.Though Fogel pointed to other issues dampening travel spending, such as the yellow-vest protests in France and a slowing economy in Germany, other travel companies have also acknowledged the consequences of Brexit. In November, airlines Virgin Atlantic and Jet2 said Britons were more reluctant to spend on travel, in part due to the weaker British pound.Meanwhile, Booking Holdings' outlook calls for significantly slower growth: It expects an increase in room bookings of just 5% to 7% in constant currency for the first quarter, down from 13% a year ago.While Coca-Cola is a global beverage company, and sales in the U.K. are a relatively small percentage of its total sales, the company is exposed to Brexit in a number of ways.Back in 2017, the beverage giant warned that Brexit could put 1,750 Irish jobs at risk if border tariffs were enforced, showing that the company has been preparing for the divorce since voters in the U.K. approved the split. More recently, Coca-Cola's independent bottler Coca-Cola European Partners has started stockpiling ingredients ahead of a potential hard Brexit, on concerns that it could experience tariffs or delays on new shipments.Beyond the concerns that any beverage seller would have of ensuring that enough fast-turning product remained available, Coca-Cola also faces Brexit risks from its  last year for $5.1 billion. Costa is the biggest coffee chain in the U.K., with more than 2,000 locations, and could be particularly vulnerable if a hard Brexit delayed inventory arrivals. Costa Coffee's former owner, Whitbread PLC, warned multiple times about possible effects of Brexit, including potential labor shortages and general economic malaise. With Coke's takeover, however, those problems now sit solely in the beverage giant's hands, and could foil its expensive bid to break into the coffee business.While plenty of global companies are grappling with uncertainty about what could come from a hard Brexit, it's still possible that the U.K. could reach an agreement with the EU before the deadline.Parliament is set to vote again next week on the deal Prime Minister May negotiated with the EU. It's the same deal that lawmakers historically voted down in January, but the EU has said it will not renegotiate the agreement. That vote and subsequent ones will determine whether the U.K. can find a way to reach an agreement on the details of its departure, take the hard-Brexit route, or extend the deadline.As lawmakers search for options, the British economy hangs in the balance.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Joining me this week: senior analysts Jason Moser and Andy cross. Thanks for being here, guys! We're coming to you from Austin, Texas. We're here for an investing conference. We are not in the studio. We're on the outskirts of a bar here at the hotel. And we actually have a live audience in front of us.[applause]Check it out! The dozens of listeners, joining us! We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street. We've got a very special interview with the late, great Herb Kelleher that we're going to bring to you. And, as always, we'll give an inside look at the stocks on our radar.But since the theme of this conference is global investing, let's start with a couple of international brands. Fourth quarter results from MercadoLibre sent the stock up 20%. A dominant e-commerce player in Latin America. MercadoLibre shares hitting a new all-time high this week, Jason. This was really a strong quarter by virtually every metric. They basically at this point own the Latin American e-commerce market. We've talked about this in the lobby here after some of our conversations today, it's hard to figure how Amazon could come in here one day and take share from MercadoLibre at this point. Not only have they developed this robust e-commerce platform, but really the Mercado Pago part of the business, their payments part of the business, has grown to be something that's just astounding. We talk about war on cash investments, MercadoLibre is certainly worth putting at the top of the list there. Total payment volume through that platform surpassed $5 billion for the first time ever. This is not just an e-commerce play, this is a payments play. Again, I don't know how a competitor comes in there and takes share from them at this point. When you look at getting some global exposure to e-commerce, to tech, to fintech, all that stuff, MercadoLibre seems like a no-brainer. And as tough as the Latin American market has had it, and the economies down there continue to struggle and have a tough go at it, it's nice to see MercadoLibre have some actual momentum behind it now. The other part to this puzzle that I think is going to play out in their favor over many years to come, it's the emergence of the middle class in Latin America in general. That's a middle class that is continuing to grow. More consumers having more purchasing power. That will definitely play into MercadoLibre's financials as well. You really think Amazon is unable to disrupt this business? I have a hard time believing they could go in there and take away share at this point. You have a point where businesses get in and establish a position. It's not only the e-commerce platform, but it's that payments part. That's a really sticky aspect of any business. It's just going to be difficult for any company to get in there and really take share. I'm kind of disappointed that Amazon didn't go in there and try to acquire them at some point earlier in the game. But if they want to do that now, they're going to have to pay up for it. (NASDAQ: BKNG) is the parent company of Priceline and booking.com. Shares falling 11% on Thursday after fourth quarter results came in with lowered guidance for 2019. Help me out here, Andy. Isn't Booking Holdings typically pretty conservative with their guidance? Yeah, they are, Chris. It was actually a pretty good quarter. Revenue was up 16%. Maybe a little bit light. It was up 21% in constant currency, when you put into effect the stronger dollar. Earnings per share blew away the estimates at $22.49. That was up 33%. Free cash flow was up 12%. Overall, I think it was a pretty good quarter. Travel bookings were up 9%, that was maybe a little bit lighter, too.The concern that I think investors saw, and we saw it in the stock price, some of the guidance was a little bit lower. Earnings at $10.90 to $11.20, a little bit below estimates. There's a lot of foreign currency exposure with Booking. 80% of its sales are done internationally. The strong dollar, not helping. That's starting to have a little bit of impact. Hotel room nights booked estimate for the quarter up to 6% to 8% and total gross bookings 5% to 7%. A little bit of deceleration. Some of the growth has some investors concerned. One of the things we've talked about recently on the show is share buybacks. One thing that caught my eye in this report is, you look at 2018, Booking Holdings spent about $6 billion on share buybacks. That's much more than they've done in years past. This is a management team that has done a great job of growing the business. Is it safe to assume we trust them with that type of capital allocation? Because I'm a little surprised they went that high. I think so. The amount of cash they generate, the consistency in the earnings they have, some of the new initiatives they're making, I think warrants giving them the benefit of the doubt to be able to invest that capital for shareholders. I know Jason and I and you have talked a lot about the concerns about some share buybacks. But for this business, considering how they can invest it and where they continue to invest it into their marketing spend and get more efficient with that, looking at the cash, they can generate warrants to be able to buy back the stock at pretty good prices. Yeah, and we've put those share buybacks under a microscope with a lot of companies. I think it was last week we were giving  a little bit of a hard time because what they were doing seemed borderline criminal at one point. At least with booking.com, you look at that share count over time, it is coming down. It'd be one thing if that share count was going up. That was something we were holding against stamps.com last week. At least with booking.com, that share count is coming down. That's the idea with share repurchases -- make those fewer shares more valuable over time. One interesting point they introduced this quarter was that the bookings through their alternative properties -- these are things that compete with Airbnb -- 40% of active booking.com customers have booked an alternative property in 2018. You're booking hotels through booking.com, and you actually are also booking an alternative property like a home rental through booking.com. Etsy's fourth quarter profit and revenue came in higher than expected. Shares up 20% this week. I get it, Jason. Everything was up for Etsy. Users were up, sellers were up. It's the kind of week that makes you want to say hey, now! We talked a lot about Etsy today in our eight-minute conversations around the tables here with all of our members. It was some really great conversation there.When you look at what this business has done, this was another great quarter. The metrics that matter are all headed in the right direction. Active sellers are up. Buyers are up. The gross merchandise sales grew over 22% to $1.2 billion. They threw out a pretty interesting statistic there, too -- there was $19,000 in gross merchandise sales per minute on Cyber Monday. So clearly, they're doing something right.I think a lot of it really is, they've established themselves as that brand for that community, that niche in crafts and art and whatnot, this really is the place to go. We talk a lot about with  the repeat purchase metric. It looks like Etsy is doing the same thing. They talk about habitual buyers, buyers who spend $200 or more over the course of a year and have made purchases on six or more days in the last 12 months. That's their most important buyer metric, and it's up 21.7% for the quarter. That is a very profitable part of the business. Again, worth noting it is profitable. They're bringing in a lot of money. I held Josh Silverman, the CEO of the year for me in our review show, if you remember, at the end of 2018. It looks like he's just keeping it going into 2019. Who is the  to their  ? There are a lot of places to buy stuff online. But in terms of the niche that Etsy has carved out, I can't name who it is. I think Amazon tried to go in there and give them a run for their money at one point. It didn't gain any traction. An interesting topic that came up in some of our conversations today, it was about folks who maybe are selling on Etsy and perhaps get a little bit too big for that platform, and they're moving over onto  's platform, another company we love here The Fool. I think Shopify is a business out there that can certainly give them a run for their money. They do similar things. But there's definitely a brand equity there with Etsy that certainly gives them a little bit of a leg up. Square continues to do its part in the war on cash. Square's holiday quarter results look good. Andy, Thursday was one of those weird days that makes me glad I'm not a day trader. The stock was down pretty big pre-market because of the guidance, and by the end of the day, Square was back up in positive territory. Square is one of those businesses that continues to deliver. Their gross payment volume was up $23 billion, up 28%. Adjusted revenue at $464 million, up 64%. That's a slight deceleration from last quarter, but still pretty exceptional for the size of that business. Adjusted EBITDA, the operating profits, up almost a double to $81 million. Earnings per share up 75%. Jack Dorsey owns 14.5% of the stock. Talking about building out the Square ecosystem, which is not just the payment readers but their Cash app and their Square card, which is partnered with  . 25% of U.S. households are now underbanked or not banked, so the Square card and these different solutions that Square continues to build are good for shareholders, good for clients. You've seen that with the performance that they continue to deliver. I'm really glad you mentioned that word, underbanked. That's the most important word when it comes to companies like Square and  . It's easy for folks who have a banking relationship, they're just used to that. There is a big part of the population out there that is underbanked or unbanked at all. Square and PayPal are developing solutions for those folks, and that's a big market opportunity that's out there. Why do you think we saw what we saw with the stock? Jack Dorsey is a CEO with a lot of experience. Square is not the new kid on the block anymore. Part of me wonders if there's just, on some level in at least some parts of Wall Street, a fundamental misunderstanding of what this business is. I think there's a lot to digest with their earnings reports. Seeing where they're going into the Square Capital side of the business and more business lending, that definitely introduces some uncertainty, some risk that maybe you wouldn't have seen before. Again, it's really difficult to account for the day-to-day machinations of the market. To your point, that's why we don't day trade. Yeah. A new CFO on board. But the full-year sales guidance up 40%. A deceleration from the other growth, so maybe the headline numbers not looking so good. But the more you hear from Jack Dorsey, you continue to believe in the Square story. Teladoc ended the fiscal year not with a bang, but a whimper. Fourth quarter results looked pretty good, but guidance was weaker than Wall Street was hoping for. Teladoc selling off on Thursday. Jason, you look at the stock, and the last time Teladoc was at this level... three weeks ago. I was going to say, it's plummeted the levels not seen since the beginning of the month! [laughs] Listen, if you're a Teladoc investor -- and I am, and I hope a lot of you out there are too -- I think you should be very happy with the way this business is progressing. This was a strong quarter and it was a strong year by virtually -- see what I did there? Virtually? Virtually every metric. Actually they exceeded guidance in a lot of cases, on sales and visits. I think the market reaction initially was to just a smidge light on revenue guidance for 2019. I've told you how I feel about that expectations game, Chris, I really don't care about it. And it was really a wild ride this stock took, because right after that release came out, the stock sold off close to 20% in after-hours, finished down about 6.5% for the day, I think people came to their senses.Listen, this is a business that is doing all the right things. Total revenue grew 59% for the quarter. Organic revenue was up 33%. We know there have been some acquisitions to grow their offering to become more of a comprehensive offering. They're actually working on access to a cross-border solution so that it will be a United States and Canada healthcare platform. That's something that really doesn't exist today in the telemedicine sector. And then, we can't forget about the Medicare Advantage 2020 plan. There's going to be 20 million or so additional patients that will open up to telemedicine services via Medicare Advantage. That's going to grow the potential opportunity for them to bring more members into their model and also even fee-only customers as well. We've seen buy-in from the regulatory side. Telemedicine is real, it's happening, and I think that Teladoc is one of the companies that's leading the way. I was going to say, if they can open up to other countries, the upside is nearly limitless. It's a big world out there. Access to healthcare is something that people need. Certainly, the internet has disrupted virtually everything else in our lives. Having used Teladoc's services before, it's a great first step in initiating a doctor's visit. If you don't have to go to the office, it's really nice not to go if you can get everything taken care of with a little video chat on your phone. Our email address is  . You can also follow the show on  , hit us up with a question. We actually got a question on Twitter about JAB Holdings, which is the private company that has just been gobbling up all manner of restaurants and coffee chains over the last few years, including Peet's Coffee, asking, \"Hey, if JAB Holdings is considering spinning off the coffee properties into an IPO,\" and reportedly they are, \"is that something you'd be interested in?\"I'd certainly be interested, Andy, at looking at the S-1. Yeah, definitely. This is a very large, I think it's the second-largest coffee roaster in the world behind  , retailer at least. They have about 12% of the market according to The Economist. Some very big brands.  , which might be part of this. We don't know if Panera will be part of this or not. JAB is a very well-run private equity firm. As you mentioned, they've been gobbling up lots of different properties. We'll be very interested to look at the S-1 and think about this as a company that we want to invest in. Yeah, no question. Coffee is good business. If you have a company that has a portfolio of coffee offerings, I can't see why we wouldn't want at least dig in a little bit further. As we've seen with others, JAB has the packaged goods and they've got the retail locations. Yeah. The whole thing with that Keurig acquisition bringing a lot of great coffee into the home in a simple fashion. You're going to find a lot of those Keurigs out there installed all over the world. It translates maybe a little bit better than that SodaStream because you don't have to worry about replacing cartridges. They have plenty of opportunity out there. I will say, I'm a very loyal Nespresso user, though. They're competing against Nespresso. You know, Uncle Joe says a lot of good things about that Nespresso as well. He's halfway around the world, and still. On last week's show, we talked about  , the parent company of Samuel Adams. They've been crushing it lately in part because of limited-edition brews the company has been producing. Maybe we can blame Boston Beer for this next story. This weekend, Smartmouth Beer, a brewery based in Virginia, is unveiling Saturday Morning Marshmallow IPA, a beer that tastes like Lucky Charms breakfast cereal. The company says the beer is \"made with pounds of marshmallows, some of which we toasted, along with tropical fruity Calypso hops. The result is magically delicious.\" Not in 100 years! Too fruity for me, man! Come on, let's take one for the team here! This is that boots-on-the-ground market research that we're known for, the selfless act of getting out there for all of our subscribers, our members, and really giving them that firsthand account of how that might be. Listen, it's beer, it's cereal. What's wrong with putting them together? When we get back to Virginia, you let me know how that goes. Let me tell you something really quick here. Folks here will appreciate this. My wife put together a six pack for me the other day from the store, and included in there one bottle of Shiner S'mores beer. I don't know if anyone out here has ever heard of that, but this was the first time I tried it. And I have to say, it was actually pretty good. That toasty sort of marshmallow flavor, I felt like I was around a campfire, Chris. Let's get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man Dan Boyd is not behind the glass. He's here at the table with us, and he couldn't be more excited because he's got a brand-new soundboard, complete with sound effects. That's right, Chris! I do. I've been told I can only use one, so I'm going to use it judiciously. Jason Moser, you're up first. What stock is on your radar this week? I tell you, everyone out there today, you inspired me to go with this selection here.  , ticker BJ. They have earnings coming out next Wednesday. We had a lot of great conversations today about the power of membership models. Amazon and  took most of those conversations. BJ's went public again recently. It's an East Coast concept mostly, but still a relatively small one. I've been to a BJ's before back when we lived in Georgia. I think this could be something we need to take a closer look at. Dan? Jason, do you think the guy with the jackhammer across the street while we were recording was having any fun? It sounded like he was having a lot of fun. Thank you, Jason! Andy, really quick, what are you looking at? Austin's own  reports fourth quarters on March 7th. The stock has really been a bad-tasting enchilada over the past year, so I'm looking for some growth. Margins under pressure from the cost side with labor costs increasing and comp sales of 0% to 1%. Looking for some love for Chuy's next week, Dan.[wild applause sound] I love it! I love it, Andy! Guys, thanks for being here! Thank you! Thanks, Chris![...] Earlier this year, Herb Kelleher, the legendary co-founder of Southwest Airlines, died at the age of 87. He defied the odds by creating an airline that produced market-crushing returns for investors. In 2017, Motley Fool co-founder Tom Gardner sat down with Kelleher to talk about his company's unique culture, the business of airlines, and a lot more. Tom started by asking Kelleher how it all started.__ Herb, what happened on March 12th of 1931? It was a boom day for the entire globe, Tom, if I do say so myself because a highly intelligent, really visionary, and very handsome baby was born and named Herb. Who is Harry Kelleher? My father. And what was his work and life? He was the plant superintendent for the  in Camden, New Jersey. Then he became the general manager of the Campbell Soup Company. They had only one plant at that time. That was his occupation up until his death. And who was Ruth Moore? My mother. And what can you tell us about Ruth? Well, she was working at the Campbell Soup Company, which was where she met my father. After our family was blown apart at the beginning of World War II, Tom -- one of my brothers was killed early in 1942, and another one off in the service, and my father died in early 1943, and my other sister became an expediter for RCA, was involved in war work -- and suddenly my mother and I were there alone from six to two within a year-and-a-half or two years. She was just fabulous because she covered everything with me. Ethics, the way you should treat people, business. We used to sit up even when I was 10 and 12 and talk until 03:00 or 04:00 in the morning. She was absolutely fantastic in that respect because she was not only a nurturing mother, but she also fed my mind. The early stages of the definition of Southwest's strategy, I do wonder when you talk about your mother and what she taught you around the dinner table or into the wee hours of the morning, about respecting other people, and even the energy or the dynamic of, flying shouldn't just be for people who are wealthy. It should be available to everyone. The egalitarian nature. Yeah, she was very egalitarian in that respect. She was a great teacher because she told me that I should not necessarily pay obeisance to position or title. She said, \"Pay attention to the individual. The individual may have a grand position or title but have feet of clay,\" which I think all of us have to agree can be the case. And she also encouraged me to read very widely, and unusually adult books for someone my age. She stimulated by curiosity in a whole lot of things that I probably never would have gotten into. Curiosity, I think, is one of the great things that can be very, very helpful to you because you're always looking for something different and how it might fit in to what you're doing. I've never adhered to the philosophy that curiosity killed the cat. I look at it as, curiosity informed the cat. [laughs] She played a big role in that respect, and also the political aspects of it. Very helpful, having that experience, fighting these battles in the Congress and in the Texas Legislature. Why do so many airlines go bankrupt. And why has Southwest Airlines never laid off a single employee? They're so extremely at polar opposites. The industry, we know, has created very little economic value in aggregate going back to its inception. That's very true. And Southwest Airlines has been -- well, certainly during your time, it was the best-performing stock on the S&P 500, and since then, it's been a wonderful stock as well, all the way through. No layoffs. Why? For a person that's sitting out there saying, \"I have no idea why this airline is successful and all the other ones continually failed, went through bankruptcy, came back, went bankrupt again, etc.\"? [laughs] Some of them three times. Yeah. Well, first of all -- I think this has something to do with history and learning something about history -- I was well aware that the airline industry was a very difficult industry. As you pointed out, at one point, it had a net loss from its inception, which means it's fairly difficult, fairly scary. And I said, you hear about regression to the mean, and I'm not quarreling with that as a formula, but how long is it going to take to regress? Is it five years? 25 years? 38 years? What we're going to do is, we are always going to be very, very strong from the balance sheet standpoint, No. 1. One time, for a long time, we were the only airline that had an investment-grade rating from the financial community. We're going to have lots of liquidity. My mantra was, \"We want to manage in good times so that we do well in bad times.\" There you get into the no-furlough policy, because if you just hire a bunch of people willy nilly during good times, guess what you're doing? You're firing them during bad times. So, we were always well set up to ride through the bad times, and market share was not our focus. Size in and of itself is unimportant. I would rather have 4% of the market and be profitable than have 24% of the market and lose money. So, we're not going to talk about market share, at all. It was verboten. I don't know, if you've read Peter Thiel's books  or know about Peter Thiel. I do know about him. He said, basically, from a from an investor standpoint, when people pitch companies to him, when they talk about how large their market is, he said, \"I want to know the smallest piece that you're going to dominate. And I know off of that if you'll have the opportunity to grow.\" Exactly. So, the other airlines weren't doing that. They were trying to get as many -- They were at war with each other, who had the most airplanes and who'd get the most routes from the CAB and that sort of thing. We eschewed all that. We opened a lot of secondary airports, satellite airports. People initially said, \"Oh, you'll never make a success out of a satellite airport.\" Well, there's Hobby, there's Love. I can run through about five or six more of them. And of course, they were much more efficient to operate from. No backups. They were a lot closer and more convenient for an awful lot of people. We did things unconventionally that way. We tried to keep our work rules very simple to promote the efficiency of the airline, and kind of operated on the philosophy that airplanes don't make money on the ground, they only make money in the air. Passengers don't pay just to sit in them, they pay to fly. So very high utilization, productivity. What would be a gap in fare between you and a competitor at any point in history? You could name one today, or go back 25 years and say, \"We flew from point A to point B for X and they did it for 2X,\" or whatever the gap was. Some of those contrasts are really amazing. Do you have time for one that's kind of -- Please! It's kind of like a burlesque. [laughs] Plenty of time! We went into BWI. U.S. Air was the leading carrier there. The roundtrip fare to Cleveland from BWI was... I don't know, $340 or something like that. We reduced it to $56. That's a considerable drop. U.S. Air found out we had a \"Friends Fly Free\" program. It was $24.50. They matched that, on a \"Friends Fly Free\" basis. So we went to $19 between BWI and Cleveland. [laughs]So that's a pretty big saving, $19 instead of $349. The traffic increased by 1,500% in the first year of service. [laughs] That's an exaggeration, but most markets we went into increased -- Popularity of flight. -- enormously. I'm talking 100%, 200%, 300%, within a year. Presumably, some of the ways that you hold those costs down for passengers is efficiency, hard work of everyone who's coming to work. Exactly. Probably not the highest salaries in the industry? I don't know whether that's true or not, you can tell me. How can you have cost containment and balance sheet management and a great corporate culture? Those things, we think there's a big tension there. Why isn't there at Southwest? You know what? A friend of mine recently wrote a paper that he sent to me and in it he said, \"Corporations are always succumbing to the tyranny of no rather than the genius of yes.\" What he was pointing out is that people sit down and say, \"Well, we can either have low costs and lousy customer service\" -- Everything's a compromise. -- \"or great customer service and high costs.\" And we said, \"No. You can have low costs and great customer service. And guess what? We're not offering you less for less fare, we're offering you more for less fare\". Part of that, of course, was our culture. First of all, the warrior spirit of our employees, who pitched in in every battle. Secondly, the fun and warmth and hospitality that our people provided to our passengers. And thirdly, the kind of culture that was upbeat. We didn't ask people to change and become robots or automatons when they came to work. We kept telling them, \"Look, we hired you because you're you.\" Did anyone take that too far? [laughs] Yeah. [laughs] \"I'm me, Herb! I'm not going to wear clothes to work today!\" You put your finger on it, per usual. When we had somebody who did something extraordinary, we didn't put in new rules pertaining to the whole company or one of its departments. We just sat down with them individually and talked to them and said, \"You cannot do that.\" But you know, if every time there's a sort of anecdotal incident -- A new policy comes of it. -- you put in a new policy, you're gradually strangling yourself with bureaucracy. As a matter of fact, when I saw a ticket agent in San Antonio, after I became CEO, trying to answer a customer's question by going through these two loose leaf manuals, you know, looking for page 73, capital A, [laughs] small i, you know? We'd burn them. We'd burn them. And what we said was we have a substitute, it's called  . The first sentence was, \"These are just guidelines. Feel free to break them.\" We were unleashing our people to be themselves with the customer. Colleen Barrett, of course, played a great role in that. She called it her Flexibility Policy. Basically she was saying, \"Look, we work like crazy to hire the right people with the right attitudes. Positive, generous, caring. So just unleash them.\" If you had, let's say, two or three leadership principles, if you had to boil them down to two or three -- maybe you just touched on one of them -- I hate to just try and get a little soundbite, but what would be your top two or three principles as a leader? I would say that, No. 1, you have to look out for the wellbeing of others more than you do for your own. No. 2, that you have to really rejoice in your people and their accomplishments, and praise them and recognize them all the time for what they have achieved. Be humble, I think. Be humble, never think you've done something so great that now you're at the top of the pyramid, because that's when the pyramid starts to collapse and you slide down on your face. [laughs] Never be complacent. How about two or three principles of business strategy that might apply more broadly than just the airline industry? For an entrepreneur or a CEO that's looking at their game plan and maybe has overlooked the responsibility of having a strong balance sheet so that you can be resilient in a down period. So, maybe two or three strategic principles? Well, first of all, if one of your principles is that you're not going to furlough, that in and of itself is an incentive to stay lean, even when times are really good. It's a discipline, and a valuable one, I think. No. 2, particularly with respect to young entrepreneurs, including myself, they're optimists, Tom, and that optimism is needed to be an entrepreneur. You're one, I ought to be interviewing you. But sometimes, you don't realize how long it's going to take and how much capital it's going to take to bring it to realization, so you don't raise enough money at the beginning. And sometimes, representing young people who want to start up their own businesses, I've found that they think that just having the idea is all they have to do. And I keep telling them, \"No, there's a lot of sweat that goes into it. [laughs] You don't just announce your idea, and suddenly golden coins start raining down from heaven like manna on you. There's a hell of a lot of lonely work to do to make it come to pass and to be successful.\"The thing that I have always emphasized is culture. I think that is the most powerful competitive weapon that you can have because it's intangible, it's spiritual. You can't buy it. Other airlines can buy airplanes, they can lease space, but if they don't have the kind of outgoing, participative, happy, devoted culture that you have, you're going to have the edge on them. I always told our people that the intangibles are more important than the tangibles. Is there a single story that comes to you right now -- maybe not across all Southwest's history -- about the employee or teammate of yours at Southwest Airlines that did something remarkable for somebody else on their team, or for one of the passengers? I'll tell you what, I've got several stories that just jumped into my mind. There are thousands of them, but these will serve as exemplars with respect to what you asked. One of them is that a lady had a flat tire in the parking lot at an air terminal, and our station manager stops and says, \"Let me change that tire for you.\" And she said, \"Well, I don't think you should because I didn't fly on Southwest Airlines.\" He said, \"That doesn't make any difference. I just want to help you change your tire, no matter who you flew on.\" [laughs]And we honor people for the great things they do outside Southwest Airlines, not just inside, the great things they do in society in general. Last question. You talked about being a founder and the number of hours of sleep you got on average, the decades that you put into it. I know that you probably don't really have any regrets, but why don't you? You've given so much of your life to one organization. Do you have any sense of, \"Gosh, I wonder if I had taken five years and gone and done that, my life might have had this?\" How do you view your commitment to a single ship that you've been sailing on for 50 years? I have no regrets whatsoever, because if a father has a daughter or a son, I believe that father has got to commit himself to a single ship for as long as that ship is afloat. I've always said I'm so fortunate because my advocation is simultaneously my vocation, so there's no challenge, there's no tension, there's no hostility between the two. I'm doing what I love to do for a company I love and helped to create, and for people that I adore. What could be more rewarding, more enjoyable, than that? I've referred to our people as my fountain of youth. I've said Ponce Deleon was in the wrong place looking for the fountain of youth in Florida. He should have come to work for Southwest Airlines.

Salesforce's Q4 results benefited from strong growth across most of its business segments and deal wins in the international market.The Zacks analyst thinks the rapid adoption of its diverse cloud offerings given the growing demand for digital transformation remains the key catalyst. Strengthening relationships with cloud companies like Amazon, Google and IBM are a positive. Additionally, strategic acquisitions like MuleSoft, Datorama and Cloudcraze is helping it deliver strong growth. The company is now aiming to achieve revenues of $26-$28 billion by fiscal 2023.Nevertheless, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern. Currency fluctuations remain a key headwind. Besides, increasing investments for international expansions and data centers is an overhang on near-term profitability.(You can  ).Shares of  have declined -8.2% over the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Internet Commerce industry, which has lost -13.3% over the same period. Booking Holdings reported strong fourth quarter results wherein both earnings and revenues have grown year over year on the back of improving gross bookings.Moreover, solid growth in the booked room nights and strong momentum across global accommodation space contributed well to the gross bookings growth. Further, robust agency model continued to aid the company's position in the international markets. Also, strong efforts toward ramping up of merchant business were positives.The Zacks analyst thinks secular growth trend in the online travel booking market and growing mobile usage penetration are tailwinds. Moreover, the company's strong position in international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market and good execution of marketing strategies are major positives. However, sluggishness in the rental car days poses risk. Also, macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs.(You can  ). 's shares have gained +39% over the past one year, outperforming the Zacks Software industry which is up +15.9% over the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks VMware is benefiting from robust performance of NSX, VeloCloud and vSAN product lines.The company has been consistently taking initiatives to diversify its product portfolio to include most of the IT infrastructure. VMware's dominance in software-defined data center (SDDC) along with expanding customer base in cloud driven by partnerships with the likes of IBM and AWS is positive. The company has significant growth opportunities from rapid deployment of 5G.Moreover, continuing enterprise deal wins will drive growth in the long haul. Nevertheless, VMware's margins are expected to remain under pressure due to heavy spending.

Investing in any up-and-coming industry is a speculative practice. That is, it's highly risky and you shouldn't invest any money that you aren't prepared to lose -- even if you think a particular company looks like a potential gold mine.I don't want to discuss any individual companies, but it would be smart to approach  in a similar manner as tech stocks in the late 1990s.  will probably do wonderfully. People who invested in  or Priceline (now  ) during the dot-com boom and held on to their shares have made fortunes. People who invested in companies like Pets.com -- not so much.With that in mind, I'd advise you to do two things if you want to add some marijuana stocks to your portfolio.First, only use a small portion of your investable assets. If you put, say, 5% of your portfolio in marijuana stocks, that's all you can lose if things go badly. And if one of them turns out to be the Amazon of the marijuana industry, it'll still be enough to produce a significant win.Second, don't put all of your eggs in one basket. Whatever money you decide to invest in the marijuana industry, spread it among at least three or four reputable companies -- not  .If you do those two things, you'll set yourself up to profit if you're right, but at the same time, you won't be devastated if things go badly.

For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $57.72 per unit.With QQXT trading at a recent price near $52.39 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.16% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQXT's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Booking Holdings Inc (Symbol: BKNG), Gilead Sciences Inc (Symbol: GILD), and Celgene Corp (Symbol: CELG). Although BKNG has traded at a recent price of $1714.08/share, the average analyst target is 28.84% higher at $2208.50/share. Similarly, GILD has 26.24% upside from the recent share price of $66.01 if the average analyst target price of $83.33/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CELG to reach a target price of $98.60/share, which is 14.70% above the recent price of $85.96.

The figure also surged 16% from the prior-year quarter but decreased 33.7% sequentially.The strong performance of agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses of the company drove year-over-year top-line growth. Additionally, accelerating room nights number, which drove the company's gross booking, aided the results.Although the company witnessed sluggish performance of rental car days, its airline tickets unit reflected year-over-year improvement. This benefited the reported quarter.However, we note that the stock has plunged 9.1% in the after-hours trade on Feb 27. This can be attributed to weaker-than-expected first-quarter 2019 earnings outlook.Nevertheless, secular growth trend in the online travel booking market and growing usage of mobile by the travelers for their travel planning are tailwinds.Moreover, the company's strong position in the international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, solid momentum across the global accommodation space and proper execution of its marketing strategies will continue to drive business growth in the near term as well as in the long haul.Increasing investments in an attempt to strengthen its alternative accommodation business, payment platform, and branding and customer acquisition program are likely to benefit the company further.Booking Holdings generates bulk of its revenues from the international markets, wherein the agency model is more popular.

These are basically non-inter company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable.Further, Booking Holdings witnessed solid momentum in room nights bookings. During the fourth quarter, the total room nights booked was 171 million, exhibiting year-over-year growth of 13%. This can be attributed to strong performance of the company's direct channel, mobile platform and alternative accommodation business.Booking Holdings' overall bookings came in $19.6 billion were up 8.7% (13% in constant currency) from the year-ago quarter. This year-over-year growth came within management's guided range.Merchant bookings were up 45.8% from the prior-year quarter and agency bookings increased 1.4% from the year-ago level.Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $1.26 billion, up 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.Per the company, operating income was $1.14 billion, up 15.9% year over year. Moreover, operating margin of 35.6% expanded 40 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.As of Dec 31, 2018, cash and short-term investments balance was $6.3 billion compared with $7.1 billion as of Sep 30, 2018.At the end of the fourth quarter, Booking Holdings had $8.6 billion of long-term debt.During the fourth quarter, the company generated $1.08 billion of cash from operations compared with $2 billion in the third quarter.Further, the company generated free cash flow of $997 million during the reported quarter.For the first quarter of 2019, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 6-8%.

(NASDAQ: BKNG) in particular has a reputation for issuing guidance that's a bit on the conservative side, initially scaring its shareholders but also setting a low bar for the online travel giant to try to overcome with its  .Coming into Wednesday's fourth-quarter financial report, Booking Holdings investors wanted to see solid growth in revenue and profit, and that's what they got. However, the company also gave guidance for the first quarter of 2019 that was weaker than most had expected, and that played a vital role in sending some shareholders into a panic. Let's look more closely at the numbers and how the  to see whether the market is overreacting to the online travel specialist's report.Image source: Booking Holdings.Booking's headline fourth-quarter results were generally good. Revenue came in at $3.21 billion, growing 15% from year-earlier levels and almost exactly matching the consensus among those following the stock. Adjusted net income climbed at a healthier 25% rate to $1.05 billion, and that worked out to adjusted earnings of $22.49 per share, crushing the typical investor's forecast for $19.42 per share as well as its own guidance from the previous quarter.Fundamentally, Booking Holdings' numbers looked a bit more mixed. Gross travel bookings came in at $19.6 billion, but that was up just 9% from year-earlier levels, showing slowing growth rates from recent quarters. Agency revenue was up 9% as well, with bookings growth of just 1.4%, but merchant revenue outpaced other parts of the business in boosting its top line by 38% on a 46% rise in bookings. Advertising and other revenue sources saw growth of about 14%.Unit metrics were weak in certain areas. Room-night counts were higher by 13% to 171 million, finishing a year in which the year-over-year growth stayed within a 12% to 14% range in all four quarters. That growth rate compared favorably to previous guidance for a 9% to 12% rise in the fourth quarter. However, rental-car days were down 0.6% to about 15 million, and airline ticket sales were also down for the first time in more than a year, falling 1.3% over the past 12 months.Nevertheless, CEO Glenn Fogel focused on full-year accomplishments. \"2018 was a good year for Booking Holdings,\" Fogel said, \"as we met many important financial and strategic goals. The CEO highlighted reaching three-quarters of a billion room-nights and solid growth in financial metrics as key milestones of the online travel giant's success.Booking also stayed optimistic about the coming year. In Fogel's words, \"I am excited about the investments we are making in 2019 as we position the company for long-term growth.\"That optimism made Booking Holdings' guidance look a bit inconsistent. The company believes that hotel room-nights booked will climb just 6% to 8% in the first quarter of 2019, with gross travel bookings seeing extensive currency headwinds that will limi  ed bookings results as well adjusted revenue growth to a range of -1% to +1%. Adjusted net income of $495 million to $510 million would translate to earnings of just $10.90 to $11.20 per share on an adjusted basis, far below the current consensus forecast among investors for $12.78 per share.Booking Holdings shareholders weren't pleased with the report, and the stock fell 9% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Yet the big question is whether in hindsight, the company's  . Time after time, many traders have sold their shares based on warnings like this, only to see the actual results come in better than expected. Moreover, adjusted earnings guidance for the full 2019 year in the low double-digit percentages is entirely consistent with what most investors are looking to see. Even so, signs of slowing growth have appeared in Booking's numbers for some time -- and it's possible that 2019 could be the year in which the impressive growth that the company has managed to post historically will come to an end.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Go ahead, gentlemen. -- Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We had a strong quarter, with 171 million worldwide room nights book, which is up 13% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue increased 16% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 21% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 17% in U.S. dollars and the FX impact was a couple of points higher than it was on revenue. Our non-GAAP EPS was up 33% year-over-year.When I look back at 2018, I am pleased with the financial performance of the company. Our total booked room nights exceeded three quarters of a billion room nights and we produced strong year-over-year growth across our key financial metrics. Revenue was up 17%, adjusted EBITDA was up 18%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 20%. We not only drove solid top line growth, increasing our share on the accommodation market, but also stabilized our operating margins through our performance marketing optimization strategy which we began in the third quarter of 2017.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now. Booking Holdings  -- but there are nine others you may be overlooking.In 2018, we invested in three main areas that we believe can drive the long-term growth of the business and we will continue to develop these in 2019. First, in alternative accommodations, we continue to add to our supply base. And as of December 31st, booking.com had over 5.7 million reported listing. However, we are not just focused on the total number of alternative accommodation listings but are also concentrating on the quality and type of properties joining our platform so we can provide the best choices for our customers and drive search conversion.Booking.com's alternative accommodation business has meaningful size and scale and recorded approximately $2.8 billion in revenue in 2018, representing approximately 20% of our overall revenue for the year. It also reached the important milestone of over $1 billion in revenues in Q3 2018. It is also growing faster than our consolidated growth rate and is nicely profitable.We believe offering real choice, with both alternative accommodations and traditional properties on one platform, is the best customer proposition. We believe a telling data point underscoring the attractiveness of our model is approximately 40% of booking.com's active customers booked an alternative accommodation property at some point during the past 12 months.Second, we invested in 2018 -- and, in 2019, will step up our investment -- in the growth of our business through branding and customer acquisition programs in order to take share in the markets with the highest long-term potential returns. We believe these incremental investments will help drive greater loyalty and higher repeat rates to our direct channel over time.Just two days ago, we launched our new U.S. brand campaign, which we expect will drive further awareness in this important growth market. We will also look to improve brand awareness across our primary markets through increased brand campaigns in both offline and online channels. These marketing programs are taking on a greater importance, as many of our performance marketing partners are experiencing slower customer growth.Third, we will continue to invest in the rollout of booking.com's payment platform. This platform provides payment options favored by customers and property partners, particularly non-hotel property partners, and provides a platform for merchant product offerings. Merchant offerings provide greater merchandising possibilities for booking.com and this year, we plan to step up our investment in this capability to drive growth.This payment platform will also facilitate our transport and local attractions business, where we envision a frictionless customer experience that we believe will drive enhanced loyalty. For example, we look to build upon the integration of rentalcars.com and booking.com to deliver a better ground transport offering for booking.com's customers this year. The number of car rentals and rides booked on the booking.com platform grew rapidly this past year, contributing to our belief that an integrated offering is highly valued by our customers.China and the broader APAC region remains an important geographic focus for us and we invested significantly against this very large opportunity in 2018. As a result of smart growth investments, Agoda produced very solid growth rates in the region despite a very competitive marketplace. We continue to work with our partners, Ctrip and Meituan, and we introduced new strategic and financial relationships with Didi and Grab, all of which we believe will help both booking.com and Agoda build better brand awareness and acquire customers more effectively in this region.Kayak completed a busy year with the integration of Momondo and the acquisition of HotelsCombined in December. Both acquisitions bring greater geographic diversity and product strength to the Kayak platform as it continues to build a global, multi-product, multi-brand travel search platform. We also announced the combined reporting structures of Kayak and OpenTable during 2018 to further drive experimentation and innovation across both platforms. We're already seeing early signs of this with OpenTable recently announcing that its customers can use OpenTable dining points to book discounted hotel stays and I look forward to seeing further innovation from the combined teams.Priceline.com is increasing its momentum and we're starting to see the benefits of our investments on this platform. The redesigned packaged product is growing very rapidly, gaining acceptance in the U.S. market. We're excited about the potential of this product for the entire company.Finally, as you can see from our Q1 guidance, we witnessed a slow start to the year, primarily in our core European markets, which we believe is largely due to overall macroeconomic factors. The initiatives outlined above are aimed at driving the long-term top line growth and share gains and will help support the business if macro conditions soften. We believe these steps strike the right balance between driving growth and operating margins. Furthermore, we believe our financial scale and global diversified platform positions us to perform well through macroeconomic challenges.In conclusion, we had a very good year in 2018 and believe we have a great long-term opportunity ahead of us. We will always manage our business with a long-term view and will continue to invest in growth this year, with the goal of increasing our share across our primary markets.With that, I will now turn it over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the financial review. -- Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will discuss our operating results for the fourth quarter and for 2018 and then provide thoughts on the full-year 2019 as well as our guidance for the first quarter. All growth rates are relative to prior-year comparable period unless otherwise indicated.All year-over-year growth rates referenced in my remarks will compare the current year income statements under the new revenue accounting standard to the prior year under the previous accounting standard. Gross bookings and other metrics, like room reservations, are not impacted by the new revenue accounting standard. Our non-GAAP financial results and forecast include stock-based compensation and information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now, on to our results for the quarter.Our booked room night growth of 13% for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance range. In the quarter, we observed a moderate stepdown in growth rates from October levels. Average daily rates for accommodation, or ADRs, were up about 1% in Q4 relative to the prior year on a constant currency basis versus our forecast for about 2% ADR growth in the quarter.Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q4 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately 4 percentage points versus last year. We estimate the changes in FX rates impacted Q4 gross bookings and revenue growth rates by similar amounts and the Q4 EBITDA growth rate by a couple of points more.Q4 gross bookings grew by 9% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 13% on a constant currency basis, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion and grew by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 21% on a constant currency basis, coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for Kayak and OpenTable, grew by 14% in Q4 compared to the prior year.Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 under the current revenue standard was approximately 5% higher than it would have been i  ed under the previous revenue standard. As a result, our revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and their growth rates versus the prior year were positively impacted in the quarter. In addition, expenses as a percentage of revenue, as well as margins, were impacted from the higher revenue when comparing to the prior-year Q4.So, to help you understand the underlying drivers of leverage and de-leverage in the business in Q4, I'll talk about these on a like-for-like revenue basis to eliminate the impact of the Q4 benefit from the revenue accounting change.Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $1.26 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range and was up 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and up about 4% on a like-for-like basis. As I mentioned previously, our growth rates were negatively impacted from year-on-year changes in FX rates.Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% under the previous revenue accounting standard was above our forecast, largely due to some leverage in performance marketing. We fully lapped our strategy to optimize performance marketing ROIs, which we began in mid-Q3 2017. We remain disciplined in our spending and we were encouraged to see a modest leverage of 20 basis points from our performance marketing in the quarter, which was better than the de-leverage we anticipated. We continue to see these channels as an effective way to acquire customers and will continue to invest rationally to optimize growth.As part of our continued effort to drive more traffic to our websites, we increased our spending on brand marketing in the quarter by 27% versus Q4 last year, which contributed about 50 basis points of de-leverage. Sales and other expense continue to grow faster than revenue, primarily due to the growth of our payment platform at booking.com. Finally, personnel expense came in lower than our forecast and contributed a small amount of leverage in the quarter.Our non-GAAP EPS was $22.49, up 33% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 11.3% in Q4, which decreased from the prior year, primarily due to a tax benefit resulting from the application of regulatory guidance issued in November that clarified a provision of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our full-year non-GAAP tax rate was 18.3%. Our 6% lower share count in Q4 versus last year further benefited EPS growth in the quarter.On a GAAP basis, operating income grew by 16% and GAAP operating margin decreased by 13 basis points compared to Q4 last year. GAAP operating income is negatively impacted by a $21 million pre-tax related to travel transaction tax charges from prior periods that are recorded in the G&A expense line.Q4 GAAP net income amounted to $646 million, or $13.86 per share, up significantly from the $11.41 loss in Q4 2017, which was negatively impacted by last year's $1.3 billion provisional net income tax expense related to the tax act. Our Q4 GAAP net income includes a $474 million pre-tax loss related to unrealized losses on our equity investments in Meituan and Ctrip. Q4 GAAP net income was also negatively impacted by the travel transaction charges that I just mentioned. We excluded the unrealized loss and the travel transaction charges from our non-GAAP results.We had a GAAP tax rate of negative 2% for the quarter, which was primarily driven by the reversal of the tax charges related to a provision of the tax act that I mentioned previously, as well as a separate $48 million tax benefit related to the finalization of the one-time expense we incurred in Q4 2017 due to the tax act.Our cash investments amounted to $14.7 billion at quarter end.For the full year 2018, we generated $5.3 billion of operating cash flow, which increased by 15% compared to prior year. Our free cash flow for the year was $4.9 billion, which increased by 12% compared to the prior year.We returned about $1.8 billion during the fourth quarter to our shareholders through share buybacks. Since the start of 2018, we reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 6% through our $6 billion in repurchases for the full year. As of December 31st, we had approximately $4.5 billion remaining of our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be both programmatic and opportunistic with regard to our repurchases and now we expect to complete this authorization before the end of 2019.Looking back at 2018, we are pleased with our strong performance during the year, as we delivered room night growth of 13%, revenue growth of 17%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 18%, and non-GAAP EPS growth of 20%. We exited the year in a stronger position and achieved many of our objectives. We grew our direct channel, which now represents over 50% of our booked room nights. Our mobile platform is strong, with over half of our room nights booked on a mobile device. And, finally, as Glenn noted, in 2018, approximately 20% of our revenue and a higher percentage of our room nights were generated by our alternative accommodations business. Each of direct, mobile, and alternative is growing faster than our overall growth rate.Now, turning to 2019, I want to start by talking about some factors that will impact the year and then come back to our guidance for Q1. There are four main factors that we believe will impact the shape of 2019. The first is our growth investments. The second is the continued rollout and adoption of our new payments platform at booking.com. The third is the mechanical timing and comparison factors. And the fourth is the macroeconomic environment. Now, let's look at each of these in turn.Starting with our growth investments, as Glenn talked about, in 2019, we're investing for growth, customer acquisition, and loyalty in a number of key areas. These growth investments are a step-up in spend from normal levels. You'll see them impact our financials in brand, in revenue via merchandising as well as customer acquisition and incentive programs, and you'll also see them in personnel to support these initiatives.We expect there will be some in-year revenue return but, after taking this into account, these growth investments will reduce our EBITDA growth rate by a few percentage points in 2019. These investments started at the beginning of this year. The expected returns are higher in the second half of the year, so there will be a greater negative impact on EBITDA growth during the first half. This means that our consolidated EBITDA growth will be higher in the second half.Now, moving to payments at booking.com. In 2018, approximately 10% of the gross bookings at booking.com was processed via our payments platform and we expect this to continue to increase. In 2018, payments put pressure on EBITDA in the form of higher sales and other expenses that were not fully offset by associated revenue. This reduced our consolidated EBITDA growth rate in 2018 by a little over 1%. Going forward, we do not expect any additional reduction in EBITDA growth from payments and will continue to see increases in revenue. This will pressure margin rates modestly. We also see the opportunity for payments to drive EBITDA growth in the future.Of course, payment provides important advantages in many areas, including merchandising flexibility, a better customer and partner experience, reduced customer service expenses, and the ability to coordinate and manage integrated trips.The third set of factors are more mechanical but important as you think about the year. FX is expected to be quite significant this year. Using current FX rates assumed in our guidance, gross booking growth and revenue growth through to non-GAAP EPS growth will be reduced by approximately 250 basis points for the full year and 500 basis points for the first half of the year.Additionally, the timing of Easter will impact revenue growth in Q1 and Q2. Last year, Easter was on April 1st and, therefore, the majority of Easter revenue was recorded in the first quarter. This year, with Easter on April 21st, Easter travel revenue will be recorded in Q2. Compared with Easter falling on the same day as last year, we estimate that about $65 million of revenue will move into Q2. We estimate this shift in timing will reduce Q1 2019 revenue growth rates by approximately 200 basis points and increase Q2 2019 revenue growth rates by approximately 200 basis points.The fourth factor is the external macro environments. We continue to expect travel to grow faster than GDP on a global, as well as on region by region, basis. Of course, this means that the growth of travel on a regional basis will be impacted by regional GDP and sentiment. Consistent with recent economic indicators, we saw a slow start to the year in Europe and this is impacting our room night growth guidance for Q1.To provide a little bit more insight, January room night growth in Europe was a step down from December and February is looking stronger than January but still below December. We expect to continue to gain share in accommodations in Europe, especially with our investments. Room night growth rates in the other parts of the world are more in line with what we saw in December.We think that walking you through these factors will be helpful as we describe and you build your models for the year. We also think that sharing some expectations for the full year, taking these factors into account will be helpful as well.For 2019, we expect to gain share in accommodations in each major geographic region and we're confident that the strength of our business, reinforced by the growth investments we are making this year, will enable us to achieve this. We'll manage the gap between growth and profitability with an expectation that non-GAAP EPS, on a constant currency basis, will grow in the low double digits in 2019 after factoring in the impact from the growth investments I previously mentioned. If economic conditions were to further soften, we'll still preference growth over realizing short-term margin because we believe this is the best for our business in the long term.So, with that as a framework, let's turn our attention to Q1. Our Q1 guidance reflects our quarter to-date actual results and our forecast for the remainder of the quarter. Foreign exchange rates are expected to be an approximately 6-7 percentage point headwind to year-over-year growth rates in Q1, which we estimate will impact gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA, and non-GAAP EPS growth rates by similar amounts. We used a dollar to Euro exchange rate of $1.13 when setting our Q1 guidance.We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 6% to 8% and total gross bookings to be approximately flat at the midpoint of our guidance in U.S. dollars and to grow by 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. This reflects what we've seen so far this quarter and also limited impact from our growth investments. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs for the company will be down about 1% compared to the prior period.We forecast Q1 non-GAAP revenue to be approximately flat at the midpoint of our guidance in U.S. dollars and grow by 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate that Q1 non-GAAP revenue to grow by 7% to 9%. We are forecasting Q1 GAAP revenue will be down 2% to approximately flat when compared to Q1 last year.Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $680 million and $700 million. The resulting growth rate is also negatively impacted by unfavorable year-over-year FX change and by Easter timing. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate that Q1 EBTIDA will grow by 2% to 4%. As I mentioned earlier, this is negatively impacted by our growth investments, especially in our seasonally smallest revenue quarter.We are forecasting leverage from performance marketing expense line in Q1, reflecting lower volumes in the pay channels and our continued focus on acquiring high-quality traffic. We expect to accelerate our brand marketing spend in the quarter, which will contribute to de-leverage to the P&L and more than offset the leverage we're expecting from performance marketing. Brand marketing is a key area where we're making growth investments to drive more direct traffic to our websites and build better awareness.Finally, sales and other expense growth is expected to decelerate relative to Q4 but will continue to grow faster than revenue, primarily due to ramp-up of our payment platform at booking.com.We are forecasting Q1 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $10.90 to $11.20. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate Q1 non-GAAP EPS growth to grow in the low double digits. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 18%, which is lower than Q1 last year, primarily due to the clarification around the provision of the tax act previously mentioned, and lower than our full year non-GAAP tax rate due to certain discrete tax benefits typically realized in the first quarter. We expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 19% to 19.5%.Our Q1 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 45.6 million shares, which is 7% below Q1 last year.We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.90 and $10.20 for Q1. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a tax rate of approximately 18%.We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue, or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions, in general, or in the travel market, in particular. With that, we'll now take your questions.Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you have a question, please press \"*1\" on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press \"#\". To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated.And our first question is from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thank you. I'll just start off with just a high-level question. When you look at your bookings growth rate in Q1 and you think about how you're performing versus other companies, it seems like it's a bit of a difference, your guidance versus other people in the travel industry. So, how do you kind of reconcile that? And then maybe if you could tell us how much better February was versus January and if you think there was just something really abnormal for the first two months of the year. Thank you. -- Hi, Justin. It's Glenn. So, as you know, we are very European-centric in our business. We are a global company, for sure, but our biggest business, by far, is in Europe. And Europe has definitely seen and is experiencing a slowdown if you look at any of the macro indicators out there or any of the published information, whether it comes from the EU data people, if it comes out from any of the investment banks that put out predictions for how European economies are going to go. And you see even, I think it was yesterday, our chairman of the Federal Reserve, who actually said \"seeing headwinds in Europe.\" So, I think that is one element that we show a difference.On the other hand, I think if you look at the pure European players, if you look at some of the tour operators, the two who are the biggest in there -- and I would suggest you take a look at their numbers and what they said -- I think I see significant consistency with what we're saying right here, right now. And there are a lot of uncertainties there. And uncertainty is something that absolutely makes people a little hesitant to book.And I can go through -- besides just general macro, we can talk about Brexit, which is obviously creating a tremendous amount of uncertainty and people are uncertain. Should I spend a lot of money right now or not? I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know are there going to be troubles traveling intra-Europe. Are there going to be troubles with FX changes?Or if you go into political issues. And France, weekly political issues with the yellow vest protests, which makes it, \"Do I want to go to Paris with that happening on Saturday and Sunday?\" Go to Germany, where the car industry drives the German economy, which has slowed down. It's a secondary impact from trade arguments throughout the world, particularly China/U.S. has a secondary impact on Germany. Go to Italy, where the government there seems to be a little bit in flux with what they're doing. I can go on and on. The fact is we are more impacted by things that happen in Europe than, say, a U.S.-based company. So, I would say that on that one.In terms of February and how that was, I think David said about as much color as we're going to say. It's that February was a nice uptick from January but it was still below December in Europe and I think that's about all Dave -- -- I just want to recap the other comment which I made. I think, Glenn, you just talked exactly about what I said about Europe. But I also just want to recap, Justin, that you heard that we said this really is an issue that's focused upon Europe and that room night growth in the other parts of the world are much more in line with what we saw in December. -- Got it. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Okay. Appreciate the relatively new disclosure on alternative accommodations. I didn't quite expect it to be that high as a percentage of revenue. So, maybe talk a little bit more about that. I think that you said that it was nicely profitable. So, is it as profitable as the core business? Maybe how much faster it's growing than the overall business? And then any color of the particular regions -- is there any more color about where that growth is coming from in alternative accommodations? Any more color there would be helpful. Thank you. -- Hi, Mark. So, it is a new disclosure and we were very proud of that one I mentioned about Q3 and breaking that $1 billion milestone. I think we were all pretty darn pleased about that. In terms of profitability, I would say nicely profitable. I'm not going to get into the details of it. One thing we have talked about in the past, though, about how sometimes the costs involved can be more than the costs with the traditional hotel product. And it's easy to see that when you start talking about scale. If you want to deal with a hotel that has hundreds of rooms, you can distribute that cost much more easily than when you're going property by property by property. And that's about as much color as I'll give in terms of profitability.What we'll say in terms of geographic growth, etc., we have made a point in the past -- and I'm going to continue this -- is that we know that we are, and I just mentioned, how we're a European-centric company and we do very well in the capital cities in the alternative accommodations. We've got great properties there. We are able to produce a very good offering there. In other parts of the world, and in U.S., in particular, we need to increase our properties, particularly a certain type and that is a single home that is in the beach locations, some of the ski locations.And I'll just point an example to show this. I was talking about getting a Hamptons house for the family and I looked at that on our site and I looked at some of our competitors' sites and I'm saying we've got to get some more of that stuff. And that is something that we are doing. That's part of the things that we invest in. And I look it as a glass half full type thing. This is a great opportunity for us to increase and really drive the seller rate down a little bit in that area and grow our business. -- Okay. Thank you, Glenn.Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. I guess, first, it looks like performance marketing spend was up about 12% in the quarter, call it 16% to 17% ex-FX and almost 20% when you include brand spend, and yet room nights booked was up only about 13%. Can you give us a sense for what's going on with marketing ROIs and maybe some more color on how that's trending in acquired channels? How growth is trending in acquired versus direct?And then, I guess, in some of the prepared remarks, you talked a lot about growth investments. It sounds like most of those are going to be on the brand side. Are you also going to be leaning in on the performance side for growth? And any color you can give there would be great. -- Yeah, Lloyd, this is David. Let me just start with that. So, let me just kind of clarify the difference between what we expect and then what we saw in Q4. You have to look at Q4, you have to exclude the impact of the extra revenue when doing your leverage and de-leverage calculations. So, on a like-with-like basis, we actually expected to get some de-leverage in the performance marketing line. We actually wound up with a little bit of leverage. It's part of the reason why we came over on our EBITDA guidance for the quarter.And, basically, what drove that compared to our expectations was a little bit less volume than we were expecting in those channels and, actually, with ROIs that are in line with our guidance when we spoke to you about the quarter at the beginning of it. And, actually, if you look at my comments about Q1, you see a similar trend as well. We're expecting some leverage in the performance marketing channel again in Q1 because volumes are a little lower but we're still getting solid ROIs against those volumes. So, you see our mix toward direct continuing to increase as a result of that leverage we're getting in those channels.And then, in terms of growth, I think we kind of gave you the growth investments and we gave you a feel that they're going to impact our EBITDA growth this year by a few basis points. In terms of the income statement, I basically told you where you'll see them. Some of them will appear in the branding line. Some of them will appear in the revenue line, in terms of merchandising, customer acquisition, customer incentive programs. You'll see some increases in the personnel line to support those investments directly. In some of the countries where we talked about investing for long-term returns, there are some increases in performance marketing associated with those countries but it's not the major part of the investment program. -- Okay. Thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thanks a lot. Could you give us -- so, just to go into the room night growth a little bit more for the first quarter. The guidance is about 400 basis points slower compared to your guidance for the fourth quarter. So, is that fully just from the European kind of macro comments that you were mentioning or are there any other key factors there for the Q1 nights guide? And then I had another one. Thanks. -- Kevin, I'll take that. I mean, that really is the major factor. Just to kind of stitch together the couple of comments that we made to make sure that you have gotten. So, as we said when we guided for Q4, we expected some deceleration in room nights in the fourth quarter from what we'd seen. We obviously came quite strongly out of Q3. In September, we mentioned that we were seeing pretty good room night growth in October. And, as expected, we saw a little step down in the fourth quarter. And, in fact, November and December room nights were quite comparable to each other but a little bit less than October and, therefore, a little bit less than the average of where we came out for the quarter. And then you jump off that point and I think the rest of it, we've kind of been through. We saw a step down and then a bit of a bounce back in Europe and we really do believe that's tied to the macro and we looked at it very carefully. And then we saw a relatively similar performance in the first couple of months this quarter as we saw to the last few months of last quarter outside of Europe. -- Okay. Thanks for that. And just to follow up on the investment and customer acquisition programs, particularly the incentive programs, can you give us more color on what you're doing there? And are you focusing on an incentive-based loyalty program or is it more on special, one-off offers for new customers or all customers? Thanks. -- Well, it's actually that and many more. There are lots of different ways to put that money to work and achieve what we want to do, in terms of an ROI that we think is acceptable over the long run. And, certainly, the two you mentioned are there and there are a lot of other ones.And it depends on which geography you're in too. If you go to some of the things that are happening in the Asia marketplace, where there is significantly more price competition with discounting by wholesalers that's being put into retail, all sorts of things, we need to be able to compete with that straight out. If we don't provide a value to our customers, we're not going to get that. So, we've got to do that.Certainly, there is things like potential loyalty programs. There's different things for just bringing in new customers. Even things -- and I'll give you an example. It's a small thing but I got a postcard yesterday from booking.com that offered up -- in snail mail -- that offered me a discount if I went to the site. So, lots of different things to do. And on top of those pure ones, it's putting together packages with different types of our inventory, with different types of our products, to create a better value that we may end up doing some subsidy for us, but we may also be working partially with suppliers.So, for example, we have new deals with Didi and Grab. Those are ground transportation companies, primarily. Working with them, where we may, together, work to be able to get more customers to those companies in areas that they need, or they're helping us get us customers in areas that we need, and doing different types of cooperative types of marketing programs that will help us get more customers. Lots of different ways to do that. And we're going to always be measuring which ones are giving us the best ROI. -- Thanks, Glenn. And then just housekeeping on the EPS guide, does that assume the future buybacks now that you expect to use that program in '19? -- Yeah. Basically, yes. The EPS guidance, from a housekeeping point of view, we said that we expect to use our remaining authorization. So, we gave you a specific share count number for Q1 but, in our guide for the full year, it assumes we extinguish that remaining authorization. -- Thanks, David. -- Thanks, Kevin.Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I was hoping you could drill down more on the key benefits of the payment platform and if you could talk a little bit about when you start seeing those benefits more and how long it takes to fully roll out. And then, David, just on the 1Q guide, is it safe to assume here that you're assuming further decel, as you usually have done in previous quarters in the past? Thanks. -- Doug, you're right. This payment platform is a very important thing for booking.com as we go forward. And developing its merchant capabilities so we can provide this greater merchandising -- a couple of things I just mentioned. You need a payment platform to be able to do some of the things I was just talking about in answering Kevin's question. So, that's the basics there. But there's even more.Just simple -- I mentioned how important it is for our alternative accommodations business that we want to continue to grow that out. Well, that's also a very important thing to have because, as you go out to those single home property owners, who are not that sophisticated, the old agency method that we used, primarily, at booking.com is not really the thing that they want to use. They're not planning to be there and take a credit card and then get a bill from us to send us our commission. They want to have a merchant product there. So, that's an important thing too.It's one of those things we're always going to be working on because a payments platform is not just the simple thing in America where we're using credit cards. There are new payment systems throughout the world that are coming out all the time and we need to be able to provide that to both sides of our marketplace. There are people on the supply side that want to connect to Alipay. I want to be part of WeChat pay. That's how I want to get my money and you've got to do that. Same thing on the customer who wants to pay. They say, hey, I want to use Paytm or I want to do M-PESA. And I can go through an endless list of these things. So, when we talk about a payment platform, we're talking about something that's global and able to use throughout and helping to reduce that friction in the entire transaction. -- And, Doug, let me just pick up on that and also clarify your question. Of course, payments is very important but let's make sure it's not going to be the entire business. We do believe that pay at the property, which has been a big piece of our business, continues to be a big piece of our business, is also a very important part of our portfolio and a lot of our customers and a lot of our partners also like that as well. So, it's bringing in an additional capability to complement what we do so well at booking.com.And then to comment upon your question on the Q1 guide. No, our Q1 guide does not assume a deceleration. That's why I did not say that. In fact, specifically, we said that January was, in fact, again, with the rest of the world being relatively consistent with December, I said that, in Europe, January was a step down and February was a step up. So, it reflects what we've seen so far and our expectations for the rest of the quarter but it does not reflect a deceleration. -- Thank you both.Thank you. Our next question is from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A somewhat related question on the payment side. What is currently the go-to-market strategy for the payments platform? What is incentivizing hoteliers to choose your payment solution versus their existing one? And, over time, do you think there is additional opportunity to generate economics from the payments efforts? Right now, it sounds like you are probably using some incentives for adoption. So, I just wanted to get some color there. -- Yeah, I'll take that and I'm going to reverse because it is exciting -- the second part of your question -- about being able to use the payment platform, not necessarily something that is increasing costs but as something that actually, over time, will actually enable us to make more money. And given the volumes that we put through and are putting through in the future, I believe that is a great opportunity but that is down the road. Right now, in terms of incentivization, listen, as David just mentioned, our agency product is still -- it's an enormous part of the product. It's the way major hotels are still going to probably want to do for some time.But, again, I go back to the thing about merchandising, putting together packages. One of the things we always try and emphasize, how we try and work with our supplier partners cooperatively and in a way that adds value to both of us. And having that merchant payment product available, so that we can combine a hotel with another service in a way that helps bring that customer to that hotel in a way that is frictionless, easy, makes that payment so much easier for the customer. Well, I think hotels are going to want to do that if it gets them more business and I think that's really the incentive for that. Over time, there could also be a volume issue where we can do a payment product that is significantly less expensive for smaller hotels in other parts of the world where their costs are higher. -- That's helpful. Thanks, Glenn.Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hi, Glenn. So, building on your highest potential market commentary earlier, it seems like there's more dialogue around your local efforts in China, both in terms of  s like this as well as interviews with your local management teams and talking about the opportunity for outbound. So, you've always had partnerships there but why is now the right time for what looks like is probably more of a direct effort to advertise and establish the booking.com brand in the country? And is perhaps a greater conversion rate from the payment product, is that what's making, I guess, the ROIs possible now? Thanks. -- I would look at it a little differently, actually. We first started our business in China many, many, many, many years ago. We now have approximately 1,000 employees there and we have different call centers there. We have always been pushing out our own brands and it's not just booking.com. Agoda has been operating in China for a very long time. So, I think the way we look at it is we're always trying to use all the different ways to get more customers through our platform and be able to provide more value to customers and hoteliers. So, yes, we absolutely are doing deals with lots of different players in China because we think that's a way to help build up our business. But I don't think it's anything different. I don't think things have changed.In terms of the payment product, there is some difference and some things that do help, in terms of doing business in China. Having that product there is good. I'd like to point out Agoda's always been a merchant player and they've done very well there. Bookings, in the past, was primarily an agency business. They've done very well there. But I do think having that flexibility, particularly with Alipay and with WeChat Pay and some of the other things coming in here, our agreement with Didi, Meituan, I think these things are helpful to have that platform there. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Thanks a lot. I've got two clarifications. On this sort of recent trend and macro-related slowdown in Europe, are you seeing customers eventually book but not really booking in advance? Kind of waiting more until the last minute. Is that kind of the behavior you're seeing or are you seeing the demand weaken all tougher? And then another question I have was about just the growth in different channels. I think I heard you mention mobile growing faster and alternative growing faster. I did not hear about direct growing faster. Was that still the case? That direct bookings are faster growing? -- Hi. So, I'll take that first one and then I'll let David talk about growth and speed. I think that it'll be interesting over -- and we need more time to see if this uncertainty factor, this propensity, perhaps, to wait to book, we'll need a little more time to see if it's been a drastic change and that is what is happening right now. I would say that it was interesting in the third quarter, where we did have a lot of people who, obviously, waited to book because either it was World Cup or the heat or whatever, and then we did see that delayed pick-up in bookings in the third quarter. I think it's a little early to say exactly what's happening. I think it's also what's going to happen in the macro environment. -- Yeah. And then, sorry, I obviously covered a lot of things in my earlier comments but I did talk about direct. And just to confirm and recap, the direct channel did grow faster. We used to say it was approximately half the business. Now we're saying it's over half the business and growing faster than the average. So, we have the direct channel at over half and growing faster than average. We've got mobile over half and growing faster than the average. And we've got the alternative business at about 20% of our revenues and a higher percentage of our room nights and also growing faster. So, each three of those are doing well and growing faster than the average. -- Okay. Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David.Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Thanks very much for taking my questions. In terms of your investments in the alternative accommodations space, it would be great to understand, within that investment bucket, how much of it is investing in new supply -- Glenn, in your example, you mentioned beach house listings -- versus marketing of that supply versus investments in the consumer tools to integrate that supply, whether it be technology or AI that improves the user interface for the customer? And then related to that, just wondering if you're seeing any consumer behavior that suggests maybe an incremental shift to home versus hotel. Is that inflecting in any way that is notable or is it more kind of a steady, linear trend that's going on out there? Thanks a lot. -- So, one thing, and it may be a little confusing, is the difference between our steady -- growing listings, growing the business is sort of our steady state. That's what we do all the time. Versus what we try and call out a little bit here is that we're doing a step-up in investments. The listings is not a step-up in investments. It's going to continue to grow our business and I want to do it. It's important. But we don't see that as a different thing that we're doing right now. So, that would not be part of when we're talking about the step-up investments.In terms of what we need to do to make that business continue to accelerate and do well is all the elements that we've done in all of our business forever. And I think one of the key things, really, is getting that knowledge out among certain groups of customers around the world who may not have as much knowledge that we have this great product. And, yes, I mentioned -- I called out where I think we have a little bit of a shortfall in some parts of it. But the fact is, in the U.S., we've got a great product and we do need, though, to make more customers aware of it and that's part of coming out with that new branding campaign that we launched two days ago. You won't see it in the stuff you're seeing these couple days but it's coming out, as part of it, to make sure that people are aware that we have a non-hotel accommodation product that is out there that is good.And we talked about the reasons why we think it's a great thing. About the instant confirmation. We talk about that you can see that on the same search results as your traditional so you can do a comparison. We talk about how you don't get hit in the end with a fee at the end. All these reasons that we think we have a great product but definitely getting that branding out and that's an area we talked about increasing our spend. In terms of actual looking at numbers and inflection points, I think there's nothing that I would see that we saw this is a difference, we're going to have a huge inflection point. This is a little bit of blocking and tackling, do all the right things, and continue to do it day in and day out and we'll get there. -- Yeah. And then, Anthony, just to clarify or to build up on Glenn's point and just make sure everybody is clear. When we talk about these incremental investments we are making in 2019, incremental above investments that we'd normally make with the regular size and growth of the business, these are all focused upon driving growth. They're focused upon branding, they're focused upon customer acquisition, they're focused upon merchandising incentive programs. They're all focused upon driving incremental customers to our platform, driving incremental transactions, and driving loyalty. So, top line focused. -- Awesome. Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question is from Michael J. Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good afternoon. I just had one. You mentioned several areas of near-term investment and I don't believe experiences was one of those areas. Just curious where that falls on the list of priorities at this point with all the other initiatives going on and alternative accommodations, direct channel growth, payment platform, China, etc. Thanks. -- So, it is important. And, as David just said, we're trying to just show a little difference in the sense of what are the incremental things that we're doing to drive growth. It's a very important part of our business. We bought FareHarbor, put that in. I can tell you now, we have over 100 cities now and I think it's up to almost 120, that have these attractions and things people can do when they show up. And we talked about, in the long run, how important it is to offer that holistic solution for a customer and that goes back to why we're having this payment product. You've got to have together all of the elements of the trip and reduce the friction for that customer. So, the fact that we didn't throw it out and we didn't talk about it, we went half an hour into our prepared remarks and I'm glad that you asked the question so I could make a point that this is still an extremely important part and we're very pleased with some of the progress we're seeing there. -- And it ties together with the work we're doing in booking, also, to bring in the car rides and put together these great trips. So, it's a very important part of our building out the connected trip experience for our customers. -- Got it. Thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. This is Daniel Powell on for Heath. Just a couple quick questions for us. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on some of the comments you made around what you saw in your various marketing channels in the fourth quarter. It sounded like the ROIs were stable but the volumes you were seeing were pretty consistent. Just curious if there was a decision around, because of what you were seeing in the macro environment, not to look to lean into other channels or if there was a lack of ROI that you saw outside of the traditional channels that you weren't getting the volume in that you had expected to.And then just another one after that. On the delta between room night growth and bookings growth in the first quarter that you're guiding to, I realize that it's not very big, but just curious if there's anything about the growth that you're seeing in alternative accommodations that we should think about over the course of 2019 that could be impacting the delta between those two. Thanks, guys. -- Yeah. Dan, let me take the second one. I think you've got to look at everything on a constant currency adjusted basis. I'm sorry to have to do that but, unfortunately, it's the only way to kind of look at things on a like-with-like basis. So, you look at that basis and, for the first quarter, room night growth is 6% to 8% and gross bookings growth is 5% to 7%. So, pretty consistent. There's an ADR difference. We do expect ADRs, and we're seeing a little bit of pressure on ADRs, tied to the macro. We're seeing it tied to two things. One, we are seeing a little bit less international travel into certain cities and those international travel transactions typically have a higher ADR. And also we are seeing some local pricing pressure as well impacting the ADRs. So, that's the story between room night growth and gross bookings, on a like-with-like basis, during the first quarter.And then just to recap, again, what we said on the fourth quarter, we were expecting to get some de-leverage from the performance marketing channels and we got a little bit of leverage. That's because there was just less volume there than we expected but we were pleased with the ROIs and we were also pleased with the share that we maintain in those performance marketing channels. So, it's really a function of the volume we saw in the channels as opposed to anything else. -- Got you. And there weren't other channels that you thought you could have spent into when you weren't getting that volume or is there an issue around timing there? -- Look, we are always looking at every way we can spend money to bring in growth and we're always looking at what's the ROI for it, what do we think the long-term benefit is going to be, what's it do for the brand, all things we've talked about in the past about that. We were pleased with the way things were at that point. -- And then, really, just to kind of put those two points back together again. If you think about it, we did better than we expected in the Q4 on room nights growth and, as I just said, we got a little bit less volume from the performance marketing channel. So, the fact that we were able to beat our room night growth guidance for the quarter and an important channel for us had a little less volume than we expected, I think that's a good thing. And, therefore, we were able to still lean in elsewhere and do better than we had told you that we thought we might do. -- Thanks. Appreciate the details.Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Just back to the growth initiatives for '19, I'm just curious if you could help us prioritize. If you had to weight each of the initiatives, where the biggest weight goes and the biggest investments in descending order. If you could just give us a high-level view, that would be very helpful. -- Yes. I don't think we're going to be able to give you more color on it. The ones we've just set out are the important ones. And one thing I'll make a point of is that we set up a budget, we think what it's going to be for the year, and we put it out and then we start actually executing. And as you go throughout a year, you may notice some things are performing better than other things where you want to put more money. Or you may see things that are not working as well and you pull that back. So, even if I were to give color and say, OK, as of this moment, here's where we're going to spend how much, it's still not going to be that helpful because these things, I know, will change as the environment changes. -- Yeah. And, Brent, just to kind of give you a little bit of color I can tell you, which is the smallest of the three areas, we told you there was going to be some impact you'd see on the branding line, some impact you'd see on the revenue line, and some impact you'd see on the personnel line. Well, the personnel line is, by far, the smallest of those three. The other two are the major spend areas and the personnel increases are really those people we're adding to support those growth initiatives. -- And, Glenn, just a quick follow-up. If Europe continues to lag a little bit longer than you would like, can you just give us a sense of how you think about the alternative opportunity to counter what's happening? How you think about that through the back half of the year? Thank you very much. -- Yeah. So, we believe that areas of slowdown can be great opportunities to gain share, develop loyalty, increase your value to your supplier partners. When things start getting a little bit slower, our hotel partners are looking for getting demand wherever they can. They'll look for that incremental. And they want to be able to say, \"Can you supply somebody in this bed?\" And, as you know, hotels have high fixed costs. They need to get that person in to help hit their bottom line or get as close as they can to make a breakeven environment. I've had the fortune of going through some of these in the past. I've been in the company, it's now more than 19 years. And so we've been through this before and we've been able to add value in the past and I suspect, if things do slow down a bit, that we can position ourselves in a way that, as we come out, we'll be even stronger.Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Patterson from Raymond James. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate the commentary around the payment platform earlier and that providing a more frictionless experience. My question is, as you layer in more of these services, how do you think about really making consumers aware of all of these new features in the app? And, in turn, how does that change your view of LTV over the long term? Thanks. -- Yeah. That's a good point because, as we point out, just having great service and a great product, that's not very helpful if people don't know about it. One of the great things is people become more mobile savvy and as they're using their mobile devices more and more and you're able to push opportunities to them more, be able to communicate more with them, you're able to demonstrate what the value can be by going through our system. And we see this developing around the world, this concept of the \"super app\" type thing. And this is everything, all the way from the WeChat, which is completely -- so many different things you can do off that -- to things that are a little bit, not quite, but our partner with Grab that's doing a lot of different stuff. We need to make sure that our customers are aware of these great things. I'm not as concerned, though, about being able to communicate what the value is and I think we're going to be there. When we set these things up, as we continue to set them up, I think it's going to be fine.Thank you. Our next question is from Tom White from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on -- you talked about profitability of your alternative accommodation room nights. I think you said solidly profitable. But, Glenn, you kind of called out some of the higher costs for that relative to the traditional hotel business. I also remember that, in the past, you've talked about the potential for technologies like AI and better automation to reduce your OpEx per room night. Is that something that should help drive the EBITDA per room night for alternative to be more in line with traditional hotel over time? Or will that always kind of be structurally lower? -- So, first, I just want to make sure we're on the same page. I said nicely profitable. That was the word I used. Not solidly. But I believe that all new types of technologies that we're developing are going to reduce that cost over time for both non-hotel accommodations and hotel accommodations. And it's interesting to see which ones will help the most, fastest. I don't know the answer to that. I do know, though, that some of the things that we see, even right now, in terms of lowering our customer service costs, because we do have more customer service contacts with our non-hotel accommodations area, this is an area where we probably will get a benefit more there than we would in hotels. But there could be other examples that go the other way.The fact is, though, one of the benefits from our company having the size and scale that we have, the ability to go out and hire lots of really smart AI-type people, help develop technologies that we can then put into our platform and distribute throughout the world for all of our supplier partners. We're providing a value that they can't do on their own. That adds to the reason why they connect to us. That's the reason why they give us the inventory. That's the reason why they want to work with us. That's something that we do that they can't do as well, particularly somebody who is not a multi-billion dollar, global chain. If you're not one of those, you're definitely not going to be able to play in that game. We bring that to them. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just where is the company strategy around some of the for/by owner-managed inventory that's sort of, I guess, more frictional and what's the overall strategy? And then you signed an agreement with Sabre a couple of months ago. Have you seen an uplift in that agreement since you started that partnership? -- I'll answer the second one. I haven't kept up with the details of that so I'm just going to have to just pass on that one. I think that, if it was significant right now, though, I'd know. So, that's one. Let's go with the second thing. Any type of non-hotel accommodation, whether it be a single home that is operated by a mom and pop that do it once a year for one week all the way up to the very sophisticated players who have multiple units and are working with multiple distribution channels, we want to be able to get all these people on to the platform. The thing that we want to do, though, is in the right order, in the right time, and spend the right amount of money. And obviously go for the more profitable ones first. So, for the ones you're mentioning, I think those are sometimes more costly. We've got a significant number of sophisticated owners to deal with to get them onto the platform but we'll get to them all eventually.So, I want to thank everybody for the call. In summary, I am very pleased with our performance in 2018, as we met many important financial and strategic goals. I'm truly excited about our upcoming key investments for 2019 as we position the company for long-term growth. And, finally, I want to thank everyone who made 2018 such a successful year, including our supplier and marketing partners, our now more than 24,000 employees distributed across more than 300 offices around the world, and, most of all, our traveler customers who are out there being what we call in our new advertising campaign the bookers, the doers, the people out there exploring the world. And by doing this, they're making the world a better place. Good night.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

The company has been  of  for years and has grown at a breakneck pace. Investors who bought into this stock during its 2007 IPO are already sitting on a 10-bagger.MercadoLibre makes its money in a handful of ways, but its most important services are its marketplace business, payment business, and shipping service.The marketplace business connects buyers with sellers. MercadoLibre pulls in revenue from each successful transaction that takes place on its platform.MercadoLibre also has its own  -like payment system called MercadoPago that facilitates transactions. The company rakes in a small fee from processing each payment.Finally, the company is building out its own fulfillment network to handle package delivery. This delivery and logistics platform helps sellers get items to where they need to be reliably and quickly.All of these business units have grown strongly over the last few years and still offer huge potential for growth. The primary reason for this is that only  are currently online. Over time, this number should continue to catch up to developed countries like the U.S., where the internet penetration rate is closer to 90%. Layering in the general shift toward e-commerce should ensure that this business pumps out double-digit growth for a very long time.Consumers used to rely on travel agents to help them book vacations. Then companies like Booking Holdings burst onto the scene and made it easy for anyone to make their own reservations online and save a bundle in the process. The rest is history.Booking Holdings has been the top dog in the move to online travel for years thanks to its portfolio of top-tier brands. This company owns a number of leading travel sites like Priceline.com, Kayak.com, RentalCars.com, Agoda.com, Booking.com, and more.Booking owes a lot of its success to its early entry on the European hotel market. The company spent years building out a vast network and became the go-to choice for travelers and operators alike. That helped to fuel enormous growth, and Booking turned out to be a  .The great news for investors is that the global shift toward online travel still has  for continued growth. That's why Booking Holdings is still producing  to this day, even though it is already a massive business.This is a trend I think can persist for years to come, so I plan on remaining a happy shareholder indefinitely.Payment processors like Mastercard have been prime beneficiaries in the  . Consumers increasingly prefer to pay with plastic since doing so provides speed and convenience that cash or check simply cannot match.Mastercard plays a pivotal role in ensuring that funds can easily flow between consumers, banks, and merchants. Mastercard charges a tiny fee for each transaction that flows through its network. Since billions of transactions occur on its network each year, those fees add up fast. The company pulls in billions in  .The beauty of this business model is that the majority of Mastercard's costs are fixed. This means incremental volume helps to drive enormous  and leads to out-sized growth on the bottom line.Best of all, there is still a huge amount of room left for continued growth.

Mastercard's revenue and profit should continue to steadily head higher as the shift to plastic marches on.I first become a shareholder of Netflix about a decade ago. The company was primarily a DVD-by-mail business that was just starting to dabble in streaming. I had no idea it was about to become the leader in the shift away from the linear TV.You know what happened next. The company used its DVD-by-mail profits to fund content growth and a massive expansion into international markets. That bold move has lead to  and has set off a flywheel that has allowed its top line to surge. Long-term shareholders have been hugely rewarded for watching the story unfold.More recently, the company has been flexing its  in an effort to turbo-charge revenue growth. Consumers have swallowed the increases without much of a fuss.The bull case for owning Netflix moving forward is that content costs will eventually flatten out and drive enormous profit growth as its subscriber count continues to surge. That's a story I find highly appealing, so I'm happy to continue holding my shares of this perennial winner.Amazon.com easily ranks as one of my biggest winners of all time. I first started buying shares of the e-commerce titan in 2010. I thought I was late to the party and that the company was already too big to own. Shares are up more than 10-fold since.It is easy to make the same argument today. Amazon's market cap briefly crossed  last fall. How can an outsized investment in this company possible make sense?I'd answer that question with the following:These four growth channels alone offer plenty of reasons to remain bullish, but the picture looks even better when you throw in other growth drivers like Whole Foods, Amazon Go, Twitch, Alexa devices, and potential moonshot projects like its steady move into  .In other words, Amazon  looks poised for massive growth in the decades ahead.

The company surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with average positive surprise of 12.35%. However, the online travel company recorded a negative earnings surprise of 1.54% in the las  ed quarter.Booking Holdings generates bulk of its revenues from international markets, wherein the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 21.6/73% in the third quarter.In the third quarter, agency revenues increased 37.9% sequentially and 0.5% year over year. We expect agency revenues to increase in the to-be-reported quarter as well, driven by strength across all its platforms.Merchant revenues are also expected to grow in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by strength across agoda.com and rentalcars.com. While agoda.com is likely to benefit from discounting in markets, rentalcars.com is expected to ride on continuous operational improvements.In the third quarter, merchant revenues were up 47.9% sequentially and 53.4% year over year.Room night growth is expected to improve in the quarter to be reported, driven by diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out the macro uncertainties related to any market, as well as growing competition from local and international players.Total room nights booked during the third quarter was 201.3 million, which exhibited year-over-year growth of 13.4%. This was driven by strong performance of the company's direct channel.For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 9-12% and total gross bookings to increase 6-9% year over year (10-13% on a constant-currency basis).According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 27, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This online booking service is expected to pos  of $19.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15%.Revenues are expected to be $3.21 billion, up 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.78% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Booking Holdings, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.31%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Booking Holdings will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Booking Holdings would pos  of $38.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $37.78, delivering a surprise of -1.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Booking Holdings doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The photo-sharing site's asymmetrical nature means posts reach a broader audience than they would on Facebook, and it's growing much faster than the company's main platform.Instagram  monthly active users in June 2018 -- just nine months after it reached 800 million -- and has spawned its own culture, complete with memes, influencers, and terms like FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). The app is also influencing the broader culture in a number of ways, and any investor would be wise to pay attention to such a social media phenomenon. Owning  would seem to be the most obvious way for investors to benefit -- but there are other ways.Image source: Getty Images.Investors often think of the beauty industry as a dull, defensive, slow-growth business -- it's a part of the household products sector that has seen little growth or innovation over the years. But Instagram is driving some change here.Millennials, the \"selfie generation,\" have become avid consumers of makeup and beauty products, thanks in part to the broadcasting effects of Instagram. The perfectly-put-together portrait style popularized on the app has even been derisively dubbed \"Instagram Face.\" Celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Rihanna have capitalized on the trend by launching their own beauty brands, but Instagram's influence is also propping up legacy cosmetics companies.The share price of  (NYSE: EL) , the 73-year-old global giant, has risen 76% over the last three years, and the company just delivered  quarterly report. At a time when many bricks-and-mortar retailers are struggling, salon and cosmetics chain  (NASDAQ: ULTA) is fast opening up stores, and its shares have more than tripled in the last five years. Sales of luxury beauty products have been growing particularly fast, driving excellent performance for companies like Estee Lauder and  (NYSE: COTY) .According to Orbis Research, the global cosmetics market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 7.1% over the next five years, outpacing broader economic growth, to $805 billion. Considering the premium that Instagram places on appearances, that trend is likely to continue.According to online travel agency  (NASDAQ: EXPE) , the No. 1 criteria millennials consider when choosing a destination isn't price, nearby attractions, or cultural experiences, but how Instagrammable the place is. Two-thirds of the young adult generation surveyed listed that factor as their top concern.Hotels, resorts, and travel companies now regularly work with Instagram influencers to make images of their destinations inspire envy in those who see them on social media -- because that emotion is leading to a whole lot of bookings.Whether Instagram's popularity is in this case more of a cause or an effect, millennials prefer to spend money  rather than on things. In previous generations, \"keeping up with the Joneses\" referred to making home improvements or acquiring new \"toys.\" Today, it means taking an exotic beach vacation so you can post the pics where everyone can see them.The travel sector is diverse and massive, but the easiest way for investors to take advantage of this trend is by holding shares of booking platforms  (NASDAQ: BKNG) and Expedia, which between them have something close to a duopoly in their segment of the industry. Hotel operators and airlines may be worth investigating as well, especially those savvy enough to take advantage of the Instagram trend. And Airbnb would also be an intriguing play, if it goes public.Another area where the millennial preference for spending money on experiences is having an impact is in the entertainment sector, boosting interest in events like concerts. Nothing inspires FOMO like party-and-music festivals -- events like Coachella have exploded in popularity with the help of social media platforms like Instagram, which act as a marketing engine for them.Brands fully admit to using such events to market to young adult consumers,  and the influence of Instagram on concerts, music festivals, and gatherings like Burning Man is at times controversial. Organizers have focused on visual spectacles to appeal to the Instagram audience, and Burning Man's CEO has decried its influence on that anti-corporate gathering.Nonetheless, such events remain a growth market. Live music ticketing, for example, is expected to grow at a 7% annual rate through 2021, according to Technavio. Investors can get exposure to that growth through  (NYSE: LYV) , the Ticketmaster parent whose shares have nearly tripled over the past three years, or  (NYSE: EB) , a newly public competitor that tends to focus on smaller events, rather than working with the big venues that Ticketmaster has contracts with.Investors should be mindful that these trends won't necessarily make all of these stocks winners; competitive dynamics within industries will likely prove more important than the broad tailwind of Instagram culture. Therefore, the best approach may be to buy a basket of stocks in one or more of the social-photo-supported industries discussed above.By doing so, investors can take advantage of Wall Street's focus on short-term numbers, and its occasional inability to recognize the implications of broader cultural trends -- or to see the forest for the trees.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But staying focused on the long haul is tough when the market is going nowhere but down. A  can bring portfolio losses that take a toll on even the most ardent buy-and-hold investor, so it's important to prepare proactively for the market's inevitable swoons. Here's how.Investing terms like \"bear market\" are often thrown around casually -- and incorrectly. For that reason, it's important to know exactly what constitutes a bear market and how it differs from a correction.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Falling stock prices alone do not make for a bear market, which is defined as a stock-market decline of 20% or more from a prior peak that lasts two months or longer. The term is most relevant when describing a drop in prices for indexes made up of many stocks, such as the  (NYSEMKT: SPY) (NYSEMKT: VOO) , but it can also refer to an individual sector, industry, or stock if its decline is steep enough and lasts long enough.If stocks are down, but not  much, it's probably a correction. A correction is a market decline that's less severe and shorter in duration than a bear market. Typically, corrections are defined as a 10% or greater decline from a prior peak price, and they last less than two months.(And if you're curious, the \"bear market\" got its name because the downward, painful, and vicious decline is reminiscent of the swipe made by an attacking bear.)To find out what might trigger the next bear market, we can look at the causes behind past ones. The excellent 2013 Motley Fool article \"  \" provides a quick backstory on the biggest drops in the  (NYSEMKT: DIA) since the late 1960s . A price-weighted index of 30 of the most important publicly traded U.S. companies, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has become one of the most-watched stock-market barometers since its creation in 1896. While the exact same catalysts causing the biggest drops in the Dow Jones over the past 50 years aren't likely to reoccur, we can gain some wisdom from examining how they came about.\n  \nAuthor's table.First let's look at 1973-74, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 45%. The reasons behind this were many: unrest in the Middle East, a quadrupling of  caused by the  , President Nixon's resignation in the wake of the Watergate scandal, and mind-numbingly big increases (12%-plus) in the price of goods and services, or inflation. Unlike the sudden 36% \"Black Monday\" crash of October 1987, the early '70s bear market was a slow-moving \"mudslide,\" according to legendary investor Ralph Wanger of the Acorn Fund.Double-digit inflation rates that continued into the late '70s and early '80s -- and the efforts to clear the financial logjam left behind -- were largely behind the bear markets of those years. The weight of inflation on U.S. economic activity, or gross domestic product (GDP), eventually prompted then-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to roughly double interest rates in 1980. This dis-inflationary policy, which was meant to (and did) restrict credit to break inflation's back, caused high unemployment and economic recession -- a perfect recipe for a bear-market tumble.Then there was the Great Recession: Between 2007 and 2009, the Dow had its worst showing since the  of the 1930s. (The index closed out 1929 at 300 and kept dropping, ending 1932 at about 60.) Lenders that had relaxed their standards and failed to secure adequate capital to back up their loans found themselves scrambling in 2007, when borrowers defaulted  on their mortgages. Banks were unable to digest the mountains of bad debt that ensued, resulting in a surge in bank failures, a shutdown in lending, and the ensuing bear market that impaled stock prices.As these examples illustrate, bear markets are often caused by declining economic activity stemming from monetary policies. They're particularly likely after an increase in interest rates (generally put in place to tamp down lending and borrowing), so investors ought to pay particular attention when the Federal Reserve is increasing the target of its Federal Funds rate, or the overnight rate banks charge each other to borrow excess reserves.Long-term investing has paid off in the past because stocks have gone on to reach new highs after every bear market. The average bull market -- a rise in stock prices of 20% or more from their prior low -- lasts far longer than the average bear market, and as a result, investors who stay the course have historically been the biggest winners.The S&P 500 has suffered  since 1950, according to Yardeni Research. The average bear market has lasted 1.4 years and lopped an average of 41% off the index, according to First Bank. Those are staggering statistics, but they become less scary when you realize that the average bull market has lasted 9.1 years and generated an average cumulative return of 473%.Because the good times far outweigh the bad, the evidence suggests that it's folly to try to time the market. Instead, it's best to own stocks through thick and thin. That said, there are still things you can do to help you invest better during a bear market.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.To ensure you can weather a bear market, investment allocation is key. That means successful investors will want to take time during  markets to make sure they've got the right balance of stocks, bonds, and cash.One way to gauge whether you're too tilted toward one investment: Subtract your age from 110 years, then invest the resulting figure as a percentage in stocks and the remainder in less risky assets. Why 110? Because that's arguably the longest you're likely to live. For example, a 30-year-old would invest 80% of his or her money in stocks and the rest in bonds, while an 80-year-old would invest 20% of his or her money in stocks and the rest in bonds. If you want a larger proportion of your money in stocks, then consider using 120 years for this calculation instead.This calculation is an easy way to help make sure you're not taking on excessive risk, but it's by no means the only consideration when it comes to allocation. It's also important to consider how easily you could survive a financial blow, such as job loss, without having to sell stocks to cover the shortfall. Everyone's budget is different, but the \"golden rule\" touted by most money pros is that everyone should have between  kicking around to get through any unforeseen setbacks. If you don't have that kind of financial backstop, make sure you include such a cash cushion when rebalancing your assets.It's true that borrowing money from your brokerage in a  allows you to buy more stock, which means you could potentially turn a bigger profit during a bull market. But losses endured in a margin account during a  market can wipe you out. That's because the stocks you own in your portfolio are the collateral for the money you borrow on margin. If the value of those stocks falls below specific levels, then your brokerage can force you to sell your stocks or add more cash to your account to bring you back into compliance.For example, if you have a $50,000 account and you borrow an additional $50,000 on margin, you'd have $100,000 invested in stocks. If those stocks fall 10%, that's a decline of $10,000 -- but that's a  loss on your initial $50,000 investment. You still owe your brokerage firm the $50,000 you borrowed, and you may have to sell stocks in your account or deposit more cash to satisfy that obligation. If your stocks fall far enough, you could lose your entire investment, plus any additional cash you contribute to the account. Therefore, using margin is incredibly dangerous during bear markets.Bear markets also bring a temptation to  . When you sell short, you borrow shares from others and sell them; your hope is to buy them back cheaper later on, return them to the lender, and pocket the difference between the amount you sold them for and the amount you paid to buy them back. This may seem like a good idea during a bear market, but it's fraught with risk. Bear markets can last months or years, and there's no ringing bell to signal when stocks have officially hit their low. And because there's no cap on how high a stock can climb and no guarantee that any stock will fall, the risk to short-sellers is unlimited. Eventually, the shares you borrowed for shorting will have to be returned, and if the market is up significantly in the meantime, you could lose a lot of money.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.There is an upside to bear markets: Many great companies wind up falling to bargain-basement prices, providing investors with the opportunity to add top stocks to their portfolios while they're on sale. is my favorite way to take advantage of discount prices during a bear market. As a refresher, dollar-cost averaging means investing a fixed amount of money at a specific interval (say, every month). In practice, perhaps the most common example of dollar-cost averaging is when employees contribute a fixed portion of their checks every pay period to a workplace retirement plan.The beauty of dollar-cost averaging is that it doesn't require you to time your investments perfectly. Most of us have heard the maxim \"don't catch a falling knife\"; it exists because investors are generally awful at figuring out exactly when a stock has stopped plummeting.Because stocks can fall further than you imagine, it's wise to spread out your risk by staggering the timing of your buys. And because investing a fixed sum at lower prices allows you to buy more shares and thus lower your average cost, dollar-cost averaging may be the best way to build a portfolio that can profit when the next bull market begins.When a bull market gets long in the tooth or a bear market appears on the horizon, it's an excellent time to take stock of the reasons you've chosen to invest in the companies in your portfolio. If you've been keeping an  , you'll have an objective, visual record of your decision-making. But even if not, you'll probably still remember the basic reasoning behind each of your stock purchases.You'll want to make sure the factors that drove you to buy each stock in the first place remain intact. In doing this, it can be very helpful to take a tour of each company's investor relations website. For most businesses, this page is a portal to valuable information, including the company's latest annual report (  ) and quarterly reports (10-Qs). Many companies also provide further resources, including PowerPoint presentations outlining recent performance and future plans, press releases detailing advances and stumbles, and transcripts of investor presentations, all of which can be useful as you determine whether the investment still makes sense to own.There's a risk to this review process, though. If you extrapolate too much into a company's falling stock price or current results during a bear market, you might begin to imagine cracks in the armor of long-term stories that in fact remain intact. For example, selling shares of  during the Great Recession -- say, because of fears over declining demand for airline travel and hotels -- would have kept you from enjoying its subsequent rally, from less than $200 in 2009 to more than $1,700 as of this writing. Similarly, selling  when it changed gears from a CD-by-mail provider of entertainment to a streaming service would have been a big mistake -- Netflix has been one of the best-performing stocks of the past decade. To reduce the risk of selling a long-term winner too soon, keep your analysis at a high level by asking: Is my overarching thesis still true? If so, then stick it out until it isn't.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.When I was growing up, my dad would say, \"Proper planning prevents poor performance.\" He recited that mantra to me  , and I think it applies nicely to the question of how best to invest in stocks during a bear market. Humans are hard-wired to react emotionally to danger -- and that means we're not at our best when making choices during gut-wrenching, teeth-gnashing, claw-bearing markets. Before a bear market hits, we as investors can review our holdings to ensure we still want to own each one. We can plan which stocks to buy if and when they go on sale, and we can re-familiarize ourselves with margin and short-selling to remember why they are generally suboptimal during bear markets. And we can arm ourselves with the historical context behind previous bear markets, which will help us understand how and why they occur and when they might end.All of this is far preferable to the risk of making panicked, poor decisions in the face of an account's falling value. In that sense, planning ahead is the best strategy for successfully investing in a bear market.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Synchrony Financial is a leader in both store credit cards and high-yield online savings accounts, and its business is firing on all cylinders. Loan balances grew by 14% over the past year, and the bank's efficiency and 16% net interest margin would make most financial institutions jealous.In addition, Synchrony investors just got answers to two big lingering questions stemming from the loss of  as a co-branding partner in mid-2018.First, it was just revealed that Sam's Club will continue to be a Synchrony partner. That makes the loss of Walmart a bit more palatable, as it's certainly easier to replace lost revenue from one major partner instead of two. Second, and perhaps more significantly, Walmart agreed to drop the $800 million lawsuit it had filed against Synchrony, which was alleging mismanagement of the co-branded credit card product.As a result of these two developments, and because it's selling its Walmart loan portfolio to  , Synchrony is releasing about $500 million in loss reserves, which can now be used to help grow the business.The best part is that even after the post-news pop, Synchrony trades for just 6.8 times forward earnings, so this highly profitable financial institution is still a compelling bargain.

Hess thinks Bakken production will exceed 135,000 boepd in 2019 and that it could reach 200,000 by 2021. If that happens, it would translate into $1 billion in free cash flow annually for the company beyond 2020, at $60-per-barrel West Texas Intermediate prices.An even bigger opportunity for Hess may exist offshore from Guyana, where it owns 30% of the Stabroek block, a massive field with  of oil equivalent that should enter production in 2020. Production there and in the Bakken has Hess thinking it can grow production by over 10% compounded annually through 2025.The increasing production and cost controls that are expected to lower Hess' breakeven point to $40 per barrel (Brent) has the company forecasting compounded annual cash flow growth of 20% through 2025.Overall, Hess has a shot at seeing its financials improve significantly over the next few years, and given that its shares have tumbled 28% from its peak last October, I'm thinking now's a great time to pick up some shares. Shares of IBM surged after the century-old tech company reported its fourth-quarter results in January. IBM is still dealing with slumping revenue as it invests in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other growth areas. But the stock was and still is priced for disaster, and the company's 2019 guidance shows that IBM is more resilient than the market seems to believe.IBM expects to produce at least $13.90 in adjusted earnings per share in 2019, up from $13.81 in 2018, and around $12 billion of free cash flow. That guidance excludes the impact of  , since the timing of the $34 billion deal set to close in the second half will have a meaningful impact on the company's results. IBM is able to grow earnings and produce solid free cash flow because of its key competitive advantages, including decades-long customer relationships, a broad portfolio of products and services, and a deeply embedded position in certain industries.Shares of IBM trade for less than 10 times the company's earnings guidance, a multiple that bakes in a level of pessimism that just doesn't make any sense. The stock also sports a dividend yield of about 4.7%, and the company plans to keep growing the dividend after it closes on the Red Hat deal.IBM has been a frustrating stock to own over the past few years. But the foundation is in place for the company to exit this era of revenue declines and return to sustainable growth. At less than 10 times earnings, the stock is a steal. Amazon's soaring share price over the past few years has probably kept some investors away from this stellar company. But now that the share price has dropped about 8% over the past three months, a fantastic buying opportunity has opened up for those who've been waiting on the sidelines.Not only are the company's shares trading at somewhat of a discount to the stock's high four months ago, but Amazon's core businesses also continue to fire on all cylinders, and its expansion into new markets, including advertising, could bring the company even more sales growth.Amazon's business has benefited from its dominance in the e-commerce market. Nearly 49% of all online sales in the U.S. are made on the company's platform, and its online dominance continues to grow. Consider that Amazon now has  , and it's estimated that  will have a Prime membership by the end of this year. The significance of Amazon's Prime memberships is best understood when you know that these members spend, on average,  on the company's platform each year than non-Prime members do.But Amazon's opportunities are expanding beyond e-commerce, of course. Amazon has wisely found a new way to turn its retail prowess into an entirely new business by benefiting from ad sales on its platform. Last year, Amazon became the  in the U.S., with 4% of the market. Amazon's share is expected to reach 7% by the end of 2020, and about three years from now the company's advertising sales have the potential to top $22 billion, up from just $4 billion in 2017.Amazon's booming advertising business shows just how well the company can take one success -- a dominant e-commerce platform -- and turn it into another big win. The company has proved over and over again that it can't be boxed into traditional markets, and with Amazon's shares now cheaper than they've been in months, it might be the right time to invest in this massive disrupter. The name \"Booking Holdings\" might not ring a bell, but the odds are good that you know this company's brands. This online travel giant owns a number of leading properties that include Priceline.com, RentalCars.com, Kayak.com, Agoda.com, OpenTable, Booking.com, and more.Booking Holdings has been a  beneficiary of the gradual shift away from travel agents over the past couple of decades.

Here's why.Hotel reservation company Booking Holdings is looking good. Image source: Getty Images.Shares of Booking Holdings are up roughly 25 times in value over the last 10 years, but the  year hasn't been especially kind to long-term holders. Over the past 12 months, Booking Holdings shares have roughly flatlined as investors worried about the company's growth rate.This absence of upwards stock movement, however, has Deutsche thinking now might be a good time to book a few shares at a discount price. Arguing that Booking Holdings stock is worth at least 27% more than it costs today, Deutsche is upgrading Booking Holdings to buy and raising its price target to $2,370.What has Deutsche Bank feeling so confident about Booking Holdings? Best known as a place to score cheap plane tickets back when it was set up as Priceline.com, Booking Holdings' business has leaned ever more in the direction of booking hotel reservations of late -- to the point that in its 10-Qs, \"booking online accommodation reservations\" now receives top billing in the company's description of its business, with Priceline reservations (which also include hotels) only a runner-up.This fact isn't lost on Deutsche, which highlights its assessment that \"room night growth\" accelerated 14% year over year in Q4 2018 -- versus Wall Street's consensus prediction of 12.8% -- in its note covered by  (subscription required). The analyst even predicts further acceleration in Q1 2019 as well, versus Wall Street's expectation of a slowdown -- indicative of the online travel agency industry in general being \"out of favor\" among investors.Now, that lack of favor hasn't done any favors for Booking Holdings shareholders over the past year, but as a result, Deutsche says that the stock is now trading below its average valuation for the past  years. That undervaluation won't last though, argues Deutsche, if Booking can surpass expectations -- as the analyst thinks it will.Citing the company's high asset quality, clean accounting, high quality o  , and strong free cash flow (Booking Holdings generated $5 billion in cash profits over the past year, versus reported earnings of only $2.8 billion, according to data from  ), Deutsche is confident this stock will outperform the broader market.And I have to say -- I'm inclined to agree.Although Booking Holdings still looks a bit pricey when valued on reported profit (its price-to-  -earnings ratio is 31), the stock actually looks remarkably reasonably priced when valued on free cash flow -- just 17.2 times FCF.Currently, consensus estimates have Booking Holdings growing profits at about 16.4% annually -- presumably based on those 12%-ish hotel-booking growth rates mentioned above, goosed by a bit of extra profit margin. But if Deutsche Bank is right and Booking can grow hotel bookings faster than 14%, and earnings even faster than that, then 17.2 times FCF should be a very nice price at which to pick up some shares.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

A  traveler veers sharply from the beaten path, exploring places like Ittoqqortoormiit, Lake Yeak Laom, and the Huacachina Oasis.That's an exaggeration, of course, but unfamiliar names such as those are becoming attractive to a growing number of tourists.

It offered pick up nearly all of the tab for those who booked stays at the Ittoqqortoormiit Guesthouse, in a distant corner of distant Greenland, by the end of last year. It described the facility as the \"world's most [remote] hotel.\"The Expedia unit didn't delve into the reasons for the big increase in distant destinations. It really isn't too surprising, though.The cheaper air tickets of the past few years, and a global economy that continues to rise, have combined to pump up global travel figures. In 2018, the number of international arrivals hit 1.4 billion, 6% over the 2017 figure. That metric has been trending up for almost a decade. We can assume a modest part of that trend comes from repeat travelers who have visited the famous places and are now eager for something fresh and different.The global hospitality sector's revenue was around $1 trillion in 2018, according to researcher IBISWorld. So even if the many Ittoqqortoormiits of this Earth are tiny in size, they still collectively represent a market segment OTAs can draw a stream of revenue from -- especially if they're becoming more popular.Expedia, of course, isn't the only game in town for DIY accommodation in the big OTA segment. Its HomeAway unit boasts around 1.8 million listings. The yin to its yang,  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , has around 5.5 million, according to  .  's (NASDAQ: TRIP) FlipKey and HolidayLettings units combine for just over 1.2 million. And of course there's Airbnb, with over 5 million.The DIY segment has been hot over the past few years, and with a growing travel market, there's no reason the trend shouldn't continue. Just look at HomeAway -- in Expedia's  , the unit grew its gross bookings by 24% year over year, well ahead of the 10% in the company's core online travel booking operations.So perhaps Expedia is pouncing on the remote-travel trend to grab some business at Booking Holdings' expense. As in many industries, first-mover advantage here can earn a nimble-footed OTA a bigger slice of the pie.But I'd have to say that the top beneficiary of the visit-the-far-corners trend should be, despite Expedia's marketing push, the better-stocked  . Still, moving to become identified with this particular segment is a smart strategy for Expedia.Since Expedia, Booking Holdings, and TripAdvisor are active in the DIY space -- to say nothing of Airbnb and a gaggle of smaller competitors -- each can capitalize on the trend. If it persists, we could see a fight for them among OTAs. After all, these destinations are what's left after the constant and endless scrambles for the Venices, Taj Mahals, and Great Pyramids of the world. And there's obviously traveler interest in exploring them.Again, it's early days, so we don't know if this growth is a long-term development or short-term fad. (My money's on the former.) So followers of, and investors in, OTAs should watch if and how it develops, and see what their company is doing to profit from it.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

My Motley Fool colleague Anand Chokkavelu pointed out years ago that the evidence against technical analysis  . He highlighted a 2009 study by Massey University in New Zealand that tested more than 5,000 technical analysis strategies. The study showed that no strategy generated returns that aren't predicted by chance.That data helped to confirm my suspicion that almost all technical analysis chart patterns are useless. However, that doesn't mean that all charts are useless.Here are five charts that I use to find great businesses:Image source: Getty Images.I'm a firm believer that  . One of the first things I look at when I'm researching a stock is how it has performed versus the market over time.My primary yardstick is to compare a stock with the  over the last five years, but I also check how the company has performed since its IPO. If it has walloped the market, then I get interested. If it has lost badly, then I usually write it off.If you want to see what a wonderful long-term chart looks like, consider  (NYSE: MA) . The payment processing giant has thrashed the index over the last five years. Conversely,  , which is a  , has a five-year chart that is about as ugly as it gets.  data by The numbers diverge even more when we start from Mastercard's IPO in 2006. data by This chart shows that Mastercard has done a  job of rewarding long-term shareholders. By contrast, MannKind's total loss of 99% couldn't be much worse.I like to invest in companies that post consistent revenue growth. When a company can do so for years on end, it tells me that the business is successfully riding a long-term trend and that it is not dependent on outside forces for success.Let's compare two well-known stocks to hammer this point home: streaming kingpin  (NASDAQ: NFLX) and energy giant  . Both companies have thumped the market since they went public and have been spectacular long-term investments.However, a look at their annual revenue over the last 15 years tells an interesting story: data by Netflix's revenue consistently moves higher every year. This 15-year time window includes the 2008 recession and the company's  . I find the company's consistent revenue growth to be highly appealing.By contrast, ExxonMobil's revenue fluctuates wildly from year to year. When energy prices are high, the company's revenue soars. When prices fall, its top line tanks.This chart makes one thing clear to me: ExxonMobil is  dependent on an outside force -- the price of oil -- for its success. By contrast, Netflix appears to be in complete control of its top line.This is a big reason why Netflix is a major part of  and ExxonMobil is not.Margins matter. A lot.The best growth companies take advantage of their increasing scale by spreading their fixed costs over a larger base of customers. This helps drive  and can lead to outsized growth on the bottom line.This is why I always look at a company's gross, operating, and profit margins over time. If they are holding steady or increasing, then it is a great sign for investors. If they trend downward, then it suggests that all of the value creation is being captured by the company's customers or suppliers and not by investors.A 10-year chart that compares travel giant  (NASDAQ: BKNG) to solar panel maker  showcases this point beautifully. Both companies are big players in growing markets. Both have far more scale today than they did a decade ago.However, a chart of these companies' margins over time tells an interesting story: data by Booking Holdings has done a  job at using its scale to drive operating leverage. When combined with its huge revenue growth, it is understandable why its stock is up more than 2,300% over the past decade.The opposite is true with First Solar. Its margins have all consistently trended downward. This indicates that the company is being forced to grant pricing concessions in order to win new business. While pursuing that strategy has translated into increased revenue growth, it hasn't benefited investors much. First Solar's stock has actually declined by more than 60% over the last decade.Great businesses create value. Bad businesses destroy value.One way that I check to see whether or not a company is creating value is by looking at its return on equity, return on assets, and return on invested capital over time. If these figures are high, then it is a great indicator that it is creating value as it grows. If the numbers are in the low single digits or negative for extended periods of time, then it is a sign that the business is destroying value and isn't worth investing in.A comparison between the data provider  (NYSE: FDS) and the consumer electronics company  illustrates this point well: data by FactSet does a great job at generating strong returns on capital each and every year. TiVo's return metrics have gone up and down over time, and they are all currently negative.This tells me that when FactSet reinvests into its core business, it creates a lot of shareholder value. TiVo's numbers suggest that it is just a value-destroying machine. is a tool that many growth companies use to reward and retain employees. This is especially true in the fast-moving tech sector, where attracting top-tier engineering and executive talent is crucial.A side effect of issuing a lot of stock-based compensation is that investors are constantly being  . While some dilution is perfectly acceptable, I like to know just how bad it is before I take a position in a stock.Conversely, some highly profitable companies  their stock in huge amounts over time. This can lead to a shrinking share count, which can greatly benefit investors.Take a look at two uber-successful tech companies: software-as-a-service pioneer  and registry services provider  (NASDAQ: VRSN) . Salesforce is well known for being very generous with issuing stock-based compensation. VeriSign has been plowing all of its profits into stock buybacks for years.This has created a huge difference in the dilution rate for these two businesses over time: data by Salesforce shareholders have been diluted by more than 50% over the last decade. Long-term VeriSign shareholders now own a higher percentage of the business than they did a decade ago.It is worth pointing out that high levels of dilution do not automatically disqualify a company from being a good investment. Salesforce's growth has been  over this time period that investors have still made out like bandits even with the huge dilution. However, I still believe that looking at this chart can be highly informative for investors.I don't think that these five charts alone provide enough data for investors to make decisions. That's why they are just a part of the  that I use to judge whether or not a business is worth considering.But I'm very confident that these five charts can be very useful in helping investors to pick better stocks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After its 2016 IPO, the stock surged out of the gate thanks to aggressive bidding tactics from ad partners like  (NASDAQ: EXPE) and  (NASDAQ: BKNG) .However, the stock  as they pulled back from spending and Trivago lapped a benefit  imposed on Booking for violating the terms of its platform. Shares are now down more than 75% from their all-time high in the summer of 2017.Since then, Trivago has reoriented its strategy and cut back and optimized its advertising in order to focus on bottom-line profits. While that strategy has resulted in revenue falling, the fourth quarter was the clearest sign yet that that strategy was delivering the desired results.Image source: Trivago.Revenue fell 8% in the quarter to 166.8 million euros, but that was largely owed to the company's decision to pull back on advertising as selling and marketing expenses declined 30% to 116.7 million euros.  As a result, Trivago's return on advertising spending surged from 118% in the quarter a year ago to 163%, which led to adjusted EBITDA reversing from a loss of 8.7 million euros to a profit of 28.6 million euros. On a per-share basis, i  ed a profit of 0.03 euros, up from a loss of 0.03 euros.Shares whipsawed after the earnings report came out Wednesday morning, opening up 10% but then trading down 5% later in the morning, a sign that investors don't know what to make of the report.Trivago investors may be getting frustrated as revenue continues to fall and the stock languishes, but the company is taking a number of steps in the right direction. Here's what management focused on during the  .Two years ago, Trivago started to expand its hotel-booking platform to include alternative properties like vacation rentals and apartments, partnering with sites like Expedia subsidiaries HomeAway and VRBO. The company ended the fourth quarter with more than 1.5 million \"alternative accommodations\" listings, up from just 250,000 units a year ago. That growth has made Trivago's platform more appealing to users, providing multiple options in one single search, and helped insulate the company from the rise of competition like Airbnb. Growth in that category should continue, as CFO Axel Hefer said the long-term goal is for every listing in the world to be available on Trivago's platform. However, the company needs to gradually improve its algorithms so it can better incorporate apartments and vacation rentals into its search in a meaningful and helpful way.Trivago is based in Germany, and Europe remains its strongest market. American viewers may remember an ad blitz on TV screens from a year or two ago, but revenue in the Americas has fallen as the company has scaled back its advertising spending. In the Americas, revenue declined 18% in the quarter but was down just 4% in Europe, showing that the more mature market is not as sensitive to advertising cutbacks as newer markets like the Americas and the rest of the world.In other words, that strength in Europe, where return on advertising spending jumped from 136% to 202%, should help profitability even if the company faces growth challenges in other parts of the world. CEO Rolf Schroemgens said he was encouraged by the performance in Trivago's home market.In its full-year guidance, Trivago forecast it would return to revenue growth in the second half of 2019 after continued declines in the first half. The company also guided to adjusted EBITDA of 50 million euros to 75 million euros for the year, up from 15.6 million euros in 2018.Hefer noted that the market Trivago competes in, online travel agencies, is seeing fundamental growth and that Trivago should naturally return to revenue growth as it stabilizes and laps the headwind from the recalibration of its advertising spending last year. Hefer also said the company is in a position in which it should be gaining market share in the industry due to its unique comparison platform.While the company believes it is regaining its footing, the online travel market remains brutally competitive, as Booking and Expedia dominate the market, and their spending on bids on Trivago has an outsize influence on its performance. If Trivago can return to solid revenue growth and deliver gains on the bottom line, this could be an appealing entry point for the stock. However, after being burned before, investors are likely to remain skeptical until Trivago makes good on its promise.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This will aid Amazon's momentum across its massive customer base.The latest move of Amazon seems to be a traditional retail strategy of advertising a product.In fact, free product samples are ramping up the company's growing advertisement strategies. Notably, the company is leveraging its vast customer shopping and delivery address data for this purpose.As of now, the company is dropping off sample products which have been purchased several times like consumer staples, dog food, makeup items and toiletries.Notably, the samples are being sent to selected customers currently.The recent strategy of Amazon is similar to targeted ads. Moreover, the company is not likely to stop here. Rather, it is likely to strengthen this strategy and expand the accessibility of free samples to other customers as it is aggressively looking into expansion of its targeted sampling team.Reportedly, the company had posted a job vacancy last year for a senior-level person for the team.However, leveraging customer data might pose serious data privacy challenges to the company. | The latest move is not only going to benefit the company but is also likely to bring social benefits.With free product samples, the company will be able to eliminate the rigidity of the traditional shoppers who still hesitate to opt for online shopping fearing product integrity.The move will enable the customers to test, try, smell, taste and feel the product before its final purchase. Further, Amazon has kept the strategy shopper friendly as there is no obligation to purchase product after receiving its sample.Further, the sampling initiative will also help the sellers and brands to improve their sales growth by expanding their customer reach, in turn aiding growth.All these benefits are likely to expand the company's customer and seller base.

In the first nine months of 2018, the company's revenues grew 3% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $1.3 billion. In addition, the company's adjusted EBITDA grew 25% during this period, largely due to increased investments, notably to enhance technological capabilities in order to improve customer engagement.TripAdvisor has experienced a more than 50% surge in its stock price in 2018. We have maintained our  , which is almost 15% ahead of the current market price. In our interactive dashboard  we detail a scenario in which the company could reach $2 billion in revenues by fiscal 2020. Below we detail this scenario further. TripAdvisor has two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. The Hotel segment accounts for almost 80% of the company's revenues. The company's revenues declined moderately in its core hotel-booking segment, even as profitability spiked in the division in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. However, the company's management expects that the hotel business will return to growth in Q4 following several consecutive quarters of declines, largely on the back of its lower cost base and more restrained spending. Overall, we expect TripAdvisor's Hotel revenues to decline for full-year fiscal 2018. However, the segment's revenues should rebound over the long run as the company is focusing on three major areas - brand advertising, product experience, and marketing mix. Going forward, we forecast the Hotel segment to generate about $1.2 billion in revenues in 2019 and a 2% y-o-y increase thereafter in revenues in fiscal 2020 - from Click-Based and Transaction revenues, Display-Based Advertising and Subscription revenue, and Other Hotel revenues. The company has witnessed increased visitors (or hotel shoppers) on its primary website over recent years, where direct suppliers and Online Travel Agencies (OTA) place their advertisements.Our bull case for a $2 billion revenue growth in fiscal 2020 assumes that TripAdvisor's unique visitors could reach $2.2 billion, from an estimated 1.9 billion. We have assumed the company's Display-based advertising and other revenues to remain constant in this scenario. Further, we have also assumed that the revenue per hotel shopper to remain at $0.40, instead of an estimated $0.39 in fiscal 2020.TripAdvisor's Non-Hotel segment is broken down into Experiences, Restaurants, and Rentals. In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the segment's revenue jumped 25% to $350 million. The segment has been profitable, but is still substantially in growth mode as management focuses on adding to its portfolio of bookable products in hopes of capturing a dominant position in this high-growth market. We have estimated TripAdvisor's Non-Hotel Revenues to grow to $660 million in 2020, up from an estimated $620 million, in order for the company to reach $2 billion in total revenues. This can be achieved if the company continues to capitalize on the significant supply and demand advantages in the Non-Hotel offerings and remains focused on driving market share gains in the segment. It should also be noted that TripAdvisor plans to globally expand its platform by using Viator's tech base to support multiple languages and points of sale. Overall the company's investments in long-term core growth initiatives should drive solid growth in TripAdvisor's revenues going forward.What's behind Trefis?

Since falling below $5 per share in the middle of 2015, GRPN stock has rarely traded above that level, as its revenue growth has stagnated.However, despite its numerous flaws, GRPN appears to have placed itself on the path to profit growth. That change, along with the depressed stock price, have made the valuation of Groupon stock low. Although the nature of Groupon's business makes GRPN a risky play, profit growth could finally break it out of its range.To be sure, one can see why the price of GRPN is so low. From a fundamental perspective, Groupon sells a commoditized product: product and service discounts. Its competitive moat consists of the \"Groupon\" brand. In theory, anyone can enter this business, and many have.That point alone has pushed many away from GRPN stock. In his passionate case against GRPN stock, my colleague, Josh Enomoto, referred to this equity as a \"  .\" He makes a tough but fair case against GRPN. Aside from the company's thin competitive moat to which I alluded, Enomoto cited the company's declining revenue. He also mentioned its attempts to enter other businesses, which in his view makes Groupon a \"confused brand.\"I see much truth in what he says. Due to these risks, I do not think GRPN stock is worth its $20-per- share IPO price today, nor was it at the time of its IPO in 2011.However, this is 2019, and Groupon stock trades at around $3.50 per share. I think that changes the dynamic. Thanks to its depressed stock price and its earnings, GRPN trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 14.7. Granted, that might not mean a lot if its profits drop going forward. However, Wall Street forecasts that Groupon's earnings will increase by double-digit percentage levels in both 2020 and 2021.While these numbers build a contrarian case for Groupon, investors need to remember that GRPN stock remains speculative. I do not recommend that investors make GRPN stock a significant part of their retirement portfolios.However, traders do not become rich from buying  (NASDAQ:  ); they build their wealth by purchasing the  Amazon. I'm not suggesting that GRPN stock will reach Amazon's $800-plus billion market cap. Still, Amazon's rise indicates that investors should speculate to a certain extent.Also, investors should keep Groupon's weaknesses in perspective. For instance, the fact that Groupon is profitable indicates that GRPN stock will probably not tumble like the shares of  (NYSE:  ). Additionally, none of Groupon's numerous competitors has matched its success. The one company that came close, Living Social, is now owned by Groupon.GRPN also reminds me of an experience I had with a stock called Priceline. Many years ago, I bought Priceline for just over $3 per share. I later sold it in the $8 per-share-range, happy about my \"huge profit.\" Today, Priceline goes by the name  (NASDAQ:  ) and trades for about $1,650 per share.I'm not promising that GRPN stock will reach the same levels in the next 10 or 15 years. Nor do I want to beat myself up for selling Priceline way too early. All I am doing is making an argument for buying speculative stocks, whether it's GRPN stock or other penny stocks with potential.GRPN stock could at least potentially be profitably traded. It reached as high as $5.65 per share in the last year and traded for over $8 per share in 2015. GRPN can be profitable for investors simply by returning to those levels. It can generate a much larger profit if it can break out of its ranges of the last few years.Despite Groupon's weak competitive position and the current lack of direction of GRPN stock, a case can be made for speculating on GRPN stock. GRPN has stagnated for years, and, in light of Groupon's business model that others could easily copy, one can easily see why Groupon stock has gained little traction.However, given Groupon's rising profits and low valuation, conditions that can push GRPN higher have begun to appear. Furthermore, GRPN could deliver outsized returns in the long run, particularly if it can maintain double-digit profit growth and become more focused.Indeed, if Groupon's profits keep growing and its focus becomes clearer, GRPN stock could become the company's best discount yet.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The potential to become wealthy often means investing in an enterprise when it is small and waiting for the entity to grow large.

Considering the Trump administration's commitment to increase defense spending, Arotech could find itself well-positioned to benefit.However, like all hot penny stocks, this play remains speculative. Its revenues for 2017 stood at $98.72 million. Its 2014 revenues were $103.57 million, so this company has struggled with growth. Arotech was founded in 1990, and one of its divisions came into existence in 1971. Hence, the build to these revenues has been slow.The company earned a profit of 17 cents per share in 2017. Still, profits are expected to grow to 18 cents per share in 2018 and 26 cents per share in 2019. This could indicate this company may enjoy some growth.

The oil price slump of 2014-2016 hit its interests hard. By 2016, MCEP had become a penny stock, trading as low as 73 cents per share at one point. The stock has struggled to gain traction since then, briefly reaching $1.75, and now trades just above a dollar.However, company financials may have begun a turnaround. Revenue fell from $96.91 million in 2014 to $56.1 million by 2016. Although revenues rose to $58.93 million in 2017, analysts estimate revenues will remain below $60 million for both 2018 and 2019.Whether those estimates factor in higher crude prices remains unclear. And at these levels, investors should still consider MCEP stock speculative. However, the stock remained consistently above $20 per share while oil traded above $100 per barrel.

The company has brought in over $6 million in the first three quarters of 2018.Still, investors should still treat this as a speculative play. The stock enjoys rapidly rising revenues and profits. However, MCIG stock still trades under 25 cents per share, indicating lingering investor doubts. It has never traded above $1, though it briefly reached 92 cents per share in 2014.

That's an ambitious target, as the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah says the number of international pilgrims has tripled in the last decade and is tracking toward 15 million by 2020.Those growth rates illustrate the boom in international tourism in recent years, and all indications are that the numbers will continue to rise. For the online travel industry, where  , that's great news for the long haul.Hajj and Umrah refer to pilgrimages in the Islamic faith. Umrah can be done at any time, is not compulsory, and is considered a minor pilgrimage. Hajj only can be undertaken at certain times of the year and is a mandatory journey for each individual in the Muslim faith at least once in their lifetime -- given they are physically and  able to do so.The trip takes pilgrims to the holy cities of Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah, and the journey can get congested. Saudi Arabia has been building infrastructure to accommodate the growing number of visitors, like a new high-speed train connecting Mecca and Medina.It also can get expensive quickly. On the website DawnTravels.com, all-inclusive 2019 Hajj travel packages start at $6,000 per person. That's where Booking comes in.The company's Singapore-based subsidiary Agoda signed the agreement with Saudi Arabia to \"use technology to manage the anticipated increase in guests to the Kingdom and make accommodation reservations more accessible, easier, faster and secure.\" With the goal to more than double the number of pilgrims to the country in little more than a decade, Booking's technology will no doubt be useful in managing all of that extra traffic and alleviating some of the overcrowding that occurs during Hajj.As the global leader in accommodations booking and online travel management, Booking's newly inked deal won't move the needle by itself. Gross travel bookings (the value of all travel services reserved) were $24.3 billion during the third quarter of 2018 alone. However, the agreement with Saudi Arabia underscores a fact that Bookings' management often speaks extensively about: Tourism is on the rise as wealth around the globe increases.According to the World Bank, the number of tourists traveling outside their home countries was 1.25 billion as of 2016, up nearly 50% from 2006. International travel was worth $1.4 trillion that year. Europe and North America have long been the biggest benefactors, but the developing Middle East, Asia, and Africa have begun to pick up millions more visitors in recent years, as well.Image source: Getty Images.Expectations for global growth have eased in recent months, most notably at global economic researcher International Monetary Fund (IMF), which downgraded its outlook for global gross domestic product (GDP) growth by 0.2% in 2019, to 3.7%. Nevertheless, the IMF expects global growth to chug along in the low single digits for years to come. That's meaningful to travel companies like Booking because rising wealth overseas means more travel.During the  , CEO Glenn Fogel said: \"[T]ravel is a function of GDP. World GDP goes up, travel will grow faster, and I am highly confident that world GDP is going to continue to go up in the long run.\"Paired with the continued migration of existing travelers to online travel and accommodations management, Fogel's outlook is an important factor for investors to consider. Saudi Arabia's preparation for a big influx of visitors in the years ahead is a piece of evidence supporting the idea that the travel industry is a long-term growth story.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the March 2019 put at the $1635 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $108.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.6% return against the $1635 commitment, or a 30.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to BKNG's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $1635 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Booking Holdings Inc sees its shares fall 0.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $1526.40 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $108.60 from $1635), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 30.7% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Booking Holdings Inc, and highlighting in green where the $1635 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the March 2019 put at the $1635 strike for the 30.7% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Booking Holdings Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $1643.58) to be 25%.

We are now drawing to the end of 2018. And that can only mean one thing: it's time to think about 2019. Chances are high that the volatility plaguing the markets in 2018 isn't going anywhere next year. With that in mind, you need to be extra careful about how you re-balance your portfolio for the new year. Luckily Goldman Sachs is here to help. It recently released a report of exactly the kind of stocks you want to be thinking about right now.These are 'high quality' stocks specially selected by the firm. And by 'high-quality' Goldman Sachs means stocks that meet the following 5 factors: strong balance sheets, stable sales growth, low deviation in operating income, low stock drawdown risk, and return-on-equity that exceeds peers. In other words these stocks are the best-positioned to 1) withstand an economic slowdown; and 2) diminishing equity returns. That sounds good to me!On top of that I used  ' stock data to find out what other top analysts have to say on these stocks.That way I can highlight stocks with the most bullish Street consensus from Goldman Sachs' list.Let's take a closer look at these top stock picks for 2019 now:I'm with Goldman Sachs on this one. Blue chip telecoms giant  (NASDAQ:  ) is a worthy 2019 stock pick. CMCSA stock has an extremely stable portfolio and growing free cash flow.Not only is its credit high-quality, but its dividend is 'sacrosanct', and it repurchases shares when it's not deleveraging from strategic M&A.\"CMCSA is arguably more a safety stock than a growth stock. While its valuation is modest we'd argue so is its risk\" writes RBC Capital's Steven Cahall (  ).He has just ramped up his price target to $45, citing the recent $15 billion deal for Sky. From current levels this means we are looking at upside potential of 19%.\"Excuse Me While I Kiss the Sky\" Cahall calls his report, adding \"We see the strategic merits of Sky being better appreciated in time.\"True CMCSA paid a hefty multiple, but Cahall sees long-term strategic benefits from Sky, ranging from a bigger subscriber base for emerging tech investments to savings on content acquisition and accelerated advanced advertising.This 'Strong Buy' stock scores 15 buy ratings vs 3 hold ratings. Its $44 average analyst price target suggests 16% upside potential. Interested in CMCSA stock? This financial stock continues to outperform. Year-to-date,  (NYSE:  ) shares have surged over 19%.And looking forward to 2019, I see no reason why Visa's outperformance can't continue.Indeed, top-rated Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Joseph Foresi (  ) has just reiterated his V Buy rating. This comes with a bullish $160 price target - 18% upside potential.\"Strong growth continues\" cheers Foresi, before writing: \"We remain attracted to Visa's dominant position in the global card network market and to its strong, recognizable international brand.\"Notably, Foresi highlighted Visa's opportunity to capitalize on the global conversion of cash into credit, international opportunities, and digital payment tailwinds.Meanwhile Visa Direct, contactless payments, and B2B all have the potential to drive share prices higher.Out of 18 analysts polled on this 'Strong Buy' stock, 17 are bullish. This is with a $167 average analyst price target. Tech stocks may be going through a rough patch, but here's one mega cap Goldman Sachs thinks is still worth buying for 2019.Trading at ~11x 2019 EV/EBITDA,  (NASDAQ:  ) valuation looks compelling, says Brent Thill (  ) of Jefferies. He picks GOOGL as his Franchise Pick i.e. a high conviction stock. This is with a juicy $1,450 price target (37% upside potential).So what justifies this bullish call?\"The Internet Team remains bullish on Alphabet due to continued expected mobile search growth and a positive stance on YouTube\" explains Thill.Online video is lining up as the biggest online ad growth driver - with GOOGL's YouTube capable of driving meaningful upside by stealing ad budgets away from television.Meanwhile, \"mobile search has been the number one driver of revenue growth for the past several quarters and the team sees continued opportunity given the ubiquity of smartphones and the important location and contextual signals from mobile devices\" writes Thill.Plus, Alphabet also boasts its fast-growing Google Cloud, and a strong leadership position in both AI and autonomous vehicles. Its Waymo vehicles have driven many millions of miles on public roads more than peers.Taking a step back, we can see that out of 31 analysts polled recently, 28 are bullish on the stock. This is with a $1,346 average price target (28% upside potential).  (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts in the US, with over 5,000 stores. Already, year-to-date, shares are exploding by over 45%. And the stock has a long growth runway ahead.Alongside Goldman Sachs, RBC Capital's Scot Ciccarelli (  ) is also a big fan of the stock.\"O'Reilly is a net market share gainer in an attractive industry,\" says the analyst. And he sees four key reasons why ORLY is set to outperform. Namely: 1) strong pricing power, 2) little threat from e-commerce because the parts are too complex, 3) increasing number and age of vehicles and 4) a highly fragmented industry.Further, steady ORLY stock performance suggests that the company is feeling little effect from price transparency/ e-commerce competition.\"Given the company's highly consistent top/ bottom line growth we remain buyers of ORLY,\" sums up Ciccarelli. He sees shares surging 10% to hit $389.Now if we look at all analysts, the consensus is a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy. However, if we shift to only the Street's best-performing analysts, then the consensus also upgrades to Strong Buy. This is with a $380 average analyst price target (8% upside potential). If you're planning a holiday right now, chances are you'll turn to  (NASDAQ:  ). From a small Dutch startup, BKNG is now one of the world's largest travel e-commerce companies. It holds Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com, Cheapflights, OpenTable and more.From a Street perspective, what stands out is a recent upgrade from Wells Fargo's Robert Coolbrith (  ). Analysts usually reiterate their stock ratings - so when a stock is upgraded to Buy that definitely tells us something.Plus Coolbrith simultaneously ramped up his price target from $2,150 to $2,200. From current levels, this means we are now looking at upside of close to 18%.In this case Coolbrith cites the company's Q3 performance and Q4 guide as well as management's 2019 long-term strategy. This breaks down to: 1) platform investment, 2) above-market top-line growth and 3) a close focus on EBITDA dollar growth.And crucially, even though shares are over $1,800, Coolbrith sees an appealing entry point right now. Shares are currently trading down over 5% in the last three months. \"We note that shares remain significantly below historical valuation averages - BKNG's current NTM EV/EBITDA is 12% below its 3-year median.\"Overall, BKNG stock earns a Moderate Buy analyst consensus. This comes with a $2,242 average price target - which means 23% upside potential lies ahead.  Source: ShutterstockWhen trading is rough, defensive stocks tend to do well. And bargain retail store  (NASDAQ:  ) is a perfect example of a defensive stock. Everything in the store sells for $1 or less.On October 16, the NY Post reported that Carl Icahn is accumulating a stake in Dollar Tree. Apparently, we are looking at a 'significant' stake. On the news, DLTR stock jumped 6.8%. Icahn is an activist investor, known for pushing for changes at the company leadership level.Five-star Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh (  ) has an Outperform rating on the discount giant. He writes: \"We continue to see meaningful optionality with the DLTR story from either an improving fundamental longer-term outlook or optionality with the Family Dollar asset.\"Encouragingly, he believes the stock is trading at attractive levels. This is in part down to the market undervaluing American variety store chain Family Dollar.\"At a low $80s stock price, the implied Family Dollar valuation is just a low single-digit EBITDA multiple\" points out Parikh. And as for Icahn joining the team, he gives this reaction: \"We await more details on Icahn's stake and the proposed actions that could potentially unlock shareholder value from here.\"With a Moderate Buy consensus, the stock's $94.18 average analyst price target works out at 15% upside potential from current levels.  (NASDAQ:  ) has a dominant position in neuroscience. The company has a leading portfolio of medicines to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as the only FDA-approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).To top it off, Biogen also boasts an extensive pipeline of new medicines in development. This includes Aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease. It is estimated that over 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide.The memory loss and functional decline of Alzheimer's disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. Aducanumab is an antibody that binds to and may reduce amyloid plaques from the brain, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.\"We believe Biogen shares are undervalued based on our view that the company's leadership position in neuroscience should deliver long-term growth. A business supporting high-risk, high reward studies puts BIIB in the lead to develop a potentially disease-modifying AD drug,\" states Oppenheimer's Jay Olson (  ).He has a buy rating on the stock with a $380 price target. According to Olson, BIIB has achieved a critical mass in neuroscience that enables high-risk programs with sufficient cash flow to embark on high-risk programs.Overall this 'Moderate Buy' stock has scored 8 buy ratings vs 3 hold ratings in the last three months. Meanwhile the $391 average analyst price target works out at over 20% upside potential. Goldman Sachs has just upgraded software stock  (NASDAQ:  ) from Hold to Buy. The firm's James Schneider (  ) also raised his price target for the shares to $84 from $81. He now predicts shares have 20% upside ahead.Improving revenue growth brings prospects for a stock \"re-rating,\" Schneider told investors. Plus a rebound in the company's Financial Services vertical should drive improved revenue growth in the near term.This bullish analysis is echoed by other analysts. For example, Loop Capital's Joseph Vafi has a Street-high $94 price target on shares (35% upside potential). Following the company's upbeat analyst day, Vafi is even more confident in the company's unique offer of a \"full spectrum of services demanded by Fortune 500 CIOs\".CTSH has now \"successfully pivoted its business to the most leading-edge service capabilities,\" and the bear case should be \"put to bed\", especially given the forecast of improving margins in 2019.Meanwhile valuation provides a positive risk/reward opportunity, with a roughly 60% multiple discount to Accenture's PE in 2019, despite similar aggregate growth rates and higher margins. Owner of the discount TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods stores and others,  (NYSE:  ) is a leading off-price retailer of home and fashion goods. Basically, if you're looking for a bargain, TJX could be for you.\"Off-price remains one of our favored industries given its positive traffic, market share gains, and strong cash flow generation,\" gushes five-star Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul (  ). And TJX is one of his top stock picks in this space.\"Despite expense headwinds, TJX continues to report enviable comps, one of the highest across retail landscape, fueled by traffic increases and share gains\" the analyst writes. He now sees TJX delivering an impressive $50B revenues over the next five years.Plus, TJX is a great stock for shareholders. This is thanks to its 1.7% dividend payout - a dividend which has now recorded 21 years of consecutive growth.\"Beyond the share gains and stable EPS growth, we believe with the increased dividend and the buyback program, TJX once again underlines FCF generating ability of the business model,\" writes Drbul. He expects TJX to generate $2.5B of FCF and combined with $1B of repatriated cash, return all of it to shareholders with dividends and buybacks.From top analysts, the stock scores a 'Strong Buy' consensus. This is with a $56 average analyst price target so we are looking at 24% upside ahead. Last but not least, comes a stock I only discovered recently, index provider  (NYSE:  ).MSCI is a global provider of equity, fixed income, hedge fund stock market indexes and multi-asset portfolio analysis tools. It publishes the MSCI BRIC, MSCI World and MSCI EAFE Indexes.\"We continue to view the index business as a key catalyst that should produce solid top-line results (in the upper-single-to-low double digits)\" is how Cantor Fitzgerald's Joseph Foresi (  ) describes the stock's outlook.The company is experiencing strong growth in its index business while margins are also expanding.Foresi sums up as follows: \"We expect shareholders to benefit over the long term from growth in indexing, recent investments/reorganization, margin expansion, and capital allocation.\"This Top 50 analyst has a bullish $182 price target on the stock - 20% upside potential.

Shares have lost about 4.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Booking Holdings due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Booking Holdings reported third-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $37.78 per share, which increased 7.3% from the year-ago quarter and 82.8% on a sequential basis. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.37 per share slightly.Revenues of $4.849 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.822 billion. The figure also surged 9.4% sequentially and 37.1% from the prior-year quarter.The strong performance of agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses of the company drove the top line. Further, the company witnessed robust growth in room nights which aided its gross booking during the reported quarter. This also contributed well to the revenue generation.Although the company witnessed sluggish performance of rental car days, its airline tickets unit reflected year over year improvement, which drove the results further.We believe secular growth trend in the online travel booking market along with the growing usage of mobile by the travelers for their travel planning are major positives.Given this, the company's strong position in the international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, solid momentum across the global accommodation space and proper execution of its marketing strategies will continue to drive its business growth in the near term as well as in the long haul.Booking Holdings generates bulk of its revenues from the international markets, wherein the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 21.6/73% in the third quarter (last reported quarter's split was 20/73%).Merchant revenues came in $1.049 billion, up 47.9% sequentially and 53.4% year over year. This was driven by the company's continued efforts toward ramping up of merchant business.Further, Agency revenues were $3.541 billion, increased 37.9% sequentially and 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising & Other revenues were $258.5 million, down 0.9% sequentially but up 14.4% from on a year-over-year basis. These are basically non-inter company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable. Further, contributions from the buyout of Momondo aided year-over-year growth.Further, Booking Holdings witnessed a solid momentum in room nights bookings. During the third quarter, the total room nights booked was 201.3 million which exhibited year-over-year growth of 13.4%. This was driven by strong performance of the company's direct channel.Booking Holdings' overall bookings came in $24.3 billion were up 11.5% (14% in constant currency) from the year-ago quarter. This year-over-year growth also comfortably surpassed management's guided range.Merchant bookings were up 65.7% from the prior-year quarter and agency bookings increased 2.3% from the year-ago level.Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $2.4 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.Per the company, operating income was $2.2 billion, up 6.9% year over year. However, operating margin of 46.3% contracted 110 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.As of Sep 30, 2018, cash and short-term investments balance was $7.1 billion compared with $7.3 billion as of Jun 30, 2018.At the end of the third quarter, Booking Holdings had $8.7 billion of long-term debt.During the third quarter, Booking Holdings generated $2 billion of cash from operations compared to $1.6 billion in the second quarter.Further, the company generated free cash flow of $1.8 billion during the reported quarter.For the fourth quarter of 2018, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 9-12% and total gross bookings to increase 6-9% year over year (10-13% on a constant-currency basis).The company anticipates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.19 million to $1.22 million.Pro-forma EPS is expected in the range of $18.90-$19.40.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.Currently, Booking Holdings has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Booking Holdings has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Meanwhile, the flight coupons which include $100 and $200 discount coupons are valid for travel in the United States from Dec 13, 2018 and Jun 30, 2019.These coupons can be availed only by Expedia's mobile app users. We believe the deep discounts will bolster the download rate of its app which in turn will increase the traffic on its platform.With the recent initiative, the company intends to deliver a cost-friendly travel experience to its customers during this holiday season, consequently enriching their vacation.This in turn will help Expedia in gaining momentum among the travelers by providing year-end savings on their travel costs.Further, the latest move of the company bodes well for its strengthening holiday strategies. Consequently, these factors will help Expedia in attracting more customers to its platform which is likely to boost its gross bookings and drive top-line growth during this holiday season. | Reportedly, the global travel industry is projected to witness growth of 12% over a period of 2017 to 2023.Further, a report from Technavio, the worldwide online travel booking platform market is expected to witness a CAGR of 11% between 2018 and 2022.The immense growth potential in both the travel space as well as in the online travel booking market is luring enough to attract other players like Booking Holdings  and TripAdvisor  , intensifying the competition further.However, Expedia is likely to gain competitive edge over these two companies with its latest holiday initiative by offering high-value coupons to travelers.Notably, both the companies have not made any significant advances to boost their holiday sales.Currently, Expedia carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the retail-wholesale sector can consider a better-ranked stock like Stamps.com  , which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth rate for Stamps.com is currently pegged at 15%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

While those explosive gains are great, they often come at price: paying a premium valuation. But, with the recent market pullback, investors might have an intriguing opportunity to pick up some top growth stocks at cheaper prices. Three Motley Fool contributors have uncovered three intriguing stocks:  (NASDAQ: CTRL) ,  . (NASDAQ: KELYA) , and  . (NASDAQ: BKNG) . If you're done shopping for gifts over the holidays, and have kept an eye on the broader market decline, you have an opportunity to shop for some discounted stocks! The market pullback has given investors a chance to grab shares of once-overvalued stocks: Control4 is a perfect example. For those who haven't heard of Control4, it's a leading global provider of professionally installed systems for homes and businesses that connect up to hundreds of smart devices to work within a single system solution -- these are expensive systems that can cost up to tens of thousands of dollars.Image source: Getty Images.Over the past three months, Control4 shares have plunged roughly 50%, bringing its once lofty valuation down to a 24 times price-to-earnings ratio and a consensus forward price-to-earnings ratio of just under 11 times. With those results, you'd think its business is torpedoing, but that couldn't be further from the truth. In early November, the company reported record revenue for the third quarter, with revenue increasing 11% compared to the prior year. Its adjusted earnings per share checked in at $0.38 per share, which was higher than the prior year's result and higher than analysts' estimates. Pessimism came from management moving its full-year 2018 revenue guidance down to a range of $272 million and $274 million, from prior guidance between $273 million and $276 million. It seemed like a classic overreaction, in my opinion, and don't forget its stock is susceptible to large swings,  and  , around quarterly earnings.While the slight revenue guidance pessimism isn't ideal, there is immense room for growth, and the company is making smart moves to grow its brand awareness and sales leads, both of which could send revenue surging. Management has launched Control4 Certified Showrooms as a destination for homeowners to see how much they can benefit from its automation systems and solutions, and essentially \"wow\" consumers in an attempt to drive stronger sales leads. Further, management estimates it has only penetrated 1.6% of its U.S. market, with the international opportunity remaining even larger.As the number of smart devices in our homes and businesses continue to multiply in number and complexity, Control4 is poised for strong growth. The faster its Certified Showrooms and other brand-awareness initiatives gain traction, the faster its recent stock decline will reverse. Lost in all the worry about  and all the hubbub about an  is the simple fact that the underlying economy is doing reasonably well. The unemployment rate remains below 4%, and the overall economy is growing at around a 3.5% pace. Indeed, there's reason to believe the low unemployment rate may very well be one of the limiting factors preventing the economy from growing even faster.In an economy like that, it can be a great time to be in a business where employees  your product. After all, when it's hard to find workers, those available through staffing firms like Kelly Services can often command a premium. In business since the 1940s, with over $5 billion in revenue, Kelly Services certainly knows how to place people with companies that need their services.Thanks to the current state of the economy, Kelly Services is expected to be able to grow its earnings at a strong 15% clip over the next five or so years. Still, what makes it compelling to consider buying right now is the fact that, like much of the market, its shares have been knocked down in recent months. That knockdown has made its shares so cheap that, despite its expected growth, its stock is available for a mere 8.3 times the company's anticipated earnings.It's rare to find a company with that kind of expected growth trading at that low a multiple. When it's available, it's certainly worth considering an investment. As wealth around the globe increases, people are traveling more. As incomes rise, local communities are getting high-quality internet access for the first time. Those two tailwinds have been a boon for the online travel industry, and Booking Holdings (formerly Priceline Group) is the undisputed leader. In spite of the sprawling size of its operations -- the company currently carries a market cap of $79 billion -- it has still found a way to consistently grow its sales at a double-digit clip.Take 2018, for example. There have been lots of new entrants to the digital booking industry, and a handful of them have even grown to rival the size of some of Booking's subsidiaries. Some of these upstarts like  are changing the way many people travel via things like ride-sharing and the ability to easily rent out private residences. Competition is also coming from other tech companies, like  (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and its expansion of search and booking tools like Google Flights.Nevertheless, Booking has still found a way to pace its competition. Through  , the company grew the value of gross travel bookings by 16% over 2017. That has led to 14% growth in revenue and 19% in earnings per share. Never prone to keep the foot off the gas, management  early in the year, made a strategic investment in China's biggest ride-sharing company,  , and recently bought Asia Pacific-focused hotel search tool HotelsCombined -- setting up more ways it can connect its customers to travel accommodations and services.In spite of the success it's experienced this year, Booking's stock is down 2% year to date and down over 25% from all-time highs it reached in the spring months. With price to free cash flow (money left over after operations and capital expenditures are paid for) sitting at a lowly 16.6 as of this writing, now looks like a good time to add some Booking Holdings stock to your portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This marketing category focuses on funneling traffic to the company's travel properties through paid channels, including online search engines, travel research services, and affiliate marketing. Booking Holdings allocates more resources to performance marketing than any other expenditure on its ledger -- even compensation expense.In fact, through the first nine months of 2018, performance marketing has equaled exactly 50% of the company's $7.12 billion in total operating expense.Data source: Booking Holdings. Chart by author. All dollar amounts in thousands. G&A = General and administrative expenses. Dep. & Amort. = Depreciation and amortization. IT = Information technology.Performance marketing drives the business forward and provides for Booking Holding's ample profits and cash flow. And it offers flexibility as well: The organization can choose in any given quarter to prop up revenue growth with bulk marketing purchases, though this \"volume\" approach to revenue hurts  .In practice, the company maintains an opportunistic attitude toward this expense. During management's  , CFO David Goulden explained that Booking Holdings is always testing  within paid channels in real time to understand where it can obtain a high return on investment (ROI). Both Goulden and CEO Glenn Fogel observed that at various points during the third quarter, opportunities arose to spend more in certain paid channels, resulting in the double-digit growth in room nights booked.The snag in this opportunistic, data-driven ROI methodology is the unpredictable nature of paid channels. It's hard to peg in advance at what point, for which reason, and through which venues the ROI from paid marketing will rise. Consumers' search habits change frequently, as do search engine algorithms,  results, and the efficacy of affiliate websites.Booking's executives like to refer to paid channels as \"dynamic,\" and I think this is a great way to describe the lucrative yet fleeting nature of the returns tied to performance-based spending.Image source: Getty Images.For this reason, management is a bit wary of its greatest income generator. The company vows to continue to pour resources into performance marketing while attempting to optimize profitability; a sensible path given the spend's significant support of the top line. But management is also extremely attuned to driving a yield from Booking's second major marketing expenditure: brand marketing.In contrast to performance spends, brand marketing totaled just $385.3 million during the last nine months, or roughly 5% of the company's operating costs. Brand marketing is the primary tool for creating direct business, i.e., business that doesn't come through a paid channel.As its name suggests, brand marketing fuels the company's brand recognition, resulting in direct visits to and bookings on the organization's online properties (versus bookings completed when visitors arrive via a performance channel ad on a third-party site).In the past few quarters, direct business has resulted in more than half of the company's new customer growth. While it's impossible to trace all of this to the brand marketing spend, improving the mindshare of Booking's major brands, including Booking.com, Priceline.com, OpenTable, Kayak, and Agoda.com, has become a very evident priority for management.Booking Holdings also wants to increase customer loyalty, as repeat users furnish a sustainable source of direct traffic. While a first-time customer may book a service as the result of either a performance or direct marketing effort, management has often emphasized ease and efficiency of the online experience to entice the customer to return. A hassle-free service that anticipates the traveler's requirements while offering value-added options is key to turning the trial user into a loyal customer who will arrive through direct channels on future visits.Looking forward to next year, the organization is leaning toward increasing brand marketing in digital channels, which offers a more concrete way to measure results, versus, say, TV advertising. This appeals to the company's native data-oriented  approach to business decisions. Booking Holdings is also planning to allocate more brand marketing to mobile traffic, from which it derives more than 50% of its bookings.A higher percentage of direct business will, of course, improve margins over time. As Fogel said at the end of the second quarter, \"[O]ne can always buy more growth, and it depends on what cost.\" Shareholders interested in tracking Booking's shift to quality growth can monitor an expected increase in brand marketing as a percentage of total sales (relative to performance marketing) over the next several quarters.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

The stock is up 13% year-to-date as of this writing and is only off its all-time highs by roughly the same percentage, but earnings have soared 25% over the last trailing 12-month stretch.The downturn looks like it could be ending, though, especially after a bounce following its  . Travel industry competition is fierce and is rapidly changing, but Booking Holdings is still on top.The third quarter, the busiest period of the year as it encompasses the summer vacation months, was much better than expected -- or at least  a few months ago. CFO David Goulden said that was because peak summer travel came after the second-quarter report, and accommodation booking accelerated after the last update.Revenue was up 11%, and earnings up 8% from the year prior. A one-time tax charge and generally higher taxes compared with 2017 were blamed for the lower earnings increase. Gross travel bookings were up a solid 12%, though, an impressive feat given that the online travel company has a market cap of $95 billion. Gross travel bookings are expected to climb another 6% to 9% in the fourth quarter.However, as always, three months does not make or break a business, so adding the third quarter to the rest of the year paints a much more accurate picture of how well Booking is doing.\n  \nData source: Booking Holdings quarterly earnings. YOY = year over year.Booking's results are even more impressive considering all of the smaller competitors gunning for it. First, there's Airbnb and its five million unique places to stay available on its site -- a number that rivals the 5.7 million unique properties on Booking.com.  (NASDAQ: EXPE) just trails Booking with $11 billion in revenue over the last 12 months and posted 11% in gross bookings growth in the third quarter, although it's far less profitable than Booking.Then there's  (NASDAQ: TRIP) , a more recent entrant into the reservation services department, and metasearch (a search aggregator that lists accommodation results from multiple sites in one place) travel competition from  's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Flights, to name just a few. To differentiate itself from the crowd, Booking has been increasing its spending on brand advertising to get more customers to go directly to the Booking suite of services.Image source: Getty Images.More than just spending on advertising, though, is Booking's goal to better integrate all of its websites to create a more unified platform. CEO Glen Fogel gave a few examples, like how Booking.com's hotel and unique property listings are side by side, and how it's now also listing local experiences and events available for reservation from the  made earlier in the year. Fogel said Priceline and Agoda are working better together in overlap markets like the U.S. to increase cost efficiency, as are KAYAK and OpenTable on technical and managerial cooperation to drive site innovation.The idea is to keep integrating services to build a one-stop shop where travelers can look for all of their needs -- from flights and transportation, room accommodation, places to eat, and entertainment. Size can sometimes make a company vulnerable to small upstarts, but in the case of Booking Holdings, its size and breadth of offerings mean it can innovate in this area unlike any of its competitors have been able to so far.While growth rates have been decelerating as of late, that's OK. In short, Booking is still the  and continues to play first fiddle in the industry.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Recently, Travel Advisor  and Booking Holdings  reported their Q3 results. Along with these two companies, Airbnb is also a front runner when it comes to all things travel. Let's take a closer look as to why these specific sites matter.Besides booking hotels or finding flights on Trip Advisor's website, customers can easily find things to do, restaurants and even vacation rentals on it as well. With ease and accessibility, customers are able to find what they want and not have it be a hassle. Although some reviews on Trip Advisor are unhelpful at times, there are a wide variety of opinions on any of the places, hotels and restaurants. Customers find this helpful, especially if it's all in one spot like how it is on Trip Advisor.In Travel Advisors Q3 report, the company posted a 4% increase in revenue to $458 million, an increase of $19 million year-over-year. Posting better than expected earnings at 72 cents per share, the company failed to meet revenue expectations. However, it saw the most growth in its non-hotel revenue by 20% to $153 million. After the company posted its results on Thursday, shares surged by almost 15%. CFO Ernst Teunissen also stated that Q3 had a number of very positive developments and that they are on track to deliver strong profit growth in 2018, leading into 2019.According to the  , there are about 70,000,000 Trip Advisor members from all over the world, with at least 315,000,000 unique monthly users.Booking Holdings operates in more than 220 countries through their six primary brands. Through these brands (Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Kayak, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable) customers are able to go directly to the site they want, specified towards they are looking for.Dominating the online travel industry alongside Booking Holdings is a similar company, Expedia  . However, Booking Holdings has been doing slightly better than Expedia in terms of profitability. This was apparent in their Q3 report where they posted an 11% increase in revenue from the year prior. The company plans to focus more on making the right investments in the upcoming year across their different brands (people, systems and marketing).What started as two former schoolmates putting out an air mattress in their living room to rent out to others so they could cover rent for their studio loft, turned in to a billion dollar business. Although a privately held company, since its launch in 2010, Airbnb has seen a significant increase in profit and revenue. According to  , in 2017 Airbnb brought in $93 million in profit on $2.6 billion in revenue. The company expects to earn around $3.5 billion a year by 2020 and at the pace that the company is going at, it seems viable that they will be able to do so.Airbnb currently has over 5 million listings worldwide, in 81,000 cities and over 191 countries. The company has grown to become a worldwide phenomenon, when it was something that started within the United States. Although quite different to Travel Advisor and Booking Holdings, Airbnb, being a PLC, holds just as much success as the other two companies. In a listing by Forbes, it was rated as the #1 travel website amongst others like HomeAway and Jetsetter.It's no surprise that the first place you look when finding a destination or a hotel is a travel website. Travel Advisor, Booking Holdings and Airbnb have all successfully created a platform which is easy and accessible to its users. Hence, why they have increasing revenue and growth in users year round.

Percentage growth  to slow over the long run due solely to math, but online travel giant  (NASDAQ: BKNG) has worked as hard as it can to keep up its growth rates even as it continues to seek a bigger piece of the travel industry's sales and earnings.Coming into Monday's third-quarter financial report, Booking Holdings investors were prepared for a  in the extent to which the travel website operator could get bigger. Yet a rosier outlook for the remainder of the year gave them some optimism that the company could see brighter days ahead.Image source: Booking Holdings.Booking's third-quarter results weren't entirely satisfactory, and they definitely reflected the long-term trends that have worked against the company. Revenue came in at $4.85 billion, and although that was better than the $4.81 billion that most of those following the stock were expecting to see, it was still up just 8% from year-ago levels. Growth in adjusted net income was even more anemic at just 2%, weighing in at $1.77 billion. The resulting adjusted earnings of $37.78 per share were higher by 7%, falling short of the consensus forecast among investors for $38.13 per share but topping the company's own forecast range from three months ago.Booking's fundamental growth rates were uniformly solid but less impressive than they've been in past quarters. Gross travel bookings were up 12% to $24.3 billion, slowing from their 15% growth rate in the second quarter of 2018. A rise of 66% in merchant bookings helped send merchant revenue higher by more than half, and advertising revenue also rose 14% to give a more modest boost to the company. Yet agency revenue rose just 0.5% on a 2% rise in agency bookings, slowing further from previous quarters.The online travel giant also saw mixed performance in its various product categories. The key hotel segment saw room-night counts climb 13% to 201.3 million, marking the third straight quarter of low-teens percentage growth for the metric. Rental-car days were actually down a fraction of a percent from year-ago levels to 19 million. The airline ticket business kept showing signs of having hit bottom and rebounding from sluggish performance over the past couple of years, however, with a solid 9% rise to 1.8 million tickets.CEO Glenn Fogel was pleased with the performance. \"We had solid execution in our busiest quarter of the year,\" Fogel said during the  , \"and passed a new milestone of 200 million room nights booked in a single quarter.\" The CEO also pointed to Booking's overall strategic plan with respect to marketing and channel partners in contributing to overall success.Booking is also enthusiastic about the future. The company sees itself bulking up brand advertising, which should be useful after its corporate name change to cement the importance of the central Booking.com travel website. In addition, investments in building up a healthy inventory of alternative accommodations, such as private homes and apartments, have paid off both in expanding breadth of offerings and in holding back potential competitors. Booking is making it easier for property owners to make their accommodations available to customers, with streamlined services to facilitate listing and management.Yet what really made investors happy was the guidance that Booking gave. The online travel giant now expects a 9% to 12% increase in hotel room-nights booked in the fourth quarter, with a 6% to 9% rise in gross travel bookings and a 13% to 16% growth rate for revenue. Adjusted earnings of $18.90 to $19.40 per share would be well above the current investor expectation for $18.69 per share, and what's especially impressive is that Booking expects to achieve these growth rates despite seeing substantial pressure from adverse currency moves that will hold back both sales and net income.Booking Holdings shareholders reacted favorably to the news, and the stock was higher by 6% in  Tuesday following the Monday evening announcement. Hopes for accelerated growth rates are driving bullish sentiment, and with a good strategy in place to try to keep up with changing trends and take full advantage of new opportunities, Booking is doing everything it can to fly higher for the rest of this year and in 2019.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Please go ahead, gentlemen. -- Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We had solid execution in our busiest quarter of the year and passed a new milestone of 200 million room nights booked in a single quarter, reporting 201 million worldwide room nights booked. This is up 13% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated gross bookings were up 12% year-over-year in US dollars or about 14% on a constant currency basis. Our revenue increased 11% year-over-year in US dollars or about 13% on a constant currency basis. And adjusted EBITDA grew 8% in US dollars with a similar currency impact on the year-over-year growth rate.Our strong room night growth rate was helped by a later-than-normal summer booking season. In addition, we had higher growth coming from our performance marketing channels, which benefited in part from our lapping the start of last year's optimization efforts. Our guidance for Q4 room night growth of 12% reflects our expectation that we will have more stability in our topline growth rate and reflects the continuation of our marketing spend. And we know that we continue to grow significantly faster than the overall global accommodations market.I am pleased with this strategic approach we have taken with our pay channels this year. Going forward, we expect these markets will remain very dynamic, which is why we will continue to employ our data-driven approach to achieve the right balance of growth and acceptable ROIs. We will look to spend in the pay channels when we see opportunities to acquire high-quality traffic at attractive ROIs. And as I said before and want to emphasize, we'll work closely with those advertising partners that help us build our brand and maintain our competitive strengths, while working in a manner that is best for our customers. Conversely, we will reduce our participation with those who do not work in a way that we believe best serves our customers.As you can see in our results, we are beginning to ramp up our brand advertising. As we've discussed in the past, we expect to increase our brand advertising efforts to further our goal of bringing more customers directly to our platforms and to increase product awareness, particularly in our home segment. We are increasing our spend in digital channels as they provide efficient reach and allow us to better measure the effectiveness of our spend. This is part of our long-term strategy and then we expect to increase our investment in this area, we are mindful to spend as efficiently as possible letting results and data help direct the pace of the investment.We have progressed in many of the investment areas that we've discussed over the current year, in particular, we've expanded our product breadth and customer experience in the areas of alternative accommodations and experiences. We continue to build supply in alternative accommodations and as of September 30, Booking.com had over 5.7 million reported listings in homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, which is an increase of 21% year-over-year. Booking.com's total reported listings were about 29 million as of September 30.Our room night growth in alternative accommodation remains robust and is higher than our consolidated growth rate. We are also pleased to see that the number of customers whose first-ever booking with us through our home product is growing nicely. We developed new services, specifically for our Booking Home hosts. These services include streamlined property onboarding, enhanced guest management tools and property profiling capabilities, which allows hosts to highlight their properties' unique aspects. We believe we are building a leading platform to search and discover truly unique accommodations in the same frictionless path that our customers have come to expect from us, and we continue to believe that the best customer benefit comes from offering both hotel and home accommodations on one unified platform.We recognized it, building a great home platform as only part of the challenge to building a great home business and customer awareness of our capabilities, particularly in certain geographies like the United States is well and will require a higher marketing investment in the coming quarters. However, we believe we are on the right path, and in the long run, we will achieve a leading global home business.In the area of experiences, we are building out our product capabilities, creating a seamless integrated way to offer more choices for our accommodations customers.This quarter Booking.com made progress integrating FareHarbor's products, getting Booking.com access to new local attractions in the US and the ability to leverage FareHarbor's technology to help even more tourism attractions around the world come online. Booking.com's Experiences product is scaling well and we now offer Experiences in approximately 70 cities worldwide. In addition, we are making progress with Experiences in other areas such as offering at-hotel services and restaurant booking options, though we note, these are nascent efforts.As mobile becomes an increasingly integral part of the travel ecosystem, we continue to invest in our mobile platform, so we can offer all of our products: accommodations, ground transport and experiences whenever and wherever our customers may be. We are happy with our progress in this area as today over 50% of our accommodation booking transactions come from mobile devices.We continue to seek ways to promote cross-brand initiatives that allow us to share best practices throughout our Company and get further benefits from our multi-brand platform. Priceline and agoda are now working more closely together in certain overlap markets such as the US, and we are seeing some efficiencies there. With greater technical and managerial cooperation between KAYAK and OpenTable, we are excited about the pace of innovation happening at both companies.OpenTable has been growing nicely, and we are confident about its large opportunity. We believe, through tighter interaction with our other brands in the future, OpenTable will provide benefits to all of our customers and create additional value to our entire enterprise. The number of restaurants on the OpenTable platform has grown by 55% since its acquisition in 2014. And over the prior 12 months, OpenTable has seated over 330 million diners via its online reservation system, which is 69% higher than during 2014. OpenTable is now increasing its development velocity and we look forward to some exciting improvements in the platform in the quarters to come.Finally, I would like to note our $200 million investment in Grab, the leading on-demand transportation and mobile services platform in the South East Asia that we announced last week. This investment in strategic partnership is consistent with our long-term strategy to create the optimal worldwide travel platform, which will make all aspects of travel easier for our customers by having an integrated seamless way to experience the world at the lowest friction possible.I have mentioned this long-term strategy before and will always be a work in progress as technology changes and advances. But I'm pleased to see the initial foundations being laid down. In some, I am very pleased with our execution in the third quarter, the pace of innovation remains robust and I am confident in the long-term growth prospects of the Company. I want to thank our approximately 24,000 employees for their hard work and dedication during this busy quarter, providing unparalleled service to both our customers and property partners around the world.I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden for the detailed financial review. -- Thank you, Glenn; and good afternoon. I'll discuss our operating results and cash flows for the third quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018. All growth rates relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. As we discussed last quarter, all year-over-year growth rates referenced in my remarks in Q4 guidance will compare the current year income statements under the new revenue accounting standard to prior year under the previous accounting standard. Gross bookings and other metrics like room night reservations are not impacted by the new revenue accounting standard. Our non-GAAP financial results and forecasts include stock-based compensation and are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release.Now on to our results for the quarter. We are pleased with our booked room night growth of 13% in Q3, which is well ahead of the high end of our guidance range, and accelerated from Q2. When we provided our guidance for the third quarter in early August, we were in a period of relatively high uncertainty, given the impact of the World Cup and unusual weather pattern in Europe we're having on the summer travel season. Following our , we saw an acceleration in our room night growth rate that continued through the end of the quarter, driven by a delayed summer travel peak and improved results from some of our performance marketing channels.We continue to show progress in growing bookings through our direct channel, which remains our largest single source of new customers. The direct channel continued to represent about half of our booked room nights and continue to grow faster than the overall growth rate.Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were up over 1% in Q3 versus the prior year on a constant currency basis, which is better than our forecast of flat. Strong ADRs in some of our core travel markets more than offset the negative impact from mix. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q3 growth rates in US dollars by approximately 3 percentage points versus last year, and by about 1 percentage point versus guidance. We estimate these changes in FX rates impacted gross bookings, revenue and EBITDA growth rates by a similar amount.Q3 gross bookings grew by 12% expressed in US dollars and grew by 14% on a constant currency basis, coming in about 6 percentage points above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $4.8 billion and grew by 11% in US dollars, and by about 13% in constant currency. Revenue for the third quarter of 2018, under the current revenue standard, was approximately 1% lower than it would have been, if reported under the previous revenue standard.Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenue from KAYAK and OpenTable grew by 14% in Q3 compared to prior year, including revenue from Momondo, an acquisition we closed in July 2017.In the third quarter, we started lapping our strategy to optimize performance marketing ROIs, which began in mid-Q3 2017. As a result, we continue to see leverage from performance marketing in the quarter, however, at a lower rate than the first half of the year. The leverage from performance marketing in the quarter was more than offset by the deleverage in sales and other expense, which continues to be driven by the growth of our merchant business at Booking.com. We will see pressure on the sales and other expense lines will continue to ramp our merchant business. However, a significant portion of these expenses are offset in revenue.As part of our effort to drive more direct traffic to our websites, we increased our spending on brand marketing in the quarter by 27% versus Q3 last year, which contributed about 40 bps of deleverage. As expected, the year-on-year margin pressure from non-marketing OpEx, which includes sales and other diminished in Q3 relative to the first half of 2018 .GAAP operating income grew by 7% and GAAP operating margin decreased by about 170 bps compared to Q3 last year. GAAP operating income in Q3 is negatively impacted by $23 million pre-tax related to -- sorry, by $23 million pre-tax related to a net travel transaction tax charge from prior period, that was recorded in our G&A expense line.GAAP net income amounted to $1.8 billion or $0.372 per share, which grew by 8%. Our GAAP net income includes a $31 million pre-tax net benefit related to unrealized gains and losses on our equity investments in Meituan and Ctrip. GAAP net income was also negatively impacted by the net travel transaction charge I just mentioned. We excluded the unrealized gain on the net travel transaction charge from our non-GAAP results. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21%, which was in line with our forecast.Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $2.36 billion, which met the high-end of our guidance range and was up 8% year-on-year. As I previously mentioned, we saw a negative impact on our growth rate from the changes in FX since providing our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 49% was slightly below our forecast. This reflects higher spending in marketing, which helps our room night growth.Our non-GAAP EPS was $37.78, up 7% versus the prior-year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.1% in Q3, which increased from the prior year due to the impacts of the US Tax Act and the higher Innovation Box Tax rate in the Netherlands. Our 4% lower share count in Q3 versus last year offset the negative impact on EPS growth from the higher tax rate. Our cash and investments amounted to $16.2 billion at quarter-end.In Q3, we generated $2 billion of operating cash flow, which grew by 4% for the quarter and by 22% on a year-to-date basis compared to the prior year. Our free cash flow for Q3 was $1.8 billion, which grew by 2% for the quarter and by 19% on a year-to-date basis compared to the prior-year.We returned about $2.2 billion during the third quarter to our shareholders through share buybacks. Since the start of the year, we reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 4%. As of September 30th, we had approximately $6.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be both programmatic and opportunistic with regard to our repurchases; and on a stable business and market conditions, we expect to complete this authorization within the remainder of the two-year to three-year time period we talked about in May.Turning to Q4. Our guidance reflects our quarter-to-date results and assumes that our growth rates will decelerate over remainder of the quarter, mainly due to size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our approach to guidance has not changed.Foreign exchange rates are expected to be an approximately 4 percentage point headwind to year-over-year growth rates in Q4, which we estimate will impact gross bookings revenue and EBITDA growth rates by similar amounts. We use a dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.145 (ph) when setting our Q4 guidance.We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 9% to 12% and gross bookings to grow by 6% to 9% in US dollars and by 10% to 13% on a constant currency basis. Our Q4 forecast assumes constant currency ADRs for the Company will be up by about 2% compared to prior year. We forecast Q4 revenue to grow by 13% to 16% in US dollars and by 17% to 20% on a constant currency basis.We estimate that our Q4 revenue, as reported, under the new revenue accounting standard, will be slightly less than 5% higher than it would have been under the previous standard. Note that our EBITDA margins and growth rates versus prior year will also benefit from the impact of the change in the revenue accounting standard.Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.19 billion and $1.22 billion, which represents 11% to 14% growth versus prior year. We forecast that adjusted EBITDA margin will be down modestly versus Q4 last year. After adjusting for the impact of the revenue accounting change, forecast EBITDA will be approximately flat versus Q4 of last year at the midpoint of our guidance range. Note that this growth rate had negatively impacted by unfavorable year-over-year FX change I mentioned earlier.To help you understand the underlying drivers leveraging and deleveraging the business in Q4, I will talk about these on the like-for-like revenue basis to eliminate the impact of the Q4 benefit from revenue accounting change. We are forecasting deleverage from the proposed marching expense line in Q4. Our Q4 forecast reflects the full impact of lapping our ROI optimization efforts we started in the middle of Q3 last year. We also expect to continue to lead in to certain performance channels where we see high quality traffic.We expect to grow our brand marketing expense in the quarter at a faster rate than we did in Q3, which will contribute additional deleverage in the P&L. We believe prudently investing in brand marketing is important to drive more direct traffic to our websites and build better product awareness. Sales and other expenses continue -- is expected to continue to pressure margins, primarily due to the ramp-up of our merchant business. We continue to (inaudible) platform to help build our home business and for other beneficial transaction effects. Finally, we expect continued deleverage in personnel from the investments we've made in the second half of 2017 and earlier this year.We forecast GAAP EPS between $18.05 and $18.55 for Q4. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 46.8 million shares, reflecting the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we've made to-date, which have reduced our share count by 6% versus Q4 last year.Our non-GAAP EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a tax rate of approximately 20%. Note that our GAAP tax rate for last year was negatively impacted by a one-time expense related to the US Tax Act, and is therefore, not comparable. We are forecasting Q4 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $18.90 to $19.40, which represents 12% to 15% growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast assumes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 20%, which is higher than the prior year rate of 17% due to the impact from the US Tax Act, as well as the increased rate of the Innovation Box Tax in the Netherlands. The negative impact from the higher tax rate is more than offset by a lower share count versus Q4 last year.We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA, and net income from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular.With that, we'll now take your questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is now open. -- Okay. I want to ask about the marketing strategy a little bit. I know you've gone through this kind of over a year of this kind of toggle, I think, away from performance and toward brand advertising. It sounds like some of the upside, the acceleration you saw this quarter happened to -- came due to the lapping of performance marketing. But just maybe address a little bit broader, this overall shift toward brand advertising, do you feel like you are at an optimal mix now? Do you think there's going to be constant experimentation. I assume the answer to that is yes, but any more color on whether after this year of experimentation do you feel like you've got a better more sustainable growth profile set up because of this toggle and marketing shift? Thanks a lot. -- Hi, Mark. It's Glenn speaking. So I know, you'd like me to be able to tell you, it's all fine, stable and it's going to be the same going forward. But the fact of the matter, these markets, as you well know, are extremely dynamic. So when we find good opportunities, we find high-quality traffic at the ROIs that we like, we step in and we're going to buy. Similarly, when we think that there's something that we don't like, we're going to step away and whether that's because of platforms acting in a way that we don't believe is in the best interest of our customers or for some other reason, we're going to vary how we're going to spend in those pay-for-performance channels.But what I said a year ago and I continue to say it now, is the importance of increasing our brand spend. And we're going to continue to do that, and you saw some of the increase already, and we said we're going to spend more. And the reason is, we believe, in the long run, we want to try and drive as much traffic as we can directly and part of that is creating a brand awareness, and we talked about this in the past several times.So I can't give you any sort of specifics about how much is we're going to do in performance, it's going up or down. I can't say, there's probably going to be dynamic, there's going be movements up and down going forward. But I absolutely believe, in the long run, the right thing is to try and increase that brand advertising to get the people to come direct.David, if you want to add any color, go ahead. -- Glenn, thank you. I think, just consistent with Glenn's comments, yeah, we did reinforce in my remarks that we are very focused upon the growth in the balance of that direct business, which remains the largest single source new customers, and represents about half of our booked room nights. So that's a very strategic part, not the only part, but the spending on brand obviously supports that and also supports our longer term strategy to expand our portfolio to provide more value to our customers. -- Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David.Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, I had a couple, if I can. Wanted to, first, I guess, follow up on the marketing questions. Can you give us any sense for how we should think about the return timing on the brand spend? And are you finding you're able to scale that up with more confidence around measuring specific payback or is that more of a strategic decision still the spend on brand?And then, I guess, the second one, you mentioned the number of customers making their first booking is growing nicely. So any specific growth kind of rate or relative growth rate to your room nights, is it faster or slower than overall room nights, or maybe you can give us an update on that that customer count metric given it's been a couple of years since you've updated that, anything further you can share there? -- Hi, Lloyd. So talking about marketing and the brand, what we're trying to do here, I can't give you any sort of specifics or when we think the ROI is going to be. I will say that it's still very early. And if you recall last year, we talked a little bit about how we increased the number of people in terms of brand marketing, how we're increasing the ability to develop technology tools to be able to measure and we're continuing to do that and we do like what we're seeing and we are increasing the spend. This is a difficult thing as we continue to go forward in terms of understanding the attribution and how much of factor you're getting for your brand that's going over to where your pay-for-performance is now performing better than it would have in the past, in many different ways to understand what's the true ROI. It's going to be something that we're going to continue to experiment, but I do believe we are going to continue to ramp up that spend, as I said in the last question, and it is something that we do believe is very important.Regarding the second thing, I want to make sure you heard what I said perfectly. What I was talking about is, we were having people who are coming there are first time they ever come and book something with Booking, and the first thing they're using is the home product. That's something we really like to see growing, because that's showing that there is awareness of our booking home product beginning to grow. In terms of specifics, we're not going to give any numbers in that area. -- All right. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my question. Sorry, again, on the marketing side, but up until the last year or so, the Company's marketing spend as a percent of revenue was, I think, pretty consistently growing a couple of hundred basis points a year. I guess, now it looks as though you're going to lean back into marketing. Is that kind of the pace that we should be thinking about? I'm just trying to understand a little bit how much of the past year or so has been a bit of an anomaly and should we be thinking about kind of pre-2017 to think more about the marketing leverage in the business? -- Yeah, Mark. This is Dave. Let me just start off with, I understand where the question is going. Let me just first of all -- I think you do have to look at the year in two halves, as you mentioned. The first-half, broadly speaking, we have the benefit from our ROI optimization activities comparing optimized -- less optimized a year ago, and in the second half, we start to lap it. So you start seeing the two halves start to play out in a slightly different way.I think, one way to look at it, if you just look at the full year and I know this is a projection based upon the top end of our guidance range Q4, but if you look at the full year and you add everything together, you see 30% room night growth, 17% revenue growth, 17% EBITDA growth, 16% EPS growth. So I think it represents a fairly healthy year, obviously, there's been some different stories, you and I hear. I know it's been a little bit of challenge some times first to walk everybody through the moving parts. So one way to look at it, is just step back and look at the bigger picture for the year.The other part of your question is kind of what are the things look like going forward. And I'm not going to give you a specific amount of leverage or deleverage, but I mean, our longer term view of the business hasn't changed. And as we put on, (inaudible) bit of an ROI reset going on with certain of our performance channels over the course of the last 18 months, but our longer term view hasn't changed.And as we think about our 2019 plan, we think about our longer term plan. What we asked -- what we plan to do is, to invest in the business to grow at above-market growth rates, expect to have (inaudible) modest deleverage in our EBITDA margin rates to achieve that build out of the platform in that above-market position, but have a close eye on the EBITDA dollar growth. So that gives you a little bit of direction. I don't want to get into the specifics yet as to how much and we're still obviously working through that, and we'll give you more as we finish our 2019 plan. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Great. One big picture question and one housekeeping. On the big picture, I think, you spent about $100 million more than we thought on marketing, just our estimates, and generated about 6 million more room nights than we were thinking. Did something shift intra-quarter where you found pockets of better ROI or something changed in the market that made you more aggressive on the marketing spend? That's the first question versus your original outlook.And then secondly, just the strength in merchant bookings growth versus agency, can you just remind us for the dynamics of that? Thank you. -- Sure. I'll take that first one, Justin. I'll let Dave take the second one. So as I remarked earlier, when we see good opportunities, we're going to spend; when we see areas that we don't think is appropriate, we're going to lean back in terms of marketing spend. The markets are extremely dynamic. And as David mentioned, there were some interesting things happening toward the end of Q2, running into Q3 that made things a little bit hard to try and foresee the future. So it's one of those things where we did spend more certain times and we did end up with more room nights, that's clearly in the math there, and we're pleased about it. And we hope going forward that we'll continue to find these type of opportunities that are going to help us build the franchise. -- Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. And then on the housekeeping, actually, it's fairly important point. You can really see the transition occurring -- starting to occur in Q4 2017 when the growth in our merchant bookings started to significantly exceed the growth in our agency bookings as we are building out and deploying a global payments platform at Booking.com. That does a number of great things for us, for our customers and our partners. For our customers, it gives them many more choices to how they may want to pay for their transactions in advance or closer to the stay, it gives them more opportunities to pay with the payments product of their choice, it may not necessarily be a credit card, it could be something like an Ally pay for example. For us, it lets us basically provide our customers with a more consistent service, because we're in charge of exactly how that payment flow works. And then for our partners, again, we offer them more ability to access different payment forms from different customers in different parts of the world, because we can basically pay them the partner in the form of whatever they like to take even though we may have taken the payment in on the front end, there are different payment mechanisms. So it is the build out of our global payments platform principally, rolling through Booking.com having the impacts and (technical difficulty) has been occurring for quite some time as we see merchant revenue, merchant bookings rather outstripping the growth of the agency bookings. -- Great. And one follow-up. Is agoda similarly growing faster than your other platforms, can you tell us about that? -- We don't usually talk about individual brands which one is growing faster, which one's not, but I will say that Asia is a fast-growing area, it's also a very competitive area. It's been that way for some time, and I suspect it's going to continue to be that way for some time in the future. -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the marketing questions. Can you give us an update on your relationship with Google and given your comments in the prepared remarks whether you feel they are helping you best serve your customers? Thanks. -- So, as you know, we don't generally talk about any individual advertising platform. And we've also talked over many, many years, we've had a wonderful relationship with people at Google, basically helping build out our business together with them a very symbiotic relationship, helping improve each other's capabilities and we're very pleased with that. And we hope that continues for a very long time. I can't say much beyond that that would be helpful to you, I don't think. -- Okay, understood. And then just another question on brand marketing. You talked about wanted to grow that, right now, you're about $500 million annually. How are you thinking about what the right amount is to spend on brand to make sure you're getting out there around the world today? Thanks. -- So, as you know, one of the things that we're very proud about is our history of doing experimentation and not trying to make guesses or just projections without data. So what we're going to do is continue to do what we've always done, and that is spend, test, test, spend, see how it goes, it's complicated, it's going to take a long time. And over this long period of time, we will find out what the optimal amount to spend is. But I can't give you a number now, given that it's going to take significant amount of experimentation for a very long time before we are able to come out with what we think the optimal is. And the interesting thing about that is, because this world is so dynamic, things changing so rapidly. I know spec wherever going to come up with a set number, it's always going to be moving. One thing though I will add that I am happy to see is more and more of the brand marketing is going to digital video. And one of the good things about that is the measurement of that spend is better than it used to be when you're doing over-the-air TV. So at least we're getting a better data to be able to measure against. -- Thanks, Glenn. Then lastly, can you just -- could you give us quarter-to-date share repurchase? Thanks a lot. -- I'll leave that to David to say no. -- Kevin, we'll just update you every quarter on how we've done. I think as our new policy, I think it's the right way to go. -- Thanks, David. Thanks, Glenn.Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, just trying to little bit better understand the 3Q and the 4Q guidance. The room night acceleration in the guidance -- the acceleration, can you just talk to any specific regions or products that were the biggest contributors to the overall acceleration in growth?Then the second one, just to kind of again, better understand the quarters, you said, direct traffic it sounds like grew faster than the overall rate, so I think direct grew in the mix. Performance probably drove more upside than expected. How did that happen, or you able to use data to sort of test and deliver more volume at lower ROIs or ROIs more stable what you thought -- how did performance come in better than expected, was it that lower ROI or not? -- Brian, let me start and then maybe pass over to Glenn for couple of comments. So you asked a number of things there. So yes, just to confirm, direct did increase mix in the quarter and also our performance growth in the performance channels did better than they did in the early part of years specifically in the Q2 to just kind of confirm that. And why do we see some more opportunities there? Well, we always test the amount of kind of elasticity and what the potential is to increase growth rates and return for investment for testing constantly in those channels. As I mentioned, very dynamic and real-time testing is kind of what we see as the opportunity. And we saw a little bit more opportunity to drive growth without dropping ROIs very much, if that makes sense.Prior elasticity tests we had during the year would say that if you were wanting to drive a lot of growth, you have a high reduction in ROI. We saw some opportunities in some of our key channels to drive some more growth with less of a drop in ROI. We thought that was a smart thing to actually do. So that accounts for a number of things we've already talked about. It accounts for kind of why our performance marketing spend was perhaps a little bit higher than many people had estimated. But as we commented upon, the performance in room nights, that was part of the reason why we were able to do better in room nights, not the only reason why we are able to do better in room nights and that's why we lend into those channels a little bit more in Q3 than we expected to when we gave our guidance.There were some other factors of course that were very much at the top of our mind when we gave that guidance at the start of the quarter. I mentioned a rather unusual patterns we were seeing in the July, in August, though started to get better, particularly the whole weather situation in Europe got better both in terms of the heat wave breaking in the north and the scorch wave breaking in the south. So those were all contributing factors, but specifically related to the channels, I think that gives you some color. -- I would just probably just add that -- and I understand where people are coming from these questions and looking at the numbers, where sort of guidance was, but what I continue to try and do is have our investors and people are looking at our company is focused on the long-term, what we're trying to grow, what we're trying to build, what's going to be great for our customers and partners. So in the long run, we're able to achieve the mission, which really is to help people experience the world no-ad, experience the world at less friction and more profits for us, that's what we're trying to do here.And some quarters are going to be better-than-expected, some quarters are perhaps not going to be as good, and there is so much, and again I'll use the word, dynamic, we got a lot of players in a market that are also bidding against us, bidding their own strategies, we have brand advertising, we are trying to figure out what works, what doesn't work, lots of factors happening. But as long as we continue to build our products, make things better for the customers, collate what I've talked about in the past about this holistic system, that really makes it easier for people to travel. As long as we focus on that and continue to do that, I believe, in the long run, we will continue to grow this Company at a reasonable rate. And as we've said so many times, we're still single-digit in accommodations in the whole industry. So that's a lot of ramp left. -- Great. Thanks, guys.Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a good segue into something that's not marketing related. But Glenn, just hoping you can talk a little bit more about non-hotel accommodations, just pass through the busiest part of the season. How do you sum up where you are here in terms of supply, the value proposition to consumers and also awareness, and how that ties into your key priorities as you look into 2019? Thanks. -- Yeah, look, it's incredibly important. We believe it's a great opportunity, we reported listings up 21% year-over-year. You got to have the actual supply to actually book anything. If you don't have that, you're not going to be able to move the business, so that's a good start. But we've also talked in the past about the need to spend money to improve all the different things that need to be done to make our host, the person who owns that property be willing to rent it out to somebody, and we need to get the awareness to the demand side to get them to know, hey we got this great product, come and get it. That's a lot of effort and we were starting from behind from some of our competitors, no doubt about that.That being said, we talk about things that we've built and I talked a little bit about it in my prepared remarks about some of the stuff that we've been building. And it's really a long-term project. This is not going to be done in a quarter or two quarters or even a year, but it's some that is a long-term thing that we absolutely believe in and we believe that we're going to be able to continue to do it in the way that we think is the best way, and that's having both hotels and home properties on the same site. So the customer sees both products right there, sees the reviews right there. And we believe it you don't hit somebody with a travelers fee at the end. And we believe incredibly important is the ability to do it on a instant booking basis, so that when the customer is ready to purchase, it's done, it's not going back and forth, back and forth.One of the things in that though is that there is an issue of trust, and that's some of the tools we talked about for the host to be able to build some of the tools to make those host feel comfortable in Instant Booking area. So lot of things to be done, but it's an important part of what we're trying to build here. And I've seen, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing people the first time ever booked with us is booking a home product, loving that. -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, thanks. It's Naved Khan from SunTrust. Maybe two questions. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about the China outbound demand and maybe plans for hotels combined, now that you've gotten approval from Europe for acquiring that business. And then I had a follow-up on metasearch? -- So first question, hotels combined, and I may have missed it. I don't believe we actually gotten the final approval yet. So we're going to pass on that question. So your question on meta in general? -- Yes. And then, just along with hotels combined, I also wanted to know if you're willing to provide some color on China outbound demand, any kind of trends you might be willing to share? -- China outbound, yeah, look, incredibly important. I love saying it, so I'll say it again, I love China, the locomotive, the travel train. I just saw some interesting statistics I thought were indicative of how poor this can be. So 2014, there were 55 million Chinese passports, so they used to go outbound; 2017, it's 120 million passports, that shows kind of the growth. People don't get a passport unless you intend to actually go out of the country.China is also making things make it easier for Chinese tourists to go out. So in 2015, there were 46 countries that were visa-free, now there are 74 countries, makes it a lot easier to go, and this is anywhere in the world. When the economy is doing well, as people get more money, they want to travel more; and in China, when the person is able to afford to travel outside China, they want to go. If you look at some of the social stuff going on social media, people putting out their pictures of visiting London and Paris and Rome and all that, but it's more than that. It's all over the world, and I've talked about the Chinese being in Alaska, seeing Chinese tourists being in (inaudible).It is so important for us to be able to get a good share of that product and that's why we are doing a lot of effort. We have over 1,000 people in China working for us there. I think we have either a dozen or 14 offices in China. We have made, as you know, we made some significant investments to have good partners in China. We invested in CTrip sometime ago, we invested in Metua (ph) and we recently made investments in GED. By making these investments, we are getting different ways to reach the Chinese tour, so that we can show them all the great things that we offer to them. So when they want to travel, we've got what they need, and we're excited about it, and we're pleased about, and we think it's going to have a long-term benefit to our Company. -- And Glenn, if I can just pick up a point on meta, I think that was in the first question of -- for obvious reason, we're not disclosing hotels combined, because we have not got the final approvals yet, so we're working down on that path nicely. But what I would say is that, we think the meta segment is very important, and it is a segment because I think there are a group of people who will always want to go to a meta first before choosing their travel and there are other people who will prepare to build their longer term relationships with OTA platforms. And we think the winning model is a global multi-platform model, which we are building in the meta space. So we think it's very important part of our strategy, and people shouldn't get confused, we don't think it's necessarily competitive with other parts of the business is complementary, because it addresses a segment of the marketplace that just refers to go there first and we want to have a great solution for those customers as well. -- Thanks, that's helpful. And just on the commentary on meta, so now that you are sort of lapping the changes you made last year, the ROI changes, do you see more room for improving ROI there or do you think they are at appropriate level for now? -- Well, in terms of meta, as I channeled out for our other businesses, I think we are now will be fully lapping in the Q4. The areas where there was the biggest share shift in terms of what changes that we made when we started our ROI observation effort was in fact in meta. So we should get benefits in there Q4-over-Q4. But we like our ROI approach, we think that -- what we've done is got things to a level that works nicely for us, and for our business. So now we're lapping those and we're looking incrementally opportunity, just like I mentioned, we did with other channels in the Q3. -- Thank you.And our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good afternoon. One follow-up on homes. Have you been able to decipher whether or not vacation homes are mostly additive or cannibalistic to traditional bookings? And then separately on Experiences, should we think about this as being a significant area of investment in the near future? Is it fairly minor relative to your spend another category, so just wondering how that stacks up on the priority list? Thanks. -- I'm sorry, could you repeat that second one again, Mike? -- Experiences, just wondering where it stacks up on the priority list and how much the near-term investments are going to be there? -- So in terms of cannibalistic, in terms of homes, I don't usually think of it that way really. I think about providing the choices and what the consumer decides, it's fine by us. It's is not our decision to try and direct them one way or the other. We do recognize though if we don't have the home, we may lose somebody who wanted a home, even though they have come to us and want to check up the hotels, we don't have home, that may be a negative. We've always said that it's important for us to try and get every single type of accommodation on that platform, it's homes, it's apartments, it's -- we say unique place to stay, we really mean unique, we're talking about yurts, we're talking igloos in the winter, we're talking everything there. That way by providing the incredible breadth really makes it more appealing to the consumer that when they want to travel, what they're going to do, they come to us I know, they're going to get what they want on our site.Now, in terms of Experiences, in the long run, it is important. It's not something that we're going to just go million miles an hour right now and crash the income statement by just throwing money at it to build out the thing, but it's something that is very, very important. And the reason is not only the money that it'll bring to the bottom-line, the incremental EBITDA, but we also believe in the long run, it goes to that they're going to talked about so many times is we're buying that system that makes it easier and better for the person to travel. And I've experienced it myself as a consumer; I use it. And in cities where we have these things like Experiences, it's just been a wonderful thing to be able just to show that QR code of the Booking.com app, skip the line to go on to the pinnacle or go up to the castle, the top of the mountain, I did that. And I said, this is great. And that's a type of thing we do, sort of build loyalty, it will make it easier. So there's a lot of compounding besides just getting the incremental amount of money out of that one transaction. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. Glenn, the hotel suppliers themselves have been out there, talking about success of their own direct to consumer initiatives, they're competing to grow direct relationships with their guests as you are. So I guess the question is, how's that going, how much of your spend on brand is really to actually compete with what amounts to your suppliers who are trying to build the same direct relationships in the channel?And then second question would be for, I guess, either David or Glenn. What's the right capital structure for Booking Holdings is? Is the business overcapitalized relative to what really is steady cash flows over time? So maybe just talking about the puts and takes of stock buybacks versus our strategic M&A versus other uses of your capital would be really helpful. Thank you. -- So our business is based on creating a great relationship both with people who want to stay in accommodation and people who are supplying the accommodation, and whether it'd be a large multinational, international chain or a single little hotel owner in the middle of some small village in France, it's always try and provide value to them as in terms of providing value to the demand side.And sure I've seen the ads for some of the large international chains and nothing wrong with that. They want to attract people to come to them directly, they think it may be cheaper for them to do that. It's nothing wrong with that. We have a great relationship. I'd point out that the international lodge chains is actually a small portion of our business, so we talked about in the past about 15% of our business. But we want to do everything that we can to be helpful and help make their business better, that's how we win in the long run. And we do provide a lot of value.We have the largest demand platform in the world for accommodation, so anybody who has a hotel and wants to fill a bed with a body and make some money, we're the people to come to. And some of the stuff that we do, do it over 40 languages -- over 40 languages and doing customer service in these languages, and we pay for that, doubled the pay for that, that's our cost. Doing all of the marketing that we do. Those things are done more efficiently than almost any hotel could do on their own, and therefore, that efficiency we're providing that value to these hotels.I want to -- I read about this and I hear about people say the fight between the people like us and the hotels and I really wish people would stop thinking this as a sporting event or boxing thing or something like that. This is a thing we're sure people want to attract people to their own site, the same I look, I want to really come to us direct to, I don't want to pay money for marketing, but in the end I really want to change the just the tone of everything, so that we see that we're really helping each other, and this is really a symbiotic relationship.And I'll let David talk about capital structure. -- Yeah. Anthony, obviously capital structure could be a very long topic and we've only got a couple of minutes for it. So I'll try and give you the higher level view. First of all, I think you have to step back and look at what we're trying to do with the business. There is a huge travel market opportunity out there and we only have -- we have a single-digit share of the accommodation segment where we are strongest. Therefore, we have a lower single digit share of the overall travel marketplace. And our mission is to build out the best online global travel marketplace on the planet, offering choice value service and seamlessness for our customers. And that price is a huge price and that is a price I think everybody wants us to go forward try to develop.So those are primary mission in life and we are fortunate to have enough financial resources to be able to do that, and of course, be able to return a significant amount of money to our shareholders. Now, that ability to return to shareholders as aggressively as we can right now has been aided by US Tax Act and is relatively new. And I think that the commitment to return $10 million over the next two to three years is a very important step forward. But I do want to put it in the context of that broader opportunity to invest both organically and inorganically in building out this incredibly large opportunity we have in front of us, where I think we have the ability to generate something which is of significant value for our customers, our shareholders, for our partners, which is kind of our primary mission in life. So if that helps, that's how we think about it. -- That's helpful. Thank you, David. Thank you, Glenn.Thank you. And our next question comes from James Hardiman with Wedbush. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. You touched on this a little bit, but maybe clarify a little bit, you had a strong finish to the third quarter and then better than expected guidance for the fourth quarter. I'm trying to figure out how much of that is momentum versus coincidence. Obviously, you don't give us the fourth quarter guide until now, but you spoke to the late-summer travel booking scenario. I wouldn't think that that would affect the fourth quarter very much. But I guess, at the end of the day, I'm trying to get at, are you more optimistic about the fourth quarter today than you were three months ago.And then maybe as somewhat of a side, maybe talk a little bit geographically, Europe was called out as maybe a headwind to overall growth last time we talked. Obviously, the mix of Europe changes in the fourth quarter, but I'm just try to figure out if that's sort of resolved itself and whether or not Europe is a headwind or a tailwind as we look into the fourth quarter and beyond? Thanks. -- James, let me start with that. So in terms of the direct question, are we more optimistic about Q4 now than we were when we did our guidance last time, yes. I think, we were pretty clear last time when we were guiding we were sitting looking at June and the July period which were impacted by some macro factors that were out of our control, Europe being our biggest in the marketplace was going through the most ridiculous weather pattern we'd ever seen where the South was, -- sorry, where the North was kind of warm and dry, people didn't want to go away on vacation and the South was basically in the 40s and raining, and people didn't want to go there. So that really affected our business. We couldn't predict when that was going to change and that was also compounded by the World Cup going on which again had a big impact on Europe with countries doing well in the tournament. So we were seeing that looking at a high degree of uncertainty.As I mentioned, as we developed through the quarter, things got better, things got better than we expected in most of our geographies and Europe was certainly the biggest one, and things did improve in Europe and obviously, we ended the quarter at a higher growth rate than the average for the quarter, because we commented that we expect a deceleration back on our August call. So we are looking at Q4 from a stronger lens than we expect it to be things hadn't improved. And as I mentioned, our guidance for Q4 would reflect some deceleration from what we saw from a growth rate in October. So those are the factors, which we are looking at and hopefully that clarifies the puts and takes. But the short answer to the question is, yes, we are in a stronger position about our view of Q4 now than we would have been if things had not improved in Q3, which is what we built into our Q3 guidance. -- Got it. And the geographic question, it sounds like Europe -- the concern today have largely been alleviated as Europe now a tailwind to growth going forward? -- I'm not going to get into the relative growth rates of different segments, but obviously, a lot of the things are out of our control. We talked how it's impacted our view of the world in early Q3 were happening in Europe and we talked about some level of acceleration from Q2 into Q3 and we saw that across most of our major geographies. -- Got it . Thanks guys.Thank you. And our last question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Just a question on the 50% transaction mix from mobile. As mobile ramped over the last several quarters, has there been a meaningful change on repeat behavior, cost of customer acquisition that should potentially be an incremental positive to unit economics going forward as the given that we have now crossed significant threshold in terms of 50% and is the mix between paid and organic significantly differ on mobile devices? -- So we're not going to get into talking about the relative costs for mobile or desktop. I would of course caution the obvious thing, but some people seem to sometimes forget this that mobile does not mean app and does not mean phrase. I just want to make sure everybody's on the same page on that one, because it's not. We are very pleased though, because we believe as people continue to move toward the mobile device and doing all of their, doing their travel with the mobile, it gives us a great opportunity to continue to work with the customer throughout the trip, providing them with more services, more things and make it a better experience, make their travel better so that they are then more willing to come back to us again, because we're offering all these great things on the mobile. That's the good part about mobile that's where it's really at. Now I wouldn't get too much wrapped around whether or not the cost is higher or lower, again these are competitive markets and over time I imagine they are probably going to end up in an area where the equilibrium is not that different than desktop, who knows. That's my point about mobile.Dave, you want to add anything to that? -- No, Glenn. I think that's the key point. The key point is that when we talk about the trip and be able to interact with the customer during that trip, the mobile device is always with them, it's always on, the desktop then back to occasionally, but the tend also to take the desktop with them. So if they opened their laptops at night maybe interactive with them once or twice a day, but the mobile devices there the entire time. So it's a very strategic shift in the business, and particularly as we build out all the aspects of the trip, we like our customers interacting with us much more often on mobile than they can on a desktop device. -- So thank you for joining us for the call today. Very pleased with our quarterly results and we remain very excited about the future prospects of the Company. Well, look forward to updating you after our fourth quarter call. Thank you very much and good night.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect.

Online retail may not be as sexy as emerging markets like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, virtual reality, or autonomous vehicles, but the long-term opportunity in e-commerce could be bigger than all of those nascent technologies. E-commerce has been revolutionizing the way consumers buy products for more than 20 years, but there is still plenty of growth ahead, especially in small-cap stocks.Image source: Getty Images.The simplest way to define e-commerce is the buying and selling of goods via the internet. With the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, e-commerce started slowly, but it has gained momentum as technology has improved with advances like smartphones and delivery times have gotten faster as companies such as  (NASDAQ: AMZN) and others have added hundreds of warehouses across the country in order to meet customer demand.U.S. retail sales alone total more than $5 trillion a year, and that number approaches $6 trillion when restaurants are included. While e-commerce may seem ubiquitous these days, especially with the rise of Amazon, less than 10% of all retail sales take place online, meaning the U.S. e-commerce market today is worth about $500 billion. That leaves plenty of opportunity for growth, and e-commerce has steadily grabbed market share since the dawn of the internet, with sales increasing by about 15% annually since the financial crisis. Over the last 10 years, e-commerce's share of retail sales has grown from less than 4% to nearly 10%, and outside of the U.S. in markets like India and China, the opportunity may be even greater.The growth of online retail should remain strong, as the advantages over traditional retail shopping are clear: Shopping from home or via a smartphone provides a degree of convenience unmatched by physical stores. E-commerce will also continue to get bigger, as new technologies will make it even more convenient, speed up delivery, and provide other advantages over shopping in a physical store. Many of the technologies listed above should help accelerate the growth of e-commerce.Driverless cars, for example, will lower the cost of delivery by eliminating the need for drivers. Drones could also remove the need for vehicles for some deliveries, making the process even cheaper. Artificial intelligence is already helping warehouses become more efficient and speed up the picking and packing process. Cloud computing has helped online retailers easily scale up as they grow, and virtual and augmented reality have made shopping online for things like furniture easier, as shoppers can see images of how an item like a couch would fit in their living rooms.Such technologies, along with the proliferation of smartphones and better internet connectivity, will also spur the growth of e-commerce in the developing world.Though e-commerce may seem like a simple business model, there are in fact several different ways for investors to capture a piece of the opportunity, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The table below shows the different ways to invest in the industry with the e-commerce companies that operate in each category.\n  \nBelow, we'll take an in-depth look at each of these categories, examine the pros and cons, and discuss the best opportunities for investors.Direct selling is the simplest form of an e-commerce business. Direct sellers handle every aspect of the business, from stocking inventory to handling payments and customer service, shipping, and returns. They function much in the same way a brick-and-mortar store would, but instead of selling through a storefront, they sell through a website. Any entrepreneur can hang their online shingle out and begin selling products online, becoming a direct seller. Many of the companies that went belly up when the dot-com bubble burst like Pets.com and Webvan.com were direct sellers. In the fervor of the dot-com boom, venture capitalists and investors were throwing money at almost any online seller, convinced by the huge opportunity in online retail. However, building a viable e-commerce business turned out to be more difficult than expected, as online businesses face challenges like shipping costs and processing returns that stores don't have to deal with. Pets.com, in particular, met its fate partly because of the high cost of shipping heavy products like pet food, which proved to be ill suited to the online channel.Even today, the model remains risky in that operators must take on the costs of inventory and shipping, and the cost of shipping, in particular, has made the online channel a lower-margin one than brick-and-mortar retail in many instances. A business's  is simply the percentage of sales that it keeps as profit -- the higher the better. High margins are often a sign of underlying strength in the business, indicating that a company has a competitive advantage such as a well-known brand that gives it  , allowing it to charge higher prices than competitors.  and the iPhone offer one example. Low margins, on the other hand, especially in businesses that have low or no growth, are a sign of weakness, which could come from poor management, operational problems, or a slew of other challenges.  , for instance, has lower margins than peers like  and  because the company has struggled to win back customers after the disastrous  .The table below shows the pros and cons of direct selling.\n  \nHowever, multiple success stories have come out of the direct-selling model, most notably Amazon. From its humble origins as an online bookseller, Amazon has grown to encompass myriad businesses, including cloud computing, an e-commerce marketplace, video streaming, and voice-activated search. It is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, but none of that would have been possible if it wasn't able to execute effectively as a direct seller, expanding its inventory, offering free and fast shipping through its Prime loyalty program, and gaining the trust of customers. In a unique way, Amazon has leveraged the power of its direct-selling business to overcome many of the cons listed above. The company has built competitive advantages through its Prime loyalty program and added a marketplace to give a platform to third-party sellers, which generates a higher margin for Amazon than direct selling. More than any other company, Amazon has shown how direct selling leads to  , or multiple futures, like entirely new businesses including cloud computing or video streaming.More recently, other direct sellers have risen to the forefront, including Wayfair and JD.com.Wayfair is a furniture and home goods seller that was founded in 2002 and went public in 2014. The stock has more than tripled since its IPO as its revenue growth has surged, and revenue could approach $10 billion by next year. However, questions have arisen about Wayfair's ability to ever  , as the company has historically operated at a loss as it works to grow sales and build market share. Over its last four quarters, the company has lost $357 million. Meanwhile, competition from Amazon, which has historically operated its e-commerce operation near breakeven, has pressured profits at other e-commerce outfits and at brick-and-mortar retailers. Wayfair looks like a classic direct seller, according to the chart above, as the company has seen fast revenue and market share growth but is still unprofitable. Management continues to see a huge opportunity in e-commerce home goods and is willing to sacrifice profits in order to grow its top line. If or when that market finally matures, the company will need to focus on profitability.JD.com, meanwhile, resembles the Chinese version of Amazon in many ways. The company is the leading online direct seller in China, ahead of Alibaba, but also operates its own marketplace, much like Amazon. In the first quarter of 2018, JD brought in $16 billion in revenue, $14.6 billion of which was from direct selling, and operating margins from direct selling were just 2.1%. Like Wayfair, the company is growing fast, with revenue up 44% in its most recent quarter to $16 billion. Unlike Wayfair, it is profitable, with $182 million in net income in the last year. With ambitions to expand into Europe and the U.S., JD could be the closest thing to  at Amazon for investors. Like Amazon, JD also has a marketplace for third-party sellers, as it's used its direct-selling platform for leverage. Its control over all aspects of its business  given it an advantage over rival Alibaba because it's rapidly adding new warehouses to improve delivery times.Finally, there's Stitch Fix, a new kind of e-commerce business. The company is a styling service that sends customers a box of clothes, sometimes on a subscription basis, based on that customer's preferences. The customer keeps what they want and returns the rest. Stitch Fix uses technology and algorithms to help guide its buying and selecting process, as the customer's past choices inform future picks, and the company has emerged from a crowded field as the leader. It is profitable and putting up steady growth, with revenue up 26% in fiscal 2018, and the stock is up significantly from its $15 IPO price last November. The company appears to have many of the same  and optionalities that  has. For instance, Stitch Fix has already begun manufacturing and branding its own clothes, using its vast reams of data to its advantage. The company has also moved fast into men's, plus-sized, and kids' clothes and is preparing for a launch in the U.K. next year, its first international expansion.Of all the kinds of e-commerce businesses, marketplaces are the most common and arguably the most effective. Though there is some overlap between marketplaces and direct sellers, the two have distinct business models. Marketplaces function as platforms that connect buyers and sellers. In a marketplace, the business does not sell any of its own goods or services but takes a commission on sales. It also makes money from providing additional services like handling payments or processing fulfillment and shipping. Below are some of the pros and cons with investing in e-commerce marketplaces.\n  \nThe best-known e-commerce marketplace is probably eBay. The auction-based online marketplace was born in the early days of the internet and was an e-commerce pioneer along with Amazon. While eBay is still a well-known e-commerce business, its cultural relevance has faded, as the company has not done enough to modernize its platform, and it's growing more slowly than the broader e-commerce industry. The stock has only achieved modest returns in the last five years, underperforming the  at a time when many e-commerce stocks have soared. The company also owns the ticket-reselling marketplace StubHub and was the former parent of  . PayPal has thrived since the 2015 spinoff, showing the power of payment platforms, arguably another investing angle of e-commerce. eBay, meanwhile, has been spinning its wheels.eBay has been a classic beneficiary of the marketplace model. Its profit margins have long been high, but its slow revenue growth also shows the consequences of becoming too complacent with such a model.Etsy is another popular e-commerce site. In fact, Etsy is one of the highest-trafficked e-commerce sites in the U.S. The company occupies a unique niche in the market: It sells handcrafted products from artisans like jewelry, home decor, and greeting cards, functioning essentially as an online flea market or craft fair. That focus has set it apart from other online retailers and given it an advantage in some ways. The company has also managed to  from Amazon, which pushed its competing service, Amazon Handmade, over the holidays in 2017. Etsy sales surged anyway, and it still maintained a majority of the market share in the segment.Though Etsy struggled in its early years, as the company lacked focus and offered cushy benefits, over the past year, the stock has been on fire. New CEO Josh Silverman  , cut costs, and refocused the company on growing gross merchandise sales, which  in each of the last four quarters. Etsy has not yet reached the profitability level of other marketplaces like eBay, but the company's specialization in handcrafted goods has made it unique and attractive to both buyers and sellers, giving it a competitive advantage and creating barriers to entry.Like Etsy, Grubhub stock has also been flying higher in recent months. The online restaurant takeout marketplace is the leader in its industry, fending off challenges from start-ups like DoorDash and Postmates, as well as more established competitors like UberEats and Amazon. The stock is up 133% over the last year thanks to both organic growth and smart acquisitions like its purchase of Eat24 from  , which also included a strategic partnership with the recommendation engine. More recently, Grubhub became the exclusive delivery partner of  restaurants KFC and Taco Bell, giving it access to more than 10,000 restaurants nationally. Grubhub continues to see its biggest whitespace opportunity as taking share from traditional delivery ordering channels like the telephone, and the company is adding new markets nationwide, moving away from its core cities like New York and Chicago. Last year, its net income doubled, and the company's profit margin reached 15%. That shows the power of the marketplace model and how Grubhub has leveraged  in its favor. Sellers want to be on the platform with the most buyers and vice versa.Finally, outside the U.S., there are two notable names worth considering as investments -- Alibaba and MercadoLibre. Alibaba is China's leader in online retail, operating marketplaces including Alibaba.com, Tmall, and Taobao. Alibaba.com is primarily geared at foreign shoppers, while Tmall is a platform for brands like  to sell in China, and Taobao more resembles eBay. Thanks to the rapid growth in Chinese e-commerce, Alibaba's sales have surged lately, with revenue jumping 58% to $39.9 billion last year. Adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $5.24, or net income of $10.2 billion, giving it a hefty profit margin of 25.6%, once again leveraging the power of the marketplace model. Compared to JD.com, Alibaba's profits and margins show how a marketplace can be scaled up profitably in a way that direct selling cannot.South of the border, MercadoLibre has emerged as the leading e-commerce operator. The company connects buyers and sellers throughout Latin America and has recently switched up its strategy to offer more free shipping, aping Amazon in a move that seems designed to block out the e-commerce giant in markets like Brazil, where it has expressed interest. As a result, MercadoLibre's revenue growth accelerated to 66% last year, and the stock has more than tripled over the last three years. Again, the benefits of switching costs and network effects have helped MercadoLibre establish itself as the clear e-commerce leader in Latin America.Businesses large and small rely on software to run their e-commerce businesses, and there are two cloud-based providers, or companies who provide  to run e-commerce businesses, that have emerged as promising investments: Shopify, which is focused on North America, and Baozun, which provides its service to companies in China. Again, let's take a look at the pros and cons in this sector.\n  \nThe advantage of investing in such software companies is that they allow investors to benefit from broad exposure to e-commerce, since a wide range of businesses use providers like Shopify and Baozun. Of course, those two face competition within their own industries, but they have emerged as leaders nonetheless.Shopify, which is based in Canada, counts more than 600,000 small and medium-sized businesses as its customers, who use its services to organize their online storefronts, track and manage sales, help with marketing plans, and process payments. The company has four subscription levels -- the highest, Shopify Plus, costs $2,000 a month -- and caters to large companies like  , Red Bull, and  .In part because of the growth of Shopify Plus, Shopify's revenue has continued to surge, increasing 73% last year to $673 million. Shopify has historically operated around breakeven, as the company's strategy has been to plow money into growth to gain market share first before focusing on profitability. Investors have been rewarded, as the stock has climbed nearly 500% since its 2015 IPO. Though concerns have arisen about its valuation, there are plenty of reasons to believe that Shopify can  . Shopify benefits from  , as it's difficult and highly inconvenient for e-commerce businesses to migrate to a new software system once they're up and running with Shopify.Baozun has had similar success to Shopify. The young company has courted the likes of  , Nike, and Starbucks and gives investors exposure to the fast-growing Chinese market. Though Baozun is often compared to Shopify and is even called the Shopify of China, the company  Shopify's offering by providing services such as IT, warehousing, distribution, and customer service. Baozun has also steadily gained market share in China and controls about 25% of the e-commerce services market, nearly triple its nearest competitor. The company is gradually pivoting to higher-margin services rather than direct sales, as services revenue has been growing significantly faster than product revenue.  The company is also modestly profitable, with a profit margin of about 3%. And, like Shopify, the stock is up more than 400% since its 2015 IPO. Baozun's market share gains demonstrate the company's competitive advantages, and its reputation continues to attract more multinational enterprises to its platform.Though smaller as an overall component of the e-commerce sector than the other categories above, delivery and logistics still deserves the consideration of e-commerce investors. Let's take a look at the pros and cons of this category.\n  \nThere's one logistics company in particular that stands out above the others as an intriguing e-commerce stock:  . The freight and logistics specialist is the leader in the last-mile delivery of heavy goods like furniture and appliances, making it a valued partner for retailers like IKEA, Amazon, and  . Home Depot even considered  , a sign of its value to such retailers. XPO shares have surged as the company and CEO Brad Jacobs have successfully executed a roll-up strategy, or acquiring smaller companies to build competitive advantages and eliminate competitors.XPO stock is up nearly 2,000% over the last 10 years, due in large part to Jacobs' strategy, which took the company from being a small logistics provider to the $13 billion industry leader it is today. E-commerce operators large and small rely on XPO for logistics, data analytics, and delivery, which are the \"picks and shovels\" of e-commerce. Much in the way miners in the gold rush relied on picks and shovels to dig for gold, so online retailers need shipping and logistics companies to ensure their merchandise reaches the customer safely and swiftly.Delivery will remain a crucial component of the e-commerce process, and even innovations like drones or autonomous vehicles are unlikely to disrupt the current system for delivering heavy goods. XPO is also focused on developing technology such as drones, so technological advances shouldn't disrupt its leadership.UPS and, to a lesser extent, FedEx both offer exposure to e-commerce logistics, but those companies also do significant business-to-business shipping, meaning XPO is the best way for investors to capture growth in e-commerce delivery.The biggest risk in investing in e-commerce stocks is their valuations. With the exception of eBay, all of the stocks discussed above trade at steep price-to-earnings multiples, meaning that high growth rates are already priced in. Given the long trail of growth ahead for e-commerce with its steady annual growth rate around 15%, investors are valuing e-commerce stocks accordingly and have factored in those opportunities.That means that these stocks will be more volatile than the market average and could be especially vulnerable in a recession or another market crash, as many of them don't have significant profits to underpin their valuations. The optimism that's made many of these stocks outperform in recent years is also likely to disappear in the event of a correction or a bear market, much like other tech-based  .Therefore, e-commerce stocks are best suited to investors with longer time horizons who can more easily endure seeing such holdings potentially lose half of their value or more. Investors who depend on their portfolio for income or wealth preservation would be better off avoiding the sector or treading carefully in it, as it's considerably riskier than the broader market.While it's almost certain that e-commerce itself will continue to grow, the same isn't true for e-commerce stocks due to their valuations. Though most of these companies should be winners over the long term, they are vulnerable to a pullback at any time.For most investors, a basket of the stocks above is the best way to play the e-commerce space. A basket is just another way of diversifying, since owning several of the stocks above will give investors greater exposure to all aspects of e-commerce and mitigate some of the risk in owning these stocks.Your  should determine your approach to e-commerce stocks; investors with a higher risk tolerance will find e-commerce stocks to be a better fit with their investing goals. Of the sectors above, marketplaces are the least risky. They are most likely to be profitable, have the strongest competitive advantages, and should be able to generate profits even in a down economy. Investors who are new to the sector would be best off investing in a marketplace operator and diversifying from there. It's also worth remembering that almost all of these stocks have outperformed the market in any given time frame in recent years, and considering the secular growth in e-commerce, they look poised to continue doing so.One thing is clear. With e-commerce giants like Amazon and JD.com continuing to make investments in things like warehouses, drones, and fulfillment and other advances in technology like voice ordering through Alexa, the ease and convenience of e-commerce will only grow. Online retail will eventually become a multitrillion-dollar market. For investors, there are plenty of ways to take advantage of this massive opportunity.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's one of those \"boring\" stocks that operates in an industry that doesn't get much attention.But if 62% return in 12 months, or a 33% return year to date for an industry leading company with a $8 billion market cap sounds like your idea of an exciting investment, well, WEX is your stock.The company was started in 1983 in South Portland, Maine, as Wright Express. Initially it started as an issuer of fleet cards to the commercial and government car and trucking fleets. Now, its business has expanded into the healthcare and travel sectors as well.While this may seem like a pretty straightforward business with a business cycle that rises and falls with the fortunes of the economy, that isn't where WEX stock finds itself today.The fleet card business is pretty straightforward. Say you are a business - whether you're a trucking firm, a furniture store or an electric utility - that has a fleet or fleets of vehicles. Maybe it's to move other people's products, or deliver your merchandise, or get your people around their territory.Regardless, those vehicles need gas and also need maintenance. Instead of having each driver use their own money to make their runs and then reimburse them all - a bookkeeping nightmare - the business owner gets a fleet card it hands out to its drivers.The fleet card pays for gas, maintenance or whatever else each owner decides the cards can be used for while the workers are on the clock.WEX stock has become a significant player in this space, which means it has also developed significant skills in payment processing and information management solutions. This has helped WEX transition its fleet business into other sectors like healthcare and travel services.So, now you have a company that operates in the trucking business which is exploding because of the rise in e-commerce and same-day delivery services. It operates in the rock-solid and expanding healthcare sector. And it's also a key player in the global expansion of the travel industry through online travel agencies (OTAs).In the latter category for example, WEX works with  ,  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) as well as others. These are some of the biggest names and most important brands in global travel.Its healthcare division helps manage payments through HSAs, HRAs, COBRA, FSAs and various other plans between healthcare providers and the companies that manage these plans. Clients include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  .And then you have the original logistics division which is seeing a complete shift and expansion in its model.

After the stock lost as much as 80% from its peak last year as revenue growth suddenly ground to a halt, the hotel-booking specialist showed signs of life in its third-quarter earnings report. Though revenue continued to slide, that seemed to be by design, as management scaled back on advertising, its biggest expense, to drive a significant improvement in profitability.As a result, the stock surged as much as 26% Wednesday morning. Revenue slipped 12% to 253.7 million euros, but net income came in at 10.1 million euros, reversing a loss of 7.1 million euros a year ago. On a per-share basis, earnings was $0.03, better than expectations of a penny-per-share loss. Beyond the headline numbers, let's take a look at some of the key points management made and what's driving the shift in strategy.Image source: Trivago.In the  , Trivago management signaled that it would focus on profitability after seeing bidding partners like  (NASDAQ: BKNG) and  (NASDAQ: EXPE) cut back on spending on Trivago's platform. However, the market seemed to have underestimated Trivago's ability to pivot toward profitability.In order to do so, Trivago pulled back on advertising, driving a sharp increase in return on advertising spending, or ROAS, which is defined as revenue divided by advertising spending and is one of the company's key performance metrics. Advertising spending fell 28% to $184.3 million, which drove a 25-percentage-point increase in ROAS to 136% in the quarter, the main reason the loss from a year ago flipped to a profit. As a booking platform, the bulk of Trivago's expenses is in marketing and advertising, as the company needs to bring in traffic to give booking referrals to its hotel partners.ROAS was up significantly in all three of the company's operating regions --Europe, Americas, and Rest of World -- and it drove adjusted EBITDA of 26.6 million euros, up from a loss of 7.1 million in the year-ago period. Management noted that ROAS had some seasonality, but the improving returns should lead to profitability increases over the coming quarters.Trivago launched a new app in the quarter, available on Android and iOS, with an improved interface that provides more information to consumers up front to keep them in Trivago's ecosystem longer. The app has improved functionalities and an increased focus on in-app content. As a result of the upgrade, Trivago expects qualified referrals to decline as fewer customers click out to a hotel-booking provider, but it sees revenue per qualified referrals growing as it sends higher-value referrals to its bidding partners.During the quarter, qualified referrals, or the number of visitors who come to the site and click on a hotel listing, fell by 12%, but revenue per qualified referral was flat at 1.32 euros, a positive sign, as that's an improving trend over past quarters. The enhanced app should also pay returns in the future, as user interface functionality is a key component of customer retention, especially in a highly competitive industry like hotel booking.Finally, CFO Axel Hefer said more than a year ago that the threat from Airbnb and similar platforms would be neutralized as hotel-booking platforms like Trivago add more listings like vacation rentals and individual homes, and Trivago is doing just that. Trivago said that the number of its \"alternative accommodation\" listings has increased from more than 250,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to more than 1 million currently, showing that Trivago's efforts to expand into nontraditional listings is paying off. Airbnb, by contrast, has more than 4 million listings on its platform.Management would not disclose the financial impact from the growth of its alternative accommodations, and it's clear whatever growth it accomplished was not enough to reverse the slide in revenue, but like the app upgrade, it should improve the company's brand and positioning in the future as vacation rental platforms like Airbnb continue to take share from traditional hotels.After returning the company to profitability, CEO Rolf Schromgens underscored the intent to rebalance the business on a higher profitability level and then return it to revenue growth through increased advertising spending. With revenue still declining by double digits, it's clear Trivago has work yet to do, but the hotel-booking platform took some important steps in turning around the business in the third quarter.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Trivago wasn't one of them!

However, there are still attractive stocks in the cloud, online travel, and business services industries. Today, three of our Motley Fool contributors will share their favorite high-growth plays in those markets:  (NYSE: VEEV) ,  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , and  (NASDAQ: CTAS) . Veeva Systems provides cloud services for the healthcare industry. The Veeva Vault helps companies track industry regulations, clinical trials, and prescribing habits. The Veeva Commercial Cloud is a CRM (customer relationship management) platform that helps pharmaceutical companies manage their customer relationships.Image source: Getty Images.Veeva enjoys a first-mover's advantage in this niche section of the cloud market, and it serves over 600 customers -- including  ,  , and  . Veeva's growth is boosted by the competition between these companies, which all need access to real-time industry data.Veeva doesn't face much meaningful competition in this market, and it has strong ties to  , the world's top provider of enterprise CRM solutions. Its founder and CEO, Peter Gassner, was previously Salesforce's SVP of Technology, Veeva's CRM platform is powered by Salesforce1, and Veeva's services are integrated into Salesforce's Marketing and Service Clouds.Veeva's revenue rose 23% to $185 million last year, as its non-GAAP EPS grew 27%. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 23% and 59%, respectively, this year. Unlike many other high-growth cloud companies, Veeva is also consistently profitable on a GAAP basis.Veeva's stock looks pricey at nearly 60 times forward earnings, but that  by its market-leading position and strong growth. The healthcare cloud-computing market could still grow from $20.2 billion in 2017 to $35 billion by 2022, according to Research and Markets. This stock still has plenty of room to run. One of the greatest high-growth stocks of all time is Booking Holdings, with its extensive network of online travel websites. The company previously known as Priceline Group made a huge splash when it purchased Booking.com back in 2005, and the strategy behind the deal turned out to be sheer genius. To a greater extent than its rivals, Booking identified the need to go beyond the U.S. to offer the widest possible scope of international travel deals, and the first-mover advantage it captured still keeps competitors at bay. about the slowing growth that Booking Holdings has seen recently. For instance, in its most recent quarterly report, the online travel giant said that revenue grew 17% on a 15% rise in gross bookings, but key metrics like the growth rate in the number of hotel room-nights booked on the site slowed to just 12%. That might sound like a lot, but for those who are used to seeing the 20%-plus figures the company routinely posted just a year ago, it's cause for concern. However, one thing Booking Holdings almost always does is underestimate in its guidance how well it will do in the future. With so many things going for it, Booking Holdings has the capacity to keep growing even as it commands its industry.Image source: Getty Images. When you picture a high-growth company, you probably think of an up-and-coming Silicon Valley tech start-up. What you probably don't think about is a nearly 100-year-old business services company in the Midwest that's already a member of the Fortune 500. And yet, uniform renter Cintas, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and founded during the Great Depression, has grown shareholders' investments  or  over the last five years.Cintas' savvy management team has pursued all of the usual avenues for growth: It has boosted organic revenue by taking market share from smaller competitors in the fragmented North American uniform rental market. It's gobbled up some of those competitors, too, like its recent acquisition of rival G&K Services. And it's used its flexible core business model of delivery truck routes to offer other services besides uniform rental, including floor mat rental, restroom restocking, first aid kit restocking, and fire and safety equipment services.However, even though Cintas' share price has grown more than 300% over the last five years, the company still has room to grow. Cintas is the largest player in the market, but that market is still very fragmented, giving Cintas numerous opportunities to take market share from -- or just acquire outright -- smaller competitors. Meanwhile, demand for Cintas' non-core services like fire and safety have been growing faster than its core uniform rental business's organic growth, offering valuable additional revenue streams.With unemployment low, businesses have more need than ever for all of Cintas' services.

For this reason, many investors are willing to take chances on what they believe to be Investors in these stocks often lose everything \u2026 but they can also end up earning massive profits from a small amount of investment capital. For example,  (NASDAQ:  ) (formerly known as Priceline.com) traded as low as $1.08 per share in 2001. BKNG now trades over $1,982 per share.  (NYSE:  ) fell to 60 cents per share in 2002 following the dot.com crash. AMT now sells for about $145 per share.I cannot guarantee such a comeback for any penny stock of today.

Despite its market cap of only $88 million, it operates in multiple countries and competes with the likes of  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) through its Power Systems division.ARTX also serves as a defense contractor and makes products designed for military, homeland security and law enforcement purposes. Given the Donald Trump administration's commitment to increase defense spending, Arotech could find itself well-positioned to benefit.However, like all hot penny stocks, this play remains speculative. Its revenues for 2017 stood at $98.72 million. Its 2014 revenues were $103.57 million, so this company has struggled with growth. Arotech was founded in 1990, and one of its divisions came into existence in 1971. Hence, the build to these revenues has been slow.The company earned a profit of 17 cents per share in 2017. Still, profits are expected to grow to 18 cents per share in 2018 and 26 cents per share in 2019. This could indicate this company may enjoy some growth. If the company can sustain that growth and speed up its slow growth trajectory, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13 starts to appear very low. 32.8%Tulsa-based  (NASDAQ:  ) is an upstream oil and natural gas producer. As an exploration and production company, times are great when oil prices are high. However, in an environment of low prices, revenue generation becomes a struggle.Fortunately for MCEP stock, crude oil now trades in the $70-per-barrel range, its highest price since 2014.MCEP stock traded as high as $27 per share in 2013. The oil price slump of 2014-16 hit its interests hard. By 2016, MCEP had become a penny stock, trading as low as 73 cents per share at one point. The stock has struggled to gain traction since then, but now trades in the $1.75-per-share range.However, company financials may have begun a turnaround. Revenue fell from $96.91 million in 2014 to $56.1 million by 2016. Although revenues rose to $58.93 million in 2017, analysts estimate revenues will remain below $60 million for both 2018 and 2019.Whether those estimates factor in higher crude prices remains unclear. And at these levels, investors should still consider MCEP stock speculative. However, the stock remained consistently above $20 per share while oil traded above $100 per barrel. If oil can continue to climb higher, perhaps MCEP stock will return to 2013 levels and become one of the hot penny stocks. -35.9%Las Vegas-based  (OTCMKTS:  ) is a marijuana industry holding company. Once limited to vaporizers, it has transformed itself into a full-scale marijuana cultivation construction company. While they had operated only in Nevada, the company landed contracts in California and New York earlier this year.Seeing business come in from across the country shows encouraging signs and could make MCIG one of the top marijuana penny stocks. However, financials also remain sparse. The company saw $1.72 million in revenues in 2016. This grew to $4.78 million in fiscal 2017, and the company made $1.53 million in that fiscal year. The company has brought in over $6 million in the first three quarters of 2018.Still, investors should still treat this as a speculative play. The stock enjoys rapidly rising revenues and profits. However, MCIG stock still trades under 25 cents per share, indicating lingering investor doubts. It has never traded above $1, though it briefly reached 92 cents per share in 2014. Still, it will need to see more growth before becoming one of the hot penny stocks.The current price stands well above the 5-cents-per-share level where the stock traded for most of 2016. If the company can continue gaining traction, its current $91 million market cap could rise much higher. 8.6%Dallas-based  (NASDAQ:  ) has become one of many retailers which have struggled to stay profitable in a changing retail environment. Founded in 1974, the company expanded across the country, operating in 41 states by 2001. During the past few years, the company has been plagued by high turnover in its top management and struggled to remain profitable.Still, the company operates 724 stores across the U.S., which by itself should make it one of the hot penny stocks. Moreover, revenue grew by 10% in its  . Comparable store sales rose by 9.1% in Q1 as well. Investors should also note that the company relocated 58 stores in the last 12 months. At those stores, sales grew by 65%. This latest report held many encouraging signs for the company.However, given that analysts expect net losses for both the current year and the year after, investors should still treat this stock as speculative.Still, a stock price in the $3.30 per share range and a market cap of about $140 million seems low for a company with 724 stores. Traders should also keep in mind that this stock traded at over $22 per share in late 2014. If management can maintain revenue increases and return TUES stock to profitability, those who buy now could enjoy outsized gains from a dramatic comeback.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (Symbol: IVW) where we have detected an approximate $130.1 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.6% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 129,600,000 to 130,350,000).

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2021 put at the $1640 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $104.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.4% return against the $1640 commitment, or a 2.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to BKNG's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $1640 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Booking Holdings Inc sees its shares fall 17.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $1535.40 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $104.60 from $1640), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.8% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Booking Holdings Inc, and highlighting in green where the $1640 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 put at the $1640 strike for the 2.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. Another example of guidance outweighing results, second quarter profits for Booking Holdings came in higher than expected but shares of the parent company of Priceline and booking.com fell on their forecast for the third quarter, Andy. It's the MO of booking.com. They tend to go a little light on the guidance, and they beat it time and time again. Sales are up 20%. Rooms booked were up 12%, that's down a little bit. But all these numbers are above their guidance. It was a nice quarter.One interesting point from the conference call that I took was, the CEO said, \"We're going to see a bit of a slowdown in the third quarter due to the size of our business.\" I'd never heard someone complain about the size of their business impacting the growth. I mean, I can get it. It's a monster company, they do more than $80 billion of bookings a year. But this is a business that's going to grow their revenue in the high single digits for the year on the dollar side, and EPS to be down to flat.They generate a ton of free cash flow, David, and they buy back a lot of stock. That's kind of the story you have for Booking. It's not a cheap stock, but it's also not the super growth story it was a few years ago. It's still a good story. This is one of the most profitable companies on the planet. Speaking of free cash flow, since 2013, even though the company is still at a good size today, free cash flow has more than doubled since 2013 to nearly $5 billion. This is a company churning out a ton of cash, and that should be able to increase going forward, as well. Shares of Etsy up more than 10% this week after second quarter revenue came in 30% higher than a year ago. Jason, I've never bought anything off of Etsy, but they're carving a really nice niche for themselves. Chris, there are a lot of things in life that are hard. Golf is hard. Understanding our tax code is hard. I think existing as a retailer in an  world is hard. I'll tell you, Etsy makes it look really easy. If you look at their numbers, quarter in and quarter out, sellers keeps growing, buyers keeps growing, gross merchandise volume keeps growing. This is obviously a platform that's resonating with a lot of folks out there. It's because it's a great network, it connects buyers with sellers for a very specific offering.It's great brand recognition. It's a capital light model, no inventory on the balance sheet. Nice and profitable, cash flow positive, a holistic solution. There are so many things to like about this business. I really do expect them to continue on this trajectory for many, many quarters to come, if not years to come. They've built out a tremendous offering that's resonated with a lot of people out there. A lot of credit for the company's success over the past year or so is really owed to new CEO Josh Silverman, who stepped in last May. Since that time, the stock is up 300%. He really helped the company focus its strategy. Since that time, margins and free cash flow, like Jason mentioned, have really exploded over the past year. They're really making great progress. They're also talking about, they're going to increase the seller transaction fee a little bit. Exercising a little bit of pricing power. That'll be something we'll want to keep an eye on, but it sounds like they're going to be able to pass that through without any problem at all.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [".

Management gave a cautious outlook for the back half of the year, though, which caused shares to fall following the report. However, this has become par for the course for Booking. If history repeats itself, the pullback is a great buying opportunity.Chart by author. Data source: Booking Holdings quarterly earnings.Gross travel bookings -- the total value of travel services and accommodations booked on the company's family of websites -- easily beat management's 10% to 14% growth estimate given during the  . Combined with a boost from exchange rates (most of Booking's business is done outside of the U.S.), total revenue was up more than 17%.Disciplined advertising, cost control, and share buybacks were the reason for the big jump in earnings per share, which smashed management's guidance of about 10% growth. There was a one-time gain in the company's equity investments, but adjusting for that still yielded a whopping 36.5% gain in the bottom line. There were 2.4% fewer shares outstanding compared with last year due to the company's repurchase program.In spite of Booking's stellar numbers, shares fell more than 5% because of another soft forecast. Total gross bookings are expected to climb 3% to 6% in the third quarter, leading to 6% to 9% growth in revenue and 4% to 7% growth in earnings per share. Those are underwhelming figures considering the pace the company has set over the years, but it's always worth bearing in mind management's  .Image source: Getty Images.It's also important to consider that while the forecast was downbeat, management was still excited about the company's growth prospects in the world travel industry. As outlined at the end of 2017, Booking is working on a more holistic platform to combine all of its various services into a one-stop shop for vacationers. It's still early days, and specific details have been sparse up to this point, but the company is busy behind the scenes bridging its various websites and services in a smart way.For example, RentalCars.com was already moved under the flagship Booking.com site, and Agoda.com and Priceline.com are doing back-end work with each other. Progress also continues in adding unique properties outside of the traditional hotel segment on Booking.com. These unique listings (think Airbnb-type accommodations) are the fastest growing segment of Booking's room-night business.China has also been a key area of focus through the Agoda site. Booking acquired HotelsCombined during the quarter to boost its presence in Asia even further. The new member of the family will report to the meta-search KAYAK segment. A  ride-hailing service was also signed last quarter, further increasing Booking's presence in the world's most populous country by integrating its travel services directly into the Didi app.Thus, even though guidance seemed weak, Booking's solid second-quarter numbers and expansion efforts can give investors hope that this was just another round of cautious commentary. The stock drop looks like nothing more than another chance for investors to scoop up shares of a best-in-class travel company at a big discount from just a few days ago.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Also, revenues were up 20.8% sequentially and 16.9% from the prior-year quarter.On a year-over-year basis, both the agency and merchant businesses showed strong momentum. Room nights, Rental cars and airline tickets, all performed impressively. On the call, management stated that the company will continue to focus on investments in people, systems and marketing, with a long-term outlook.Despite strong results, its share price declined 5.02% in after-hours trading due to lower-than-expected guidance for the third quarter.Overall, we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market, Booking Holdings' strong position in the international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position.However, weaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs.

Agency revenues increased 21.4% sequentially and 10% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising & Other revenues were down 9.5% sequentially but up 34.5% from a year ago. These are basically non inter-company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable.On a year-over-year basis, room nights volumes increased 12%. Also, rental car days increased 1% and airline tickets were up 5.3%.Booking Holdings' room night growth is attributable to geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from the local and international players.Booking Holdings' overall bookings were up 14.9% (11% in constant currency) from the year-ago quarter and also ahead of management's guided range.Merchant bookings were up 68.7% from the prior-year quarter and agency bookings increased 6.4% from the year-ago level.Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $1.3 billion, up 35% from the year-ago quarter.Booking Holdings' operating income was up 36.7% year over year.

In the case of  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , the online travel company often makes forward projections that prove to be unnecessarily pessimistic. That typically creates a cycle in which the parent company of Booking.com is able to  , only to send some investors into a panic about guidance for the coming quarter.Booking Holdings took the unusual step of delaying the release of its second-quarter financial report from Wednesday afternoon to Thursday morning, and some investors had already taken that as a negative sign. The online travel specialist's numbers were solid, but projections for the third quarter that were weaker than investors had wanted to see created another round of share-price declines. Those who argue that markets are efficient have to see this repeated phenomenon as evidence against their views, but the pattern doesn't appear likely to change anytime soon.Image source: Booking Holdings.As those who've watched the company before can guess, Booking's second-quarter results were able to outpace what the company had originally forecast. Revenue was higher by 17% to $3.54 billion, which was stronger than the 14% growth that those following the stock had projected. Adjusted net income came in just over the $1 billion mark, rising 32% from year-ago levels and producing adjusted earnings of $20.67 per share. That was far above the company's own projections for between $16.35 and $17 per share on the bottom line.Fundamentally, Booking Holdings continued to deal with the long-term slowdown in growth rates that we've seen lately. Gross bookings were up 15% to $23.9 billion, with favorable currency impacts adding 4 percentage points to the figure. That number surpassed the downbeat guidance of 10% to 14% growth that Booking had initially given. A nearly 70% jump in merchant bookings was able to pull up the company's overall growth rate, with agency bookings rising at a troublingly slow 6% pace.Most of Booking's travel categories kept seeing weaker performance as well. On the hotel side, room-nights sold came in 12% higher at 190.5 million, down from a 21% growth rate a year ago but topping the guidance range of 7% to 11% growth. Rental-car day counts were up just 1% to 20.9 million. Only the airline segment did better, with 1.9 million tickets representing 5% growth from year-ago levels, bouncing back from losses throughout much of 2016 and 2017.CEO Glenn Fogel said little to add color to the report, noting only that \"Booking Holdings achieved strong results for the second quarter.\" The CEO did call out gains in adjusted earnings as being particularly impressive. appears to be intact in the company's assessment. In Fogel's words, \"We will continue to execute on our long-term strategy to drive profitable growth and invest in capabilities to increase customer loyalty and build a larger direct business.\"The company's guidance predictably painted a less favorable picture for the future for those investors who haven't gotten used to the way Booking Holdings typically handles its future projections. The online travel company says it expects hotel room-night bookings to rise 6% to 9% in the third quarter, with gross bookings picking up just 3% to 6% from year-ago figures. Revenue growth of 6% to 9% should produce adjusted net income between $1.76 billion and $1.81 billion, translating to adjusted earnings of $36.70 to $37.70 per share. Those numbers were well below the nearly $40 per share consensus forecast among those following the stock.As a result, Booking Holdings investors generally looked panicked by the outlook, and the stock dropped 6% in  following the announcement. It's always possible that the online travel giant's results will actually be as bad as its forecast suggests this time, but for the vast majority of times in the past, that hasn't proven to be the case.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Booking Holdings was mixed.

But several well-known tech and biotech stocks could afford to invest in their businesses, buy back their shares and pay dividends, if only they chose to.When it comes to returning cash to shareholders, corporate management often prefers stock buybacks to dividends because it gives them flexibility. A company can adjust its share repurchases according to business and market conditions. A dividend is a commitment. The market often exacts severe and swift revenge if a company cuts or suspends its payout.The initiation of a dividend can also be taken as a sign that a company or stock's best days are behind it. A quick look at Apple's (  ) performance shows that's not necessarily the case. The company reinstated its dividend in 2012 after a 17-year hiatus. Between price appreciation and payouts,  has delivered a total return of about 170% since March 2012, when it announced plans to reinstate its dividend later that year - the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up about 130% over the same span, including dividends.The following five stocks don't yet offer dividends, but they should ... and could.

But it could afford to give them more.Even after share repurchases and interest payments on debt, Adobe generated free cash flow - the mother's milk of dividends - of $2.6 billion during the 12 months ended June 1.Market value: $861.4 billionAnalysts' opinion: 24 strong buy, 4 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellAlphabet (  , $1,238.16), the corporate parent of Google, is another technology giant with such outsize growth prospects that it can get away with not paying a dividend.But the fact remains that it easily could - even after European regulators hit it with a record $5 billion antitrust fine.The search giant's revenue is forecast to increase 23% this year and 19% next year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Earnings are expected to increase at an average annual rate of 18% for the next five years.Alphabet is plowing investments into the next big things. It has artificial intelligence, machine learning and virtual reality in its sights, and it's already a major player in cloud-based services. But it's still swimming in cash.The company had $102 billion in cash and short-term investments as of June 30 and just $3.9 billion in long-term debt, according to S&P  Intelligence. Alphabet bought back $6.3 billion of its own shares over the 12 months ended June 30, and still generated $22 billion in free cash flow, so it clearly has the financial means to initiate a dividend without risking its R&D.Market value: $69.0 billionAnalysts' opinion: 17 strong buy, 1 buy, 7 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellIt might be time for Biogen (  , $344.21) to start paying a dividend.It wouldn't be the first big biotechnology stock with slower growth prospects to do so. After all, peers such as Amgen (  ) and Gilead Sciences (  ) pay dividends with yields of 2.7% and 2.9%, respectively.A dividend also could help smooth out some of the volatility that BIIB investors have had to deal with. Mixed results from a mid-stage clinical trial of Biogen's promising Alzheimer's drug made July a month to remember. Biogen rose more than 30% between June 29 and July 25 ... but the stock is down by double digits ever since.Expected top-line growth isn't as explosive as Alphabet and Adobe, at just 7% this year and 3% next year. Annual long-term earnings growth is promising, though, at nearly 8% for BIIB, according to Thomson Reuters.Biogen bought back $3 billion of its own stock over the 12 months ended June 30, while generating $3.9 billion in free cash flow even after paying interest on debt. Biogen certainly can afford to return more cash to shareholders.Market value: $98.4 billionAnalysts' opinion: 15 strong buy, 4 buy, 8 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellBooking Holdings (  , $2,029.71), the online travel website operator formerly known as Priceline.com, has sturdy growth prospects, but it's not like they're accelerating anymore.Analysts expect earnings to increase at an average annual rate of 14.7% for the next five years. That compares with average annual earnings growth of 15.6% over the past five years - in other words, good, but slowing down. Revenue is forecast to rise 19% this year and 12% in 2019.Booking's strategy of growth through acquisitions and investments hasn't precluded it from buying back its own stock - or generating ample free cash flow. The company repurchased $2.3 billion in BKNG shares in the 12 months ended March 31. It also generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow after paying interest on debt.Booking's shareholders aren't clamoring for a dividend, but it absolutely could afford to initiate one. That would ensure a little extra total return and perhaps tamp down what historically has been a relatively volatile stock.Market value: $515.9 billionAnalysts' opinion: 25 strong buy, 3 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellFacebook (  , $177.78) set a record for the most market value wiped out in a single trading session when the stock lost 19%, or $120 billion, on July 26. That came on fears that it has entered a new era of slower revenue growth and narrower profit margins. Shares have drifted lower ever since.Earnings that have grown at an average annual rate of 64% for the past five years are now expected to rise \"only\" 21% a year for the next half-decade. Revenue is forecast to increase 37% this year, but \"just\" 25% next year.If Facebook's days of outrageous growth (relatively speaking) really are over, one thing it could do to sweeten the pot for its stock is to start paying a dividend. It has more than enough firepower to do so and still pour resources into acquisitions, research and development.Facebook had $42.3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of June 30 - and no long-term debt against it. It bought back $6.7 billion of its own stock during the 12 months ended June 30, while generating $11.3 billion in free cash flow. Returning some more of that cash to shareholders could go a long way toward rebuilding faith in  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking Holdings (  ), formerly The Priceline Group (PCLN), is due with its Q2 results in the after-hours today, and analysts polled by Capital IQ expect the company to report a profit of $17.36 per share on revenue of $3.45 billion.BKNG demonstrates an aggressive tendency to widen its next day share movement following an extended-hours earnings release, doing so for 38 of the past 58 quarters, or 66% of the time.Looking deeper into the performance data, longs should be aware that BKNG has seen a positive extended-hours earnings-driven trade in 33 of the 58 quarters we've tracked, and in 22 of those upside extended-hours moves the stock has followed that trade with a more aggressive positive run in the next day's regular session, or 67% of the time.Shorts too may see some more aggressive next-day trade.

That's the day we're publishing. We publish every Wednesday, late afternoon here on the East Coast of the United States of America.

That's The Motley Fool family of podcasts, and I enjoy each a little bit every month. I hope you do, too. I hope you're having a great summer.Last week, we had a lot of fun talking about stocks that I picked a few years ago. We reviewed a five-stock sampler from 2016 and saw that those stocks are dead on the market. They are up, the market is up, too, so they have not yet distinguished themselves as above or below the market after two years. It's been a good market. I like the companies, I certainly like them going forward. Please listen back for our Brexit-inspired stock list if you feel inspired. You might also enjoy the five new stocks that I picked last week, five stocks celebrating the World Cup, looking four years forwards, since that's when the next Men's World Cup will be. That five-stock sampler there for you on July 4th, if you didn't get a chance to listen in on America's birthday.This week, it's time for something entirely different. In fact, this week, I'm going to use as my format the title of a book that I enjoyed reading more than a decade ago. It's by John Allen Paulos, the Temple University academic, the longtime writer and thinker about numbers and innumeracy. You might have read his wonderful book, I did,  , which shows us how we can up our game as readers and citizens around math, especially as we read newspapers, watch media studies put out on television channels. We can be a little bit savvier about statistics and mathematics. That's important for a well-functioning democracy.John Allen Paulos, years ago, wrote a book called  . That's my format for this week's podcast. What you're going to get this week is a  , not reading the newspaper, but looking at FAANG stocks. If you don't already know what that phrase is, I'll explain that in a second. This is a  . What I want to do is share with you a number of thoughts I had as I perused a recent article on the subject. We're going to have a few points, brief meditations across a few dynamics about FAANG stocks. That's what I have for you this week.In fact, I first started to speak to this a little bit a couple of years ago on this podcast. It was April 20th of 2016. That one was called What The Top 3 Stocks Of 2015 Have In Common. That was a fun podcast to do, because among other things that they had in common, we had picked all three of them in our services. That's nice to know, that the top three stocks in 2015 were all Motley Fool picks.But, I was reviewing those, and I was starting to talk about this idea of using an acronym to describe a set of companies, and what that means for our thinking and what that can mean for your investing. I have to admit, my cards on the table at the start, I'm a little cynical about using phrases like FAANG stocks. That'll no doubt come through on this week's podcast. But I want to think deeper with you and become better at thinking not just about investing, but about how we read things, how we take in information, and do we have the right lens perched on the end of our nose as we look as investors at how the media covers the stock market. That's definitely part of what we're doing today.There's another book. I was just reviewing my Amazon book purchases over the years. I actually bought this one on May 27th, 1999, Amazon tells me. It's a devilish little book called  . That one goes through my mind, as well. When you start talking about how the media reflects numbers, they say, \"This study has proven this or that thing,\" or, \"This is how we're going to look at the stock market,\" the use of graphs can be very misleading for people. by Darrell Huff cynically and humorously shows you how you can put up graphs in newspapers -- I won't name any particular newspaper, but you can imagine infographics can sometimes be used to mislead people. Sometimes, you won't even see the x-axis or y-axis label. Sometimes the actual scaling of the axes is questionable. Sometimes, what data went into the studies in the first place are questionable.So,  and  . If you've read either of those books, you're already a step ahead of listening to this week's podcast.OK, so what was the article I read a couple of weeks ago that I want to reflect on? The title of that article, this was on Bloomberg, it was a Bloomberg opinion piece, is, \"The $1 Trillion Market Cap Race Is A Zero-Sum Game.\" The article was written on July 3rd of 2018. If you just want to Google the phrase \"Bloomberg opinion trillion,\" it will be the top link, at least of July 2018. You can find it pretty quickly. It's by somebody that I don't know named Jim Bianco. \"The $1 Trillion Market Cap Race Is A Zero-Sum Game.\" That's what we're going to be thinking through. I'm not going to take you all the way through this article, I'm certainly not going to read the article to you. Feel free to enjoy reading it yourself. That's what we're going to be looking at.Earlier, I used the phrase FAANG stocks. I know many people listening to this podcast already recognize that as a commonly used acronym referring to some of the great companies and stocks of our time. I've variously heard FANG as Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google; sometimes I hear it phrased with two A's, FAANG -- Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. One of the things this article does is introduce a couple of additional letters. I'll be making a point about that later.One thing the article we're talking about this week does is, it adds a couple of extra letters, so let's make sure that we define our terms right now, up front. It's using a six-letter acronym to describe earthshaking, big-time players on the markets today, companies that have huge market caps that have made big gains. The premise of the article, which was implicit in the title I read to you, is that it's a \"zero-sum game.\" These companies are winning, and everything around them seems to be losing. Here is the six-letter acronym used in the article -- FAANMG. For our purposes this week, I'll be pronouncing that as FANG stocks. But, FAANMG could be said differently. I'm not sure how we would refer to it other than FANG. It's Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix,  (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Google.In that spirit of those six letters and the concept of FANG stocks, I'm going to make six points this week, each organized with those same six letters. I have six points, and each of my points will start with those letters -- F, then A, then A, then N, then M, then G. Now you see the full rules of the game that we're playing this week.That brings us to reflection No. 1. This is the F reflection. I'm going to go here with the two words Foolery works. I think most people listening to this podcast know that The Motley Fool name comes from Shakespeare. Specifically, The Motley Fool name comes from act 2, scene 7 of the play As You Like It. It was indeed I who was flipping through a book of quotes,  , about 25 years ago, trying to figure out what we would call the newsletter for our parents' friends that The Motley Fool started out as.I loved the concept of The Fool, the one who could challenge conventional wisdom, the one who could tell the king or queen the truth, the only member of the court to be able to say the emperor has no clothes when necessary. The Fool got away with that because he had license to do so. It was part of his or her role within the court to be able to tell the truth, but of course, to do so with humor and with wit. I loved the idea of The Motley Fool, and I certainly love even more what The Motley Fool has become 25 years later. Foolery works.In fact, one of my favorite Shakespeare quotes, we used it a lot for our old Motley Fool radio show, we would open up each show with this quote: \"Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun. It shines everywhere.\" That comes from Twelfth Night, where there's another great Fool, Feste, who says that. Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb. It spins around the earth like the sun. It shines everywhere. And while that was supposed to be a negative comment on humanity, that there's foolishness everywhere, we flipped that and made it a great way to open up The Motley Fool radio show.Similarly, I'm opening up this week with my F as Foolery works. As I look over the FAANMG stocks -- let's do this together -- I'm going to ask you the same question I asked on this show a couple of years ago, what's your FANG score? There are two ways of scoring your FANG score. We're going to do that right here. One way is the way I did two years ago. I want you to ask yourself, do you own the stock? If so, for how long? For how many years have you owned the stock? Let's go over these six. I'm going to give you my FANG score, and I'm going to encourage you to come up with your own FANG score. The first is just how many years have you held it.If you are a  and  subscriber, in 2012, we recommended Facebook. We've held Facebook in  for six years, so that's six. Apple is next. I first recommended Apple in Motley Fool Stock Advisor in 2008. That was ten years ago. Six plus ten is 16. Amazon, I first recommended for Motley Fool  in 2002. That's 16 years ago, plus 16, makes 32. Netflix, I first recommended in 2004. That's 14 years ago. 14 on top of 32 is 46. Microsoft, I have never recommended, so unfortunately, I missed that one. We're going to give ourselves a zero for that. If you've held Microsoft for any amount of time, feel free to add to your own FANG score for that one. And finally, Google, I recommended shortly after its IPO. In my case, it was in 2008. That was 10 years ago. That brings my FANG score to 56. Foolery works.If you are a longtime  and  subscriber and you've acted on our advice, you've held those six companies for a combined total of 56 years at this point and counting. That's because each of them -- with the exception of Microsoft, which is still not an active recommendation -- remains an active recommendation here, six, ten, or 16 years later. All of them are winners that we've let run. Foolery works.Here's another way, a second, new way to calculate your FAANG score. This will take a little bit more time, but I've done the homework myself, so I'll give you mine. What multiple of each of those investments does that represent for you? For example, Facebook is up 7X in value for us since 2012, so that's a seven-bagger. I'll just go straight down the list really quickly. Apple has been a nine-bagger for us. Amazon has been a 113-bagger for us. Netflix has been a 179-bagger from our first recommendation in October 2004. A couple of months later, I recommended it again. That one's actually a 225-bagger, because it dropped from October to December of 2004, and we reupped it. But I'm just counting the first instance of each of our active recommendations, so I'll just count Netflix for a 179-bagger. Microsoft is a zero-bagger. Still have never recommended the stock. Finally, Google, since 2008, this isn't as impressive as you might think, is a four-bagger. If you add up all of those FANG scores measured by baggers, that's 312 times around the bases for investors who've patiently and Foolishly held on to those companies over the course of time.Reflection No. 1, my F reflection this week for you, is Foolery really does work. This is not a backward-looking thing at companies and their performance. In each of these cases, we've actively recommended these to you, our dear members, our paying subscribers, and said, \"Buy this one.\" Whether it was Amazon in 2002, still holding; or Google in 2008; Facebook in 2012; etc., Foolery works.Reflection No. 2, A. The first of our two A reflections is: appreciate capitalism. Certainly, there are some poor forms, there are some crony forms, of capitalism. There are some abusive companies out there. Often, sadly, those companies get a lot of the headlines. But underneath those kinds of bad stories, there's almost infinite good. The tremendous efforts, not just of these companies, but by every for-profit company trying to do good by their customers, create a product that is useful, create a service or experience that is memorable -- all of these things are humanity coming together, working in teams, trying to create things that are of benefit to others, that you or I would pay for, would buy, as customers, and maybe pay above their costs so they can make a little profit and grow their enterprise. Appreciate capitalism.I don't think that capitalism is a zero-sum game. A point of debate I have with this particular article, it's right there in the headline, the trillion-dollar market cap race is a zero-sum game. Each of these companies has been growing its market. While part of the premise of these kinds of articles these days is that only a handful of companies are really prospering, and everybody else is just treading water in this market environment, how did those companies even get to the point where they are today over the last five, ten, or 15 years? The answer is, they did a great job for their customers.Even a company like  , which is not listed in the FAAMNG acronym, in addition to prospering greatly on its own and for its shareholders and all of its stakeholders, I see far more mom-and-pop coffee shops around me today than I did before Starbucks showed up 30 years ago. I don't believe, for the most part, that capitalism is a zero-sum game. Business is not zero-sum. These companies are great examples of that.In fact, how long have each of these companies actually been around? Microsoft has been around for more than 30 years, but a few of these companies haven't been around for much more than a decade. Part of the reason we should appreciate capitalism, and it works, is that the big movers and shakers of today haven't been the overdogs of yesterday, and haven't been these oligarchical, dominant things for the last century. No. In fact, most of these are really upstarts, if you think about the world of business. That says something very good about letting innovation happen, and about upstarts coming out and unseating the power of the past. There's something really wonderful about capitalism. Of these FAANG stocks, none of them even existed when I was born in 1966. That's a remarkable thing to reflect on, and it shows how well our system works.Reflection No. 3. We've been through FA, here comes the second A. The second A is: acronyms reveal. We've already said Foolery works, appreciate capitalism, and acronyms reveal. I think it's really funny that people have taken to grouping a few companies together -- this has happened for a few years now -- and refer to them using an acronym. The reason I think that's funny is, if you've noticed, the acronym keeps changing. That reveals something for me. When you try to lock down and just say FANG is Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, well, all the sudden, a few other companies show up and look like those companies, so we add an additional A. Or, for this article, we're throwing in an M, as well. Acronyms reveal.The first thing that acronyms reveal to me is, since we can't keep the acronym constant, probably, the system is more dynamic and less zero-sum than most of us would be led to believe. In fact, when I did my episode a couple of years ago that I mentioned earlier, which is the April 20th, 2016, you can probably still Google it and listen to it, if you'd like -- What The Top 3 Stocks Of 2015 Have In Common.After that, I was starting to make jokes that the phrase FANG missed  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , which, at the time, was among the top five stocks of the last ten years that were being written about in articles a couple of years ago. These days, Priceline renamed itself to Booking Holdings. That company is a true, worldwide leader, but because the letters P and B didn't seem to fit the acronym, it's never really been mentioned, even though, for Stock Advisor members, Priceline is up 87X since we first recommended it. That's way more successful than Facebook's seven-bagger or Apple's nine-bagger. But, because the letter doesn't seem to fit the acronym, we forget about one of the worldwide leaders, and a great company unto itself.In fact, I remember tweeting out a couple of years, PNNA is the new FANG, because Priceline had outperformed Netflix. It was the No. 1 stock at the time, so I was making a joke that PNNA is the new FANG, and trying to confuse people on  by using No. PNNA and suggesting it's better than FANG. If you were casually watching, you wouldn't really have understood what was going on or what I meant at the time. Now, I guess I would say BNNA, since it's Booking Holdings, is the new FANG. The key point here is, acronyms reveal. They reveal that we really can't put our arms around any given set of companies because we'd be excluding others when the letters don't fit, or the numbers start changing.One other thing that acronyms reveal for me -- this is my own opinion, I can't back it up with data, it's just pure intuition, but I'm going to submit to you that I think that most of the people who actually frame things up in this way, who say \"FANG stocks,: who search the internet for the phrase \"FANG stocks\" or listen for it in articles or on television, I'm going to submit to you that most of the people who frame things up this way don't actually have a very big FANG score themselves. That's just a guess. When people are looking for something hot, and they start creating trends in their heads and use acronyms to reveal them, I'm betting, in most cases, those people weren't investing in those companies five, ten, or 15 year ago, and they're looking for what was hot last year as a way to figure out how to get started for this year and next.So, I think acronyms can reveal a lot to us. By paying attention to language, which is something that I've always done very naturally as a writer myself, an English major back in the day, and something that I know a lot of you do, and I've always encouraged us to look hard at language. That's one of the things I'm doing this week with this reflection No. 3, acronyms reveal.Reflection No. 4, we've gotten to the letter N. In the FANG long-form acronym, that stands for Netflix. On this podcast, N will stand for names change. In some ways, this is a continuation of my previous point about acronyms and how they change. Names change. I want to mention, going back to that Bloomberg opinion article, which has inspired a portion of this podcast, I want to give you what the subtitle of that article is. It reads like this. \"The stock market values of a few technology companies are increasing at the expense of legacy businesses.\" Names change.How about this name -- the phrase in that subtitle, \"technology companies?\" That's a funny concept for me. I've said this for more than a decade. I remember when we would go on CNBC back in the day, and they'd be saying, \"Now here to talk about tech stocks are David and Tom Gardner, The Motley Fools.\" I would start by saying, \"You guys can call these tech stocks. I don't call them tech stocks.\" I don't really know what the phrase \"tech stock\" means. For a long time, I've invited you as my listener or my fellow Fool to question the words around us. Names change.Technology stocks, maybe in 1950, made some sense to me, when there was a company like  but not that many others, or when  starts, and the PC comes online. But since the age of computers and now the internet and information technology and social media, and we're not even talking about things like virtual reality. The bones, the foundations that our business world is built on today, technology runs through it all.In that article subtitle, to say the stock market values of a few technology companies, doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Really, when I look at these six FAANMG stocks, I see completely different businesses. What Google is doing with search, but oh, by the way, also with Uber and autonomous cars, or, did we talk about YouTube? Even within Google, it's doing completely different things, operating in different businesses. That's to say nothing of a company like Netflix, which is entertainment streaming, or Microsoft, which is clouded as a business, a huge cloud business with its Azure business today, in addition to the Xbox. How about Amazon's Web Services clouded business, existing right alongside a place where I could buy John Allen Paulos' book,  ? Haven't even talked about Facebook or Apple. I don't have to go through all six companies. Each of these companies themselves is itself operating in completely different businesses. Yes, technology runs through them all and through much of their competition. Names change.I'm going to quote a little bit from this article for you now. \"These six stocks alone,\" the author wrote in the article, \"pushed the S&P 500 up 2.66%.\" That's since December of 2017. That's, admittedly, the near-term focus of this article. It goes on to say that the other 494 stocks in the S&P 500 were collectively down 0.4%. Overall, the S&P was up just over 2%. So, the perception is, these six companies were all of the gain, and all of the others were actually down.\"This is not just a U.S. phenomenon,\" the author goes on to say, \"the next chart adds Twitter,  ,  ,  ,  , and  to the FAAMNGs to form a group we call \"The Disruptors.\" Since the start of November, this group pushed up the  World Stock Index by 1.6%.\" I'm not going to go through too much more of this.The two big takeaways here are, one, by enlarging the group and adding some more letters and names, and then giving them a new name -- names change. Calling them \"The Disruptors,\" we can now make a big point about the world markets. That's big point No. 1.Big point No. 2, hilariously to me, most of these companies are  or  stocks. It's funny to me that they're inventing a new phrase, \"The Disruptors,\" to refer to this group. Now, we've added enough companies in that we can't use an acronym anymore, so we invent a new phrase. I think you and I, as longtime listeners of this podcast, or even longer-time members, might just call them, instead of The Disruptors, say it with me, the  ! The methodology that I've talked about for three years on this podcast has led us to find all of these companies not last year or since December 2017, but in fact, has led us to find them and hold them for years and years to great profit.Yes, I think, going back to my point No. 1, Foolery works. To the title of this podcast, as a  looking at FAANG stocks, I can't help but notice that  are what are winning worldwide, whether we're talking about U.S. domestic stocks or the real innovators globally. What runs through  is not merely disruption, but I would say innovation, a great ability to constantly innovate and innovate at scale.Those are the stocks you and I want to own. Yes, these are the stocks that we have, if we've been Motley Fool members for a long time, owned for quite a while. To close reflection No. 4, names change. Sometimes company names won't fit acronyms. Sometimes the world changes. Sometimes what we mean by technology changes. Names change.Reflection No. 5, we've reached M. This is a particularly American reflection. Phrase five, this one came to me from my producer this week, Anne Henry. I was like, \"Anne, I need something for M. Here's the point I want to make. But like others who create mnemonics with acronyms, I need to fit certain words or phrases to make it spell something.\" I needed to make this fit M. And Anne said, \"Aren't you just saying that they're made in America?\" Each of these is a two-word phrase this week, so, made American.With reflection No. 5, I think we should briefly reflect on that. Isn't it interesting that these FAAMNG stocks all happen to come from one country in the world? You'd think, if this was all random, it would be randomly and evenly distributed globally. And indeed, I think we'd be a stronger planet if that were the case. My hope for our future, my hope for your future, is that you live in a world where these companies come from all over the place.They could have come from anywhere. But the reality is, there are a few key ingredients that are part of America today that are not present in many other places around the world that has made it so that America -- this is a little bit of a Chauvinistic point, a national pride point. Nationalism is not going to invade the  podcast here for very long, but briefly here with reflection No. 5, indeed, all of these companies came from the United States of America, and, most of them in just the last couple of decades.Is that a coincidence? I don't think so. I think that capitalism, practiced well by visionary entrepreneurs who gain backing from places like Silicon Valley, where there is capital, seeking a better world, go on to take their widget, their great product or service or website, and start to improve lives of people who say, \"I want to use that product or service. I will pay you for that. I will give you my money, my time. It's worth it to me.\" It's an incredibly powerful one-two combination, when good ideas meet good capital in fertile soil that we've always had here since the United States of America was born in the year 1776. Now, you see what it looks like.The rest of the world can participate, too. In fact, if you're not an American, I hope that you look on with, I'm not going to say envy, because that's kind of negative. How about admiration for these companies? I realize these companies are in the headlines. Facebook has gotten a lot of criticism for what happened in the last U.S. presidential election. Netflix made some horrible mistakes in 2011 that sunk its stock badly. Microsoft has had the Department of Justice go after it. Some people think that Amazon should be broken up. I realize there are always fair questions to ask of these kinds of companies. My fair question, which I think maybe isn't asked enough, is, how did these all start in one place? Why? What can we learn about that? What can the rest of the world emulate about that to lead to even more great companies starting in other places worldwide? Reflection No. 5, made American, that's our M point.Briefly, before I close with our final reflection this week, I want to speak to the idea of whether something like Amazon should be \"broken up.\" I think it would be a huge mistake for us, in this case, as American readers of a Bloomberg opinion piece, to conclude -- after reading a headline, \"The $1 Trillion Market Cap Race Is a Zero-Sum Game\" -- that something like Amazon has gotten too powerful and should be broken up.On the one hand, most of the companies we're talking about this week didn't even exist a couple of decades ago. On the other hand, do you truly think that in the next 20 years, the world won't change again, and new leaders won't arise? Yes, indeed, they will.I'd also like to point out that these are great American assets for me and my fellow Americans. These companies are world leaders. If we as Americans begin suggesting that's what's going on here has gotten too big and powerful and needs to be broken up, I think we'll really reduce our standing worldwide. If we were to start taking the best players on our team and saying, \"They need to sit on the bench some,\" or, \"We need to trade them away,\" guess what's going to happen? Other places worldwide will gain from our losses. For example, I doubt the Chinese government is going to start taking its equivalents, companies like Baidu or others, and start breaking them up.I think as Americans -- this is my made American point here -- we should be pretty big fans of propping up these companies. Think about a company like  in South Korea, how much it means to South Korea, how proud Koreans are of Samsung. I think we Americans should remember to take serious pride in the made in U.S.A. nature of these FANG companies, full stop.Reflection No. 6, to close this week, we're down to G. G in the FANG stocks acronym stands for Google, which is kind of funny, since the company's name is Alphabet now. Names do change, don't they, back to reflection No. 4. I'm going to go with this G -- generalizations mislead.Generalizing can be helpful. It's helpful to start seeing connections between things and grouping them up ... until we go too far with it. I would say now, in the third or fourth or fifth year of people using the phrase \"FANG stocks,\" we're starting to mislead ourselves and head fake ourselves into what's actually happening in the world if we think that's a meaningful set of companies.I've already shown, from the article we're looking at, that the author begins to broaden and add in ten other companies worldwide that start to fit. You start to see a more amorphous grouping, and no longer an acronym. Within that amorphous grouping, you have wildly different businesses. Tesla was mentioned and Twitter. Could Tesla and Twitter be any more different as businesses from each other? I don't think so. Generalizations mislead.In fact, it would be misleading to even think that these had been the best stocks over the last ten years. Yes, they've been awesome picks for  and  members who've shown patience. By the way, if you're not already a member of  and  , I highly suggest you sign online to  and take a 30-day free trial and check us out. I hope you'll join us if you're not yet a member. It would be misleading to think that these have been the best stocks. Sometimes, articles like this make you think that's been the case.The truth is, as I mentioned earlier, a company like Priceline, now Booking Holdings, has far outperformed Google. Or  , which I haven't mentioned at all this podcast, has been a wonderful 47-bagger for Stock Advisor members, which is way ahead of most of FANG stocks.In fact, when you start generalizing and saying, \"These six companies have been all of the gain of the S&P 500 since December,\" even that's a little silly. Among the other 494 stocks, some of those have outperformed the six. Some of those other 494 have been incredible picks, and others have been really bad. Balanced out, they about equal 0, as it turns out, while these so-called six companies are up 2.5% to explain most of the gains. But what the author is doing there is cherry-picking a small group of companies. You could cherry-pick a separate group of companies and make the same point. Generalizations mislead.I think it's worth noting that these are the big players. These are the index drivers. When you have a market cap of $100 billion, that's going to push an index far more than a stock that has a market cap of $1 billion. That's just 1/100th of the size of one of these companies.Here's another generalization I don't want you to make, I don't want you to mislead yourself about -- do you think that these so-called FAANMG stocks are the best-performing stocks over the next 20 years? I certainly don't. I think, again, a lot of people are generalizing and head faking themselves into thinking those are the ones to own. Yes, I love each of these companies. I even love Microsoft, though I've missed recommending it. I wish I had recommended it, it's been a great performer the last five, three, and one years. Microsoft under Satya Nadella has been an incredibly great company.But, as much as you or I may love any or all of these six companies we've focused on this week, the truth is, they're going to underperform the big performers of the next 20 years. In some cases, they're so large. It's just hard for Apple to double or triple again from the size where it is today. You and I might own Apple. I do. I think it's a great company. But if I'm looking for the big winners of the next five, ten, 15 years that we talk about on this podcast, you'd want to be looking at much smaller companies, emerging companies. Going back to reflection No. 1, Foolery works.Using our  principles, I think you're well on your way to start figuring out what those new companies are. But, generalizations mislead. Don't be fooled into thinking that these are the stocks to own for the big winners of the next generation. Some of these companies may be dramatically disrupted in the way that  has been over the last 30 years and won't look anything like they do today 20 years from now.On this podcast, and with my investment strategy and approach at The Motley Fool, the  approach, we're always looking not backward but forward at the future, asking, what are the next leaders? Who's innovating? Can we please get our money there as early as possible, holding for as long as possible, together?Alright, there you have it! A  . I do appreciate the article that was written. Jim Bianco, I've never met him, I probably never will. I really haven't focused that much on his article. I'm glad that people are caring enough to write about stocks. I don't have a lot to say about the man or his work. I did want to use this opportunity to talk some about these companies and go over our six points, which, to close, are: Foolery works, appreciate capitalism, acronyms reveal, names change, made American, and, generalizations mislead. A  .That's all she wrote for this week. Next week, I'm really excited to be welcoming back my brother Tom Gardner and our longtime producer, Mac Greer, for a continuation, the second in our series, a  . We did this a few months ago, got a great reception. I've asked Mac Greer to go back, find more quotes and quips from past CEOs, business authors, and celebs from Motley Fool radio shows. We'll play those and reflect on them in next week's  . In the meantime, have a great week.

Go ahead, gentlemen. -- Good morning, and thank you for joining this morning's call. I want to start by apologizing for rescheduling the call from last evening to this morning. We needed the additional time to complete our checks on room nights and gross bookings. Now turning to our results for the quarter.I am pleased to report Booking Holdings performed well during the second quarter. Our revenue increased 20% year over year in U.S. dollars or about 16% on a constant-currency basis. And adjusted EBITDA grew 35% year over year to approximately $1.3 billion.Our worldwide 191 million booked room nights was an increase of 12% year over year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated gross bookings were up 15% year over year in U.S. dollars or about 11% on a constant currency basis. While we are pleased with our financial results, we saw slower-than-expected room night growth toward the end of the quarter, which we believe is due in part to a greater-than-expected impact from the World Cup, in combination with some unusual weather in some of our core European markets which extended into the third quarter.David will provide further details on this in his remarks. Our performance marketing ROI optimization has continued to impact year over year growth rates, as has slower growth in some performance marketing channels. We have talked about this in the past about our desire to decrease our historical dependency on performance marketing channels and increase our direct business. At this time, we are pleased with the trends we are seeing in our traffic mix.Our direct channel, which represents approximately 50% of our total booked room nights, is not only one of our fastest-growing channels but also represents a significant source of new users to our platform. These are important metrics we use to evaluate the long-term health of our business, which you can see in our strong bottom line results. A year ago, I talked about the importance of measuring the effectiveness of our paid channels, and we will continually evaluate the efficiency of our performance marketing spend in paid channels. We said we would deploy capital in the channels that offer us attractive ROIs and provide the best user experience for our customers.Our strategy has not changed since then, and we remain open to leaning into channels that make themselves more attractive to us as an advertiser, work with us to improve the customer experience and help us build our brand. Regarding brand marketing. We have not been able to ramp the spend as quickly as we had hoped in the first half of the year. But we believe we are exercising appropriate prudence regarding new brand campaigns and channels.And we remain confident that over time, we will build a strong brand marketing effort, which, in the long term, will produce a beneficial impact and increase our direct business. Overall, we are executing on our long-term strategies that we outlined at the end of last year, which is to provide a more holistic travel experience for our customers in order to further drive loyalty and build a larger direct brand. Providing the most accommodation choice with the best customer value and experience is a key piece of this strategy, and I am pleased with our progress in building a leading alternative accommodations platform. As of June 30, Booking.com had a total of approximately 28.8 million reported listings, consisting of approximately 23.3 million reported listings in hotels, motels and resorts; and approximately 5.5 million reported listings in homes, apartments and other unique places to stay.Reported listings for our alternative accommodation category was up 23% year over year. And booked alternative accommodation room nights continues to grow faster than our consolidated growth rate, which shows that our focus on providing maximum choice for our customers is delivering results. Providing local experiences, in-stay services and ground transportation are also important components of our holistic travel vision. And we are in the early stages of building a robust local experience product through both organic investment in acquisitions such as FareHarbor, which we announced last quarter.While the volume of attractions and other travel-related services is still very small compared to the size of our accommodation business, we are happy to report that the foundational blocks are being laid. And we believe that in the long term, providing a frictionless booking and payment experience in this area will be a competitive advantage. As we have said in prior calls, the APAC region remains an important growth market for us, and we continue to make investments in this region. Agoda is growing faster than our consolidated growth rate.China remains a focus of ours, and we are building there organically as well as through strategic partnerships. The recently announced DiDi investment and strategic relationship is an example of this strategy. We are pleased about this partnership and potential to help both DiDi's and our customers travel in a more seamless way. Also during the quarter, we announced the acquisition of HotelsCombined, a leading hotel metasearch brand with a strong presence in several APAC markets.HotelsCombined will report into KAYAK and will further help us become the  meta leader through increased scale, greater geographic breadth in the world's fastest-growing region and expanded hotel and affiliate services. We hope to close this transaction later this year. In summary, we produced a solid quarter with industry-leading cash flow and margins. We continue to invest in the business for the long term and remain focused on driving quality growth that we believe will make us a stronger and more competitive player in this enormous global travel market opportunity.I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the detailed financial review. -- Thank you, Glenn, and good morning. I'll discuss our operating results and cash flows for the second quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2018. All growth rates are relative to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. As we discussed last quarter, all year-over-year growth rates referenced in my remarks and Q3 guidance will compare the current-year income statement under the new revenue accounting standard to the prior year under the previous accounting standard.Gross bookings and other metrics, like room night reservations, are not impacted by the new revenue accounting standard. Our non-GAAP financial results and forecast includes stock-based compensation and are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. In the second quarter, our strategy to optimize performance marketing ROIs drove significant improvement in our operating margins.The result was a third quarter in a row of expanding adjusted EBITDA margins and bottom line performance that substantially exceeded our guidance range and FactSet analyst estimates. Room nights booked in Q2 grew 12%, which beat the high end of our guidance range. Stayed room nights in Q2 grew faster than booked room nights. As I mentioned on the last call, we have factored some impact from the World Cup into our room night guidance for June.I also commented that the actual impact was difficult to predict. We observed that the impact during the World Cup period in late June, but also running into early July, was larger than we had estimated, in part due to many of our larger booking country's national teams making it deep into the tournament. We also believe that unusually warm and dry weather in Northern Europe during the World Cup period had a compounding impact on bookings. Post-World Cup, we've seen a pickup in bookings in Europe, although the unusual warm and dry weather in Northern Europe continues.Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were relatively flat for Q2 versus prior year on a constant currency basis, which was better than our forecast of down about 1%. Foreign exchange rates favorably impacted Q2 growth rates in U.S. dollars by about 400 basis points. However, given the strengthening of the U.S.dollar since our last guidance, exchange rates for the quarter were unfavorable by about 100 basis points from that time. Q2 gross bookings grew by 15%, expressed in U.S. dollars, and grew by about 11% on a constant currency basis, coming in about two percentage points above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $3.5 billion and grew by 20% in U.S.dollars and by about 16% on a constant currency basis. Future revenue include $40 million from the Momondo Group, an acquisition we closed in July 2017. Revenue for the second quarter of 2018 under the current revenue standard was about the same as it would have been reported under the previous revenue standard. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues from KAYAK and OpenTable, grew 34% in Q2 compared to the prior year, including revenue from Momondo.GAAP operating income grew by 37%, and GAAP operating margins increased by 432 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. GAAP net income amounted to $977 million or $20.13 per share, which grew by 40%. Our GAAP net income includes a $21.8 million benefit related to an unrealized gain on our equity investment in Ctrip, which is now recorded in the income statement rather than the balance sheet due to an accounting change that took effect in Q1. We excluded this unrealized gain from our non-GAAP results.Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, which was a little better than forecasted. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $1.313 billion and grew by 35%. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the previously mentioned Ctrip gain. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 37% was substantially better than our forecast, due mainly to performance marketing efficiency, higher revenue in the quarter and lower-than-expected spending on brand marketing due to the factors that Glenn discussed, plus some timing, primarily in digital channels.As expected, non-marketing OPEX pressured year-over-year margins as we continue to invest in new markets and new capabilities, as Glenn described in his remarks. Our non-GAAP EPS was $20.67, up 36% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax charge of 19 point -- tax rate of 19.3% in Q2, which increased from the prior year due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act and the higher Innovation Box tax rates in the Netherlands.Our cash and investments amounted to $16.8 billion at quarter end. In Q2, we generated $1.6 billion of operating cash flow, which grew by 35% compared to the prior year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, which is 35% higher than Q2 of '17. We returned about $1.2 billion during the second quarter to our shareholders through share buybacks.Since the start of the year, we reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 2%. As of June 30, we had approximately $8.6 billion remaining of our share purchase reauthorization. We continue to be both programmatic and opportunistic with regard to our repurchases and, under stable business and market conditions, expect to complete this authorization within the remainder of the two to three-year time period we talked about last quarter. Turning to Q3.Our guidance reflects our quarter-to-date actual results and assumes that our growth rates will decelerate over the remainder of the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our approach to guidance has not changed. Foreign exchange rates are expected to be an approximately 200 basis point headwind to year-over-year growth rates in Q3, which represents an approximately 300 basis points unfavorable change from where FX rates were at the end of April and approximately 200 basis points from the date of our last . We used a dollar to euro exchange rate of 1.17 when setting our Q3 guidance.We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 69% and total gross bookings to grow by 3% to 6% in U.S. dollars and by 5% to 8% on a constant-currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the company will be about flat compared to prior year. We forecast Q3 revenue to grow by 6% to 9% in U.S.dollars and by 8% to 11% on a constant currency basis. Q3 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.36 billion, which represents 5% to 8% growth versus prior year. We forecast that adjusted EBITDA margin will be slightly lower than Q3 last year. Our Q3 forecast assumes that our ROI optimization efforts will continue to yield year-on-year performance marketing efficiency.However, we expect the year-over-year improvements to moderate as we begin to lap these optimization efforts, which started in the middle of Q3 last year. We expect the deleverage from our investments in brand marketing and non-marketing OPEX expenses will more than offset the leverage from performance marketing in the quarter. On the last call, we commented that deleverage from non-marketing OPEX and brand marketing will diminish in the second half as we lap investments we made last year. We expect this to continue to be the case for non-marketing OPEX.But due to the phasing of our brand spending, we expect deleverage in the second half of the year. We forecast GAAP EPS to be between $35.85 and $36.85 for Q3, which represents 4% to 7% growth versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 48 million shares, which reflects a beneficial impact of our -- the common stock repurchases we made to date. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% compared to the prior tax rate of 17%.Our current year tax rate is higher than last year due to impacts of the U.S. Tax Act as well as the increased rate of Innovation Box Tax in the Netherlands. We're forecasting Q3 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $36.70 to $37.70, which represents 4% to 7% growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 21%, which is higher than the prior year rate of 17%, due to the same reasons I just discussed for the GAAP rates.We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. With that, we'll now take your questions.Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the performance marketing optimization. Just curious, as we think into the back half and into 2019, philosophically, are you still looking for further areas for ROI and performance optimization of business more efficient that we should expect to go into the back half and into next year? And then secondly, on Europe.Just kind of looking for any further color on the growth of your largest business in Europe as you're guiding to a single-digit overall room night growth. How should we think about the potential for European growth rate over the next, call it, 2 years or so, given how large the business is at this point? Thanks. -- Hi, Brian, it's Glenn. I'll give my comments on this first, then I'm going to give David a chance to give his opinion on all of this. So regarding optimization, and we've talked about this in the past, about our reasoning why we decided to optimize and what we're trying to do in terms of building out a much more powerful and, we think, very important to us brand and direct marketing approach. It's very hard to predict in these very dynamic pay-for-performance markets what's going to happen because there are so many influences that are coming in and particularly what your competitor is going to do.But what I want to point out is what I said in my prepared remarks, and it really comes down to what we said when we first started this almost a year ago. I think almost exactly a year ago, I said this. For those advertising platforms that are willing to work cooperatively with us so that together, we can build better business for both of us to create something that is a great customer experience, something that helps build our brand, something that again is not something that is sort of competitive but is cooperative, we're always willing to lean in and work with them. And we've been doing it with a number of them.Some are more cooperative than others. So in terms of the answer to that, it really depends also on how others are going to act. In regards to Europe, yes, we have a big business in Europe. But -- and it is our biggest geographical area.But I still want to point out, it's still a relatively small part of the overall travel business in Europe. And we have a lot of ramp left both in our core business, which I would consider to be our hotels in urban areas, but then there's even more opportunity in all the other areas, as we talked about building out NHA, which is a very fast site, non-hotel accommodation. It is a very fast-growing area. And then we've talked a bit about the holistic travel service that we want to provide.So I think there's still a lot of opportunity there. We are at different stages of development in all of it. But I do not believe that this is something where we are running out of ramp at all. And I'll turn it over to David. -- Thanks, Glenn. No, I think I would just reinforce that as we've been looking into the market opportunity, even in our strongest markets, there's a lot of what I'll call white space. And it's an opportunity for us to grow, not only in the new areas, but also in the core hotel areas where we have obviously very strong shares in certain particular types of travel and less strong share in other travel. So we think there's a lot of growth opportunity over and above what the market growth rates are sitting in Europe.And going back to performance marketing optimization, I think Glenn again summarized it very well. These are dynamic marketplaces. Obviously, you saw we had very good results in the Q2 and much beyond what we guided to in terms of optimization, driving a number of the -- a large piece of our overachieve in Q2. I think we recognize that these are important channels.We continue to look for ways to optimize, but they're also growth channels for us as well. So there's always a balance. But as Glenn said, we -- it is a dynamic marketplace. It's a little bit difficult to predict.I think we are in a fairly good position in terms of our optimization right now in terms of the balance between growth and profitability. But there are always areas where we're experimenting constantly in these channels is probably the best way to summarize it.Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is open. -- Thank you. I know it's probably nitpicking, but just obvious question would be, if it's possible in any way to quantify the incremental impact that you think you had from World Cup that you weren't anticipating as well as some of the poor weather. Also, I think in the past, you said that weather tends to not be a focus as consumers tend to be pretty flexible. But why is that not necessarily the case this time around? And just on a follow-up, what, if any, impact are you seeing with Google's news and changes in the hotel search arena in terms of your share of overall travel traffic from that channel? Thank you. -- So Mark, let me take the first one and hand to Glenn for the second one. So pretty helpful to start by explaining what impact we have built into our Q2 guidance for World Cup. And as I mentioned on the last call, the main factors here, including what teams did, so I'll start off by saying we had a little less than half a point built in to our guidance. What we saw was a combinatorial factor.We saw a lot of the teams are big booking countries, many of those are sitting in Northern Europe. Having an unusual weather period during the World Cup, in fact, I was in Holland a lot during that period of time, and you could just see the activity. And we believe the combination of those two things had a bigger factor than we expected. Hard to quantify because it's hypothetical, but certainly enough to mention and point out.We did notice that, again, as I said in my remarks, that at the end of the World Cup, because the World Cup obviously impacted the last two weeks in June, impacted the first two weeks in July, bear in mind that several larger booker countries made it all the way to the semifinals. And historically, we have found that when teams are doing well in the World Cup, there is an impact on bookings. You can see it during the game. You can also see it over a period of time as well.So it did roll into July. So we want to comment on that as well. And what we've commented after the end of World Cup, we saw a bounce back in bookings in Europe, but the weather is sufficiently noticeable to comment about it. We're going through a very unusual weather pattern in Europe right now.In the Northern countries, temperatures are in the 30s in terms of Celsius; and in Southern Europe, they're in the 40s, making it less pleasant than usual to want to go sit on a beach when it's 110 degrees. So I think others have commented upon that. We wanted to point it out. The World Cup had a factor in our Q3 guide.The ongoing weather has a bit of a factor as well. And we do see it in -- when we look at the numbers of people traveling from Northern Europe to Southern Europe, we see an impact. So we just wanted to call it out and explain this kind of built in to the way we're thinking about the business this quarter. -- And regarding Google, I'd want to emphasize a couple of things. One, we have been working with Google for a very, very long time. Symbiotic relationship helps build both of our businesses in the travel vertical, and we're continuing to do that. And we are pleased with where our share is in Google in all their different products right now.And they continue to develop new products, new ways to reach out to their customers to provide their customers with a good experience. And we work with them and provide that travel service to our customers. And it's really worked well for us over the last more than a decade, and I think it's going to continue to work that way. Clearly, in certain parts of the world where travel growth is faster, Google has less of an ability to get customers.I, of course, speak to China right away. I mean, that's an area where, as of today, Google would not be a supplier of customers to us of any great state. So we are going to continue to work with them well. And I have confidence that we're going to have a good relation going forward, and we're always looking forward to the new things they're working on because that can help our business.Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Thanks. I have two, if I can. First, just asking a question in another way. Given your view that there's a lot of room left in the core markets and in your newer NHA markets, are you guys happy with the outlook for single-digit room night growth? Or is your base case that you can grow faster than that looking out over the next few years, given the runway left? And then second one, just kind of strategically, as you guys shift the focus beyond hotels, it seems like the different products are still a bit siloed.So I'm just wondering what the strategy is for integrating your experience. Is that effort being led by the Booking.com team? And what kind of product investments do you need to make here? Whether that's building out individual products, building an underlying platform and like, do you see risk at core hotel conversion as you develop this strategy of kind of a more holistic travel product? Just curious if you can share some thoughts there. Thanks. -- Sure. So it's Glenn speaking. Referring back to the growth area, you said, are we happy? I will just make the statement that I am never happy no matter how fast we're growing, I always want to do it faster. So let's just lay that down.I'm a competitive person, our teams are competitive, everybody in this organization is competitive, and we always want to win and do more no matter what level we're at. Now your question about, are we kind of in single digit, are we going to be in single digit? Part of our belief is that, and this is one David mentioned a little bit about, is optimization in choosing profit versus growth. And we want to do things in a smart way. And one can always buy more growth, and it depends on what cost.And is that long-term benefit to the franchise or not? Right now, we're at a stage where we're happy where we are and the way we're investing and the way we're getting the bottom line where we are. Clearly, we believe that building out this holistic travel system should provide a much better solution for customers around the world who want to travel. And we expect that competitive benefit to accrue to us. Now you'd make a point, though, on this holistic thing and having these siloed different companies in our organization, are we going to make changes there? Well, I would point out we're already doing that.And we made the thing earlier in the year of noting that our rental cars company, which wasn't more of an independent company, has now been put under the Booking.com umbrella to make sure that the customers are getting the most frictionless, seamless way to use ground transportation services. And it's more than just rental cars, it's all elements of ground transportation that we're building. So that's an example of what we're doing. And we're doing it in other areas, too, and I don't want to get into too much of the details, but we have Agoda and Priceline doing a lot of back-end work together.There's a lot of things happening under the hood to help build out this system. Now you're right to mention the point about what sort of risks does that bring on, and does that -- first, does that do anything that's going to put a risk to the hotel, the core hotel business? We're aware of that potential, and that's why we always want to guard against it and make sure we're doing things in the right way to do it with the right checks so that we don't end up doing anything that could influence the core business in a negative way. So I think we have it under control. I think we're doing it the right way.And I'm pleased where we're and the position of where we're going. -- All right. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Yes. I'll just ask about the advertising strategy, the kind of the toggle away from performance marketing toward brand advertising. And I think you'd said that you'd -- it sounds like you weren't able to spend as quickly as you wanted in brand advertising, so if you could explain that a little bit more. Is it that the pricing wasn't -- you couldn't find the right channels? The brand pricing, the ROI on that spend wasn't as favorable as you would have liked so you didn't spend that? Just explain a little bit more why the toggle over the brand advertising didn't occur as rapidly as you wanted.And maybe also bigger picture, when you think about this, the goal seems very clear, build up customer loyalty and that it should show up in better margins. But on the -- how are you going to judge yourself how successful this strategy is? Is there a room night goal -- growth goal you're looking for or bookings growth goal? I know you're trying to do both of those, margins and growth, but what's the growth objective you want to get out of switching the advertising over more toward brand advertising? All right. Thank you. -- Hi, Mark. Yes, the brand, and I wanted to call out that we did not spend as fast as we would have liked. And that's a function of something that we said at the very beginning when we talked about going toward a strategy that would be more direct, which would include building out a bigger brand effort. And I made it very clear at the beginning that we would do this in a prudent way.I used the word prudent. I think I've used the word prudent every time since then because that's how we're doing this. Our DNA is one of experimentation, test, see what the data shows us, and then if things are working, do more of it; if things aren't working, change around, figure out well, what should we adjust to and work on that. It's an iterative process.And there are many things that go in. It's what kind of creative do you have, what are the signals you're getting from that, what channels are you using in it? And of these new channels, relatively new, where it's not just brand on TV, it's all sorts of video, and how are your responses on that going? So over all these things, as we go through it, not that different than when we built out our pay-for-performance thing, is experimentation, results, rinse and repeat. And where we are right now, that's what we thought was the appropriate thing. And it makes no sense in my mind to spend excess money if you think you're not going to get a result out of it.So that's that one. In terms of what's the goal, though, I think the best way we can measure this really is at direct. When you see more and more direct business coming, that's showing your brand effort is working. And that's why I wanted to point out that approximately 50% of our bookings are coming direct, and it's growing.And we're getting new users in that channel. So that's what -- that's sort of like what I'm using as a thermometer, see, is the brand working or not.Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. -- Great. A couple of things. First, on the market share, you haven't gained as much this year as in prior years. Has anything really changed in June or July? If we see the industry data that you're looking at, do you think you've held up your market share in the last couple of months? Any big changes there? And then, David, on your guidance, did you guide deceleration off of a slow start in July? Or was that off of kind of the more recent improved trends? And then maybe one housekeeping.Your take rates are much higher this quarter, and I'm assuming that's just because the booking growth slowed a bit in your marketing strategy. Was there any change to the underlying take rates in the hotel business? Thank you. -- Justin, thanks. I'll kind of take those in the order which you gave them. So market share, when we look at our share of the total rooms available in our portfolio, which is kind of what we can measure and manage, we see us continuing to gain share on a quarter-by-quarter or on a month-by-month basis, so we're kind of pleased with that number. Some people call that our sell-through rate.But when we look at that, we continue to gain share in what is an expanding portfolio. So we are pleased with that. In terms of the guidance arrangement -- and I want to stress our approach to guidance has not changed. And so that's an important point to take into account.When we gave the guidance, we looked at a number of factors. We did look at what we saw coming out of June and into July, which was obviously impacted by some of the comments I talked about on my earlier remarks. And I also pointed out that the guidance does continue to reflect a deceleration during the rest of the quarter, so potentially some opportunity there. So those are the factors that kind of went into that guidance number.Take rates, nothing particularly -- other than probably the impact of the book-to-stay ratio, you're probably seeing that slightly shortening windows, as we mentioned for the last couple of quarters, just as well as the timing of things in the Q2 quarter. But basically, it's the book-to-stay window, which would probably have the biggest impact upon what you're seeing in take rates. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks a lot. Just a couple of questions. First, so just to clarify on previous comments, so you've seen some negative impact from weather.Can you quantify the impact from the Northern Europe heatwave? Or give us any sort of ballpark to what extent you think that's hurt growth? And then to be totally clear there, you've taken -- because that's kind of ongoing, you've taken that rate and slowed it down from there, so you're not assuming a pick-up on better weather. And then I have one more question. -- Kevin, so let me pick the -- so yes, to be clear, hard to predict what's going to happen to the weather. I think if anybody knew that, we wouldn't be sitting here. We'd be doing something else. But yes, we've obviously had some impact that we did see in end of July.And we saw impacts of the weather pattern, and we saw impacts of the weather pattern in combination with the second half of the World Cup, and that was factored into our July actuals. So we have, as we normally do, taken an appropriate approach and guided some level of deceleration from that in our Q3 guide. So that's exactly kind of what's -- reiterating what I said in my prepared remarks. And what was your second part of the question? -- OK. OK, I understood on that part. And then just a question on the direct business. You said it accounts for about 50% of nights.And can you give us more information on how you're defining that? So specifically, are you adjusting out direct nights where users have been influenced by clicking on your online advertising in the prior 30-day period? And in addition, are you including SEO? Are you including brand SCM on branded keywords? And are you including mobile app traffic that may have been driven by advertising? Just so we can understand that metric that you disclosed a little bit better. Thanks. -- Sure. So the direct is basically, users come through non-paid channels, were not paid. So it will include SEO. It would not include brand searches or a brand PBC search.So to be very clear, we're taking a very narrow but I think appropriate definition of direct. I know others have maybe expanded and gone through a slightly broader view, but we're taking a pure view. Obviously, people have come -- from our advertising, that's all well and good. And a lot of that direct traffic, of course, is coming through a mobile with the app.It is an important piece of it, but specifically, where we've not paid for that user when they make a booking. -- OK. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question. I definitely appreciate the color on the World Cup and European weather. But just given the fact that the comp is certainly notably easier into 3Q, is there anything else that's impacting room nights and the FX-neutral bookings growth in the third quarter? So that's for David. And then, Glenn, just on China, can you talk a little bit more about the investments in DiDi and Meituan and your strategy here and how they tie operationally to your efforts in China? Should we view the value there more in the equity investments, in the stakes or in how they can help actually drive bookings business? -- Yes, Doug, let me take the first part. I'll clarify -- I think by comp, you're talking about the performance marketing optimization comp. So let me just kind of clarify what's going on there. So as we've said, I'll kind of just walk you through the kind of logic here, so performance marketing optimization has obviously benefited our profitability, but over time, it's cost us some amount of growth.But I think we've also pointed out, we do not believe we lost much share across the performance marketing channels in aggregate. Obviously, our spending reduction reduced in -- resulted in reducing growth in those channels is absolute, but we do not believe we lost much share across them in total. And also, last quarter was only a partial quarter of optimization. So we've not really got a full overlap this time.So we don't expect to see significant uptick in growth in Q3 from lapping any change in share in those channels, a, because it wasn't a big change in share; and b, because it's only a partial compare. -- And I'll take the -- I'll talk a little bit about the Chinese -- China strategy we have right now. And when we've talked about China, really, it's the locomotive of the growth in worldwide travel industry. In any side you'd look at, you see this huge growth opportunity there. I think I saw a stat that said less than 10% of Chinese citizens have a passport or traveling out of China.So that's a lot of growth potential, and we want to get a good share of that. Now on the flip side of that, though, China is a more difficult place to work for nonlocal players. That's absolutely a truism. So our strategy is to maximize our opportunity, is to both develop our own brand there, develop our own abilities within China and, at the same time, establish partnerships with companies that have great customer bases with people who are using the Internet to do things.So we mentioned DiDi, and you mentioned Meituan. You didn't mention Ctrip, which is also a big partner of ours. And just to spell this out, we have over $2 billion invested in Ctrip. We made an investment in Meituan in the $400 million, $450 million.We made a $500 million investment in DiDi. Now I'll repeat what I said when we made the announcement about DiDi, just to scope that one out a little bit. Really, 3 pillars there. The first thing, and we've talked about, is holistic travel system.And critical to that is ground transportation. And ground transportation in China is even more critical because people who are not Chinese do not rent cars and drive in China. So you got to come up with a way that people, our customers, when they get to China, how are they going to get around? That's an important thing. Doing this deal with DiDi is going to create this seamless, frictionless way that our customers go to one of our apps, the Booking.com app or to the Agoda app, and are able to get that ground transportation that's powered by DiDi.So that's going to be a thing of great advantage for our customers when we get that one up and running. The second part of that, and this is very important too, is help build our brand among the DiDi customer base. And DiDi, as part of this agreement, is going to help us do that through different types of marketing and different types of programs. And the third thing, as you pointed out, is yes, we want to get a good return on our investment, of course.And that's why we're doing it with each of them. Now with Meituan and Ctrip, they both have very, very powerful travel services within their companies. And we share inventory, and we provide them with outbound inventory so they can have their customers get outbound hotels. And we are working with them with inbound.When we have sent people in, they have Chinese hotels that perhaps we don't have or perhaps they would better price. That's the way we're cooperating in all these areas. And we believe that this is the smart way to try and take advantage of what is a great opportunity for us. And I'd say it's not easy, and some of the things are very early.We obviously don't have that DiDi-powered app up and running yet, but it's exciting to see what we can build and what's going to be the future. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Yes. Hi, thanks a lot. Just a couple. So Glenn, can you just maybe give us some more color on this direct traffic? And I think you mentioned that it's becoming the fastest-growing channel for new customer acquisition.Is there any positive impact on this direct traffic from the brand advertising purse that you have been doing for the last, at least, a year? And then I have a follow up. -- Well, it's difficult to suss out what the reason is if somebody comes to us direct. We hope that part of it is to spend on brand. Certainly, some of this is because of our great service. People have -- maybe they came first time through a paid click, used the service and loved it, and now they're coming to us direct.The point is that, by developing systems that are much better, it builds loyalty. And we can look at some of the people who are not in the travel business, and you can see some of the benefit they're getting. And I'll point immediately to, say, Amazon. People are not going to search engines to buy stuff off Amazon.They're going directly to Amazon because that service is a better service. So we believe that yes, we have to have brand marketing so people are aware of us, come to us. End of the day, though, you win in the long run by having all those best things, which is we always talk about best price, best availability, greatest selection, easiest of use, best customer service side and go on the litany of reasons you become the winner in the space. Those are the areas we're working out.And then you go on to the next things, the things that we're working on, things why we hired more people, why we have these data scientists, why we're doing all this stuff in machine learning, personalizing the service, making sure it's seamless and frictionless, coming up with a payment way that people -- the same way people in the U.S. are going to use Uber. What a convenient service. We want the travel experience to be like that: easy, frictionless, so it all fades into the background, and people are able to just to accomplish what our mission is, which is to help people experience the world.And your follow-up? -- Yes, on the -- yes, on just the cloud efforts. Are you doing anything on the cloud? And anything on the AI machine learning front? -- Well, of course, we're doing a lot of things on AI. We've hired a lot of people. We brought in companies. We bought a company called Evature out of Israel.It's very highly specialized in some natural language processing stuff. And we've done a lot of things to try and make sure that all technologies are being brought in as quickly as possible and utilized. Now I'm not going to get into specifics about cloud. Of course, we do some things at cloud.Some things are on our own data center stuff. And I'll leave it up to our extremely qualified and capable IT people to determine what's the best way to do it, what's the most efficient way to do it, what gives most flexibility and all of those things, but we're not going to call out anything in particular. And David, who actually comes from a technological background, I'm going to let him add to that. -- Yes, I would characterize our cloud strategy as very much a hybrid cloud, which is a recognition of its value in both private clouds and public clouds and certain applications based upon volumes, capacity, performance, decent troughs, etc., are better sitting inside a private cloud and some are in a public cloud. And we're basically looking at that spectrum across a whole range of attribution capability, including things like natural language, machine learning, etc. So hybrid is the approach that we're taking, and I think that's the appropriate approach.Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies. Your line is open. -- A couple of quick ones. Maybe as a follow-up to Mark's questions about the brand spending. We appreciate the iterative testing that you're doing, that you seek to deploy this brand spend. Any impacts from GDPR you're seeing there? Post-GDPR, maybe not direct cost to you guys, but kind of an overall malaise or some slowness as the EU digital advertising ecosystem grappled with implementation there? And then, Glenn, how do you feel about your NHA inventory, the breadth and depth there, it sounds like it's growing nicely, and the penetration of -- and certainly bookability there? -- Hi, Brian. So GDPR, and I didn't want to call this out because I don't think it's -- it's a short-term thing. Some of our brand spend was somewhat delayed a little bit, so don't put too much into this. But some of our platforms did have to halt in some of the work they were doing so they could develop more resources to making sure that they were ready for GDPR.So some of the things we were doing to gather, particularly in the testing and experimental things, had to be pushed off. But again, that's a short-term timing issue. And we're talking -- we play for the long run. So I'm not going to worry about, so it took a month or two months, whatever it was, that's not a big point.In terms of the NHA, 5.5 million listings. And am I happy? And I think I'll just stay consistent and say, I'm never happy. I always want more. We want more.But in specifics, and we talked about this before, we need to continue to develop certain categories in the NHA, where I really feel -- I'm even less happy in those areas. And we talked about the single-property owners. The people have, let's just, for example, say a house on the Outer Banks or they have a condo at Vale, and then expand that worldwide, and that's the area where I feel that we really need to make more effort in getting that, a. But then on top of that, it's a two-sided marketplace.We not only have to have the supply, we also have to make sure that customers around the world are aware that we have this great service. We think we do have a great service, and I've talked about this. The fact that when our customers come, they can see both the NHA stuff and they can see the core hotel stuff, and it's easier to compare and contrast them. We've talked about how the ease that people can pay because for us, you're not putting -- the customer doesn't have to pay a customer fee.For us, it's simple. It's never the customer fee at the end when you see, oh, here's a big charge at the end from the customer fee. And we talk about all the different things we can do to make this holistic, so it's not just the accommodation. That's what we're driving to.But specifically about NHA, there's a lot of inventory that we need to go out and get in. And then we need to -- particularly in the U.S. because when I talk to U.S. people, I know they're not as aware that we have this great product.If you go to Europe, it'd be a different story where people are aware of it. And this is what we're working on. -- Got it. Thanks, Glenn.Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks. Just had a few I wanted to get a sense on. Glenn, I know we've spent a lot of time talking about brand marketing.But if we look at the first half, brand is still only about a-tenth of what you're spending on, on customer acquisition. Where do you see that settling out? With this emphasis, does that become half? Does it become the majority over time? What's the goal that you and your teams have for that? And then competitively, I'm kind of curious how you think about the benefit to your competitors as you pull back on marketing spend like this. I think it's notable that Expedia was able to maintain their growth rate and expand margins for the first time in several quarters as you and others in the space were pulling back on marketing. How do you think about what that does to sort of the long-term competitive balance in the space? And then, David, you mentioned that your approach to guidance hasn't changed.In the past, you guys have averaged about 300 basis points, above the high end of your guidance on bookings. Was that line specifically to suggest that what we've seen these last few quarters relative to your guidance is less of an indicator of how we should think about Q3? And thanks. -- Hi, Heath. On the brand question, clearly, it's a very difficult thing to try and come up with a long-term target. But it's not just because -- as we always say, it's very difficult to make predictions, especially about the future. Beyond that, much more important is the whole area of brand is changing so rapidly with new channels coming in, new ways to measure.So let's take, for example, let's take something like YouTube, for example, where, a few years ago, advertising at YouTube was not effective at all, and it was a smaller number, and now it's growing very rapidly. When I say growing, I'm not speaking for the travel business, I'm saying YouTube advertising in general. It's not -- anyway, one can measure the effectiveness. And then take that all different types of things, particularly in the social area.The fact is that it's hard to say it because the world is changing so rapidly, particularly in how one does brand advertising. I will just repeat what we've always said is, look, we're going to do it the way we do everything. We experiment, we test, and if it ends up being more and more effective, we're going to do a lot more of it. And I do believe in the long run that we are going to be able to use brand advertising to build out a larger direct business.But I'm not going to pin myself to -- and this is what the percent of our spend is going to be in year 4. And what was your second one, by the way? -- The competitive point, how -- Expedia and others. -- Oh, yes. So what's interesting, of course, when the advertisers go to optimize, and there's less revenue now going to a particular or several advertising platforms, they then have less money to go out and try and get customers. So their growth then slows. So if their growth slows, even though all the advertisers may be in the same share and doing the same amount of share, they may not have the growth rate they had before because the core platform is not growing as rapidly as it used to do.So I think when we look back and we see the amount of spend being done by some of the advertising platforms in the past of very, very heavy weeks, that probably brought forward some people who may not have been as familiar with how to get travel online. And now perhaps those people who came on and now because they're slowing in terms of the amount of spend in that type of brand to bring customers to these advertising platforms, maybe that is an influence on the overall flow or amount of growth in that area. That would be the way I'd say it. -- And then, Heath, to pick up your third point, I was going to say I'll avoid getting into the specific quantification. But what I'll just say is that the way the company has approached guidance over the last several years and quarters, I think is one that's been beneficial and appropriate. And we haven't changed that as I've come in and worked with the team, and we continue to factor in the same issues when we look at our guidance. And obviously, we leave ourselves some potential to do better. -- Great. Thank you, both.Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions. First, with the HotelsCombined acquisition and then Momondo previously, should we view these acquisitions as a strategy to sort of build out a portfolio of diverse smaller metasearch channels? Are there opportunities to continue this strategy? And then more broadly on performance, you know that you're willing to reinvest on certain performance channels, depending on the levels of branding that you get on them.Is it kind of safe to say that prices and ROIs on these channels are something that you're comfortable now at these levels? Thank you. -- I'll take one, and I'll let David take two on that. So we are pleased with the HotelsCombined deal. It hasn't closed yet. We expect it to close before the end of the year.And we did do Momondo, and that is -- and so you are correct, we have built out -- brought in some smaller players. And we believe the strategy is, one, scale matters in these areas. We bring in these meta companies that have a customer base, and perhaps they're doing certain things that we don't do as well or whatever. And we can then optimize in terms of the amount of people we need to run the entire organization.There's some synergies to be gotten. And so if we see more and they are at the right price because we're always conscious that you've got to get value for it, what can you achieve with it, we would always be interested in doing it. But I think we are reaching a level now where we are certainly bigger than we were before we got Momondo and when we bring in HotelsCombined, hopefully. And by the way, this strategy started a long time ago before we bought KAYAK, when KAYAK went out and got sidestepped.And that, I think, was the initial thing. Steve Hafner, our CEO there, is still with us, and he did that deal back then. I think his vision hasn't changed. -- Yes. And then on the -- our performance channels. First of all, they're very important channels for us and also our customers. So we view them as a strategic part of the business.And as Glenn commented, our strategy in those channels hasn't changed. And we'll actually lean into the channels that make themselves more attractive to us as an advertiser. It will help us to build our customer experience and build our brand. And that's been a great relationship, and we expect it to continue.In terms of where we are versus a year ago, I'd say we are pleased with what we're now seeing in terms of ROIs on those channels. And as I mentioned, a decent balance between growth and profitability in terms of what we're getting from those channels. As Glenn said, we're never pleased, we're never satisfied. There's always opportunity to continue to improve.And I think we're at a place where we're now looking for incremental improvements and certainly looking at ROI and growth in those channels, those two things we're looking at very closely. So I'm pleased but not satisfied will summarize where we are today. -- Great. Thank you so much.Thank you. And our final question comes from Brad Erickson from Pacific Crest. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups. Can you talk about hotel inventory, just geographically where you're really focused on adding supply this year, if anywhere? And does that give you incremental opportunities to maybe spend on performance marketing later in the year as you get bigger in certain markets? And then second, just what does your direct booking retention rate look like today versus, say, I don't know, two, three years ago? Thanks. -- So in terms of inventory, we don't spell out where we are trying to get more inventory. It was very nice some of our competitors in the past have done that, which have been great for us in terms of the road map where should we be looking at things. And I don't want to do the same thing for -- going the other way on this. I will say that our -- people are always out there trying to get more inventory because we do believe that's a great way to help build the business, and they are out there doing it.And we did point out the importance -- already, we've talked a little bit about how important it is to try and get certain parts of the non-hotel accommodation built up because we do think that is an area where we do need to continue to improve in that area. And I'll let David talk about the second one there. -- Yes. I think in terms of retention rates, we're not going to give you a specific data point, but I'd say that we're certainly pleased with our Genius customer group in terms of how well that has developed and the level of retention in repeat booking we get out of those customers, which has continued to be a focus on the business. So we've seen not only is direct increasing and becoming now very close to half the business, but we do see, obviously, a much stronger retention rate, particularly in those customers who are part of our different closed-use programs. So that is a good trend for us, not only in terms of the growth as the mix of the business shifts toward more direct, but also, as Glenn said, building out this loyalty factor where we want people to be coming back to us as their preferred travel partner with a whole broad range of capabilities and travel experiences. -- OK. So I want to thank everybody again. I want to just reemphasize a couple of points. One is that we believe we're on the right track.We believe we are building the business the way we want to. We believe we have the right mix in terms of profit and growth right now. And we are pleased with our level and where we are at this stage of progress. I also want to thank all our employees around the world who have worked so hard.This is a very, very busy season for them right now, and I just want to reach out to them, and we appreciate greatly the amount of effort they are putting in there. And of course, we always want to thank our supplier partners and our customers who, without them, there'd be no reason for us to be here. So thank you, and see you in three months.[Operator signoff]The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hares of Booking Holdings  gained as much as 1.5% during regular hours Tuesday, a day before the online travel giant releases its latest quarterly earnings report. Investors may be more familiar with Booking's old brand name, Priceline, which it changed in February.Booking shares have gained 2.2% in the last year, but are up 20.5% on a year-to-date basis. The company has seen solid momentum on the back of strong performance in its room nights and rental car segments. Still, weaker airline ticket performance, macroeconomic headwinds, and increased advertising headwinds represent a few of investors' current concerns.In recent news, Booking expanded its partnership with Chinese firm Ctrip.com International  in mid-June. Through the arrangement, Booking's restaurant reservation service, OpenTable, will see its North American restaurants become available to Ctrip users for booking.A solid earnings report could potentially help BKNG move back toward the $2,170 mark that it hit in March. Tuesday's price movement reflects investor optimism heading into Wednesday's report, but what should we expect from its soon-to-be-reported quarter? Let's take a closer look.Booking will release its Q2 fiscal 2018 results  on Wednesday. Here's what analysts are expecting, according to our Zacks Consensus Estimates: BKNG is projected to report earnings of $17.41 per share, which would represent 15% growth from the year-ago period. BKNG has seen downward earnings estimate revisions in the past 30 days for the current quarter and next quarter. However, the firm has also seen mixed recent estimate activity for the current fiscal year and next fiscal year. Consensus estimates have BKNG's Q2 revenue pegged at $3.44 billion. This would mark growth of 13.7% year-over-year.BKNG is trading at 21.5x forward 12-month earnings heading into today's report. This represents a premium compared to the broader \"Consumer Discretionary\" market's average of about 18.6x, but is still comparatively \"cheaper\" than the stock has been over the last year.In the past year, BKNG has traded as high as 24.9x and as low as 19.3x. Its 52-week median earnings multiple is 22.1x.Booking shares took a large hit in November after issuing disappointing guidance, but has since recovered those losses this year. The company continues to make strategic partnerships and investments to expand its market share. While there are still challenges ahead, Booking appears to be on the right track.Investors should keep an eye on Q3 guidance figures, as summer is the period with the highest travel-related activity.BKNG shares have performed well in 2018, so many investors may be more interested in realizing their gains rather than risking an earnings play. Analyst revision activity for the quarter has been mixed, but BKNG has a Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) of 0.87%.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Given the stock's current Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP value leaves us optimistic about BKNG's chances at beating estimates going into Wednesday afternoon's report. It is also worth noting that the Booking has not missed earnings estimates in over seven years.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Considering Khan had been forecasting roughly 50,000 in hotel adds, Expedia topped his expectations. The EXPE management team maintained that it is tracking to add over 180,000 by the end of 2018, which Khan cheers is more than two times the number of adds seen last year.\u201cFocus markets seeing early signs of acceleration.

Non-GAAP earnings came in $12 per share, which grew 22% on a year-over-year basis but declined 29% sequentially.Net Revenues were $2.93 billion, increasing 21% from the prior-year quarter and 4.5% sequentially. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.87 million.Top-line growth was driven by strong performance of agency and merchant businesses of the company. Moreover, robust overall bookings drove the results.For the second quarter, the company expects pro-forma earnings to lie within the range of $16.35-$17per share.Coming to the price performance, shares of Booking Holdings have returned 16.8% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the  's rally of 28%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Gross bookings remain the key growth factor of Booking Holdings, which is expected to continue to improve in the to-be reported quarter with the company's strong focus on investments in people, systems and brand marketing. These will also drive the direct traffic on the company's website.Moreover, the loyalty programs on its platform and strong efforts toward enhancing the travel experience will continue to drive the customer base of the company consequently aiding growth of overall bookings. The company's strategy of ensuring customer royalty remains positive.In the last reported quarter, gross bookings were up 20.9% year over year. This can be attributed to improved merchant and agency bookings, which grew 74.1% and 13.4% from the year-ago quarter, respectively.Further, the company is currently benefiting from increasing room nights number. In the last reported quarter, room nights volume increased 13.2% on a year-over-year basis.For the to-be-reported quarter, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 7-11% and total gross bookings to increase 10-114% year over year (5-9% on a constant currency basis). | Booking Holding's Rental cars business is expected to ride on continuous operational improvements and this remains a tailwind. In the first quarter, rental car days increased significantly 18.7%.Further, the company's strong momentum in its agency model is anticipated to drive its performance in the international markets, from where the company derives bulk of its revenues. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 18/73% in the previous quarter.We remain optimistic about the company's strong position in the international markets and growth opportunities in the domestic market backed by company's robust advertising business.Booking Holdings' leading travel metasearch brand, KAYAK and OpenTable are expected to drive its advertising revenues.During the second quarter, the company unveiled KAYAK Trip Huddle which efficiently aids in planning group traveling.Further, KAYAK Matchmaker was launched in the second quarter for the Big Soccer Game. This tool filters travel and fan preferences which encouraged the people to travel to their preferred team's country.Additionally, Booking Holdings extended its partnership with Ctrip.com International which will allow the linkage of OpenTable's North American restaurants with Ctrip users.All the above mentioned factors are expected to drive top-line growth of the company in the to-be reported quarter.However, weaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), increasing advertising spend and growing investment expenses remain headwinds.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

Shares of the hotel-booking specialist are down 36% so far in 2018, and 81% over the last year, as revenue growth has suddenly turned negative.A year ago, Trivago's revenue was growing by 67%, but in its recent second-quarter earnings report, revenue actually fell 21%. Management made a familiar argument on the , saying that commercialization rates have declined, referring to what bidding partners like  (NASDAQ: BKNG) and  (NASDAQ: EXPE) (as well as independent hotel operators) pay to get clicks on the site. As the company  , its largest partners have scaled back spending to focus on profitability rather than market share. Revenue per qualified referral (RPQR), one metric that tracks commercialization, has fallen 13% in the second quarter and 11% in the first half.After opening down 7%, the stock was trading higher by the afternoon as the market seemed to applaud the company's shift in focus to profitability from revenue growth. However, profit was down sharply in the second quarter, to a loss of 0.06 euros per share from a profit of 0.01 euros per share, though it improved modestly from the first quarter.Trivago plans to move toward profitability by scaling back on marketing spending and improving its return on advertising spend (ROAS), which seems like a wise move since marketing costs take up nearly all of its revenue. There was, however, one warning sign during its .Image source: Trivago.It's bad enough that RPQR is down double digits and seems likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future, as Trivago's bidding partners appear to be experimenting with competing platforms such as Google's hotel-finder search tool. (Or they're simply more concerned with profitability than they have been in the past, as management has posited.) Still, CEO Rolf Schromgens told me he doesn't see evidence that competition has been responsible for the sudden downturn in revenue growth.Aside from the loss in revenue from declining RPQR and commercialization, the greater concern for investors may be that it reveals Trivago's lack of a  . The company sees its strength as its singular focus on hotels, unlike many online travel agencies that also provide booking for extras like flights and rental cars; Trivago offers the ability to screen for a variety of factors like being pet-friendly or having a pool, and has a wide range of properties available on the platform. However, it's become clear that Trivago is just one of many competitors in the hotel-booking marketplace. The company is largely subject to market conditions out of its control, and the whims and behaviors of larger partners like Booking and Expedia.A competitive advantage is often a key component in an outperforming stock, and the lack of one may explain why Trivago shares have crashed over the last year.At this point, Trivago shares have fallen so sharply that it may only take a minor catalyst to send the stock higher, which seems to be one reason the stock was moving higher today. The company raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) range from a loss of 25 to 50 million euros to one of between 15 and 30 million euros, signaling positive adjusted EBITDA in the second half of the year.On a price-to-sales (P/S) basis, for example, Trivago is significantly cheaper than its peers:\n  \nData source: YCharts.Given that discrepancy, Trivago shares could spike if the company can execute on its promise to deliver profitability. Considering that commercialization also appears to be cyclical, revenue growth could return along with profitability if bidding activity picks up among its peers.However, since the company sees revenue continuing to decline for the second half of the year, the stock is likely to be quiet over the coming months.

Among the largest underlying components of ITOT, in trading today Union Pacific Corp (Symbol: UNP) is up about 0.6%, United Technologies Corp (Symbol: UTX) is up about 0.6%, and Booking Holdings Inc (Symbol: BKNG) is up by about 1.5%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of ITOT, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, ITOT's low point in its 52 week range is $55.13 per share, with $65.71 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $65.71. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ: BKNG) , the owner of several popular travel-related sites, including Priceline and Kayak, said this week that it has invested $500 million in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing.It's a coup for Didi, which is undertaking an aggressive global expansion. And it almost certainly raised some worries at Didi's archrival, Uber Technologies.There's more to this deal than a straight-up investment by Booking Holdings in Didi, although that investment is significant. The two companies also announced a partnership that, among other things, gives Booking Holdings' brands the ability to offer on-demand car service through their apps -- and that will integrate two of Booking Holdings' services into the Didi app.Users of Didi's hugely popular ride-hailing app will now be able to book hotels through Booking.com or Agoda. Image source: Didi Chuxing.That's significant, because Booking Holdings' brands include several very popular travel and entertainment apps:Users of all these apps could soon have one-click access to ride-hailing services, courtesy of Didi and its global network of partners. Likewise, users of Didi's app will have the option to book hotels through Booking.com or Agoda, the companies said.Booking Holdings' corporate development chief, Todd Henrich, talked about the attraction of Didi for his company:\"Didi has clear advantages in technology and scale in the shared-mobility industry. We believe that together we can offer smarter transportation services to our brands' customers, and help Didi's customers with seamless access to the products and services the brands in our company provide throughout the world.\"It's clear that this is a nice move for Booking Holdings, one that will give two of its sites exposure via an app that's wildly popular in some parts of the world. But aside from the investment, what does Didi get out of this deal?What Didi gets is another piece in its quest to turn its app into a global one-stop shop for travel and mobility services.Although much of Didi's business is still in China, the company has made investments in  , including Grab (in Southeast Asia), Ola (in India),  (in Brazil), and Lyft (in the U.S.). Significantly, those relationships are also partnerships that help Didi (and its partners) retain their customers when they travel: Didi's customers can use the Didi app to hail a Lyft in the U.S., for example, and vice versa. This new partnership with Booking Holdings builds on that.Didi has become a key hub in the increasingly interconnected world of ride-hailing. It has acquired some heavy-hitting backers, including  (NASDAQ: AAPL) , which  , and  (NASDAQOTH: SFTBF) , which invested $4.58 billion last year. Of note, SoftBank, like Didi, also holds significant stakes in Ola, Grab, and 99 -- and it's Uber's largest investor.(SoftBank's Vision Fund also has an indirect connection with Lyft: It's an investor in  '  , GM Cruise, and  in 2016.)As I said above, it's not hard to see why this is a good deal for Booking Holdings: It puts two of its apps in front of a huge new audience.But it's also not too hard to see why it's a good deal for Didi Chuxing. It is carefully assembling the pieces to become a global travel-and-mobility powerhouse. It's already close to becoming a one-stop shop for Chinese citizens traveling both in China and abroad (and for foreigners traveling in China, too). As it integrates more tightly with regional mobility partners like Ola, Grab, and Lyft, it could well relegate Uber to also-ran status -- even in markets like the United States.Long story short: Didi has already  in China. Increasingly, it looks to be outflanking its California rival globally as well.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For the Invesco Russell Top 200 Equal Weight ETF (Symbol: EQWL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $60.39 per unit.With EQWL trading at a recent price near $55.08 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.64% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EQWL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Facebook Inc (Symbol: FB), Las Vegas Sands Corp (Symbol: LVS), and Booking Holdings Inc (Symbol: BKNG). Although FB has traded at a recent price of $176.26/share, the average analyst target is 29.48% higher at $228.21/share. Similarly, LVS has 11.78% upside from the recent share price of $71.30 if the average analyst target price of $79.70/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BKNG to reach a target price of $2296.85/share, which is 10.26% above the recent price of $2083.13.

It was a watershed moment for the open market -- or perhaps a catastrophic flash flood, and at the time, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner offered listeners to the  podcast a sampler of five stock recommendations that he felt had some Brexit resonance. Two years on, Brexit is barely even a work in progress. In fact, it's a political quagmire with no blueprint close to being accepted by all sides, and based on the latest news, the negotiations are appearing to grow even more tumultuous. However, though there's no clarity in Europe, it is nonetheless time for him to check back in and see how those picks are performing en route to the three-year holding period he originally suggested.Stock No. 4 was at that time called Priceline, though now it is called  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , a change that reflects the fact that  is the bigger revenue generator. David had it on his list because many watchers were concerned that Brexit might seriously dampen travel, but he took a contrarian view. His baseline for comparison is the  , which is up 26% since he made these picks. As it turns out, Booking has handily outperformed the market.A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! Stock No. 4 -- again, these are all alphabetical by company name -- is Priceline. This one reminds us of how the world changes, because the company Priceline is no longer known by that name. In just the succeeding two years -- really, in just the last several months here in 2018 -- Priceline renamed itself to Booking Holdings, ticker symbol BKNG. Priceline at the time when I picked it two years ago was at $1,339 -- that's right, $1,339 per share, for one share. Today, I'm happy to say it's up to $2,046. The stock is up 53%. Playing along with our game here, 53% minus 26% gives us a plus 27%. That means we're now minus 22% as we go to our final company.But before we get there, I just want to remind you why I included this stock on the Brexit-inspired stock list two years ago. There was a lot of pessimism around travel through Europe. The idea of firming borders was, it's a less fun world, people won't travel as much. And yep, in just a couple of days, Priceline's stock lost 15% reacting to Brexit. The stock had been battered up a little bit. I like the company a lot. It's one of my personal biggest holdings. It's been a big-time winner for Motley Fool Stock Advisor. That's why I included it on this list a couple of years ago. I'm really happy to see that it's up more than 50% since.In fact, this is a company that bought booking.com in 2005. Booking.com was the biggest player in Europe at the time. Back in 2004, when I first picked Priceline, Priceline was mainly an American brand. It was doing what we know today, with the hotels and booking flights and travel, mainly for America. In 2005, it bought booking.com. These days, it's known as Booking Holdings, showing the centerpiece that Booking represents for this company. It also has Agoda, which is the Asian version of Booking or Priceline. It owns the world at this point.It's a beautiful company. It has top and bottom line growth in double digits, even at the size and scale it's achieved today. So, yes, I continue to like this company a lot. I'm really happy to see it was on this list, bringing us within 22 points of publishing a win.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["mong sports' great contests, the quadrennial battle that is the soccer World Cup stands out among the most epic. Win, and you have bragging rights for a nice long run. And given that The Motley Fool is focused on longer-term success, it makes sense that this week on the  podcast, when co-founder David Gardner picks his 15th set of five stocks, he's dedicating it to the World Cup, with timing based on the World Cup.So, his holding period for this set is, of course, four years -- enough time, one hopes, for the market's short-term biases and momentary moods to even out, and for the proverbial cream to rise to the top. Which companies is he betting on and why? Join him on the pitch and find out.A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. Alright, let's get to it! We're going to call this list five stocks celebrating the 2018 World Cup. Each of these I'm suggesting for the next four years, I'm picking each of these stocks individually -- I hope -- and certainly the group together, as market-beaters. We're going to try to outpace the S&P 500, as we do in all things here at The Motley Fool, or at least with my approach through  and  . This is our 15th stock sampler. And, yes, the market is still at or near all-time highs, just like it was in 2016. It'll be interesting to see how these four years ago, especially for these five stocks.Stock No. 1. This is one I've already talked about on this podcast. It has a different name than two years ago. It's  (NASDAQ: BKNG) . The ticker symbol is BKNG. How could I not pick one of my personal biggest holdings, a company I deeply admire, that's such a dominant worldwide player, and that's still enjoying such significant growth?Some of that growth might be coming in ways that you or I might not expect. For example, have you ever heard of Airbnb? I bet you have. I have, too. A lot of people think that Airbnb might make life tough on hotels in particular -- hotels, motels, etc. Why pay  or  when arguably, you could pay less and stay in sometimes nicer accommodations by using something like Airbnb? Sounds like a threat, doesn't it, to Priceline/Booking/Agoda?Here's some good news. As of -- well, I'm looking at last summer's numbers, anyways. I'm assuming these haven't changed dramatically. Airbnb had about four million unique properties that were listed there that you could stay in, that you could rent. Booking, with the same business model, had five million places that you could stay that were not hotels or motels. Like Airbnb, Booking is doing the same kind of a business. It's playing in that sharing economy. What might look like a threat to some on Wall Street as they look at Booking Holdings, maybe they need to make sure they've done their homework and recognize that that same model's going to work really well for this company, too.BKNG, again, the ticker symbol. It's been an 85-bagger for Stock Advisor members who listened to me when I first picked it in 2004. But even more fun, I think -- even though it hasn't been quite as rewarding -- was when, in 2010, I decided to rerecommend Priceline at the time for Stock Advisor members. A lot of people were saying, \"It's already up eight times! From 2004 to 2010, it's gone up eight times! Why would you recommend we buy this stock today?\"The reason this is fun is because, as of this year now, it is up 949% from that rerecommendation. Over 900% is a ten-bagger. Doing the math -- always reminding people of this, by the way -- a 100% gain is a two-bagger. A 900% gain is a ten-bagger. That rerecommendation is up itself ten times in value, proving that when you find a great horse, stick with it. Keep the bets in place. Maybe add some more purse over the course of time, because these great companies can win the triple crown sometimes on their own track by themselves. Booking Holdings is a good example of that, BKNG, stock No. 1.Alright. Again, proceeding alphabetically, stock No. 2 is  (NASDAQOTH: DASTY) . The ticker symbol is DASTY. I attempted just a slight French lilt, with the accent grave over one of those Es in the second name. That's my high school schoolboy French talking. The one that I didn't continue, the one that, sadly, I kind of lost. I can still pronounce French pretty well, I just can't speak it back and forth very well at all.Dassault Systemes has been an outstanding performer since first picked in September of 2009. It's up 429% for Stock Advisor members. The market over that time is up 206%, so it's a couple of hundred percentage points ahead of the market. It's a five-bagger. It's a $36 billion company today, but a lot of people haven't heard of it.Some people in America might especially ask, \"Is France really a capitalist nation?\" There's a lot of socialism, or has been, in France. Although, under Macron, it looks like more and more capitalism might be in the offing. If so, I think that's a great antidote to beleaguered Europe. A stronger, more capitalist France sounds really good to me. If so, Dassault Systemes would be a great example of that.This is a company that was operating in CAD/CAM software back in the day. When you were designing things using software, whether you were an architectural designer, or you were designing packaging for a new children's toy, you could use CAD/CAM software to design it right there on the computer and show people, prototypically, what it would look like. Well, that's still a big business today for Dassault Systemes. But as the world has moved more and more toward 3D graphics, or think about virtual reality, think about all of those assets and prototypes that are being developed purely digitally, you're seeing the beauty of being a leader in that space, which is certainly what Dassault Systemes is. Again, the ticker symbol is DASTY.As the world goes more and more 3D -- in fact, their website is 3ds.com, you can check it out -- as the world goes toward virtual and augmented reality, you're going to see a lot more use of this company's product. Already, though, very substantial worldwide leader.And, great to include France here. As I do this taping, France is still alive in the World Cup, so I have France on my mind. I'm certainly cheering them on. I'd like to see them do pretty well. I'm not sure, at the end of the day, I think I'd pick England to win it all if I had to pick a team right now. But I'm certainly cheering France on. Good luck, France. But, even more, good luck Dassault Systemes.Stock No. 3. This is not a stock tied to a specific country. I do have couple of others coming on this list. Nope, this one is the No. 1 maker of the biggest FIFA World Cup video game in the world, and that would, of course, be  (NASDAQ: EA) . Today, with its ticker symbol, EA, it totes a $44 billion market cap and is one of the worldwide leaders in interactive entertainment. In fact, the FIFA World Cup 2018 game that many are enjoying -- maybe you have it on your PlayStation or Xbox these days -- that is in its 25th installment.Certainly, a big part of EA's success over a few decades now has been these sports games, like Madden football or FIFA World Cup. They just keep coming out with a new edition each year that fans willingly pay up for -- most years, anyway, as long as it gets decent enough reviews, as long as the company has put some effort into improving the game from one year to the next. I can't say that Electronic Arts has distinguished itself every year in that regard, but more often than not, it has, which is why it has a very substantial sports business.Of course, EA has wide-ranging assets and properties across all genres of interactive entertainment, not just sports. But, because this is our five stocks celebrating the World Cup list, I had to think about including Electronic Arts, one of my favorite companies.This is, if you're a Motley Fool  member, a starter stock. Hint hint, if you're not a Motley Fool  member -- we think you should join  , just go to  or  and take a 30-day free trial to join us at  . You'll see what our starter stocks are. That's a shorter list of stocks that we think anybody who's just starting investing, these are good picks for them. Why? Because usually, these are companies with larger sizes, more substantial resources, they're safer companies, and most of these companies, you would recognize their names. They're recognizable names in businesses in which they reside. They're often the leader within their category.Certainly, Electronic Arts is one such example, and darn it, I wish I'd picked this stock on my Brexit-inspired stock list two years in place of  ! I did actually pick this stock for  in June of 2016. It's up 89% since then, with the market up 36%, marked directly against the market. This would have been a big-time winner.That's why I'm putting it on my list for the next four years. A company like this, I see thriving and continuing to grow, again, for at least the next decade plus out, unless the world changes in some way I can't really see. Interactive entertainment, big brands, these are really vital businesses, and Electronic Arts is a great example. That's stock No. 3.We're coming down the home stretch. Here comes stock No. 4, the company  (NASDAQ: MELI) . The ticker symbol is MELI. Again, a slight effort at trying to pronounce the name as a native speaker of Spanish might. This is a company that's a $13 billion company. It's one I've mentioned a number of times on this podcast. I'm sure, in some of our five-stock samplers, I've included it. I'm not looking at the full list right now. It's one of my favorite go-to companies.Here's a few things about MercadoLibre. First of all, I'd like to point out that a number of Latin American countries are still in the World Cup. MercadoLibre operates in all of them. That's one of the things I love about the World Cup, actually. Latin America doesn't often make the leadership category when you look at a lot of other, especially athletic, things worldwide. You don't see a lot of dominance in the Winter Olympics or the Summer Olympics from this block, although it's well ahead of the Middle East in terms of its gold medals, no doubt. But, think about soccer and how many tremendous teams come out of Latin America. So, I had to think about including this company on my five-stock sampler.Two more quick things I want to say about MercadoLibre. First of all, it has for me what I consider to be a shockingly low, and therefore very promising, risk rating. One of the things we do at The Motley Fool and in  and  , my services, is we put a number estimating the risk we think you take on when you buy a stock. We make that number somewhere between 0 to 25 -- the higher the number, the higher the risk of the stock. Our highest-risk stock that I think I've ever recommended off that 0-25-point scale is a 17 or 18. Very infrequently do I take that much risk. In general, we like to take, if possible, as little risk as we can and get the best returns we can imagine.This is a tremendous multi-bagger for us off of a risk rating of five. That means, the way we define risk, that your chances of actually losing money if you hold this over a long period of time are very, very low. That's how we estimate risk.When I talk about our risk ratings, longtime listeners will remember, I've done a whole series on risk ratings. It's something that I care and think a lot about. It's something we invented at Motley Fool  . I love these risk ratings, so I really wanted to double underline that -- a risk rating of just five for Mercado Libre. Really surprisingly safe investment for what might sound like a risky e-commerce player in a sometimes-volatile area of the world. But no, this is a grounded company with a $13 billion market cap.In fact, since Uruguay is still in the World Cup, I decided I'd just visit the Mercado Libre Uruguay site. Sure enough, right on the front page, they're advertising a soccer ball. They're advertising Father's Day 40% off prices. Father's Day, as it turns out, in Uruguay, is the 15th of July. It's maybe a universally celebrated day worldwide, but at least in the country of Uruguay -- side note, a little bit of trivia for you coming out of your  podcast experience -- this year, it's the 15th of July in Uruguay. And yep, they're advertising soccer balls for Dad. Play soccer with Dad for Father's Day.Have I saved the best for last? Well, these are all alphabetical, so we go down from M and we hit the letter Y. This is a really interesting company. It might be the best performer for last. We'll see. If it is, it'll be a lot better than its recent performance, which hasn't been great.The company is  (NASDAQ: YNDX) , ticker symbol YNDX. How could I not think to include this longer-time  ? I first picked it in 2012, so it's almost six years old in the  service. It's up 54% over that time, the market up 114%, so Yandex is down 60% to the market.But if you know search engines, and you think about companies like Google, and you think, who's the Google of Russia? What's the No. 1 most-used search engine among Russian speakers, in that area of the world? And the answer is Yandex, a company founded in 1997 by Arkady Volozh, who today is still the CEO and founder of this company. He is a billionaire, but he's not one of those Russian billionaires who's just sitting on a whole heap of oil and milking it or striking questionable deals with the Russian government. Some of those oligarchs, there are a lot of questions about where that money's come from asked worldwide in a more transparent world these days. No, Volozh has done it through inventing the Google of Russia.This is a company I have great hope for. It has been, as I mentioned, a significant underperformer over its first six years. But as I watch Russia, through penalty kicks, advance into the next round of the tournament, being held in Russia, it makes me happy for the nation. I think the better it performs, the more it comes online and connects with the rest of the world. I have great hopes for Russia, and not just for their soccer team or their national pride, but very specifically for the capitalism.When I look at Yandex, I see a company that is the No. 1 search engine, but it's also doing a lot of other interesting things that you might do the same if you were Arkady Volozh looking at other competitors worldwide. \"Who else is leading in search engines in other places? Let's start to mimic them,\" I think Volozh has been thinking, because in 2017, Yandex began to introduce its intelligent personal assistant, which is Alice.Then, a few months later, it's time to buy Foodfox, a food delivery service. Or, how about this year, when it combined with Uber to merge their businesses in Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, and Georgia, but most prominently there in Russia, so that Uber and Yandex are now together operating Uber Russia, another pretty good business model? Yandex owns the majority of that stake, and Uber owns a minority of that stake.If you're seeing what Volozh is doing here, what Yandex is doing, they're getting into a lot of horizontal businesses using the optionality that you get if you're the leader in search for an important territory in the world. So, let's see how Yandex does over the next four years.OK, those were our five stocks. Just recounting them alphabetically to close: Booking Holdings, BKNG; Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, DASTY; Electronic Arts, EA; Mercado Libre, MELI; and finally, Yandex, YNDX. Good luck, five stocks celebrating the 2018 World Cup.

On Tuesday, Mahaney dished advice at Fortune\u2019s Brainstorm Tech conference in a presentation called, \"10 Lessons, 10 Minutes: The Perils of Stock Picking in Tech.\"Investors, when is the time to pick a tech stock? Mahaney says: \u201cLook for the lucky lexicon.\u201d You know the ones -- those pop culture names dominating everyday conversation. That\u2019s when you know \u201cit\u2019s a really good time to invest in the stock.\u201dUsing  Top 25 Experts tool, we can see Mahaney has earned a high ranking of #11 out of over 4,800 analysts on Wall Street. TipRanks compiles market data to track analyst accountability based on how financial calls perform. To put it bluntly, veteran market watcher Mahaney\u2019s track record is on fire.We have cherry-picked three internet stocks the five-star analyst says are gains-makers to watch. Let\u2019s dive in.Netflix () is the video streaming king dominating Wall Street talk this week, just maybe not in the way bulls had anticipated. This internet leader surprised investors with a rocky second quarter earnings show, specifically on key metric new subscriber additions. It comes as a particular plot twist, considering Netflix hasn\u2019t fallen short of quarterly subscriber forecasts in five quarters. That run has come to an end, and bearish frenzy got stirred up in the process.That said, since the print, the \u2018Moderate Buy\u2019 stock has racked up 14 buy ratings in two days, a total bullish camp of 22 analysts in the last 3 months firmly in Netflix\u2019s corner. Consensus analyst expectations call for 6% in return potential within the next 12-months. Don\u2019t give up on this tech giant just yet. Even before the , Mahaney saw a company that \u201cstill\u201d unleashed \u201ca significant lead over YouTube, Amazon & Hulu, all of which also dropped vs. March\u201d in terms of his latest poll. The poll indicated 55% - over half \u2013 of respondents watched Netflix during the second quarter. Though this marks a fall compared to the 60% in March, Mahaney highlighted a rise against the 53% seen in May 2017.Moreover, satisfaction trends continue to shine \u201cconsistently positive.\u201d After all, Mahaney ran encouraging numbers here: \u201c68% of Netflix subs were \u2018Extremely\u2019 or \u2018Very Satisfied\u2019 - same as last four quarters.\u201d Internationally, France and Germany surveys show that \u201cNetflix is taking over Europe.\u201d Mahaney sees room for Netflix to fly 20% more to $450 within the next three years and says shares could spiral up to $750.Bottom line: Netflix\u2019s \u201clong-term fundamental trends remain intact.\u201d Mahaney rates NFLX an Outperform. Consider that the analyst reaps 55.5% in average profits when betting bullish on Netflix. In other words, it does not seem Mahaney\u2019s upbeat sentiment on the stock is bound to change any time soon. ()Online travel giant Booking Holdings Inc () CEO Glenn Fogel wanted to rebrand the company formerly known as Priceline Group. Fogel\u2019s intent: make it clear that flagship \u201cBooking.com is the biggest in the group.\u201dBy February, the trip giant changed its name, putting BKNG\u2019s hotel-and-home-rental unit center-stage. The priority transition is fitting, considering the unit stands as Booking Holding\u2019s largest. Booking Holdings is an internet favorite on Wall Street, as the \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 stock has received 11 buy ratings in 3 months. Consensus believes the stock could reach $2,288.08 (13% upside potential). .While Mahaney dialed his price target down to $2,500 following BKNG\u2019s first quarter earnings show in May, this still suggests nearly 24% in return potential for the stock. Mahaney holds tight to his Outperform rating on Booking Holdings, as he explains: \u201cmarketing has clearly been one of Booking's core competencies over the last dozen years.\"Mahaney\u2019s call: look for growth and profitability to make a comeback in the back half of this year and in 2019. Additionally, the company is shifting focus to the \u201clocal attractions market,\u201d one that ought to be \u201ca very robust addition to its platform.\u201dAudiophile favorite Spotify () has gained popularity as a music streaming giant over the last ten years. It wasn\u2019t until early April 2018 that Spotify had an IPO. Mahaney surveyed the internet giant with enthusiasm: he initiated ahead of the IPO with an Outperform rating on Spotify and a $220 price target. Keep in mind, \u201cscale matters,\u201d says Mahaney.The \u2018Moderate Buy\u2019 stock has received 14 buy ratings in the last 3 months. Mahaney sees 18% in return potential still to go for Spotify within the next 12 months and \u201c70%+ upside vs. recent private transaction price of $127.50.\u201d Personalization is an asset to Spotify; and via personalization, the company can grow an already loud fan base even further.Look for the company to continue to outpace Apple with sales that could reach $8.32 billion by next year. Bet on this \u201cglobal music streaming leader,\u201d if you want to play the Wall Street game as well as Mahaney. .Our database spans more than 5,000 stocks.

According to data from  , the stock has given up 30% through July 11.As you can see from the chart below, most of the stock's losses this year came after it badly missed the mark in its first-quarter earnings report, which came out at the end of April. data by  .Trivago, which went public at the end of 2016 after being spun off by  , initially flew out of the gates: The stock had doubled by last summer. However, results  by aggressive spending by Booking Holdings, which was focused on gaining market share at the time, and also penalties that Trivago assessed to Booking for violating its user terms.Image source: Trivago.Booking has since lowered its spending on Trivago, moving some of that budget to Google, and as a result, Trivago's revenue growth has dramatically slowed. The stock is actually down 78% from a year ago as revenue growth has gone from 67% in the second quarter of last year to a decline of 3% in the first quarter of 2018 to 259.4 million euros, which was in line with expectations. On the bottom line, the company turned in a loss of $0.07 per share compared to expectations for a $0.01-per-share loss. Shares tumbled 26% on April 25 when the news came out, essentially making up the stock's entire decline this year.Trivage stock was also pressured by management cutting its outlook for the year from 5%-10% revenue growth to just flat, as it expects bidding partners to focus even more on profitability, thereby lowering cost-per-click rates. Still, it sees growth returning in the second half of the year and expects steady growth into the future, as the company is focused on carving out a larger portion of the hotel-booking market, spending aggressively on marketing.If Trivago can return to steady growth, the stock should recover at least some of these losses.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Booking Holdings wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! Let's move on now to the other end of the spectrum that I mentioned. Now, we'll talk a little bit about Booking Holdings.Formerly known as Priceline, this is a huge company, over $100 billion in market cap. Even though  is less than a tenth of that size, and it's been dinged for really failing to deliver the growth that investors want for the past several years, Booking Holdings is on an absolute tear, with about 20% growth in the top and bottom lines last quarter.The thing that always shocks me about this company is the breadth of its full portfolio. If you've heard of booking.com or Priceline or KAYAK or rentalcars.com or even OpenTable, guess what? Those are all under the same Booking Holdings umbrella. Really impressive. With that kind of reach and that kind of consistent growth, the stock has been very, very kind to shareholders. The company is quite a favorite here at Fool HQ. What do you think is the secret sauce here, Asit, in terms of the strength of this business? What I love about booking.com is, it has an extremely simple strategy, and that is to take the market by brute force. The company only has a very small portion of the total market share for travel, as big as it is. Among online travel agencies, it's quite huge. But, as Vince had mentioned, booking.com has grown by being a serial acquirer. Just to give you a couple of other names besides the ones you called out, I'll list Agoda, OpenTable, I think you said that, and momondo.com, which I've used before to isolate flights that didn't show up on other engines, which were actually owned by booking.com.This strategy of tacking on is really a brute force mechanism to increase inventory. If you look at some statistics from the very last quarter that's been recorded, booking.com had approximately 1,740,000 properties on its website as of March 31st of 2018. That comprised 415,000 hotels and resorts, and approximately 1,325,000 homes, apartments and, they call them, other unique places to stay. I hope we have time to talk about the alternate lodging market in just a moment here.The company hasn't grown this way through organic growth, but having its sales force go out and acquire more and more hotels for its listing on its original site, priceline.com, as you point out, Vince. Using capital from its pretty high margins to keep buying up more what is essentially hotel inventory, is the way that it's grown. It's a different strategy than TripAdvisor, which is smaller, more specialized, relies on content to drive its growth. This is a very easy-to-understand economic engine. And if you doubted that engine several years ago, you would have missed out on a lot of return.It doesn't have quite the allure of a really, really highly technical company. Basically, it functions very similar to the way it did when it first originated. However, that's led to -- let's look at this most recent quarter again -- gross bookings were up 25% to $25 billion. Now, that's not the company's net. The company's net sales out of that were $2.9 billion. But, you can imagine what it takes to achieve $25 billion worth of gross bookings. That's a lot of hotel rooms. That's what I love about this stock -- it's really easy to understand how it makes its money, and it's a very consistent earner in that respect. Yeah. I will add that, what you mentioned, in terms of, Booking is the industry gorilla, but at the same time, its slice of the pie is relatively small. The total bookings that I could find for 2017, $80 billion. The total digital travel spending for last year, I think, was nearly $600 billion. So, again, a really small piece of that pie, and quite a runway for the company going forward.In terms of outlook, I think macro factors are really going to influence this business more so than maybe specific competitors, because as the overall travel industry grows, I think Booking is in a really strong position to continue expanding its share of the pie, even though management has acknowledged, quite a few times now, that going forward, the company's growth will decelerate just due to the scale, it being the No. 1 player in this space.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (Symbol: IVW) where we have detected an approximate $129.4 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.6% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 130,050,000 to 130,800,000).

Leading tech stocks tend to dominate 90% of the market, the second-place company gets 9%, and everyone else scraps for the remaining 1%.If you're an investor, the rule is simpler: Go with the winner.This is where we get the word \"WinTel\" from. WinTel described the virtual PC monopoly held by the Microsoft (  ) Windows operating system, running on Intel (  ) hardware, 20 years ago. You could have owned Apple (  ) in 1994, or Advanced Micro Devices (  ), but in terms of the market as it was at the time, you would have been wrong.You go with a winner until it's no longer winning, notes Rich Winer, a wealth adviser with Steel Peak Wealth Management LLC in Woodland Hills, California. \"People assume that just because a company has had a strong run, that the run has to end,\" he says.The end of the run isn't based on valuation, but technology.

It was an intermediary, between small goods producers and retailers. Only in the past few years has it begun building out its physical infrastructure.This has impacted Alibaba's profitability; it earned about $1 billion in its most recent quarter, on revenue of about $3.6 billion. That's just more than half the net income of a year earlier, on 45% more revenue.But the pros still love Alibaba.For one, 46 of 47 analysts currently covering BABA shares consider them an \"Overweight\" or \"Buy.\" Allyson Berry, an account coordinator at BackBay Communications in Boston, goes one step further, calling Alibaba \"the perfect stock.\"\"Its fundamentals are super strong, and institutions are buying it with both hands,\" she says. \"I have been doing the same and have more than doubled my money since I began doing so in November 2016.\"That's because Alibaba also is becoming the dominant cloud player in its home market, expanding around the world. Meanwhile, it continues to expand its e-commerce services across fast-growing markets in South and Southeast Asia, including payment services. It has a clear runway to keep growing.Market value: $806.7 billionAlphabet (  , $1,155.08) division Google has been the leader in Internet search for so long that the names of its onetime competitors -- such as Excite, Ask Jeeves and Altavista -- are now nearly forgotten. When you search for something online, you \"Google\" it.Google defined the space by focusing all its attention on the service, not on monetizing it, and by offering a clean, simple interface. Its purchases of DoubleClick and YouTube in the mid-2000s sent revenues and profits into overdrive. In 2017 its gross profit came to $65 billion, which came on $110 billion in revenue. Even after building new cloud data centers, entering numerous consumer markets and relaunching YouTube Red as a paid media distribution channel, Alphabet still had net income of more than $12 billion.Expansion in new directions naturally carries new risks. Josh Blechman, director of capital markets at exchange-traded fund provider Exponential ETFs, doesn't worry about those risks, saying the company is still well-positioned \"as media consumption continues to move away from the television.\"There is now \"a generation of kids growing up with the notion of a household without a cable box,\" he says, allowing the company to redefine the entertainment as well as information-gathering experience. The company's strong cash flow has also let it invest in \"moonshots\" such as self-driving cars, Google Fiber and Nest intelligent devices that will define its future.Despite a market cap of almost $800 billion, and despite shares selling at roughly 50 times last year's earnings and nearly seven times sales, 39 of 44 analysts give the stock a buy-equivalent rating.Market value: $839.3 billionAmazon.com (  , $1,710.63) isn't just the dominant player in e-commerce, with about half the U.S. market.It is the dominant player in cloud computing.Amazon has become king of the cloud by doing just what it did with its online store: It rented it. Hundreds of thousands of merchants operate on Amazon's website. Some have their orders shipped by Amazon, others only use sales services. All Amazon did, in 2006, was apply this model to its cloud data centers. Amazon Web Services was born.AWS had $5.4 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2018, up 49% from a year earlier. Among its big customers are Netflix (  ), which recently became worth more than any other entertainment company -- more than Walt Disney (  ), even more than Comcast (  ).Amazon's stock is laughable in so many ways. It trades for more than $1,700 per share, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 217 times trailing profits, and 85 times next year's. It trades at 5 times sales. And yet ... 45 of 47 analysts think the stock is buy-worthy, and the other two think it's at least worth holding on to if you've already got it.Levi Sanchez, co-founder of Millennial Wealth in Seattle, agrees. \"They make all their decisions based on data, and they're not afraid to operate at a loss to gain market share,\" he says.Amazon's cloud cash flow \"allows them to fund their ambitions across retail, entertainment and devices,\" adds Mark Stoeckle, CEO and Portfolio Manager at Adams Funds in Baltimore.Market value: $100.3 billionRemember Priceline? Well, the \"name your price\" hotel site which had  actor William Shatner as its spokesman for years, has grown up.Since buying European site Booking.Com in 2005, Booking Holdings (  , $2,086.93) has acquired a host of other travel sites, including Kayak and OpenTable, and created a virtual \"duopoly\" in the U.S. hotel booking industry with rival Expedia (  ). (Priceline holds the larger market share.)The company shuns stock splits, so there are only 48 million shares. But each one now costs roughly $2,100, which is nearly twice the price of just three years ago. The company posted earnings of $77.03 per share in the previous fiscal year, and shares trade at more than 40 times earnings. But the company's financial results have been precise stairsteps, with sales and profits both doubling over the past five years.Two-thirds of analysts covering the stock have it on their \"buy\" lists, and on the whole, expect earnings of more than $100 per share by fiscal 2019.Travel isn't just about hotels, by the way. Priceline sells air tickets, rents cars and even leads the better-known AirBnB in longer-term vacation rentals of homes and apartments. The company is investing heavily in chatbots, too, to reduce the cost of telephone operators. The company says its AI-driven bots can answer half of all post-booking questions from travelers.Market value: $21.0 billionFew technology companies have been industry leaders for as long as Cerner (  , $62.96), the kings of hospital record keeping.The company has warded off challenges from mainstream technology companies such as Microsoft, Oracle (  ) and Alphabet over the past decade, and has about 17% of its target market.Cerner was founded in 1979 by Arthur Andersen accountants, taking its current name in 1984, then going public in 1986. The company's value has risen sixfold since the current recovery began, buoyed by a series of acquisitions and winning the $4.3 billion contract to manage electronic health records (EHRs) for the Department of Defense. It also won the Veterans Affairs business, finalizing a 10-year contract in May.Net income has been growing 20% annually for years, and the company has nearly as much ready cash ($413 million) as long-term debt ($439 million). Operating cash flow has grown at roughly 17% annually, reaching $438 million in 2017.More than half of analysts covering the stock think it's a buy, with the remainder suggesting holding on at the very least.Market value: $62.7 billionMemory chip maker Micron (  , $53.23) is among the least-loved tech stocks on the market right now, at least based on its valuation.Micron lives in a sector of the market that has seen regular boom-and-bust cycles. As a result, you still can buy it for about 5 times last year's earnings of about 7 times last year's earnings.This boom may be different.

Chip memory is even replacing disk memory in many clouds because it's faster and more reliable.So far, the boom in memory shows no signs of ending. After delivering revenue of $20.3 billion in fiscal 2017, Micron had revenue of $6.8 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2018, then $7.3 billion in its next quarter. The company then reported $7.8 billion in the quarter reported in June. That puts the company on track to reach more than $29 billion in revenue for the year -- a nearly 50% growth rate.The company's profits are also accelerating, hitting $5.9 billion in the second quarter alone, then another $3.8 billion in its most recent quarter -- topping analyst estimates.You'd think analysts would be screaming \"buy,\" and most are -- 26 of 34 like it, though seven have it as a \"hold\" and one even rates it a \"sell.\" A few analysts still are trying to tease out when the current tech boom might end.Even when that happens, however, Micron should still be cheap as chips.Market value: $150.6 billionNvidia (  , $247.33) originally was known as a \"graphics chip\" company, with a niche in helping video game players see more realism with less latency.That hasn't changed -- Nvidia dominates this market. But the same hardware techniques used to make Lara Croft smile are also at the heart of self-driving cars, solving cryptographic puzzles and delivering artificial intelligence from clouds. This has sent the shares of Nvidia up 370% in the past two years.Has it come too far too fast? Not so, says Ron Weiner, managing partner and director of RDM Financial Group at HighTower in Westport, Connecticut. \"Just think about how many chips will be needed to power an autonomous vehicle in the future, with artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and data centers,\" he says.The autonomous vehicle market -- just one of Nvidia's niches -- is expected to be worth $60 billion by 2035, the company says. As artificial intelligence continues to make our lives easier, Nvidia will be at the heart of it, Weiner says.Allyson Berry of Backbay Communications in Boston agrees, saying Nvidia's results fit squarely in their 15-stock momentum growth strategy index -- one whose approach is based on that of Investor's Business Daily founder William O'Neil.Despite Nvidia's rapid rise, other analysts are quickly lining up with this position. Assuming it can meet its current earnings estimate of $7.25 per share this year -- and it has regularly been powering past quarterly estimates by 50 cents per share and more - it would have a P/E of 34. That's a bargain for this company's future growth prospects.Market value: $104.8 billionAs good as it is to be a dominant cloud player, sometimes it's better to be a major cloud user. Salesforce.com (  , $141.40) illustrates this point.Salesforce has led the move of business applications to the cloud, which has been a key to industrial transformation this decade. Salesforce grew into its $100 billion market cap by putting database applications in the cloud and selling them through a monthly subscription.This began with customer relationship management (hence the CRM ticker), but it now boasts cloud offerings covering sales, service and applications, as well as marketing. The company is expected to grow sales at more than 20% annually in each of the next two years. Revenues of $3 billion for the quarter ended in April resulted in $344 million (11%) in net income.Steve Koenig, Managing Director for Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, says it can still outperform. He has a $150 price target on shares that were selling for $139 in mid-June, believing its recent acquisition of MuleSoft provides \"the capability to unlock data trapped in isolated systems and accelerate customers' digital transformations.\" He sees the valuation as attractive, and thinks CRM has a \"long runway for growth.\"Market value: $4.1 billionThe smallest company, and the smallest niche, among these kingly tech stocks is Teladoc (  , $63.35), which has a market cap of just more than $4 billion but a solid lead in the business of connecting doctors with patients remotely. If you live in a big city, you may have never heard of Teladoc. If you're in the wilds of Alaska, they may be essential.The company has been on a buying spree, most recently acquiring Advance Medical for $352 million in June. Advance adds episodic and complex care to the Teladoc portfolio and offers it the chance to scale globally.While most health care companies have their fates tied to the U.S. market, Teladoc is increasingly international, with one-third of the 42 million employees currently covered based outside the U.S. Teladoc's virtual system also lets it tap niches such as mental health service for young males who are otherwise tough to reach.You will pay for this potential. Teladoc sells for just less than 15 times revenues, and it has yet to show a profit. But when your sales are doubling every year, investors tend to give you a pass. The company is due to report earnings on July 31, with a loss of about 37 cents per share expected on revenue of $92.5 million. That's more than twice the $44.6 million in sales for the same quarter a year ago.That's why 13 of the 16 analysts following Teladoc have a buy rating on the stock. Most of those issuing new reports are upgrading their ratings or raising their price targets.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t's not everyday that businesses can boast market opportunities that top $1 trillion.

Welcome to  , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. I'm your host, Vincent Shen, and we're in the Fool HQ studio today, pre-recording this show for Tuesday, June 19th.The summer solstice is almost here, meaning vacations and travel activity are already starting to pick up. For this season, we're going to look at the latest news from two online travel companies, Booking Holdings, ticker BKNG, and TripAdvisor, ticker TRIP.Joining me today is senior Motley Fool contributor, Asit Sharma, who's calling in to the Fool HQ studio via Skype. Hey, Asit! Thanks for hopping on with us! Hey, Vince! Hello, listeners! I hope everyone's summer is getting off to a fantastic start. I know mine is. I'm pretty pumped to talk about these two companies. This is a really interesting space.But before we get into our main topic, I know that you wanted to briefly cover Funko, ticker FNKO. This is another company from the IPO class of 2017, but it's not one that we spoke about during our recent IPO update episode from a few weeks ago. Funko is a small-cap, currently trading with a market capitalization of about $550 million. The company priced its IPO last November at $12 per share. It's experienced some rocky trading since then. It's only recently recovered to above $10 per share in the past month or so.The company makes pop culture-inspired consumer products. Take some of your favorite movie or video game characters or musicians or athletes, and Funko basically turns them into figurines, plush toys, apparel, and other fun items. As part of its business, the company has a lot of licensing agreements with different intellectual properties, including all 15 of the highest-grossing movie franchises in history.Last year, Funko generated $516 million of revenue, and that was 21% growth over the prior year. Its primary product category has historically been these figures, but it's starting to branch out into different product categories. I'll stop there, Asit. First, I wanted to ask you how Funko ended up on your radar, because it's a smaller company, not one that would necessarily come up in terms of some of the screens that we do and things like that. I'm curious how you heard of it. Sure, Vince. I want to credit one of our dozens of loyal listeners on this one. This is Brandon Stokes, who's actually a friend of mine. He is a young investor, and invests in very forward-looking companies. We have coffee every few months and sit down and talk about stocks, and he brought this to my attention. Brandon bought Funko after its IPO and cued me into this company. I realized much later that I did know about Funko, because I have three teenage sons -- listeners, you've probably heard me talk about them from time to time -- and I realized we had a couple of  bobbleheads around the house that emanate from this company.That's how I found out about it. I did some research, and I think it's very interesting, as well, Vince. I really love the idea of intellectual property. We've talked in the past about so many franchise-style companies.  is one that we've discussed in terms of having strong intellectual property and then licensing that, letting other people do the hard work.Funko is on the flip side of that model. It actively seeks out licenses from major companies. As you named,  is one, for example. Then, they create whatever the ebb and flow of pop culture is alighting on at the moment. I love this idea: everyone is a fan of something. That's Funko's motto, and it really speaks to the idea of this stream of fun things that people align on and can be monetized.The company is also a manufacturer. Once it gets a license, it goes out and uses manufacturers in Vietnam and China, for example, to manufacture these goods at a low cost. It has gross margins of about 30%, which we'll get to in just a moment. I think those can improve some. But just to give you a little bit more information about the company, they have over 1,000 licensed, what they call properties. Any time the company goes out and figures, let's take Han Solo , for example, let's license Han Solo 's likeness into a bobblehead or a vinyl figurine -- that's called a property. They have about a thousand of these licensed properties, and they can go from the idea stage to a pre-order in about 70 hours. This is an example of how quickly tastes in pop culture move.So these are just a few more facts about Funko. I think, again, with this IPO class of 2017 we talked about, another one to put on your radar screen and watch over the next few quarters. The only thing I'll add -- we have to move on quickly here -- is, with that time to market that you just mentioned, the fact that they have to capitalize on opportunities like a new movie release, a new video game release, for example, they compare, I saw in their 10-K, the way they do this, bringing products to market quickly, they compare it to fast fashion apparel companies. They talk about how they can go from the design stage to store shelves between about 110 and 200 days traditionally, sometimes in as few as 70 days. To give a specific example, with the release of the  movie in 2014, the company said they were pre-selling a figurine for Baby Groot within a week of the film's release. They move very quickly when the consumer interest in these properties, as you described, is at its peak.The other thing I would like to add, in terms of the high-level opportunity, in terms of pop culture and accessories and how much consumers might want them, in the company's IPO filing, they present a pretty interesting case for the growing influence of pop culture thanks to there being more movies, more TV shows, more video games, and the increasing quality of that content, and then, the ability for fans to connect and engage with that content through, for example, social media and other forums. They really make a solid case for that. actually gets brought up. Its traditional retail business is falling apart at this point since most video games can simply be downloaded without any sort of actual disk or cartridge now. The company is placing a lot of its hope in its collectibles segment, which is pretty comparable to what Funko does. That collectibles segment for GameStop has more than doubled in the past few years. Revenue was up almost 30% in 2017 to $635 million. It was up another 25% in the most recently reported quarter. If you read GameStop's earnings call discussion of that segment, they mention several times the importance of being quick to market with their collectibles. Obviously, again, that speaks to Funko's abilities there. I'm going to stop us there just because we have this whole other space to talk about.Our main event is the online travel agencies. The main thing I always like to remind people of when getting into this topic is the scale. Online travel sales make up a huge industry that's been growing double digits for years now. It should still average about 9% annual growth through 2020, at which point spending will hit almost $800 billion. Right now, though, the online spending still makes up less than half of global travel spending in total. We're talking about, ballpark, about $1.6 trillion, a massive sum.The two companies we're discussing today, TripAdvisor and Booking Holdings, they represent what I would consider different ends of the spectrum. First, we'll talk TripAdvisor. I'm sure many of you listening have referred to TripAdvisor reviews and guides in the past when you've done your vacation planning. The company has over 430 million average monthly unique visitors, and though it previously relied on paid clicks from those users to book lodgings and other accommodations, the company has spent about two years now trying to become a destination itself for booking hotels and other accommodations.The results of those efforts have been somewhat mixed. If you look back five years, the stock has really languished. It's trading at about half its all-time highs. But more recently, investors have been flocking to the company. For 2018 year to date, TripAdvisor shows are actually up almost 70%. Asit, what's the latest for TripAdvisor? Why the bullishness recently? Vince, the bullishness is ironically not due to any wild revenue growth that the company has in the future. It's due to improving margins, the basic blocking and tackling of strong companies that have these built-in, recurring revenue streams. TripAdvisor sprung to life this year, up 67% to date, because investors like what they're seeing in its earnings.What really caught my eye is the way the company's controlling its marketing spend. Previously, TripAdvisor has been a big spender in the online marketplace. But in recent quarters, it started to shift a little bit. It's advertising on TV, interestingly enough. I think the company spent about $24 million on TV advertising in the last quarter, which is unusual. As a result, it's using that marketing budget much more effectively. If you look at selling and marketing spend in the first quarter of this year, the company spent $198 million. That's 52.4% of total sales of $378 million. Go back to last year this time, TripAdvisor had a spend which was about 55.6% of its $372 million in sales. That's about a 4% or 400 basis point reduction right there.That's something, when you have a revenue stream which is highly predictable, if you can't grow that revenue stream by leaps and bounds, any ability to show efficiency in the margin will attract investors' attention. And I think there was some pent-up demand for the stock, too, given that it had languished while other companies, other online travel agencies -- like Booking Holdings, which we'll talk about later -- had continued to climb. There may be a perception on investors' parts that it's time to pour into the stock. OK. Some of the major themes for this company that jumped out to me, at least, have been, one, its transition from just a place for reviews to an actual portal for people to book their travel; two, it's clear that management is really trying to figure out how they're going to further monetize this massive user base that they have, all this traffic that they get, especially as users migrate to mobile platforms, which presents some challenges for them that we'll talk about; and then, three, they have to manage some of the competition that they're getting from bigger peers like Booking Holdings but also big tech names like  as well. This is still a very fragmented space and definitely presents some unique competitive challenges in that way.On the mobile front, I'll just speak to the fact that management has mentioned how the higher mobile traffic that it's seeing has a multi-prong effect on the business. On one hand, the advertising revenue goes down, because the company wants to keep their mobile experience relatively clean, easy to use. That means less ads on the mobile site. On the other hand, conversion rates are weaker on mobile in general, which means partners end up paying less per click they receive from users through TripAdvisor's portal. That's one way how the transition to mobile is challenging the business.But management is really focused on the fact that, there's nothing they can do about traffic moving to the mobile platform. Trying to optimize that traffic, keep the user experience as positive as possible, and develop the revenue opportunities there, is definitely a priority for them.Then, something else that I know that you wanted to speak to is the importance of a new category for them or a growing category, and that's with experiences. Do you want to share a little bit about that? Sure. The company breaks its revenue up into two segments, basically its hotel and non-hotel services. Non-hotel services are comprised of three components: experiences, restaurants, and rentals. Those of you who have been following TripAdvisor for a long time may remember when it first got into this idea of selling experiences, that is, a complete package, versus just a place to stay on your vacation. It was able to do so, because it has this massive base of content and loyal base of users.I was interested to see that this non-hotel segment grew 36% in the most recent quarter. This is where the company is experiencing revenue opportunity, even though, when you look overall, the total revenue is still sort of flat-lined. I think that this is also a consequence of that revenue per user that you talked about, Vince, they call it revenue per hotel shopper, that's decreasing as time goes on. They're getting less conversion. They're getting less out of their marketing efforts. That revenue decreased 11% to $0.42 per visitor in the last quarter. Meta-search, which is the tool they've used for a long time, searching for a hotel and TripAdvisor's site comes on, that's getting weaker. However, the content they've built over a number of years is strong enough to the point that it's an attractor for business.I wanted to mention something that's related to all of this. This goes back to, Vince, what you were talking about, in terms of mobile and advertising revenue. Because TripAdvisor is such a great content site, it has really come up in the consciousness of hoteliers and restaurateurs as a place where they should be placing ads. The reason is, if you're looking for this total experience on their site, promotional placement becomes very important. Maybe, as a restaurant, you're not top-of-the-mind when Vince is planning his vacation. But if you have placement on TripAdvisor's site, that will cause you to have a higher placement in that consumer's mind.Surprisingly or not surprisingly, that advertising revenue is starting to increase. Part of this is just hoteliers and restaurateurs trying to get on TripAdvisor's site. I think advertising and subscription revenue, that rose $6 million in the most recent quarter, which provided an offset to that hotel segment revenue, which had declined by about $22 million. We're talking about this hotel-only segment now. So you can see the force of the content that the company's built. It helps absorb some of the traditional revenue that's in decline. I'll just say that, with that non-hotel segment, it's definitely a bright spot that management has pointed to, that investors are watching. In 2015, non-hotel made up, I think, just 15% of the top line. Last year, it was 23%. Pretty rapid growth there.I can see why, personally, in my experience, TripAdvisor is positioned especially well for this opportunity, based on how a lot of people use the site, myself included. You think about most travelers, they have their airfare and lodging usually booked pretty far in advance -- weeks, if not months. But I think a lot of people plan their day-to-day itinerary maybe the day of, maybe the night before. As they go to TripAdvisor, because it has millions upon millions of reviews, over a million different locations and attractions with reviews, as people go to TripAdvisor to look at things to do, the company's in a very great position to not only offer those reviews but then to potentially sell things like tickets toward other experiences on the spot. At a  conference last month, CEO Steve Kaufer, he said he thinks attractions will eventually be a multi-billion-dollar revenue stream for the company, so very important, they're very focused on that.Let's move on now to the other end of the spectrum that I mentioned. Now, we'll talk a little bit about Booking Holdings.Formerly known as Priceline, this is a huge company, over $100 billion in market cap. Even though TripAdvisor is less than a tenth of that size, and it's been dinged for really failing to deliver the growth that investors want for the past several years, Booking Holdings is on an absolute tear, with about 20% growth in the top and bottom lines last quarter.The thing that always shocks me about this company is the breadth of its full portfolio. If you've heard of booking.com or Priceline or KAYAK or rentalcars.com or even OpenTable, guess what? Those are all under the same Booking Holdings umbrella. Really impressive. With that kind of reach and that kind of consistent growth, the stock has been very, very kind to shareholders. The company is quite a favorite here at Fool HQ. What do you think is the secret sauce here, Asit, in terms of the strength of this business? What I love about booking.com is, it has an extremely simple strategy, and that is to take the market by brute force. The company only has a very small portion of the total market share for travel, as big as it is. Among online travel agencies, it's quite huge. But as Vince had mentioned, booking.com has grown by being a serial acquirer. Just to give you a couple of other names besides the ones you called out, I'll list Agoda, OpenTable, I think you said that, and Momondo.com, which I've used before to isolate flights that didn't show up on other engines, which were actually owned by booking.com.This strategy of tacking on is really a brute force mechanism to increase inventory. If you look at some statistics from the very last quarter that's been recorded, booking.com had approximately 1,740,000 properties on its website as of March 31st of 2018. That comprised 415,000 hotels and resorts, and approximately 1,325,000 homes, apartments and, they call them, other unique places to stay. I hope we have time to talk about the alternate lodging market in just a moment here.The company hasn't grown this way through organic growth but having its sales force go out and acquire more and more hotels for its listing on its original site, priceline.com, as you point out, Vince. Using capital from its pretty high margins to keep buying up more what is essentially hotel inventory, is the way that it's grown. It's a different strategy than TripAdvisor, which is smaller, more specialized, relies on content to drive its growth. This is a very easy-to-understand economic engine. And if you doubted that engine several years ago, you would have missed out on a lot of return.It doesn't have quite the allure of a really, really highly technical company. Basically, it functions very similar to the way it did when it first originated. However, that's led to -- let's look at this most recent quarter again -- gross bookings were up 25% to $25 billion. Now, that's not the company's net. The company's net sales out of that were $2.9 billion. But you can imagine what it takes to achieve $25 billion worth of gross bookings. That's a lot of hotel rooms. That's what I love about this stock -- it's really easy to understand how it makes its money, and it's a very consistent earner in that respect. Yeah. I will add that, what you mentioned, in terms of, Booking is the industry gorilla, but at the same time, its slice of the pie is relatively small. The total bookings that I could find for 2017, $80 billion. The total digital travel spending for last year, I think, was nearly $600 billion. So again, a really small piece of that pie and quite a runway for the company going forward.In terms of outlook, I think macro factors are really going to influence this business more so than maybe specific competitors, because as the overall travel industry grows, I think Booking is in a really strong position to continue expanding its share of the pie, even though management has acknowledged, quite a few times now that going forward, the company's growth will decelerate just due to the scale, it being the No. 1 player in this space.I'm curious, Asit -- between Booking Holdings and TripAdvisor, are you sold on one or the other, both companies, on the space in general? What do you think? It's an interesting question. My father, who's an investor, had told me about priceline.com years ago, and he has off-and-on been a shareholder of this company. Unfortunately, as many of us do, he got out on some small dips but has learned to hold this company. So I've watched it over my shoulder, and I'm sort of sold on its growth. I think, outside of 2017, it's had several good years in the market. And these are steady returns of 20%-plus years of stock price appreciation.I do like the macroeconomic factors which favor booking.com. As long as global GDP continues to grow moderately, 3% to 4%, that's a positive environment for this company. I also like the way that it's muscling into the alternative lodging market. It just announced recently that it surpassed Airbnb in terms of private rooms available. At the point it announced it, I think on the most recent conference call, the CEO said they have 5.2 million, versus 4.85 million properties for Airbnb, so it's also expanding into new markets.TripAdvisor, they have a really, really strong asset. Again, if you want to talk about intellectual property with Funko, TripAdvisor's site is its intellectual property. It still has enormous potential itself, but the proof is in the pudding.If you had to choose -- and I think you posed this question to me this way, Vince -- if you had to choose one of these companies and only one to invest it, it would probably be booking.com, although it's a few magnitudes larger than TripAdvisor. What do you think? What is your differentiation between the two? For me, I'm in the same boat as you. The big selling point is, you have the relatively fragmented travel industry overall. I think, in those situations, scale can be a particularly powerful advantage. With, at this point, Booking Holdings generating over $3 billion of free cash flow each year that it can deploy for more acquisitions, adding more brands and platforms to its portfolio, it can invest in new categories, like these unique private listings to compete with the likes of Airbnb, I'm actually really sold after this latest look at the company, and I plan to pick up shares as soon as our trading rules here allow.So between those two, I'm leaning toward Booking, for sure. But overall, this is definitely a space that I have not had exposure to previously in my portfolio, and I'm looking more and more at it every single time we talk about it now and over the past year or so.With that in mind, any final thoughts from you, Asit, before we wrap up? If you buy into booking.com, keep in mind what Vince said. The company has said, eventually, it's going to have a little bit of deceleration. I think they're forecasting booked room nights to grow by about 7% to 11% this next quarter. That's a little bit more moderate of a pace than the past. So you'll have, maybe, some sequential dips here and there in performance, which could be reflected in the stock price. Those could be good entry points, nothing to panic over. Year in, year out, this company has a talent for returning a pretty nice appreciation for its shareholders. Alright! Thank you so much for being here today! Thanks a lot! Appreciate it!

This is going to be a fun show. Why is it going to be a fun show? Two reasons come quickly to mind. The first is, I'm going to be picking five new stocks, five stocks that I like for the next four years going forward. It's always fun to do our five stock samplers, and it's that time of the year. Every ten episodes or so, we have one of our five stock samplers. This is that episode. It's our 15th stock sampler. We've done this 14 times. This continues our series with No. 15, and it's all World Cup-themed. That reason to think this will be fun No. 1.Reason No. 2 is, I'm going to get to look back at one of those five-stock samplers that I picked two years ago this month. That's right, two years ago this month, I picked what I called the Brexit-inspired stock list, five companies that made me think in some way that I related back to Brexit, which had happened just weeks before -- in late spring of 2016, you'll remember. We'll get to see how those five have done. Always fun to see whether we're going to win or lose.As I know many of my regular listeners will know, we've been pretty good with these five-stock samplers. In fact, almost all of them are beating the market as little five-stock portfolios, with the exception of just one that I talked about a few weeks ago on this show, which broke a streak. All other previous stock sampler reviews had been beating the market, except for that one. Let's see how we do with the Brexit-inspired stock list. That's what we have on the agenda this particular week.We're going to be thinking more about the World Cup. Having watched a fair amount of World Cup soccer myself, I'd like to offer an observation or two about the event prior to getting started with our stock review lists. You have to remember that these points come from somebody who does not regularly watch soccer, or football, as it's known worldwide; somebody who tends to just show up every few years, maybe watches the women's or men's World Cup, but not really much soccer beyond the World Cup. I have a thought or two to share.Before I get to that, I'd like to mention that I did give six investing takeaways from the World Cup on this show just a few weeks ago. If you're a World Cup fan and you're new to this podcast, you might enjoy my June 28th, 2018, where we come up with six investing takeaways from the World Cup.Alright, let's call this short list my gripes about the World Cup. Just one or two gripes, specifically coming out of my experience watching Spain play Russia over the weekend. I'm sure some of you saw that game, or at least heard that Russia won. 1-1 was the final score of the regulation game, and then it went to penalty kicks, and Russia hit four in to Spain's three, so Russia advanced.Two quick gripes about the World Cup. It's really more about soccer. I realize that I have a pretty big soccer fan in my producer, Rick Engdahl, who's going to be scrutinizing, I hope, what I'm about to say. Rick, if at any point you feel like I'm being unjust, or if I'm missing something about the sport, I want you to come in and correct me, or speak for the other side, if it needs to be aired out. Just don't blame the ref. Alright, I won't blame the ref. I think what troubles me about the game of soccer is how it's decided by penalty kicks. Now, this is not a new point. I see Rick nodding his head. I think a lot of people have complained about this aspect of soccer. And I think it's worth complaining about. I think there's a better way to settle this game than the artificial mini game of having guys step a few yards away from the goal to get five shots to boot it past the goalie, and whichever country in this case does better, wins. That just isn't very satisfying after watching these epic, two-hour long contests.Two quick thoughts about how to fix what I think is broken about soccer in this case. I don't think either of these are original, so I'm just going to be sharing things you may have already thought before. The first one came to me by my good friend Todd Etter, with whom I've worked many years here at The Motley Fool. I'm sure this idea came to him from somewhere else. He said, what they really should do is, when the game gives out, when time is up, and the score is tied, they should keep playing, but every few minutes, each team loses one guy off the field. So, it starts from 11 on 11, goes down to, let's say, three minutes in, ten on ten. Three minutes later, nine on nine; eight on eight three minutes after that.Eventually, someone's going to score. You've maintained the organic nature of the sport. You're not going to this artificial, random number generator, coin flip way of deciding with penalty kicks. You're able to enjoy the game. And you can imagine those epic endings when it got down to, let's say, three on three, or something as crazy as one on one -- which would never actually happen. But isn't that a more exciting, satisfying way to conclude a game of soccer? At least, I think it is. Rick, I do see you shaking your head. Why do you think that a five on five game, say, is going to be more likely to have a goal than an 11 on 11 game? I think, as you thin it out, the chances of somebody kicking it without going off side and finding a striker that's largely undefended -- my theory is, let's go the other direction -- what if soccer started as 100 on 100? Do you think that there would be any goals at all? Well, the number of players has a lot to do with the size of the field. And when you have these exhausted players down to five on five on that huge field, it's probably not healthy, and I'm not sure it would help. I understand, Rick, except that I have to counter by saying, I think it would be awesome. It would be a great test of endurance. For this reason, I think you would actually have goals that would be scored as the players thin out, because people would start getting exhausted. Could be. [laughs] Now, an alternate way of approaching the same problem. Maybe this one's a little bit more original, because I came up with this one with my kids watching it over the weekend. How about this? Before the game starts, we go through the penalty kicks. Before the game has even started, we go through the exact same exercise. We find out ahead of time that, in this case, Russia has outscored Spain four to three on penalty kicks. Now, let's play a game of football. Over the course of those 90 or 120 minutes, there's going to be a lot more urgency on the part, in this case, of Spain, to get out there and score.I'd like to put that very subversive thought before anybody who loves the game of soccer, because I think it would add or urgency, and it would take away, again, some of the coin-flippy nature that it feels like the game suffers from, especially when you get to these knockout games, where everything counts and it comes down to the 71.5% chance -- which is, by the way, the chance of somebody scoring a penalty kick. Historically, in World Cup games, 71.5% of the time, you kick it in. It's just really very close to coin flips when you think about how important these games are. One thing about that is that it would inspire the team that wins the penalty kicks at the beginning -- Russia, in your example -- to just park the bus and play for the draw, which is not a very exciting game. It really could. For this reason, that one might not work as well. I think I probably still prefer the first. Although, Rick, I think you didn't like either of these. I like the effort, and I think maybe we should send it out to listeners. Let's get out on  figure out how we should end the World Cup draws. I love it. @RBIPodcast is, of course, this podcast's address on Twitter. If you have a way to solve how to end a soccer game in a more satisfying manner, go crazy. Let us know. Maybe at the end of this month, mailbag, we'll feature a few of our best ideas. I know that our listenership, replete as it is with so many Rule Breaking thinkers, can come up with a better way to do it.If you think about it, the penalty kicks are truly just a mini game. It's an artificial mini game staged outside of the game itself. I bet there are some other good mini games. How about just a three on three with a much shorter field? Let's just settle it that way. That would be more fun. Unlimited goals could be scored over a ten-minute period. I'd love to watch that. As long as we're going to have artificial mini games decide things, let's make them actually strategic and interesting.And then, my one other gripe -- and then, darn it, let's get to the show -- is just that Spain-Russia game. I watched it for two hours. How many shots on goal did Russia have over those two hours? The answer is, Russia had one shot on goal for the entire game. Now, I love soccer. I love what soccer can be. I don't have a specific fix for that other than to say, it's kind of funny to think, how many people felt how deeply meaningful that win was for the entire nation of Russia? They had one shot on goal over two hours, and their actual goal was scored on a penalty kick.Alright, let's go over our stocks picked two years ago first. We're going to start with our Brexit-inspired stock list, and close out this episode with five new stocks inspired by the World Cup.I went back and listened to my episode. It was July 13th, 2016. Went back and listened to what I was saying at the time. I had just tweeted out, in response to Brexit, this line. \"We make fearful the things we don't understand.\" That's something that I just believe is true of human nature. Medieval map makers -- as I've had wont to say on this podcast in years past -- when they got to a place that they actually hadn't visited in the world, they would write, what? Up in the corner, usually, they'd write, \"There be dragons.\" They wouldn't write, \"We've never actually been to Ultima Thule, or to this place up here that no one has actually been to.\" Instead of writing, \"We don't know,\" they wrote, \"There be dragons.\"We make fearful the things we don't understand. That's so true in the money world. How many people are afraid of the stock market? They don't really know it, they haven't been taught it, they don't understand that it's risen on average 10% a year for decades. They hear about the bad news when the market drops, they worry about a crash. The short-term media has them fixated on day-to-day movements. As a consequence, they've made fearful something they don't understand, and they don't get started investing, sometimes for their whole lives. Or, they never invest in stocks, or they think it would be crazy to invest directly in individual stocks.I understand why it wouldn't be a good idea if you don't understand it, if you're not interested in it, if you're not following it -- you're probably not listening to this podcast in the first place. But, for the rest of us, I think we can recognize the great beauty of the stock market, and the great fortunes that we can make in buying the best companies of our time -- that's right, buying directly individual stocks. In a world where mutual funds, let's say index funds or sector funds, have to buy all of a sector, or all of the S&P 500, you and I can just buy the best companies in a sector, or the best companies among the S&P 500, hold them for five or ten years, or five or ten decades, and make out like bandits, I think, if we're doing it Foolishly, if we're doing it the way we've always talked about in our 25 years at The Motley Fool.People make fearful the things they don't understand. Two years ago, the idea that Great Britain would leave the European Union was a fearful thing. It's something that really hadn't happened before since the E.U. was formed, that that significant a country, that major a player, would opt out.While I'm politically neutral, I don't have strong feelings either way on this, it was treated so negatively, and typically continues to be treated so negatively, that as I was saying two years ago on this podcast, The Fool in me who wants to always challenge the conventional wisdom, maybe will take devil's advocate on any argument if one side isn't represented -- The Fool in me thought, \"Hey, maybe things are better than we all expect. Maybe things will work out better.\" And certainly, the FTSE -- which is basically the Dow Jones equivalent for the London Stock Exchange in the U.K. markets -- did quite well, after people thought that it wouldn't do well at all post-Brexit. In general, that economy has held up pretty well.That's about all I want to say about Brexit, because I don't have a lot to say about Brexit, per se. I'm talking about these stocks that I picked two years ago this week, these five companies.One thing I love about these samplers is that we're actually picking them and we're holding ourselves accountable. I'm going to be scoring these for you very shortly. That's in a world where very few people put skin in the game. They have a lot of opinions -- we all think Brexit is good or Brexit is bad, or this or that company is good or bad, but how often in your experience or my experience do we see people actually scoring and giving real statistics about who's right and who's wrong? At least, with these stock samplers, I hope I'm modeling for you what I believe you should be doing with your own investing, your own portfolio, which scoring if you're beating the market. You should also be asking the same of your financial advisors, or any source of financial advice -- be it Barron's or something on CNBC.I really want everybody to be holding themselves accountable. When you don't have skin in the game, you just opine, you talk off the top of your head about what you think's going to happen, and you never revisit that. I don't think that's really a service to your listening public, whoever you are, and it's ultimately not a service to you, because it's only through scoring that we can figure out whether we're doing well or not and how to improve.One other thing I'll mention before going over these five stocks, the market was at all-time highs two years ago. A lot of people were probably thinking, \"I don't want to buy a stock because it's at all-time highs.\" That's the opposite of how we think here on the  podcast, where I'm constantly talking about how good companies and good markets, over the course of time, will inevitably constantly make new highs. You shouldn't be afraid of investing at all-time highs. Since the stock market is up 26% -- yup, that's the bogie we'll be competing with this Brexit-inspired stock list -- over the last two years, it turns out it was a good move to be buying two years ago when the market was at all-time highs.Each of these five stocks was picked for three years. That's the way I set up the game two years ago on this podcast. We'll revisit it today, and then we'll conclude with a look one year from now at these five stocks. Without further ado, here they come, in alphabetical order by company name.Therefore, the first one is and was Alphabet. The ticker symbol is GOOG, because, for whatever reason, Alphabet a few years later has not changed its ticker symbol. It loves that GOOG ticker symbol, I guess. They certainly could have changed their ticker symbol, but they haven't, so the ticker symbol for Alphabet is GOOG. Alphabet's stock two years ago was at $717 when I picked it on the show. Today, it is at $1,110. This is up 55%. Spoiler alert of these five: this is the best performer, up 55% over these last couple of years.Looking back now, how valuable has YouTube become? These days,  puts a value on YouTube at about $160 billion, which is pretty remarkable when you consider that when Google bought out YouTube for $1.65 billion in the year 2006 -- from $1.65 billion to $160 billion looks like a 100-bagger for the Google management team at the time. What an outstanding call it's been, and how valuable is YouTube, not just today but really for the rest of our lifetimes? That's an incredible platform, and it helps to explain Google's outstanding gains. A lot else happening, certainly, at Alphabet over these last couple of years, but I just wanted to highlight that.Why did this stock show up on the Brexit-inspired stock list? Well, I was talking about how Britain has made the decision for the U.K. to be independent and autonomous. Google itself and Alphabet is probably the most autonomous and independent company that I can think of worldwide. It has so many different businesses that it's playing in. A lot of them are independent of each other, and it is a remarkable entity unto itself. So, I was wishing Britain good luck with being independent, saying, \"Maybe you could be a little bit more like Alphabet.\"With that stock up 55%, the market up 26%, that's a plus 29% in the win column for this five-stock sampler list.Stock No. 2 is Euronet Worldwide. The ticker symbol is EEFT. This is, as I was saying two years ago, kind of the  for Europe. This is a company that does a lot of e-payments, a lot of digital payments. Focused mostly in Europe, hence the name Euronet Worldwide. Yet, it also owns a lot of ATMs. Even though that may sound like an older business, because this company is expanding pretty mightily through India, where things are lower-tech in a lot of places throughout that country, a network of ATMs in India is a valuable commodity.Euronet Worldwide two years ago was at $72 a share. Today, it tips the scales at $84 per share. That's up 17%. Good news, the stock is up, but bad news, the stock is losing to the market by 9%.Well, why did this stock appear on the Brexit-inspired stock list? Well, for Euronet Worldwide, I was reminding anybody in the European Union who felt bereft that the U.K. had opted to leave that Europe remains such a substantial and important block. Yes, you've potentially lost one of your star players -- sticking with soccer, out on the field, you've lost one of your start players -- but you still have a really good team.I like, I was saying at the time, the so-called PayPal for Europe, and I think that you should too. Let's hope that this stock has a better year over the next year so that I can put this one in the win column when we close out a year from now. But, for now, Euronet Worldwide is a minus 9%. If you combine that with Alphabet, plus 29%, minus 9%, that equals plus 20% as we move in our game to stock No. 3.Stock No. 3 is Hain Celestial. The ticker symbol is HAIN. When I picked it two years ago, I was talking about the Celestial part of Hain Celestial. Hain Celestial is an organic food company. It has a lot of brands. It's rolled up part of its industry, organic food, over the course of time, buying well-known brands that are then seen in places like Whole Foods and lots of grocery markets, not just here in the U.S. but other places, too. Europeans care about the food they eat, I was saying at the time, and that's why I wanted to put Hain Celestial on the stock list. The Celestial part ties into the Celestial Seasonings brand, which a lot of us know as a well-known tea brand. Since the Brits love their tea, I was throwing Hain Celestial onto the Brexit-inspired stock list.Bad move, Dave. Really bad move. This stock two years ago was at $51.50. Today, it's just over $29 a share, $29.37 as I do this podcast. That's a drop of 43% for Hain Celestial. Motley Fool Stock Advisor members will know that Hain Celestial, we decided recently to part ways with it. It's no longer even in the Supernova universe or on my active recommendation list. Not a big fan of the CEO. The company, over the six years we held it in Stock Advisor, was up 23%, but the market was up 130%.At one time, Hain Celestial had been a three-bagger for us. But as the world got crowded with more and more organic food brands and more and more places to buy organic food, Hain Celestial found itself with a lot more competition, and I don't think had the visionary leadership to bring it through into the future as a big-time winner.So, unfortunately, Hain Celestial has been a dog, a really big dog, for the Brexit-inspired stock list. That's right, it was down 43% with the market up 26%. That's a minus 69% in the loss column. That puts us at minus 49% with two stocks left.Stock No. 4 -- again, these are all alphabetical by company name -- is Priceline. This one reminds us of how the world changes, because the company Priceline is no longer known by that name. In just the succeeding two years -- really, in just the last several months here in 2018 -- Priceline renamed itself to Booking Holdings, ticker symbol BKNG. Priceline at the time when I picked it two years ago was at $1,339 -- that's right, $1,339 per share, for one share. Today, I'm happy to say it's up to $2,046. The stock is up 53%. Playing along with our game here, 53% minus 26% gives us a plus 27%. That means we're now minus 22% as we go to our final company.But before we get there, I just want to remind you why I included this stock on the Brexit-inspired stock list two years ago. There was a lot of pessimism around travel through Europe. The idea of firming borders was, it's a less fun world, people won't travel as much. And yep, in just a couple of days, Priceline's stock lost 15% reacting to Brexit. The stock had been battered up a little bit. I like the company a lot. It's one of my personal biggest holdings. It's been a big-time winner for Motley Fool Stock Advisor. That's why I included it on this list a couple of years ago. I'm really happy to see that it's up more than 50% since.In fact, this is a company that bought booking.com in 2005. Booking.com was the biggest player in Europe at the time. Back in 2004, when I first picked Priceline, Priceline was mainly an American brand. It was doing what we know today, with the hotels and booking flights and travel, mainly for America. In 2005, it bought booking.com. These days, it's known as Booking Holdings, showing the centerpiece that Booking represents for this company. It also has Agoda, which is the Asian version of Booking or Priceline. It owns the world at this point.It's a beautiful company. It has top and bottom line growth in double digits, even at the size and scale it's achieved today. So, yes, I continue to like this company a lot. I'm really happy to see it was on this list, bringing us within 22 points of publishing a win.That takes us, finally, to stock No. 5. Stock No. 5 was Tesla, ticker symbol TSLA. The stock was at $223 a share at the end of trading July 13th, 2016. Now, somewhere midday Monday July 2nd as I tape this, it's up to $331.That's a gain of 48%. Minus 26%. If you've done the math with me -- I realize it's not that easy to listen to math in audio form -- we were minus 22% going into this stock, and we just published a plus 22% on Tesla, which brings us to a grand total of zero points for this stock list!Amazing that the math would work out that way. We've only ever lost once. We've won every other time until this one, where we've technically tied, leaving things in the balance. You might wonder, is Brexit even a good idea? Is it right there in the middle with this group of stocks? Is it clear whether it will win or lose? We'll have to watch the drama going forward.Why did I pick Tesla two years ago? I was thinking about that word autonomous. Again, Britain choosing autonomy for its future, more autonomy. I was thinking about autonomous cars and how big Tesla was at the time.Autonomous cars, as it turns out, are going to come online slower than a lot of people were probably thinking in 2016, me included. Having now a Tesla myself with some autonomous features, I'm reminded every day of just how many more gains truly need to be made before this kind of technology will really be ready for primetime. I realize, every car company and his little sister is out there, pretty much, trying to figure out how to make things autonomous. It's working in some contexts worldwide. I'm a big fan of it. I just think it's going to take a little longer than we were thinking in 2016. Fortunately, Tesla has still done really well, up 48% from two years ago.Alright! There you have it, my review of our five-stock sampler from two years ago, where we published a zero! We're right in the middle!Now, I will say, if you actually calculate the gain of the S&P 500 from then until now, it was 25.5%. I rounded it to 26% and compared each of these five stocks to a 26%. But, if you're looking for a victory here, or a little bit of a silver lining, technically, we are ahead by a couple of percentage points if you don't round things. But I did round up for the market. I always try to help the market out. It was at 25.5%, so I made it 26%, and that's the results that we've enjoyed. Take it to PKs. [laughs] You know, we don't have PKs on this podcast because I'm not a big fan of them, but I understand that there may be no better way. Let's put it this way -- if, a year from now, these five stocks are dead on zero, and we need to close out the three-year game, because that's what this one was playing, maybe we'll go to PKs.Alright. That was then, and this is now. It's time to look forward at five stocks that I favor over the next, we're going to make it -- sure, why not -- four years. The World Cup for men comes around every four years. Four years from now, the game that we'll play with these five stocks will end right in the middle of the new World Cup. That's fun, that'll be fun to keep track of. These five companies are all companies that, in my mind, have something to do with either the FIFA World Cup or global investing. We're thinking globally as we go through these five companies. But, before I get to that list ...Alright, let's get to it! We're going to call this list five stocks celebrating the 2018 World Cup. Each of these I'm suggesting for the next four years, I'm picking each of these stocks individually -- I hope -- and certainly the group together, as market-beaters. We're going to try to outpace the S&P 500, as we do in all things here at The Motley Fool, or at least with my approach through  and  . This is our 15th stock sampler. And, yes, the market is still at or near all-time highs, just like it was in 2016. It'll be interesting to see how these four years ago, especially for these five stocks.Stock No. 1. This is one I've already talked about on this podcast. It has a different name than two years ago. It's Booking Holdings. The ticker symbol is BKNG. How could I not pick one of my personal biggest holdings, a company I deeply admire, that's such a dominant worldwide player, and that's still enjoying such significant growth?Some of that growth might be coming in ways that you or I might not expect. For example, have you ever heard of Airbnb? I bet you have. I have, too. A lot of people think that Airbnb might make life tough on hotels in particular -- hotels, motels, etc. Why pay  or  when arguably, you could pay less and stay in sometimes nicer accommodations by using something like Airbnb? Sounds like a threat, doesn't it, to Priceline/Booking/Agoda?Here's some good news. As of -- well, I'm looking at last summer's numbers, anyways. I'm assuming these haven't changed dramatically. Airbnb had about four million unique properties that were listed there that you could stay in, that you could rent. Booking, with the same business model, had five million places that you could stay that were not hotels or motels. Like Airbnb, Booking is doing the same kind of a business. It's playing in that sharing economy. What might look like a threat to some on Wall Street as they look at Booking Holdings, maybe they need to make sure they've done their homework and recognize that that same model's going to work really well for this company, too.BKNG, again, the ticker symbol. It's been an 85-bagger for Stock Advisor members who listened to me when I first picked it in 2004. But even more fun, I think -- even though it hasn't been quite as rewarding -- was when, in 2010, I decided to rerecommend Priceline at the time for Stock Advisor members. A lot of people were saying, \"It's already up eight times! From 2004 to 2010, it's gone up eight times! Why would you recommend we buy this stock today?\"The reason this is fun is because, as of this year now, it is up 949% from that rerecommendation. Over 900% is a ten-bagger. Doing the math -- always reminding people of this, by the way -- a 100% gain is a two-bagger. A 900% gain is a ten-bagger. That rerecommendation is up itself ten times in value, proving that when you find a great horse, stick with it. Keep the bets in place. Maybe add some more purse over the course of time, because these great companies can win the triple crown sometimes on their own track by themselves. Booking Holdings is a good example of that, BKNG, stock No. 1.Alright. Again, proceeding alphabetically, stock No. 2 is  . The ticker symbol is DASTY. I attempted just a slight French lilt, with the accent grave over one of those Es in the second name. That's my high school schoolboy French talking. The one that I didn't continue, the one that, sadly, I kind of lost. I can still pronounce French pretty well, I just can't speak it back and forth very well at all.Dassault Syst\u00e8mes has been an outstanding performer since first picked in September of 2009. It's up 429% for Stock Advisor members. The market over that time is up 206%, so it's a couple of hundred percentage points ahead of the market. It's a five-bagger. It's a $36 billion company today, but a lot of people haven't heard of it.Some people in America might especially ask, \"Is France really a capitalist nation?\" There's a lot of socialism, or has been, in France. Although, under Macron, it looks like more and more capitalism might be in the offing. If so, I think that's a great antidote to beleaguered Europe. A stronger, more capitalist France sounds really good to me. If so, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes would be a great example of that.This is a company that was operating in CAD/CAM software back in the day. When you were designing things using software, whether you were an architectural designer, or you were designing packaging for a new children's toy, you could use CAD/CAM software to design it right there on the computer and show people, prototypically, what it would look like. Well, that's still a big business today for Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. But as the world has moved more and more toward 3D graphics, or think about virtual reality, think about all of those assets and prototypes that are being developed purely digitally, you're seeing the beauty of being a leader in that space, which is certainly what Dassault Syst\u00e8mes is. Again, the ticker symbol is DASTY.As the world goes more and more 3D -- in fact, their website is 3ds.com, you can check it out -- as the world goes toward virtual and augmented reality, you're going to see a lot more use of this company's product. Already, though, very substantial worldwide leader.And, great to include France here. As I do this taping, France is still alive in the World Cup, so I have France on my mind. I'm certainly cheering them on. I'd like to see them do pretty well. I'm not sure, at the end of the day, I think I'd pick England to win it all if I had to pick a team right now. But I'm certainly cheering France on. Good luck, France. But, even more, good luck Dassault Syst\u00e8mes.Stock No. 3. This is not a stock tied to a specific country. I do have couple of others coming on this list. Nope, this one is the No. 1 maker of the biggest FIFA World Cup video game in the world, and that would, of course, be  (NASDAQ: EA) . Today, with its ticker symbol, EA, it totes a $44 billion market cap and is one of the worldwide leaders in interactive entertainment. In fact, the FIFA World Cup 2018 game that many are enjoying -- maybe you have it on your PlayStation or Xbox these days -- that is in its 25th installment.Certainly, a big part of EA's success over a few decades now has been these sports games, like Madden football or FIFA World Cup. They just keep coming out with a new edition each year that fans willingly pay up for -- most years, anyway, as long as it gets decent enough reviews, as long as the company has put some effort into improving the game from one year to the next. I can't say that Electronic Arts has distinguished itself every year in that regard, but more often than not, it has, which is why it has a very substantial sports business.Of course, EA has wide-ranging assets and properties across all genres of interactive entertainment, not just sports. But, because this is our five stocks celebrating the World Cup list, I had to think about including Electronic Arts, one of my favorite companies.This is, if you're a Motley Fool  member, a starter stock. Hint hint, if you're not a Motley Fool  member -- we think you should join  , just go to  or  and take a 30-day free trial to join us at  . You'll see what our starter stocks are. That's a shorter list of stocks that we think anybody who's just starting investing, these are good picks for them. Why? Because usually, these are companies with larger sizes, more substantial resources, they're safer companies, and most of these companies, you would recognize their names. They're recognizable names in businesses in which they reside. They're often the leader within their category.Certainly, Electronic Arts is one such example, and darn it, I wish I'd picked this stock on my Brexit-inspired stock list two years in place of Hain Celestial! I did actually pick this stock for  in June of 2016. It's up 89% since then, with the market up 36%, marked directly against the market. This would have been a big-time winner.That's why I'm putting it on my list for the next four years. A company like this, I see thriving and continuing to grow, again, for at least the next decade plus out, unless the world changes in some way I can't really see. Interactive entertainment, big brands, these are really vital businesses, and Electronic Arts is a great example. That's stock No. 3.We're coming down the home stretch. Here comes stock No. 4, the company  (NASDAQ: MELI) . The ticker symbol is MELI. Again, a slight effort at trying to pronounce the name as a native speaker of Spanish might. This is a company that's a $13 billion company. It's one I've mentioned a number of times on this podcast. I'm sure, in some of our five-stock samplers, I've included it. I'm not looking at the full list right now. It's one of my favorite go-to companies.Here's a few things about MercadoLibre. First of all, I'd like to point out that a number of Latin American countries are still in the World Cup. MercadoLibre operates in all of them. That's one of the things I love about the World Cup, actually. Latin America doesn't often make the leadership category when you look at a lot of other, especially athletic, things worldwide. You don't see a lot of dominance in the Winter Olympics or the Summer Olympics from this block, although it's well ahead of the Middle East in terms of its gold medals, no doubt. But, think about soccer and how many tremendous teams come out of Latin America. So, I had to think about including this company on my five-stock sampler.Two more quick things I want to say about MercadoLibre. First of all, it has for me what I consider to be a shockingly low, and therefore very promising, risk rating. One of the things we do at The Motley Fool and in  and  , my services, is we put a number estimating the risk we think you take on when you buy a stock. We make that number somewhere between 0 to 25 -- the higher the number, the higher the risk of the stock. Our highest-risk stock that I think I've ever recommended off that 0-25-point scale is a 17 or 18. Very infrequently do I take that much risk. In general, we like to take, if possible, as little risk as we can and get the best returns we can imagine.This is a tremendous multi-bagger for us off of a risk rating of five. That means, the way we define risk, that your chances of actually losing money if you hold this over a long period of time are very, very low. That's how we estimate risk.When I talk about our risk ratings, longtime listeners will remember, I've done a whole series on risk ratings. It's something that I care and think a lot about. It's something we invented at Motley Fool  . I love these risk ratings, so I really wanted to double underline that -- a risk rating of just five for Mercado Libre. Really surprisingly safe investment for what might sound like a risky e-commerce player in a sometimes-volatile area of the world. But no, this is a grounded company with a $13 billion market cap.In fact, since Uruguay is still in the World Cup, I decided I'd just visit the Mercado Libre Uruguay site. Sure enough, right on the front page, they're advertising a soccer ball. They're advertising Father's Day 40% off prices. Father's Day, as it turns out, in Uruguay, is the 15th of July. It's maybe a universally celebrated day worldwide, but at least in the country of Uruguay -- side note, a little bit of trivia for you coming out of your  podcast experience -- this year, it's the 15th of July in Uruguay. And yep, they're advertising soccer balls for Dad. Play soccer with Dad for Father's Day.Have I saved the best for last? Well, these are all alphabetical, so we go down from M and we hit the letter Y. This is a really interesting company. It might be the best performer for last. We'll see. If it is, it'll be a lot better than its recent performance, which hasn't been great.The company is  (NASDAQ: YNDX) , ticker symbol YNDX. How could I not think to include this longer-time  ? I first picked it in 2012, so it's almost six years old in the  service. It's up 54% over that time, the market up 114%, so Yandex is down 60% to the market.But if you know search engines, and you think about companies like Google, and you think, who's the Google of Russia? What's the No. 1 most-used search engine among Russian speakers, in that area of the world? And the answer is Yandex, a company founded in 1997 by Arkady Volozh, who today is still the CEO and founder of this company. He is a billionaire, but he's not one of those Russian billionaires who's just sitting on a whole heap of oil and milking it or striking questionable deals with the Russian government. Some of those oligarchs, there are a lot of questions about where that money's come from asked worldwide in a more transparent world these days. No, Volozh has done it through inventing the Google of Russia.This is a company I have great hope for. It has been, as I mentioned, a significant underperformer over its first six years. But as I watch Russia, through penalty kicks, advance into the next round of the tournament, being held in Russia, it makes me happy for the nation. I think the better it performs, the more it comes online and connects with the rest of the world. I have great hopes for Russia, and not just for their soccer team or their national pride, but very specifically for the capitalism.When I look at Yandex, I see a company that is the No. 1 search engine, but it's also doing a lot of other interesting things that you might do the same if you were Arkady Volozh looking at other competitors worldwide. \"Who else is leading in search engines in other places? Let's start to mimic them,\" I think Volozh has been thinking, because in 2017, Yandex began to introduce its intelligent personal assistant, which is Alice.Then, a few months later, it's time to buy Foodfox, a food delivery service. Or, how about this year, when it combined with Uber to merge their businesses in Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, and Georgia, but most prominently there in Russia, so that Uber and Yandex are now together operating Uber Russia, another pretty good business model? Yandex owns the majority of that stake, and Uber owns a minority of that stake.If you're seeing what Volozh is doing here, what Yandex is doing, they're getting into a lot of horizontal businesses using the optionality that you get if you're the leader in search for an important territory in the world. So, let's see how Yandex does over the next four years.OK, those were our five stocks. Just recounting them alphabetically to close: Booking Holdings, BKNG; Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, DASTY; Electronic Arts, EA; Mercado Libre, MELI; and finally, Yandex, YNDX. Good luck, five stocks celebrating the 2018 World Cup. We'll check in with you each year going forward.Alright. This podcast was taped one day early because Rick and I, presumably, when you hear this, are off celebrating Independence Day here in the United States of America. Happy Independence Day to all my fellow Americans. I hope you've had a wonderful week. In my case, a portion of it will be spent at a North Carolina beach, so I'm not really sure what we'll do it next week. I'll just be getting back from the beach.I know one thing: we'll be aiming to educate, to amuse, and to enrich, which is what the  podcast -- and indeed, The Motley Fool now, celebrating its 26th year of doing business -- are all about, to educate, to amuse, and to enrich. In the meantime, I will simply say, thanks for listening and Fool on!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["inally, The Motley Fool is old enough to rent a car. Good thing we already have the Foolmobile.It didn't even make a splash! Image source: The Motley Fool.Well, maybe  is a better term. Anyway.All jokes aside, the last 25 years have been an incredible journey for millions of Fools -- our three co-founders -- Tom Gardner, David Gardner, and Erik Rydholm, Fool staff, members,  , and readers. As we've worked with Tom and David over the past 25(!) years, we've shared in the ups and downs -- joy, laughter, Foolishness, camaraderie, and bright memories made all the brighter by many failures and hard times.We've all learned a lot together over the years. And so we decided to take some time to reflect on the biggest lessons we've internalized over the last quarter-century together.Here, in no particular order, are 25 lessons to carry into your investing life, your professional life, and even your personal life.One of the most empowering things a newly hired employee can hear is: \"We trust you.\" Fools are trusted to make big business decisions, because we believe we've done a good job of hiring smart, talented, decent people who will do their best to find the right answer. That's also why The Motley Fool embraces flexible schedules and unregulated vacation time.For Tom and David, that started early. \"From the beginning, it was easiest for us to do that with our new hires, because we didn't have ads to run in newspapers to get strangers,\" says David. \"So we hired people we knew.\"As The Motley Fool grew over time, that underlying culture of trust expanded with it.Disruptive companies usually look like underdogs at the outset. They're taking on entrenched interests with far more resources. Consider  versus traditional bookstores (and, ultimately, most of retail) in the '90s and early 2000s.But disruptors have a critical advantage over the incumbents in their space: vision. Past business success -- and the resulting belief that the status quo will persist -- often hobbles market leaders, and they fail to appreciate just how much things can change. Wall Street has been underestimating disruptors for far longer than we've been around. One of the biggest advantages an individual investor can have over Wall Street is the ability to see that change before entrenched interests can. Use it.Yesterday's disruptors become today's industry leaders. Amazon has become a classic Rule Maker in e-commerce: Dozens of other companies are trying to follow a similar playbook and carve out their own digital niche.Yet Amazon remains the undeniable market leader. Tom recently noted that \"I've gotten to the point where any problem I'm trying to solve in my life, I just type it into Amazon.\" 100 million satisfied Prime members agree.Yet Amazon has stayed hungry, rapidly expanding across all kinds of other businesses, from Web services to video streaming to same-day product delivery. There's plenty more to like about the business, even today.One of the key secrets to investing well is  -- just holding on to great businesses for a long time. Tom is fond of telling people, \"Whatever your holding period, double that, and you'll be a better investor.\"To stretch the Amazon example  , it's up over over 400 times since its first recommendation in September 1997. Had we recommended Fools sell it sometime in the past, they likely would have made impressive money -- 10 times their original investment, or 50 times, or even 100 times. Yet holding through to today has generated awe-inspiring returns.Take the long view. It's worth it.The idea is simple: If someone has an idea that you don't think is the right way to solve a problem, then figure out a better solution. It's a more collaborative way to achieve shared goals: add innovation instead of merely shooting down someone else's idea. We think it's the right way to run teams, and it's a phrase commonly heard at TMF headquarters.It has real impact in investing, too. When Tom invests in a company, \"I need to see a demonstration that they have a larger market opportunity\" beyond what they're currently doing today. They have to be in a position essentially to top themselves.Like several of these concepts, '\"top it\" has its roots in Tom and David's childhood and has been in their lexicon \"since long before we started the Fool.\"Tom and David near the beginning. Image source: The Motley Fool.Different life experiences, personalities, and viewpoints help us become better investors, businesspeople, citizens, and humans. Make sure you regularly hear other views, because it ensures that you're investing humbly, and that you make fewer mistakes.Motley matters in your investing too -- not only in terms of diversifying across sectors, but also in how organizations run themselves. Tom believes \"that the culture of an organization is becoming more and more important as we become more connected as a species around the world.\" Tom also notes that \"The bottom 50 public companies on Glassdoor, rated by employees, significantly underperform the market.\"We try to apply this  as well. As David recently put it, \"Any employee who comes to The Motley Fool is bringing to our stained-glass window their own unique piece of glass. It's their own shape, their own hue, and it's additive. That's what I love about Motley.\"Relatedly...If you've built a business full of diverse viewpoints, then conflict is inevitable. Too many people (and businesses) avoid tough conversations. Research shows that every missed \"  \" costs a business $1,500 and eight hours of employee productivity.Image source: The Motley Fool.It's a nice factoid, and we're glad to have it as an additional argument in favor of wading into tough conversations and getting to the right answer (which may not always be the consensus answer). But really, it's just about treating people the way we all want to be treated. Everyone should know where everyone stands and why.And of course, that's because we believe everyone should...Treat others as you'd like to be treated.We all crave trust. We all crave community. We all need kindness and grace every now and then. Part of running a purpose-driven business is treating all of your stakeholders as equal partners -- or, put differently, as  like to be treated in their shoes. Every new Fool who joins our ranks takes a class specifically on this critical aspect of Foolish culture, because it's something we want to implement every day, in every interaction our business has with the broader world.As David puts it, \"Time is our dearest commodity.\" Because you have a limited amount of it, make sure you're spending it on the activities and relationships that matter most to you.Your time is limited, but you can increase it by embracing a healthier lifestyle. The data  that a sedentary lifestyle (too much sitting, not enough exercise) has major negative effects on your physical health, reducing the length of your life.The Motley Fool has an  , spearheaded by Sam Whiteside, that's designed to help Fools improve their physical health (free healthy food, meal planning, fitness classes, and an office gym) and mental health (reimbursement for meditation and mindfulness apps, free access to a digital support program for people coping with anxiety or depression, and more). If you're an employer, consider the message you're sending your employees if you put resources into helping them live healthier, happier, and, ultimately, longer lives.Most new investors (we're excluding traders from that definition) focus far too much on either metrics or the story that a company's management is telling -- and neglect the other. As David puts it: \"Knowing either the metrics or the story is helpful; knowing and understanding both leads to even better outcomes...You want to be a numbers guy and a words guy.\"Image source: The Motley Fool.Getting caught up in the numbers might mean you miss the forest for the trees; focusing on the story to the exclusion of all numbers could leave you without any tangible way to back up your thesis. has beaten the market by more than three times as of this writing (with a track record now in its 17 th year and counting) by recommending businesses that have incredible growth ramps ahead of them. Those stocks are usually \"expensive,\" according to the financial media, and rarely on sale.So consider buying the stock that recently doubled -- like Amazon shortly after its IPO (seriously, did you really think we were going to stop with the Amazon examples?) -- and that you think still has tons of room to run. And if it doubles again, that might be a great time to buy more.Psychologically speaking, we feel the pain of losses far more strongly than we feel the joy of wins -- yet investing requires you to accept losses.Tom and David are great stock-pickers -- yet under half of their picks have beaten the S&P 500 over a five-year holding period.Expect failures. Acknowledge them. But most importantly, don't overindex to them. As David has said: \"The worst you can ever lose [in investing] is one times your value, but your best stock pick could grow to five hundred times initial value. Joy of gain should infinitely exceed the pain of loss.\" One or two good stock picks can make all the difference in the world.OK, so we're not saying you should  sell, but Tom's first rule of selling is \"Don't sell.\" Because the chances are good that, if you're selling a stock that has run up a bunch, you're selling too early and missing out on even more incredible gains. (See:  .  .  .  . And so many more.)There are all kinds of ways to learn more about the world. Each provides a unique perspective.But investing (hopefully)  you while you're learning. As David is fond of saying, \"The act of investing, by actually putting your money on the line, will cause you to care and pay attention.\"And there are some knock-on benefits, too. As he continues:\"When you buy that awesome company and it does well, you'll start saving more so you can have more invested and make more money. Investing makes people smarter and act better.\"Here at The Motley Fool, we encourage people to double down on what they're good at instead of focusing on mitigating their weaknesses -- because we believe that diverse teams can effectively balance each other's strengths to create a better whole.That's also something every entrepreneur should do when first starting a business: Focus on their niche, the thing they do best, rather than trying to do everything. Payment processors and software providers are specifically trying to solve the problems that keep entrepreneurs from focusing on whatever business they're trying to build.But there's one place where the \"focus on your strengths\" lesson really breaks down: matters of character.If you've ever seen  , chances are good you've heard an engineer or three talk about the USS  's structural integrity being in danger of collapse. (Spoiler alert: Somehow, the ship always holds together. Except for that one time in  . But we digress.)In matters of character, we have to sweat the small stuff -- because any weaknesses in character will threaten the structural integrity of the whole enterprise (pun intended). That's true whether the enterprise is your personal life, a department you lead, or the business you run.Honesty is a core value at The Motley Fool, but at the center of our entire philosophy is  -- doing the right thing whether or not someone is watching, simply because you know it to be right.If there's a flaw in \"cigar butt\"-style value investing (which is the idea that you buy a company at a discount to its liquidation value in the belief that you'll get at least liquidation value), it's that it often undervalues just how much shareholder wealth can be generated by a superbly run business. Here's what value investor Warren Buffett had to say on the topic in his  :\"I could give you other personal examples of 'bargain-purchase' folly, but I'm sure you get the picture: It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\"Instead of trying to find OK companies selling at a discount, focus on fantastic companies that look set to dominate the competition. Those are the companies that can compound wealth at an incredible rate.And as David notes, \"As you get used to finding excellence, you're going to get better and better about finding it.\"John Milton coined the phrase \"Luck is the residue of design.\" We Fools believe you can set yourself up to be lucky by actively seeking opportunities -- and, when they present themselves, acting decisively.Think about luck as \"being in the right place at the right time.\" David recently shared a story about one of The Fool's early lucky breaks:Hey! It was the 90s...Image source: The Motley Fool.Hey! It was the 90s...\"We were on AOL ahead of the rest of the world, and we got the attention of AOL when we, as paying customers, had a few articles written about us in newspapers and [  ]. We were at the dawn of this new medium, and we were at the right time. We couldn't control the right time, but we were at the right place-DC.\"Back when Tom and David hosted a weekly NPR radio show, they usually opened the program with a quote from  : \"Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun. It shines everywhere.\"We've decided not to take ourselves too seriously since The Motley Fool's inception. (As if the name weren't already a pretty good indicator of how we feel about the topic.)That's why new Fools get jester hats with their employee packet. It's also why we do things like:The office circa early 2000s. Now we have VR headsets. Running a successful business takes mental flexibility and a readiness to laugh at yourself. It encourages others to do it, too, which builds a sense of safety in groups.Visionary leaders win when they see a future very different from our present. It is almost inevitable that such a vision seems zany in the present.\"But people  browsing through Blockbuster.\"\"Tesla can't possibly remake the auto supply chain. That's just the way it is.\"\"The internet will never replace TV.\"\"People will  pay up for organic. Whole Foods is [avocado] toast.\"...and on and on.Yet here we are, in a society that doubters could not have imagined just a few years ago.We care a lot about culture at The Motley Fool. (You've probably picked up on that by now.) As a result, we care about leadership.Our services' recommendations are filled with companies led by CEOs with the vision to dream big, the humility to listen when someone proves them wrong, and the thoughtfulness to invest heavily in a fantastic company culture. That's why we consider what current and former employees say on websites like  and  when deciding whether to recommend a stock. Believing in a company's future starts with trusting the leader at the helm.Tom invested in a play created by his college friend Jill Furman because he believed in her ability, her grit, and her passion for producing great theater.  ultimately won four Tonys and a Grammy (and was even nominated for a Pulitzer). It also opened the door for Tom to be an early investor in a then-unknown musical called...  .As a corollary to that point...As Tom puts it, \"Culture doesn't just mean what it's like to go to work. It also means: How are customers treated? How are suppliers treated? How are the stakeholders of that business treated? That's No. 1 for me.\"We could talk about karma and all the reasons why it's smart to be good to others, but that really neglects the underlying point: Being good to people is just the right thing to do.The Motley Fool has accomplished a great deal in its first 25 years, but we're more excited than ever about what our community can achieve in the coming 25 years.At the end of the day, only a fairly small slice of people are interested in stocks. Our goal is to \"help the world invest -- better\" -- which means we need to serve a much broader swath of the population than only people interested in stocks.David shared a great quote at a company conference a few years ago: \"Make your portfolio reflect your best vision for our future.\" But that's only part of the answer. Make your actions -- where you invest your money, where you spend your money, where you spend your time,  -- reflect the world you want to see. That's what we try to do here at The Motley Fool, and we're excited to grow and change together over the next 25 years.We have been so fortunate to share this journey with millions of awesome people.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of XLY, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, XLY's low point in its 52 week range is $87.89 per share, with $112.62 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $110.03. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["f you looked at the recent stock performances of  (NASDAQ: TRIP) and  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , TripAdvisor has been, by far, the better investment. But zooming out to look at their respective price changes over the last several years tells a much different story.Which story should investors believe? The long-term results of Booking Holdings or the short-term momentum of TripAdvisor?TripAdvisor vs. Booking Holdings Stock Performance, data by  .TripAdvisor vs. Booking Holdings Stock Performance, data by  .While TripAdvisor has recently shown signs of a turnaround, Booking Holdings is still a better buy for growth investors. Here's why.TripAdvisor posted better-than-expected revenue growth in the first quarter. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean much when analysts are expecting a revenue decline. TripAdvisor improved its top line just 1.6% in the first quarter.By comparison, Booking Holdings produced year-over-year revenue growth of 21% last quarter. Importantly, the company has seen accelerating growth over the last few years, spurred by its continual acquisitions of smaller online travel agencies and travel search companies.TripAdvisor vs. Booking Holdings Quarterly Revenue Growth, data by  .What makes TripAdvisor's poor revenue growth especially disappointing is that it's actually driving substantially more traffic to its website.  12% to 433 million in the first quarter. What's more, those users are increasingly engaged, with user reviews and opinions up 26% year over year. But TripAdvisor has done a poor job of monetizing those users, as evidenced by its weak revenue growth.Meanwhile, Booking Holdings  in revenue growth in the second quarter, as gross bookings decelerate to 10% to 14% growth. That's likely due in part to a pullback on advertising on websites like TripAdvisor's. But Booking is finding its ad spending is becoming more efficient and it's also seen a higher take rate on booking revenue.Booking Holdings has produced a relatively flat operating margin over the last five years. That's not great, but it's significantly better than the steep decline in operating margin for TripAdvisor.TripAdvisor vs. Booking Holdings Operating Margin Performance, data by  .More importantly, Booking stands to see meaningful profit margin expansion going forward as it focuses on its performance marketing return on investment. Further leveraging fixed costs can help expand its profit margin as well.TripAdvisor should be able to improve its operating margin, which plummeted to 7.7% in the first quarter of this year. Management expects a long-term earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin in the mid-to-high 20% range, so it sees lots of room for improvement. Still, that's well below Booking's current operating margin in the mid-30% range.Image source: Getty Images.Booking is growing revenue at a faster pace than TripAdvisor, and it should continue to do so into the next decade. That, combined with more modest margin expansion, ought to provide it with similar net income growth as TripAdvisor with less risk along the way.Booking Holdings stock trades for a  of 1.47 based on analysts' expectations for this year and the next five years. TripAdvisor's PEG is 2.15. Considering the better value of Booking stock compared to TripAdvisor's, and the clearer path to continued growth, it's a much better growth stock for investors interested in the online travel space.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2020 put at the $1580 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $71.00. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.5% return against the $1580 commitment, or a 2.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to BKNG's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $1580 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Booking Holdings Inc sees its shares decline 21.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $1509.00 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $71.00 from $1580), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Booking Holdings Inc, and highlighting in green where the $1580 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put at the $1580 strike for the 2.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Booking Holdings Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $2009.13) to be 25%.

In other words, there are lots more put buyers out there in  so far today than would normally be seen, as compared to call buyers.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["If this were the 1800s, the smart move for the next century would be to invest in telephone company stocks. Today's communication investment for the future is cloud stocks.Think about it.I don't make phone calls anymore. You may not, either. The smartphone has been the death of the phone.We text one another, or e-mail. We  (NASDAQ:  ), we  (NASDAQ:  ), and we  (NASDAQ:  ) Google things.Just as the junk call industry reaches its dream of rendering all robocall defenses useless - the equipment can now spoof any incoming number, so you can't block them - no one cares. that amazed and frightened reporters when it was announced during Google's I/O event  months  , may prove a non-story.Why are you calling a restaurant to make a reservation? Haven't you heard of Open Table from  (NASDAQ:  )?The telephone, our primary means of business communication for over 130 years, is practically gone.One result is that we no longer live synchronous business lives. You ask when you want, I answer when I want. Arranging a useful call is a dance of calendars, agendas, and conferencing software.Have you even noticed that long distance is no longer a concept? When our daughter was going to school in Europe we Skyped. The same was true when our son was in China.It's not just that voice is dead. Voice revenue is dead. Voice Over IP (), an exciting new thing in the last decade, is now ubiquitous. Everything happens on the Internet, and even with video voice is a low-bandwidth application.A third point is that you can't hide. I made a joke about the  on  (NASDAQ:  ) recently. He and his fans were on me in minutes. (Sorry, Mr. Crowe.)Another important point is that the phone company, as we knew it, is dead.All the cabling  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) built out over a century, as the Bell System, is obsolete. These companies exist only because of their wireless efforts.The cable \"giants\" like  (NASDAQ:  ) can smell this coming for them, too. They're anxious to get into wireless and sell themselves as Internet Service Providers.As a result of these trends the former US West, now part of  (NYSE:  ) has a market cap of just $20 billion. This includes its own wireless, cloud hosting and Internet components.TV is dead, too. We don't wait for TV schedules. We stream. We even stream live sports.

That's more than the whole communication and entertainment industries put together.Retail sales aren't dead, but traditional retailing in which you fill a space with stuff and wait for people to come get it is.This doesn't mean you can't compete with Amazon. It does mean you have to deal with it. You need an \"omnichannel,\" scaled Web commerce sites with distribution behind it. Even if that's provided by Amazon itself.The point is that the business world, the consumer world, has changed utterly, just in this decade. It takes your breath away.One more thing.

For this reason, many investors are willing to take chances on what they believe to be hot penny stocks.Investors in these stocks often lose everything \u2026 but they can also end up earning massive profits from a small amount of investment capital. For example,  (NASDAQ:  ) (formerly known as Priceline.com) traded as low as $1.08 per share in 2001. BKNG now trades over $2,145 per share.  (NYSE:  ) fell to 60 cents per share in 2002 following the dot.com crash. AMT now sells for about $138 per share.I cannot guarantee such a comeback for any penny stock of today. The following four stocks, however risky, could be positioned for outsized gains in various industries.[  ] 11.9% (NASDAQ:  ) functions as a defense and security services company. Despite its market cap of only $88 million, it operates in multiple countries and competes with the likes of  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) through its Power Systems division.ARTX also serves as a defense contractor and makes products designed for military, homeland security and law enforcement purposes. Given the Donald Trump administration's commitment to increase defense spending, Arotech could find itself well-positioned to benefit.However, like all hot penny stocks, this play remains speculative. Its revenues for 2017 stood at $98.72 million. Its 2014 revenues were $103.57 million, so this company has struggled with growth. Arotech was founded in 1990, and one of its divisions came into existence in 1971. Hence, the build to these revenues has been slow.The company earned a profit of 17 cents per share in 2017. Still, profits are expected to grow to 18 cents per share in 2018 and 26 cents per share in 2019. This could indicate this company may enjoy some growth. If the company can sustain that growth and speed up its slow growth trajectory, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13 starts to appear very low. 42.2%Tulsa-based  (NASDAQ:  ) is an upstream oil and natural gas producer. As an exploration and production company, times are great when oil prices are high. However, in an environment of low prices, revenue generation becomes a struggle.Fortunately for MCEP stock, crude oil now trades in the $70-per-barrel range, its highest price since 2014.MCEP stock traded as high as $27 per share in 2013. The oil price slump of 2014-16 hit its interests hard. By 2016, MCEP had become a penny stock, trading as low as 73 cents per share at one point. The stock has struggled to gain traction since then, but now trades in the $1.75-per-share range.However, company financials may have begun a turnaround. Revenue fell from $96.91 million in 2014 to $56.1 million by 2016. Although revenues rose to $58.93 million in 2017, analysts estimate revenues will remain below $60 million for both 2018 and 2019.Whether those estimates factor in higher crude prices remains unclear. And at these levels, investors should still consider MCEP stock speculative. However, the stock remained consistently above $20 per share while oil traded above $100 per barrel. If oil can continue to climb higher, perhaps MCEP stock will return to 2013 levels and become one of the hot penny stocks. -28.1%Las Vegas-based  (OTCMKTS:  ) is a marijuana industry holding company. Once limited to vaporizers, it has transformed itself into a full-scale marijuana cultivation construction company. While they had operated only in Nevada, the company landed contracts in California and New York earlier this year.Seeing business come in from across the country shows encouraging signs and could make MCIG one of the top marijuana penny stocks. However, financials also remain sparse. The company saw $1.72 million in revenues in 2016. This grew to $4.78 million in fiscal 2017, and the company made $1.53 million in that fiscal year. The company has brought in over $6 million in the first three quarters of 2018.Still, investors should still treat this as a speculative play. The stock enjoys rapidly rising revenues and profits. However, MCIG stock still trades under 25 cents per share, indicating lingering investor doubts. It has never traded above $1, though it briefly reached 92 cents per share in 2014. Still, it will need to see more growth before becoming one of the hot penny stocks.The current price stands well above the 5-cents-per-share level where the stock traded for most of 2016. If the company can continue gaining traction, its current $91 million market cap could rise much higher. -1.7%Dallas-based  (NASDAQ:  ) has become one of many retailers which have struggled to stay profitable in a changing retail environment. Founded in 1974, the company expanded across the country, operating in 41 states by 2001. During the past few years, the company has been plagued by high turnover in its top management and struggled to remain profitable.Still, the company operates 724 stores across the U.S., which by itself should make it one of the hot penny stocks. Moreover, revenue grew by 10% in its  . Comparable store sales rose by 9.1% in Q1 as well. Investors should also note that the company relocated 58 stores in the last 12 months. At those stores, sales grew by 65%. This latest report held many encouraging signs for the company.However, given that analysts expect net losses for both the current year and the year after, investors should still treat this stock as speculative.Still, a stock price in the $3.30 per share range and a market cap of about $140 million seems low for a company with 724 stores. Traders should also keep in mind that this stock traded at over $22 per share in late 2014.

Over the last several years, the bloc's leaders have shown again and again that they will indeed do \"whatever it takes\" (as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi famously said) to keep the eurozone intact. Meanwhile, the fundamentals of the euro zone's economy remain quite strong.As a result, investors should buy stocks that have retreated recently on worries about the eurozone's outlook and that stand to benefit from the continued strengthening of the bloc's economy.  (NASDAQ:  ) stock (formerly Priceline stock),  (OTCMKTS:  ) stock, and  stock (OTCMKTS:  ) stock all fit the bill.The crisis in Italy was the latest event that caused panic about the eurozone's fate. But the Italian president's decision to refuse to accept the anti-euro economy minister originally nominated by the country's populist parties once again proves the truth of Draghi's statement.What most American investors simply do not understand is that the E.U. in general and the eurozone, in particular, are still viewed by Europeans as insurance against the kind of wars that caused unimaginable (to Americans) suffering and deprivation in most countries on the continent for hundreds of years.And of course, the last major war on the continent, World War II, was the worst one. European leaders believe that the break-up of the eurozone could lead to the type of economic woes that was one of the causes of World War II, so they are determined to avoid that situation. The eurozone's very expensive bailout of its weak members over the last eight years or so illustrate the extent of the determination of its leaders to avoid a break-up.The eurozone's economy expanded 0.4% last quarter. That may not sound like much, but it still  year-over-year growth of 2.5%, according to economic consultant Arthur Donner.Moreover, as Donner pointed out, \"most economists expected that there were only temporary factors behind the Q! moderation and that the economy would continue to expand strongly for the rest of this year.\" And importantly, the bloc's unemployment rate inched down again to 8.5% in April from 8.6% in March, representing its lowest level since December 2008.Finally,  the European economy \"has the room to continue growing above potential rates for some time, with unemployment falling further and inflation increasing only very gradually,\" the E.U. stated.These favorable economic trends will likely cause Europeans to travel much more. That should significantly raise the revenue and profits of Booking Holdings, as \"more than 80% of (the company's) bookings are international, primarily in Europe,\" research firm Argus Research  in March.Those increases, in turn, should cause Booking Holdings stock to climb significantly. After retreating about 5% since early March, Booking Holdings stock is trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of around 21.Like Booking Holdings stock, Deutsche Lufthansa stock should get a big boost as more Europeans obtain jobs, leading to increased traveling by the continent's residents. Indeed, there are already signs that this trend is taking hold. In April, the number of passengers on the airlines jumped 9.1% versus the same period a year earlier, while its revenue rose 6% year-over-year. For the first four months of the year, the airline has set records in capacity, capacity utilization and number of passengers.In the first quarter, Lufthansa's revenue fell less than 1%, but its bottom line was impressive, as its adjusted EBITDA jumped 5.6%. Moreover, it served 13% more passengers than last year's first quarter and its revenue per seat kilometer jumped 11% year-over-year.In 2017, Lufthansa's revenue jumped 12.4% and its EBITDA surged 32% compared with 2016.Meanwhile, the airlines' trailing price-earnings ratio is a paltry 4.4, while its trailing price-to-sales ratio is just 0.3. Moreover, the airlines should benefit from continuing drops in fuel costs, given the recent decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to pump more oil. has already seen increasing demand for its products, prompting it to open at least two new factories in its home market later this year and enabling its organic revenue to surge 13% in the first quarter of 2018. In 2017, Louis Vuitton's profit from recurring operations jumped 18% and its free cash flow surged 20%.Those upbeat trends should continue as the economic recovery in Europe proceeds. Indeed the company plans to open a third new factory in France by 2020 \"in order to help Louis Vuitton meet the increasing demand for its leather goods,\" Fashion United reported in March. , the worldwide luxury products sector is expected to expand 5% this year, \"outpacing fashion as a whole.\"Moreover, Louis Vutton  in the fast growing market of China, and its trailing price-to-earnings ratio of around 28 isn't too high, given its growth. Despite the company's strong Q1 performance, Louis Vutton stock is around 5% below its 52-week high of $73.60 after a small recent pullback.

The momentum in the U.S. hotel industry continues in 2018 after moderate growth in 2017. In first-quarter 2018, the industry witnessed a better-than-expected rise in demand, with revenue per available room (RevPAR) increasing by 3.5%.Consequently, stocks in the Hotels and Motels Industry have put on an impressive show in the past year, handily outperforming the broader market, as a reflection of this positive backdrop. The  has rallied 20.2%, surpassing the S&P 500 index's gain of 14.5%.The industry looks attractive, owing to rise in occupancy rate and gain in commercial transient demand. Further, we note that rising employment, higher real income and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, which are likely to continue.The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years. The U6 unemployment rate, which includes people forced into part-time work and people sporadically looking for jobs, declined to 7.6%, the lowest level witnessed since May 2001.Going forward, consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat, suggesting that the U.S. economy will remain on solid footing in 2018. In fact, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow model forecasts healthy 4.8% (annualized rate) GDP growth in second-quarter 2018.A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that new supply is likely to rise 2% in 2018, up from 1.8% in 2017. This is likely to result in 0.3% increase in occupancy rates in 2018 to 66.3%. Moreover, ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2.6% and 3%, respectively this year. In 2019, the industry is likely to register ADR and RevPAR growth of 2.8% each.Meanwhile, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U.S. exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks, rose 1.6% in April 2018. In fact, in a year, the index has gained 12.7%.Additionally, according to Smith Travel Research (STR), a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics, U.S. hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics. However, the report revealed that occupancy rate will decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in 2019 due to rise in demand post hurricane in 2017. Despite this, the industry will continue to report record performance due to robust industry fundamental.Fall in international travel in the recent times has been a major concern for the U.S. lodging industry. Moreover, negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States, given Trump administration's stringent policies on immigration and tourism visas, is detrimental to hotels. If the U.S. dollar gains strength, this may keep industry growth in check, given its impact on inbound international travel.Additionally, higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to be headwinds.Meanwhile, hotel companies have been focusing on renovation, and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers. However, steep costs incurred by leading hotel companies to do so are taking a toll on profits. High labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers. In fact, online travel agents like  ,  and  are also limiting the pricing power of these brands.Another major threat comes from home-sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc., which offer digital service, allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like  and  . Both companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .The hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions. So the present solid economic fundamentals are likely to spur consumer spending in the remainder of 2018, raising optimism for hotel companies. Moreover, hotel companies will be able to counter any economic volatility better, if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services.Also, these companies must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory. In fact, Marriott's acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. was viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home-sharing companies.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar.

However, many companies are using the trend to start new business segments and transform existing operations. Here are two doing just that,  (NASDAQ: BKNG) and  (NYSE: F) , as well as peer-to-peer lender  (NYSE: LC) .Image source: Getty Images.While not a hard asset like a home or car, lending services have also come into the crosshairs of the sharing economy. Lending Club, the nation's largest peer-to-peer lender, gets borrowers lower interest rates and smaller fees than a credit card or other traditional lending source typically offers by connecting them with investors on its online platform.Since becoming a public company in December 2014, Lending Club revenue has soared more than 50% as seeking out alternative means of funding has increased in popularity. That sounds like a great investment, but Lending Club has actually fallen on hard times. It has been riddled with scandal the last couple of years, stemming from a  filed in 2016 regarding the company's disclosures and other communications to borrowers and lenders. Those regulatory issues are still ongoing and contributing to elevated costs and have pushed operations into the red. The stock is down 75% from its 2014 debut as a result.Other concerns, like increased competition, have surfaced:  ' online-only bank Marcus is just one of them. But there is some hope for this \"sharing\" company as  revenue increased 22% on an 18% increase in lending origination. The stock is high-risk with so much uncertainty swirling around it, but it nevertheless is still the leader in the peer-to-peer lending industry.While Airbnb may have become synonymous with sharing rooms, apartments, and homes for vacation and other short-term needs, the online accommodations company hardly has a big head start. That's because the world's largest online travel company, Booking Holdings, plays in the space, too.When last updated in summer 2017, Airbnb boasted 4 million worldwide listings of unique places to stay, including homes, tree houses, yurts, RVs, and boats. However, Booking.com -- the largest subsidiary of Booking Holdings -- said it had over 5 million unique listings on its platform as of the end of March 2018. That's in addition to the 23 million hotels, motels, and resorts that Airbnb doesn't have, giving travelers a  to price and compare accommodations.Image source: Getty Images.It's worth noting that while Booking has emerged as a leader in the sharing space, that's still a small portion of its overall business. Besides its traditional accommodations business, it also makes money off of rental cars and airline tickets, and total revenues were $2.9 billion in the first quarter of 2018. Nevertheless, unique listings are helping the company continue to  by double digits. For those wanting to bet on the travel industry getting disrupted, Booking Holdings is a good place to start.Everyday investors can't access new transportation sharing companies like Uber and Lyft, since they are private companies, but that might be OK.

Ford has made monetizing these various initiatives a top priority, cutting expenses and reducing investment in developing cars of the past in order to fund technology for the future.

For this reason, many investors are willing to take chances on what they believe to be hot penny stocks.Investors in these stocks often lose everything \u2026 but they can also end up earning massive profits from a small amount of investment capital. For example,  (NASDAQ:  ) (formerly known as Priceline.com) traded as low as $1.08 per share in 2001. BKNG now trades over $2,145 per share.  (NYSE:  ) fell to 60 cents per share in 2002 following the dot.com crash. AMT now sells for about $138 per share.I cannot guarantee such a comeback for any penny stock of today.

Despite its market cap of only $88 million, it operates in multiple countries and competes with the likes of  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) through its Power Systems division.ARTX also serves as a defense contractor and makes products designed for military, homeland security and law enforcement purposes. Given the Donald Trump administration's commitment to increase defense spending, Arotech could find itself well-positioned to benefit.However, like all hot penny stocks, this play remains speculative. Its revenues for 2017 stood at $98.72 million. Its 2014 revenues were $103.57 million, so this company has struggled with growth. Arotech was founded in 1990, and one of its divisions came into existence in 1971. Hence, the build to these revenues has been slow.The company earned a profit of 17 cents per share in 2017. Still, profits are expected to grow to 18 cents per share in 2018 and 26 cents per share in 2019. This could indicate this company may enjoy some growth. If the company can sustain that growth and speed up its slow growth trajectory, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13 starts to appear very low. 42.2%Tulsa-based  (NASDAQ:  ) is an upstream oil and natural gas producer. As an exploration and production company, times are great when oil prices are high. However, in an environment of low prices, revenue generation becomes a struggle.Fortunately for MCEP stock, crude oil now trades in the $70-per-barrel range, its highest price since 2014.MCEP stock traded as high as $27 per share in 2013. The oil price slump of 2014-16 hit its interests hard. By 2016, MCEP had become a penny stock, trading as low as 73 cents per share at one point. The stock has struggled to gain traction since then, but now trades in the $1.75-per-share range.However, company financials may have begun a turnaround. Revenue fell from $96.91 million in 2014 to $56.1 million by 2016. Although revenues rose to $58.93 million in 2017, analysts estimate revenues will remain below $60 million for both 2018 and 2019.Whether those estimates factor in higher crude prices remains unclear. And at these levels, investors should still consider MCEP stock speculative. However, the stock remained consistently above $20 per share while oil traded above $100 per barrel. If oil can continue to climb higher, perhaps MCEP stock will return to 2013 levels and become one of the hot penny stocks. -28.1%Las Vegas-based  (OTCMKTS:  ) is a marijuana industry holding company. Once limited to vaporizers, it has transformed itself into a full-scale marijuana cultivation construction company. While they had operated only in Nevada, the company landed contracts in California and New York earlier this year.Seeing business come in from across the country shows encouraging signs and could make MCIG one of the top marijuana penny stocks. However, financials also remain sparse. The company saw $1.72 million in revenues in 2016. This grew to $4.78 million in fiscal 2017, and the company made $1.53 million in that fiscal year. The company has brought in over $6 million in the first three quarters of 2018.Still, investors should still treat this as a speculative play. The stock enjoys rapidly rising revenues and profits. However, MCIG stock still trades under 25 cents per share, indicating lingering investor doubts. It has never traded above $1, though it briefly reached 92 cents per share in 2014. Still, it will need to see more growth before becoming one of the hot penny stocks.The current price stands well above the 5-cents-per-share level where the stock traded for most of 2016. If the company can continue gaining traction, its current $91 million market cap could rise much higher. -1.7%Dallas-based  (NASDAQ:  ) has become one of many retailers which have struggled to stay profitable in a changing retail environment.

During the past few years, the company has been plagued by high turnover in its top management and struggled to remain profitable.Still, the company operates 724 stores across the U.S., which by itself should make it one of the hot penny stocks. Moreover, revenue grew by 10% in its  . Comparable store sales rose by 9.1% in Q1 as well. Investors should also note that the company relocated 58 stores in the last 12 months. At those stores, sales grew by 65%. This latest report held many encouraging signs for the company.However, given that analysts expect net losses for both the current year and the year after, investors should still treat this stock as speculative.Still, a stock price in the $3.30 per share range and a market cap of about $140 million seems low for a company with 724 stores. Traders should also keep in mind that this stock traded at over $22 per share in late 2014.

Let's move on to online travel. Both TripAdvisor and Booking Holdings, AKA Priceline, reporting first quarter results this week. Both better than expected, but Jason, it was TripAdvisor's stock that got the bump. You looked at this quarter. Was it that great of a quarter for them? Well, I mean, a broken clock and all that stuff, right? It's been a very tough stretch here for TripAdvisor. But let me ask you, Chris, can you put a price on swimming with pigs? Can you put a price on swimming with dolphins? I feel like Ron's question about seeing  was easier to answer. I say that because TripAdvisor actually gave me the opportunities to do both of those things, in the Bahamas and Hawaii. To swim with pigs? Swimming with pigs, yeah. We'll talk more about it after taping, but Spanish Wells, Bahamas, baby. Go there. Wow, I'm so intrigued. It's been a very rough stretch for TripAdvisor. We talked a lot here over the past couple of years about this move they made to instant booking. They were trying to become more of an OTA, an online travel agency, like Booking, like  . Didn't work out so well. But it seems like there are some signs they're putting this snafu in the rearview mirror. And if that is the case, if they can get back to a place where they're playing nice with booking.com and with Expedia, who are very big spenders on the TripAdvisor platform, then there's a little bit more certainty in the business, and we can get back to growing that top line a little bit.On the bright side, this is still a very engaged platform. They have 433 million average monthly users. That was up 12% from the same quarter last year. 630 million reviews, up 26% from a year ago. There's a lot of reasons to appreciate what the actual platform is doing. Some not-so-great business decisions, I think, put them on hold for a little bit, but they might be turning a corner here. So, investors, if you own shares today, and I do, probably worth hanging onto to them to see how these guys play out. Yeah. You mentioned some of those numbers. As far as popularity, TripAdvisor is as popular as ever. It has the richest data it's ever had. The problem I've always had is that next click. People go to TripAdvisor, you get the data, you read the reviews, you find out what you want to do, and you click away and go somewhere else. Still very much an ad play, and that's just tricky. What about Booking Holdings? I'm wondering if, to Ron's point about Nvidia, if Booking Holdings is a little bit priced to perfection? This was as rock-solid a quarter as they could have put up. Maybe the guidance scared people a little bit? I don't know. You know why they changed their name to Booking Holdings? Because these guys know how to book stuff. $25 billion in bookings for the quarter, up 12% excluding currency effects. Room nights, up 13.2%, closing on 200 million, exceeding their own guidance for the quarter. A presence in over 220 countries. If you're going to get exposure to the travel industry in your portfolio, Priceline is a must. This is a core holding.If you look at the charts, year-to-date, one year, five years, ten years, there's never been a bad time to own this stock because it's such a massive network. That's really what it's all about in this business, having that network. If you're on the side of selling rooms, you want to be a part of this network. And I think they just continue to build the business around that premise, and it's working out really well. Does William Shatner still have some of those shares that he originally got? I have to believe he hung on to a couple, right? I don't think he did. I don't think so. I think he got out at a very low price.

Many shareholders worry that current growth rates are as good as they'll be and will cool off. Such was the case after  (NASDAQ: BKNG) reported a  .The rub was guidance, which indicated a slowdown is in order. Total gross travel bookings are expected to grow \"only\" in a range of 10% to 14%, or 5% to 9% when adjusted for currency fluctuations. Earnings per share should be $15.50 to $16.15, or up 10% year over year at the midpoint of guidance.Those numbers are hardly worth losing sleep over, and it's worth bearing in mind that Booking underestimates all the time, and is constantly reminding investors to expect decelerating growth as the company gets bigger. Even though some are nervous about a few other factors, smart investors don't need to worry much about them either.Image source: Getty Images.The first problem is currency. The company got a big boost from the dollar devaluing against other currencies (most of Booking's business is overseas).  it has hedges in place to protect its profits, but currency fluctuations will continue to impact gross bookings and revenue. Some years that will be good, others not so much, but it should all wash out over the long term.Taxes are the second problem. While tax rates for companies that do business in the U.S. dropped after the tax overhaul late last year, Booking expects its tax rate will increase from its prior 17% to a new level of 21% in the second quarter. That's due to its activity outside the U.S. There were other tax increases elsewhere in the world -- the Netherlands was cited specifically -- that will hit the bottom line, too. The increases look modest, though, and are manageable.The third and final issue is timing. Easter is a busy travel time around the world, and last year that holiday fell in the second quarter. This year it was in the first quarter. That means the holiday bump came early, so Booking is lapping a difficult comparable period that isn't apples-to-apples. Also in quarter No. 2 is the World Cup, which could cause slowdowns in travel. It all ultimately depends on which countries' teams do well (if developed nations' teams advance, expect more travel bookings).All of the above factors are out of Booking's control and will ebb and flow over time. As for factors it does control, the company is making the most of them. As the world develops, an increasing number of people are traveling and using the internet to find accommodations. With a heavy international presence, Booking is positioned to capitalize on that growth in the emerging world.In developed countries, where booking online is already common, increasing inventory of unique places to stay is a key factor. While Airbnb helped pioneer the trend away from hotels and resorts, Booking.com is actually the leader in the space with 5.2 million homes, apartments, and other unique listings. That number continues to grow at a healthy double-digit percentage rate. Plus, Booking is working on making itself a one-stop shop for vacations by integrating travel, accommodations, and  in one place.Image source: Getty Images.All of that said, a detractor might say Booking is already a big company; market cap is currently $100 billion. However, even as the leader in online travel services, it musters only single-digit market share. Thus, there's plenty of room for improvement, and the company continues to make its online experience better for customers and make strategic acquisitions to consolidate more market share. Plus, trailing price-to-free-cash-flow is only at 22.6 after the report, and one-year forward P/E is under 20, all for a company that consistently posts double-digit top- and bottom-line expansion every year.Management said it believes its stock is worth buying at these valuations, too, having made $1.5 billion in repurchases last quarter. There is another $10 billion left in the current share repurchase plan -- representing 10% of what the company is currently worth -- which will be used in the next two to three years. That's another reason to give investors cheer.In short, after Booking's first-quarter beat and subsequent pullback, this stock looks like a great buy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Booking Holdings reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2018.Non-GAAP net earnings of $12 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $1.38. Earnings increased 22% year over year but decreased 29% sequentially.Revenues of $2.93 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.87 billion. Also, revenues were up 4.5% sequentially and 21% from the prior-year quarter.On a year-over-year basis, both the agency and merchant business showed strong momentum. Room nights, Rental cars and airline tickets, all performed impressively. On the call, management stated that the company will continue to focus on investments in people, systems and marketing with a long-term outlook.Overall, we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market, Booking Holdings' strong position in the international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position.However, weaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), macro headwinds, the increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs.Let's check out the numbers.Booking Holdings generates bulk of its revenues from the international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 18/73% in the fourth quarter (previous quarter split was (19/74%).Merchant revenues were up 3.5% sequentially and19.1% year over year. Agency revenues increased 2% sequentially and 18.4% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising & Other revenues were up 30% sequentially and 50.2% from the last year. These are basically non inter-company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable.On a year-over-year basis, room nights volumes increased 13.2%. Also, rental car days increased 18.7% and airline tickets were up 1.9%.Booking Holdings' room night growth is attributable to geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from the local and international players.Booking Holdings' overall bookings were up 20.9% (12% in constant currency) from the year-ago quarter and above management's guided range.Merchant bookings were up 74.1% from the prior-year quarter and agency bookings increased 13.4% from the year-ago levels.Owing to the nature of business and mix of agency versus merchant revenues, management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter. Booking Holdings' gross profit dollars were up 6% sequentially and 25.2% (18% in constant currency) from the last year.Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $798.2 million, up 25.7% from the year-ago quarter.Booking Holdings' operating income was up 31.2% year over year. Operating margin of 24.9% was up 190 bps from the year-ago quarter.Booking Holdings ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $6.9 billion compared with $7.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, Booking Holdings generated $640.4 billion of cash from operations. It spent around $132 million on capex. Free cash flow in the quarter was $508.4 million.At quarter-end, Booking Holdings had $8 billion of long-term debt.For the second quarter of 2018, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 7-11% and total gross bookings to increase 10-14% year over year (5-9% on a constant currency basis).The company expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1,085-$1,125 million.Pro-forma EPS is expected to come in the range of $16.35-$17.00. GAAP EPS is expected within $15.50-$16.15.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been 11 revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower. | At this time, BKNG has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio, from Motley Fool Asset Management, New York Yankee fan extraordinaire, Bill Barker. How are you doing? Things have been good lately. Things have been really good with your team that's apparently incapable of losing at all. Let's not dwell on that. They're coming to town next week. I'm leaving town. I won't go, but you could go. You could go. If I go, I'll be rocking the red and I'll be rooting for the hometown Nationals. And, we're going to talk about your trip, because you have kind of an interesting trip coming up. But we're not here to talk about baseball! I mean, we could be, but no one would listen. No. No one would care. We're going to talk earnings, we're going to talk television, we're going to talk stock buybacks. Let's start with Booking Holdings, AKA Priceline. First quarter profits for Booking Holdings were higher than expected, revenue was higher than expected. The stock down about 5% this morning on guidance for the current quarter. How weak was this guidance? This was about as rock-solid a quarter as Booking Holdings, which is a behemoth, by the way, could put up. Yeah, it was a good quarter.

They didn't have the big pop that  had yesterday or the day before because they have been delivering, unlike TripAdvisor, which was bouncing off lows rather than trying to maintain a stock price high. Let's move on to AMC Networks. Shares of AMC up nearly 10% this morning. First quarter profits came in higher than expected. I'm assuming at least part of the story here is the tax cut, because coming into this quarter, there was a little bit of concern, in part because the flagship show for AMC right now,  , or, I guess,  -- clearly, I'm not an actual viewer of said show -- ratings down just a little bit. So, I think there was a little bit of concern. But, you tell me. Yeah, it's  and  , and numerous other shoot offs of it. If you go to the AMC website and scroll down, they have  ,  ,  , which, I guess, is talking about the show -- That's a show that Chris Hardwick, a podcast host that I enjoy a great deal, yes, it airs right after the show. We talk about doubling down. Clearly, AMC Network, tripling down on zombies. ,  -- Please tell me there's a musical. Tell me if there's a  . --  , not to be confused with  . It just goes on. So, if there's softness in that brand, then they're going to be in trouble. I think they showed that they got the ad rates a little bit higher than last quarter, where they'd had some softness in the ad rates. Bottom line and top line, very flat year over year, which seems to be enough for investors today. Here's what could help: if they could actually produce the next season of  . Which, in the past, has come in the spring, and here we are in the spring. Fans of the show like myself are just sort of looking around, saying, \"Where's the next season?\" They don't even have a firm date on when it's going to start. They're saying, \"Fall of 2018.\" People like me would like a little bit more specificity. I guess you would. You're going to have to wait. You're going to have to suffer. Your interest will be increased. They have a lot of different networks over there. IFC. IFC. WE tv. OK. If you tell me there's a television network called WE tv, sure. I'll believe that. There is. I don't think it's aimed toward us. Which ironic, because it's named WE. [laughs] I think the WE, the W probably has something to do with women, because I think that's more of the target audience. MeTV, I think, would be the one for us. Yes. [laughs] Instead of WE tv. But, that, I think, is their second-biggest network. I'm not sure. It's interesting, I saw a couple of comments from the executives, I believe this was from the call. One of the things that AMC, and networks in its category, is trying to do to stem the tide of  (NASDAQ: NFLX) is to talk up not only the quality of their programming, but also their ability to promote those shows. And I think there's a little something to that. I don't know, from an investor's standpoint ... I think that matters more on the content creator side of thing as opposed to investors. If you're an investor and you're looking at Netflix and AMC and just look at the past few years, it's kind of easy to figure out which one has been the better investment.But, I do think there's something to, when showrunners and producers are looking at their options, in terms of who they're going to go with, one of the things that AMC can legitimately say with regards to Netflix is, \"We're going to give you more promotion of your show on our network than Netflix will,\" simply because Netflix is cranking out a new thing -- whether it's a movie, a television show, a limited-run series, a comedy special -- they're cranking out a new thing pretty much every day this year. Yeah. That may be the case, certainly, for the producers. There's a little bit more visibility to some of these things. But, certainly, if Netflix is able to pay more, that speaks, too. [laughs] That does. Netflix has been spending wildly, and it's working out for them. I think everybody who's partnering with them is pretty happy about the money that they're paying. I think. I would think so. For all these things. Like anything else, you get more money getting past seasons one and two. So, having a smaller playground to compete in, AMC doesn't have the opportunity to start a new show every day. But, it's all kind of flat there, which is maybe not too bad, in an era of cord-cutting, to maintain your revenues. But, I think today's news was more relief than really demonstrating that things are rapidly improving. For anyone who thinks we've been talking about stock buybacks more than we usually do, there's a reason for that. The Wall Street Journal reporting this morning that U.S. companies are buying back their own shares at a record pace. So far, S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings for the first three months of this year have bought back $150 billion worth of their own stock.I'm curious what your take in general is on stock buybacks, because Buffett at the  meeting over the past weekend, generally not a fan of it, although he seems to like the fact that  is going to be buying back stock. I'm sure the fact that Berkshire Hathaway owns a healthy chunk of that stock has everything to do with him applauding Apple for buying back shares. Well, they're buying the same thing he's buying, so, yeah, he has to applaud that. Apple just produces too much cash to really put it all to use. And unlike Berkshire Hathaway, where the central skill that the company has is capital allocation. Apple's central skill is not acquiring additional companies. So, buying back its own stock has worked pretty well. Historically, that's a better than average use of capital, and lower than average uses of capital are making acquisitions of companies other than your own.So, on the whole, I think it's good. It's not surprising, given the tax cut. There's more cash. Apple brought back a lot of cash from abroad, wasn't able to put it to use there. Having brought it back, has to put it to use in some form. It's not surprising that it's stock buybacks. The tax cut in general is fueling a lot of this, as was predicted. My own view on this is, it kind of depends on a number of things, including, what are the options that a company has for the cash. We were talking the other day about  (NASDAQ: SBUX) and this deal with  , this global marketing deal, and how Starbucks said they're going to take some healthy chunk, if not all, of the $7 billion they just got handed from Nestle, and they're going to put that toward share buybacks. As a longtime owner of Starbucks stock, I heard that news and I thought, good, because for all the success of Starbucks, they haven't really demonstrated a great ability to buy other companies, in particular food and beverage companies, and make them work. So, the fact that Starbucks is thinking, \"Yeah, you know what? We're going to buy back our own stock,\" I've seen what happens when Starbucks goes out and acquires food companies, and I would much rather that they spend money buying back their own stock. Yeah. For the most part, it's a better use of capital than acquiring other companies, as measured. Those who have taken the time to measure this have concluded that the stock buybacks historically have been a better use of cash. Now, historically, stocks have also been cheaper over the long spread of time than they're trading right now, perhaps. Most stock buybacks have come in the last couple of decades because of some changes in the tax laws, or changes in securities laws, which allowed companies more opportunity to buy back their own stock. So, it's more a function of the last two, three decades than the history of the market, where returning cash to shareholders, for the most part, came in the form of much higher dividends. You go back in time and you find that the larger history shows 4-5% annual return of dividends. That's no longer the case. It's less than 2%, it's been less than 2% for a while. But, buybacks are a bigger and bigger part. Couple of quick shout-outs. First, shout-out to the newest youngest listener out there, Elizabeth (unclear 15:55), born yesterday. Her father, Peter, is one of our listeners, and he sent a photo. Congrats to Peter on a brand-new baby girl. Fantastic!Shout-out to Peter Roegner of Fool Germany who's visiting this week. For anyone who has not checked out The Motley Fool's website in Germany, you absolutely should. Peter runs one of our services over there, essentially our small-cap service. Also, Peter's a longtime listener, because he brought tribute in the form of not just a bottle of whiskey, which looks amazing, but also Pringles. I'm going to Tweet out the photo of the Pringles, because they're Emmentaler, I think I'm pronouncing that correctly, basically Swiss cheese. Swiss cheese Pringles. I can't wait to break them open. They're going to be fabulous.Last but not least, if you're going to be in the D.C. area at the end of this month, we're having a podcast listener meetup in Washington D.C. We've got more details coming, but it's going to be on May 30th, so save the date for that. If you want to email us,  , we'll send you all the information. That's  for our podcast listener meetup in Washington D.C. on May 30th.Let's talk about your trip. You have two conferences you're going to, is that right? Yes. I'm going to the CFA Annual Conference in Hong Kong. Not in Boise? Not in Boise this year, unfortunately. It's going to be in Hong Kong instead. So, heading out tomorrow, arriving a day later. Looking forward to it. This is you and a bunch of other folks like you in a room and companies are presenting to you? Companies are saying, \"This is why you should buy our stock. We're going to do this PowerPoint about our business and take some of your questions. We have a great business here.\" Is that typically how that goes? That's the typical conference I go to, but that's not the CFA conference. It's a society and people get together and talk about how wonderful their profession is, and where it's going, and a lot of talks about what's new in the business and what's new in the profession and what's old and not going to work any longer. It's not an individual company presentation kind of thing. I'm doing that afterwards in Singapore. And Singapore is where you have a little bit of free time to maybe explore, go out, check out a restaurant, maybe a tourist attraction or two? Yes. Have you been to Singapore before? Yeah, but not in 25 years. I'm sure it's exactly the same as it was 25 years ago. I can't imagine Singapore's any different. I hope not, because it was great then. If it's changed in any way, I'll be disappointed. I'm sure it's a completely different place now. Can we crowdsource for you? Sure. Obviously, if people are interested in the podcast listener meetup on May 30th here in Washington D.C., they can email  . They can also email suggestions for restaurants, for things to do, because Bill Barker hasn't been to Singapore in 25 years, and it might as well be a completely different planet. Is there anything new there? I assume not. No. You're wrong. I've never been to Singapore, I'm sure it's completely different. Hong Kong, the same -- What are you looking for? Ideally, we get an email that just says, \"Here's where you have to go.\" Are you looking for restaurants? Are you looking for tourism stuff? Museums? Anything. A coffee museum? Any must-do things, because I will have a little bit of free time. I'll have the better part of one free day in Singapore, and really no free time in Hong Kong. But there'll be some speakers. Daniel Kahneman's speaking. Have you ever interviewed him? No. No? No. Michael Lewis has interviewed him, and I've interviewed Michael Lewis about his interview of Kahneman. So, there you go. So, you've indirectly interviewed him. You feel like you've interviewed him? It's two degrees of Danny Kahneman, which is a much more obscure game than the six degrees of Kevin Bacon. He's been here though, hasn't he? Who? Kahneman? I don't know. Maybe. Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing him speak, and everybody else. What are you going to be doing? I'm just going to be here in the studio. Going to the Yankees game? They're in D.C. [laughs] No, I'm not going to be doing that. I'm going to be watching on TV. Our producer, Dan Boyd, might be going. You're going to be rooting for the Celtics next week, aren't you? You know what? That is the other sport news today. My Boston Celtics emerged victorious over your Philadelphia 76ers. I'm glad we were able to work that in. [laughs] Yes, the Celtics will be in the Eastern Conference Final. And you've got them going past the Cavs? Oh, my goodness, LeBron James is just ... [laughs] is just looking superhuman, more so than usual, which is incredible. By the way, I was actually thinking -- I'm going to use an investing analogy here. For those who are not fans of the NBA, not basketball fans, one of the star players for the Philadelphia 76ers is a young man named Ben Simmons. He's almost certainly going to win the Rookie of the Year award this year. Ben Simmons has had a phenomenal season, and Ben Simmons had, in the playoff series against the Celtics, not a great series. Didn't shoot particularly well, had some turnover, in general didn't play great, particularly for someone who's probably going to win the Rookie of the Year award.And, much like in investing, when a promising young company goes public, and maybe they have a stumble in terms of quarterly results or something like that, you see people descend and immediately start to focus on all of the flaws as opposed to the promise. And that has really happened over the last few days. My observation with respect to Ben Simmons, that as he has struggled a little bit in this series, there's any number of commentators coming out and saying, \"I don't know. He's really struggling. Maybe he's not that good.\" A couple of people even suggesting, \"You know, they shouldn't take off the table the idea of trading him.\" And I just look at that, and kind of like investing, where there's a young company and you just think, \"Yeah, they have a little bit of growing pains, but I'm pretty sure this is a business I want to be a part owner of for the next 10-15 years and beyond.\" If Ben Simmons were a public company, shares would be selling off over the past week and I would absolutely be buying them. Well, I think there's a very low bar for spouting off some nonsense on sports talk radio. Really? Have you watched financial television recently? [laughs] Because I think there's a similarly low bar. There's a low bar. But, in terms of the decision-makers on Ben Simmons, I doubt they're giving one-millionth the amount of thought to trading him that those that call in on sports talk might promote. I think that's probably true, but it's still entertaining. Another speaker at this, Steve Eisman. Steve Eisman?! Steve Eisman. Now I'm -- Now you're thinking about going. No, I'm not thinking about going. But actually, now I'm legitimately jealous that you're going to be at this thing. Steve Eisman, for those unfamiliar, one of the star characters -- real life characters, obviously -- of Michael Lewis' book  . In the movie version, the Steve Eisman character is played by Steve Carell. I remember reading  and being blown away by Steve Eisman, who's just an openly rude person. Not necessarily in a malicious way, he just, as his wife says, he just lacks manners. But, it makes him a phenomenal investor, because he's able to sit in meetings where companies are pitching him ideas, and because he has no manners, he does not care about how he comes across. And because of that, he doesn't care about looking rude when he's asking very pointed, blunt questions. There's a meet and greet with him. Should I try to get him for your show,  ? No. Would you have him on? I would love to. There's no reason Steve Eisman would need to come on, because he doesn't strike me as someone who's necessarily seeking publicity or looking to promote a book or anything like that. But, you should absolutely go talk to him, because he strikes me as a fascinating person. Well, we'll see who's willing to talk to me out there. If there's anybody listening who's going to be there, let me know. I may know very, very few people. At the beginning. I'll know everybody by the end, hopefully. . I'll be the white male in a dark business suit, so I should be easy to spot. Yeah, that's perfect! At conferences like this? [laughs]  if you have any suggestions for Bill in Singapore.

The stock fell 8% on the headline even though they delivered a beat on the top and bottom lines.\u00a0But these days, investors are on edge and are focusing most on forward guidance. BKNG came in light on that front so traders hit the sell button quickly.Luckily for Booking bulls, the stock came into the earnings up 15% year-to-date, so even after this dip, the overall trend long-term is still intact. BKNG stock is a momentum stock. It runs really fast in either direction and it often doesn't need a reason to do so. So on an earnings reports, it is not that surprising to see this size move.The good news is that valuation on Booking stock is reasonable given the growth the company usually achieves. Yes, it carries a high ticket stock price but it doesn't mean it's expensive. The price-to-earnings ratio is under 50, and that's in line with its industry.Investors were disappointed with the light second-quarter guidance. But there is also concern around some costs increases. Management needs to commit to grow its inventory to maintain its lead over Airbnb. But this\u00a0is part of normal operating procedures and I am sure that BKNG has seen such hurdles before and has consistently overcome them.I expect nothing different going forward, and therein lies the opportunity.Inside my bullish macroeconomic thesis, I want to create income from Booking stock without any immediate out-of-pocket expenses. Earlier this week we saw  (NASDAQ:  ) report earnings, and its stock shot up tremendously in spite of it being the company that loses money. So this proves that is all about expectations. Investors had higher expectations of company guidance, and they are wrong to sell it.Management is merely being cautious in an unstable headline trading environment with regards to tariffs and geopolitical unrest. It shows responsibility and maturity, so this team will overcome and conquer going forward.Technically speaking, there are several levels of contention below current price that will be support for BKNG in the long run. Should the stock continue to fall against my risk, I will end up owning shares at a deep discount from current price. This worse-case scenario is totally acceptable to me given the intrinsic and tangible value that I see in Booking.com.Click\u00a0  \u00a0for a detailed review of the stock and for an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters. Sell the BKNG Oct $1,560 naked put for $11. This is a bullish trade where I have a 90% theoretical chance for maximum gains. Otherwise, I will own shares and accrue losses below $1,549.Selling naked puts carries big risk, especially for a momentum stock like BKNG. For those who want to mitigate it, they can sell a spread instead. Sell the BKNG Oct $1,570/$1,560 credit put spread where I have about the same odds of winning but with much smaller risk.

Go ahead, gentlemen. -- Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' 2018 Quarter 1 conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Booking Holdings had a solid quarter with revenue up 24% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, or about 16% on constant currency basis, and adjusted EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year to approximately $800 million. Our worldwide accommodation room nights of $197 million, were up 13% year-over-year, and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated gross bookings were up 21% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, or about 12% on a constant currency basis. An important factor contributing to our EBITDA over-performance was another strong quarter of efficiencies in our performance marketing channels, as we were able to leverage our spending by over 380 basis points.As we have discussed in the past, our performance marketing channels are complex and dynamic. Our goal is to achieve an appropriate balance between acceptable ROIs and growth. As we set out our ROI hurdles, we take into account not only the short-term impacts from our bidding strategies, but also factors such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the income incrementality of the traffic we receive, the anticipated repeat rate from a particular platform, and several other important elements.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Booking Holdings wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!As we discussed last quarter, increasing direct traffic and customer loyalty is a key strategic priority for us. To achieve these goals, we strive to have the widest selection, the best prices and availability, the most informative content, the easiest user interface, and the highest level of customer service. We are pleased to report that we continue to see growth in our direct channel and note that our mobile business is an important factor in the growth of our direct business.As we have discussed in previous quarters, we believe that brand marketing will also be an important part of driving direct traffic to our websites over time. We hope to make further progress executing our brand strategy implementing new measurement technologies and tools and testing in various geographies but want to reiterate what we have said in the past -- that we will proceed in a prudent manner.During the quarter, we made progress adding new supply to our marketplace, maintaining our position as the leading global accommodations platform offering the most choice in over 220 countries and territories worldwide. As of March 31, booking.com, our largest brand, had a total of 28.2 million reported listings, consisting of approximately 23.0 million reported listings in hotels, motels, and resorts, and approximately 5.2 million reported listings in homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay.Year-over-year growth in booking.com's reported listings for our alternative accommodations category was 28%, which demonstrates our ongoing focus to build additional supply. Today, all of booking.com's alternative accommodation listings are fully integrated in our marketplace and are instantly bookable with no customer fee. Room night bookings in this category are growing nicely and we firmly believe our customers want a one-stop shopping experience to find a great place to stay, whether it is a hotel, resort, home, or apartment, they want the ability to search and compare across all property types to find the best fit for their unique needs.We remain focused on bringing more alternative accommodation properties onto our platform, especially single properties whose owners may not be as aware, as professional multi-unit managers are, of the strength of our traveler demand. We believe that this is an attractive opportunity for us. Building sophisticated capabilities in local attractions and in destination experiences remains a long-term goal for the company, as we look to provide a more holistic travel experience for our customers in order to drive loyalty and build a larger direct brand. We've been gradually increasing our investments and expertise in these areas, including our recent acquisition of Fair Harbor and are pleased with our progress to date, though we want to stress that we are still in an early stage.During the first quarter, we utilized $1.5 billion in capital to reduce our fully diluted share count through both share repurchases and the cash settlement of the conversion premium on our convertible bonds which matured in March. We will continue to prudently deploy capital through a mix of organic growth investments, M&A, and stock repurchases.In summary, Booking Holdings had a good start to the year. Bottom-line results for the first quarter were aided by solid revenue growth and efficiencies that we realized in our performance marketing channels. We believe the travel market remains healthy and we continue to orient ourselves to the long run. We have a single-digit market share in the very large global accommodations market and an even lower market share in the total travel market. We continue to evolve the company, so that in the long run we will be able to provide our customers with a more complete and superior travel offering. This will take time, but we believe that if we continue to leverage our unique assets and expertise and all of our brands could change to execute, we will be successful.As always, I want to thank our more than 24,000 employees worldwide for their hard work and dedication. We are now getting ready for our busy northern hemisphere summer season. I know we will all work tirelessly to ensure our customers have a great travel experience. Finally, I want to send out a special thank you to Rob Rosenstein, the co-founder and longtime CEO of Agoda, our Asia-based business. Effective June 1, Rob is moving up to be the Chairman of Agoda and taking the role of special advisor to the CEO of Booking Holdings. I have known Rob for almost 15 years now, and I look forward to working closely with him as we continue to develop our long-term Asia strategies. Taking Rob's CEO position at Agoda is the current COO of Agoda, John Brown. Omri Morgenshtern, the current Chief Product Officer, will take the COO role there. Congratulations to all of them.I will now turn the call over to David for the Financial Review.Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the first quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2018. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Before we get into numbers, as we discussed last quarter, starting on January 1, 2018, we began reporting on the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which recognizes revenue at check-in rather than at check-out. As a result, all year-over-year growth rates referenced in my remarks and Q2 guidance will compare the current year on the new accounting standard to the prior year under the previous accounting standard.Additionally, revenue growth and profit margin performance of Q1 results and Q2 guidance are based upon comparison to prior gross profits due to the associated change to net revenue reporting in 2018. Gross bookings and other unit metrics like room night reservations are not impacted by the new revenue accounting standard. Our non-GAAP financial results and forecasts include stock-based compensation and are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release.So now, onto our results for the quarter. Our strategy to optimize performance marketing ROIs is impacting our top line growth. It's also driving significant improvements in our operating margins. The result was the second quarter in a row of expanding adjusted EBITDA margins on a bottom-line performance that substantially exceeded our guidance range and the facts at analysts' expectations.Room nights booked in Q1 grew by 13%, percent which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were down slightly for Q1 versus prior year on a constant currency basis, which was better than our forecast of down about 1%.Foreign exchange rates favorably impacted growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for our Q1 results. Q1 gross bookings grew by 21% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 12% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $2.9 billion, and grew by 25% in U.S. dollars, and by about 18% on a constant currency basis.Q1 revenues include $45 billion from the Momondo Group, an acquisition we closed in July of 2017. We also recognized a $27 million benefit to revenue in Q1 from the reversal of a portion of OpenTable's loyalty program liability. This benefit relates to recently introduced changes to OpenTable's loyalty program and is excluded from our non-GAAP results, as we believe it's not indicative of the core operating results of our business.Our non-GAAP revenue grew 24% in U.S. dollars and by about 16% on a constant currency basis. Total revenues for the first quarter of 2018 under the current revenue standard were approximately 2% lower than the first quarter 2018 would have been if reported under previous revenue standard, which was consistent with our guidance. This 2% difference in the quarter resulted in a 3 percentage point impact on our growth comparing Q1 with a year ago.Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 50% in Q1 compared to prior year, including revenue from Momondo and the OpenTable loyalty program benefits. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the OpenTable benefits, growth in advertising and other revenue was 36% in Q1.GAAP operating income grew by 31% and GAAP operating margins increased  compared to  last year. GAAP net income accounted to $607 million, or $12.34 per share, which grew by 35%. Our GAAP net income includes a $54.5 million benefit related to an unrealized gain in our equity investments in  , which is now recorded in the income statements or all through the balance sheet, due to an accounting change that took effect in Q1. We excluded this unrealized gain, as well as the OpenTable loyalty program benefit from our non-GAAP results.Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%, just slightly better than forecast. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $798 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance of $705 million, and grew by 26%. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes previously mentioned Seaship gain and OpenTable loyalty program benefits. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.5% was substantially better than our forecast, mainly due to higher revenue in the quarter and performance marketing efficiency. As expected, not-marketing OpEx expenses pressured year-on-year margins as we continue to invest in new markets and new capabilities.Our non-GAAP EPS was $12.00, up 21% versus the prior year, comfortably exceeding our guidance in the quarter, and facts at consensus. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4% in Q1, which increased from the prior year due to impacts of the U.S. Tax Act and the higher innovation box tax rate in the Netherlands, as well as last year's rate benefiting from discrete items. Our cash investments amounted to $16.3 billion at quarter end. In Q1, we generated $640 million operating cash flow, which grew by 68% compared to the prior year. Our free cash flow for the year was $508 million, which is 64% higher than Q1 2017.Cash flow in the quarter benefited from increased merchant transactions at booking.com, which have a favorable working capital impact. We returned about $732 million during the first quarter to our shareholders through share buybacks. In addition, we used another $773 million in the quarter for the cash settlements of the conversion premium on our convertible bonds that matured in March.We currently have approximately $10 billion remaining of our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be both programmatic and opportunistic with regards to our repurchases and, under stable business and market conditions, we expect to complete this authorization within a 2 to 3 year time period. Our guidance reflects our quarter to date actually results and assumes our growth rates will decelerate over the remainder of the quarter mainly due to the size of business and consistent with long-term trends.Our guidance also reflects the continued impact of our performance marketing optimization efforts and our approach to guidance has not changed. Our Q2 guidance is based upon current foreign exchange rates which provide a tailwind to our growth rates expressed in US dollars. We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 7% to 11%, and total gross bookings to grow by 10% to 14% in U.S. dollars and by 5% to 9% on a constant currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes a constant currency accommodation ADRs for the company will be down by approximately 1% compared to the prior period.We forecast future revenue to grow by 11.5% 15.5% in U.S. dollars and by 6% to 10% on a constant currency basis. This forecast includes the impacts of revenue shifting from Q2 to Q1 due to the timing of Easter and revenue recognition at check-in.Q2 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.085 billion and $1.125 billion dollars, which at the midpoint is up about 13% versus prior year. We forecast the adjusted EBITDA margin will be about in line with prior year Q2.Our Q2 forecast assumes our ROI optimization efforts will continue to yield year-over-year performance marketing efficiency. We expect the de-leverage from our investments in brand marketing and non-marketing operating expenses will offset this leverage from performance marketing in the quarter. As mentioned last quarter, these investments have a more significant margin impact in Q1 and Q2, which are quarters in which we typically earn a smaller share of our annual profits due to normal seasonality of our business.Although we're not giving guidance beyond Q2, we do expect de-leverage in non-marketing OpEx and brand marketing throughout 2018, but diminishing in the second half as we lack investments made last year. We also shared operating margins will benefit from increased performance marketing efficiency until we anniversary the optimization efforts that started in Q3 of last year.We forecast GAAP EPS between $15.50 and $16.15 for Q2, which at the midpoint is up about 10% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 48.6 million shares, which reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we've made to date. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a tax rate of 21% compared to prior rate of 17%. Our current year tax is higher than last year due to the impacts from the U.S. Tax Act, as well as the increased rates of the innovation box tax in the Netherlands.We're forecasting Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $16.35 to $17.00, which at the midpoint is about 10% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 21%, which is higher than the prior rate of 18%, due to the same reasons I just discussed for the GAAP rates.We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue, or operating profit from the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations.Our forecast does not assume a significant change in macro economic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. With that, we'll now take your questions.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time if you have a question, please press the * then the No. 1 key on your touchtone phone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from queue, you can do so by pressing the # key. Again, that is * and then 1.Our first question is from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question, maybe two if I can. Last quarter, you called out shortening booking window and the potential for some cancellations or volatility around Easter in the way you'd forecasted room nights. I wanted to understand how that played out as the quarter progressed against what you initially thought going in. And then second, you're projecting an e-sell in room nights in Q2 against what looks like an easier comp. I wanted to understand maybe a little bit, maybe some color around your forecasting there as well and anything we keep in mind. Thanks. -- Hi, Eric. It's Glenn. I'm going to take that second question and then I'll let David talk a little bit about booking windows.So, our company over time has been very consistent in talking about deceleration because of the law of large numbers. That has been something that has been trending fairly regularly over time. But there's certainly been volatility quarter-to-quarter. In some quarters, we've had small deceleration. In some quarters we've had faster deceleration. In some quarters, we've even had acceleration. There have been many factors have gone into that.Some of the factors are macro things -- the economy. Some the factors can be a competitive action by someone. Some of these factors can be somebody who's not a competitor but has influence of some sort of reorganization and an SEO algorithm for a search engine. And some of the factors are things that we do -- optimizing our performance market is clearly one. You take all these factors and they interact and there are feedback loops. It's very complex.That makes it very hard to project or predict short-term and its volatility. But long-term, we can make some absolute, in my sense, you can't make comp without making some predictions. The prediction is that we're going to do very well. I have a lot of confidence in the industry and the company and let me tell you why. Let's start the macro level.Travel is a function of GDP. World GDP goes up, travel will grow faster, and I am highly confident that world GDP is going to continue to go up in the long run. That's one. The second thing, a tailwind that we've always been experiencing is the offline to online. I know it sounds archaic using off line to online. Let's call it digital processes. That trend is going to continue. Yes, in some of our developed markets there are more people who are already online, let's call it, who are doing it. But there's so many areas in the world that are not doing that yet but will be doing it. That's another thing for us.Now let's go down to No. 3, micro. Let's get into our company individually. You know, we're a big company, but we're a small share of the travel industry. A small share of our biggest businesses, the accommodation business, a single-digit market share of, and we're measuring that -- just the number of available rooms on our platform. I'm not even talking about the inventory we haven't gotten yet. So that's a lot of opportunity for us there. And if you think about us, the share of the total travel industry in all things -- air, things like attractions, other parts of the industry that were much smaller, we're a very small share.I mentioned the inventory. We can go out we get more inventory. That's another thing that we're working very hard. We've talked about in the past, about us going out and getting more inventory. You see the numbers that we talked about. We talked about the amount of money being put into investing in developing our non-hotel accommodations. That's an area of growth for us. We talked about our experimentation with older  , maybe you've seen it on booking.com and we have flight on that. Maybe you've seen some things we're doing with ground transportation. Maybe you've seen some of things we're now doing with attractions. Experimentation got us where we are, now it's going to continue to get us to the future. A separate part of that is coming up with innovation.Whether it's a new thing out for Priceline.com, it's a package product they have out. It's new, it's exciting. Things like that are always going to help drive us forward growth wise. Then you come and you say what about conversion? Is that dead? No. We've always talked in the past about we do all, we have a giant experimental platform, and that we're always trying to come up with a better conversion way. Now, some quarters we do better. Some quarters we do worse but in the long run, we're always going to keep building and that conversion rate is going to continue to go up. We talked about our mobile in the past. That continues to be an absolute growth area for us. I could just keep going on.The point is, 24,000 very talented people. We have a lot of capital. We have technology. I think we're very positioned. So, when you say what's happening, your comparing this to an Easter comp. Last year was a 21% growth rate, at which point we hadn't started our optimization yet. I would say, actually, where we're positioned is actually very good. It's a good balance between growth and profit and I like where we are.David, do you want to take No. 2 there?Yeah, Eric, let me pick up on a couple of your opening question that maybe about Q2 as well. On the booking window, we did continue to see a modest decline in the booking window. We saw over the last few quarters to see a modest decline. We think it's likely impacted by some of the things we're doing around optimization in the performance marketing channels. We're now going into all the details. We are targeting less lower converting and less upper funnel ad placements that's having an impact on the booking window. Also, I would point out that mobile continues to perform well and mobile has a shorter booking window than desktop. So, those factors are going into the booking window. As we see it continuing to modestly decline.In terms of the Easter impact on room nights booked, very much in line with what Dan commented on the last earnings call. It did have a small impact to the room nights booked, very much in line with our comments. It had a much bigger impact on revenue and if we get a question about that later on the call, I'll explain how Easter impacted revenue. Then there was just specifically relative to Q2, as Glenn mentioned, we are comparing against a period in which we were spending very heavily in the paid channels. But if you think about the actual guidance itself, it's relatively stable guidance vis-\u00e0-vis what we just reported for Q1. Our approach to guidance hasn't changed.Also, we are now sitting here with more time between now and quarter end than when we guided for the last quarter, so there's natural increased level of potential variability, but I would point out that as in every quarter, there's always something going on. In this quarter, we are looking at some new factors in Q2, for example, given the timing of the World Cup and group play ending right at the end of the quarter is something that in prior years has impacted growth rates. So,  . -- Thanks so much.Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question, two if I can. It looks like, Glenn, I think you mentioned mobile as an important factor in driving the direct business. I'm wondering if you can just give us a sense if anything in particular has changed there. I think just two quarters ago, you had kind of downplayed mobile as a source of direct strength. So, is there a synergy with the TV spend you're doing or maybe has something changed in mobile app usage versus mobile web? Any color you could share there.And then and then just looking at non-advertising OpEx, it actually looked like it was ultimately fairly well contained, despite some of the investments you're making. So, is that really just a function of the size of the P&L being able to absorb that or any changes in magnitude of the investment you have to make in some of these new areas? Any color you can share there would be great. -- Sure, Lloyd. If I said something that was interpreted that I do not believe that mobile is important for direct or something of that nature, it was misunderstood or I misspoke, one or the other. Because certainly mobile helps direct significantly. We believe it's a very important part of the strategy going forward. Now, why are we noting it and why is it important? I don't know how much time you spend in  Asia, for example. But people are not doing desktop. Mobile is the way you do everything.That is so important for us to continue to be developing the right interfaces, the right connectivity for the different systems in all parts of the world where mobile really works efficiently. And I just think that that is something that for us because of the size of our company, because of the number of technologists that we have on our staff, we have an advantage. We can do these new experiments in all different areas of the business, ending up with a better result, a better use for our customers, which in the long run is how we went.Regarding the non-ad OpEx, we talked about this a couple of quarters ago about how we were making these non-ad OpEx investments. It was people and then all the things are associated with people, the expense that goes with them. We talked about a bunch of things, reasons why we wanted to do that, why we thought that was important for our strategy long term. And we ramped up that those numbers significantly at the time. Now, those people that came on board throughout the year and they're on now full, we don't need to hire at a higher rate. We need these people now to be more efficient, more effective and such. So we believe, as Dave was pointing out, over the year -- and I certainly see going into 2019 we will get the benefit of those people who are doing all the great work that they're doing -- but you should not expect us to continue to hire the way we did last year at that kind of rate. -- Got it. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks for taking my questions. The first one, just going back to your comment around direct traffic. It was kind of growing. I guess the question is, is direct traffic growing in your mix at this point? And if not, how are you thinking about that throughout the course of the year? And then going back to the deceleration implied in the guidance, I appreciate the color about the industry, but maybe just talk about potential for acceleration. What are the factors you are most focused on internally, whether it's regions or buckets of room nights, that you think over the course of the next year could lead to faster room night growth even through laws of large numbers? Thanks so much. -- Could you just explain a little bit more about, you said direct within the mix? I didn't quite understand that question. -- So, you mentioned that direct your direct traffic is growing year-on-year. The question is, is it increasing as a percentage of your total room nights or is paid still growing in the mix? -- Direct is growing. Direct is growing and we're very pleased with that growth rate and it is something that is part of the overall strategy to continue to increase that. In terms of -- I could come up with a whole bunch of hypotheticals of what could increase the growth rate and become an accelerating number versus a decelerating number, and a lot of them would be just making up and being speculative. I will say one thing though, that we have seen over time. That is when we come up with something that's innovative, something that -- we obviously haven't thought of it yet -- some new things that we've done and come out. That's actually been helpful in terms of driving more business.So a good example of something like that might be, while we were growing so fast at the time you, would have seen it in the growth rate. But the fact is when mobile came out. I'm been here long enough, 18 years. I was here when there was no such thing as mobile. But when people started booking on mobile, by being out in front and coming up with great ways to use that technology to make it easier for people to book who wanted to use their phones, that was an advantage for us.So it'll be something like that that I believe could come out in the future and we will be able to take advantage of it for something that I talked about earlier already, about the idea because we do have scale in our technology area. Because we have scale in all areas of our business, actually. That will help us achieve a better result than competitors who may not have the same scale. -- Okay, thanks. -- You know, let me get David. Is there anything -- you're a technologist at heart, so maybe you have something you'd like to talk about. I could speculate why we would accelerate.I'll add just a couple points, Glenn. Just on the first point, I just want to reinforce that not only is the direct increasing as we  our mix. It is our largest channel for bookings, Brian, just to clarify that point.Then I'd just add one more point. Certainly, it will start to play into fact in the second half of the year. Right now, we are from a growth rate comparing periods in which we are optimizing our ROIs against periods where we weren't optimizing them so aggressively, so in the second half of the year, the comparison will start to get a little easier for that factor as well. But as Glenn said, long-term, there are many other factors, including all the things he mentioned, in terms of head room available for us to grow this industry with, this business with single-digit market shares in our core markets and new ways to attract customers, etc. So, those will be the bigger factors for driving long-term growth rates. -- Okay, thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from Mark May of Citi. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Actually, one of my questions is a bit of a follow-up to the last comment. Is it possible for you to help quantify to some degree the impact that optimizing some of your direct response marketing has had on the growth? And maybe just help frame that a bit. And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the relative rate of growth in your North America market and kind of how that's been trending in recent quarters? Thank you. -- Okay, Mark. So, we're not going to put a pin on a number in terms of the optimization, but as David pointed out, optimization is definitely a hurt on the growth rate. And we know that if we wanted to get more growth, we could pay up for it so to speak, but that's not our strategy. Our strategy is to achieve a balance and we're at where we believe is the appropriate balance between profit and growth and that's really where we're going to play at.In terms of North America, we don't generally start pulling out different regions, so I'm not going to go there. I will say that the world economy is good. Travel is good in most areas of the world. David I think mentioned we have a couple of small areas that are of interest and it's not North America at all. Argentina and Brazil with some currency. Russia also, some currency effects happening there, which make outbound business decline. You recapture some of that in domestic business, but it's still a negative impact on us generally. So that's a little bit in terms of a regional area or a country area. But generally, that's about as far as I go in anything I could call out as an issue. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey, I've just got two European-related questions. One, this is small, near-term stuff. But World Cup. Just talk about the impact that's had in years past. That is a pretty sizable event. I hear people over there are getting excited by that. They don't travel, so just how do you actually try to handicap the kind of impact that could have on your business? I know that's a near-term issue, but I want to ask that.Secondly, also European, I want to ask about GDPR. How do you think about the extent to which that will complicate your business, either in terms of your ability to reach out to your current or potential future customers and just overall? Does that does that impinge on the effectiveness of online marketing channels? How much of a challenge for you is GDPR in terms of running the business? Thanks a lot. -- Hi, Mark. I'll take the second GDPR. David, being English and they actually have a team in the World Cup this year, I'll let him handle that one.So, GDPR. First, before I answer your question, let me just point out how we definitely believe that privacy is a very important thing. We've been thinking about how to maintain privacy for our customers, our partners, everyone long before GDPR was even a thought in Brussels. We do not believe, and we've talked about this here, we do not think this is going to have any real impact on our business in terms of our marketing or getting customers. So really, we look up and down trying to figure out if there some sort of impact, and we cannot not see a material impact from GDPR.That being said, preparing for it and continuing as we come up to the deadline, it obviously causes costs and diversion of resources -- relatively minor compared to the size of our business, but there were actual movement of people who would have been preferring to work on the business, making either more accommodations or working on some of our new, innovative things, rather than working on GDPR. But that being said, it's something that we need to do and again, we're happy to do it. I'll let David talk about World Cup and what his thoughts and maybe a prediction on who he thinks is going to win.Mark, certainly I would not go as far as that in public. Mark, it's interesting because it's difficult to predict because a number of factors come into this. It depends which seems doing well. What we've seen in prior years, is that when teams get through to the latter round, their countrymen are not booking very heavily while it's the end of World Cup, but once they get knocked out, they stop booking quite quickly. So, it's a function of who gets through to the latter rounds. As I mentioned, with everything happening starting in the middle of June going into early July, it's the group play. Rounds end right at the end of the quarter. So, it's going to be a function of which teams are going forward beyond that. So, it's very difficult to predict. So, I can't be more specific but it's certainly a factor that we're looking at when we're modeling our growth rates and looking at sequential bookings growth and things like that during the quarter. We'll have to tell you based upon what happens if he winds up getting through to the latter rounds. -- Okay. Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Great, thank you. You definitely have tighten your ROI thresholds and I'm wondering if you thought about the competitive impact on that? You've said it's affected your growth rate. Where do you think those rooms might be going? Is it going direct or do you think some competitors might be getting it?. And then over time, I've followed this company for many years, you've always found great opportunities in new marketing channels that have helped propel your growth and you've actually out competed people over time. So I'm just thinking about do you still see those opportunities? Is it going to take new emerging companies that you can take advantage of or changes in Google? But over time do you still think you can have an advantage in marketing channels? Thank you. -- Justin, I agree with your point that we have done a good job in terms of marketing over time. We do believe that we will continue to do well and find new ways to be able to bring in more customers and new types of marketing. Certainly something that we've talked about in the past is our brand marketing effort. That's sort of a counter to raising ROIs on our performance and countering with brand spend to bring people direct.That's an area that we're going to continue to work on, work very hard on, to try and develop the right formulas. Coming up with the right creatives, the right measurement tools, putting in the right geographies, so that we can bring more of those people direct to us. It's so important to our strategy in the long run that we don't depend as heavily as we have in the past on third-party sources of customers. We believe the right thing for the company in the long run is to create a service that is so good, that people, when they think about travel, they think about us immediately and come to us directly. -- Got it. Then on the first question, you apparently have given up a few rooms. Do you think those are going to direct channels or where do you think those people are going? Any thoughts on that? -- Thoughts on that. I have some thoughts on it and what I'm really hoping -- because I think David may have mentioned this a little; he can talk a little bit after I'm done -- is the idea that when we are optimizing, which keywords are we thinking aren't good for us in the long run? And thinking well, maybe those people will come to us later in another way, shape, or form, or maybe they'll be booking somewhere, but before they actually show up, they'll cancel there and come back to us and check our prices and our availability and see maybe they will be book with us in the end. Anything beyond that would really be just speculation. David? I don't think there's much else we could say on it. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks a lot. Could you give us an update on underlying take rate trends that you're seeing? It seemed like those might have been a little bit stronger in the quarter, even after making all the adjustments. And then on that, can you tell us where you did end up for the estimated Easter impact on revenue both under the new and old accounting standards for Q1? Thanks. -- David, do you want to take it?I'll take Easter first, Kevin. That's kind of a long rant, and then I'll come back to the take rate. So, as I mentioned in one of the answers to an earlier question, from a bookings point of view, Easter timing was a modest headwind in Q1 in line with our expectation. The revenue impact is much greater, but also in line with our expectations. So, let me explain what was going on there.So, in 2017, of course, Easter fell in Q2 and revenue  was based upon checkout. So those Easter stays help Q2 revenue. In 2018, Easter fell on the first of April, but very importantly, the revenue  moved to a check-in. So most of those Easter to stay mainly helps Q1 revenue. So, the impact of that was about 3% year-on-year benefit to Q1 growth, and about a 2% hit to year-on-year growth in Q2.If you think about those 5 points of difference in growth, those account almost the entire difference in our constant currency revenue guide from Q1 to Q2. It's really all explained by the  6 points. So that's what's happening with Easter and it's in line with our expectations of what we told you on the last call.In terms of in terms of take rates, they have actually been being quite stable and we are pleased with that. And we also mentioned that ADRs were down only very modestly in the quarter and we had it in our guidance predicted them being down 1%  constant currency ADR. So, that's what's going on there. -- Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question is from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense about how, and I know you've talked about this in a couple of different ways, but just how are you thinking about the trade-off between growth and profitability? To the extent you're optimizing away from lower performing channels, are these channels that are actually losing money or simply not hitting the ROI target you had for them?And then the second question is, as we move further away from the changes in pricing regulations, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of hotel behavior, discriminating and for the meta search channels and whether or not -- I guess, one, whether you're seeing it and to the extent you are, whether it's having an impact? -- Hi, Heath. It's Glenn. We talked about this in the past and how we value a performance platform from this marketing platform and how we decide what we're going to bid, how much we're going to bid. We've talked about what's the customer experience on that platform, what's the incrementality of the traffic going to be? What's the anticipated repeat rate going to be for that demo? We also think about are we supplying funds to someone who may then use those funds to compete with us later down the road? These are all factors that come in.So it's more than just is it a positive ROI or a negative ROI? There's a lot more that goes into how we decide how we're going to bid, where we're going to bid, what level we're going to go at. We're getting leaning in and we will continue to lean in with those platforms that we believe are helping us build our business for our long-term strategy. I've said this before many times. We lean out against those platforms that are not doing that, those that we believe in the long run are actually detrimental to achieving our long-term strategies. That's the answer to that question.Regard parity, I have not seen much impact at all regarding any of the changes in the landscape in that area. It really has not, to my knowledge, from what I've seen yet had a material impact. We still believe that we are the people who have the best price, the best availability, the best service, the best user interface, and people come to us. I know this from looking at this.It's not always just best price, by the way. Part of our winning strategy has been doing all those other things too. So there's a lot more to it than just showing up with the best price in a meta to be successful in this business. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, you talked about wanting to be the place to go for travel and you've certainly been talking more about a broader holistic travel approach and more full service. I was hoping you could help us understand how much of your business, non-hotel, non-accommodations could be over time, how you think about that and what kind of investments are required to get there if you think over the next three to five years? Thanks. -- I definitely have talked about this a great deal. I do believe it is the proper way for us to go for the long run. One of the critical things about this is not just making sure that we have an appropriate return on the investments on the, let's take for example let's say you wanted to do -- we're doing attraction right now. We believe it's very beneficial, helping our customers before they show up, while they show up, to get those attractions or experiences. More than just the money we would make from those, it's providing a much easier way for that customer to achieve a great trip.So, we could over time make a lot less money on that individual action, but because it builds great loyalty, be very beneficial and, of course, it's going to show up. David, doing his accounting, he's going to tell me, \"Hey, this is great. Lot at how we're doing on our accommodations.\" We'll have to then figure out how much we attribute to some of these other services and make sure that we are properly realizing what is a good investment or not. So that's the first part of that answer.I do not have in front of me a 5-year plan with the absolute numbers and dollars for each of these items. As you know, we're an experimental company. We build products out. We see how they work. If they work, we do more and we develop it further. If it doesn't seem to be working, we pull back. The right thing though is maintaining the balance. We've talked about this. This is how do we use our capital? We use our capital for organic growth and organic growth investments is things like building out these services.There's also M&A. As I mentioned, we went out and we bought Fair Harbor to help. That's one building block in building out this large, holistic system. And those are the different ways we're going to do it. I can't give you some numbers. I can say I do believe that it is and it will be when we have done this, a very strong competitive advantage over companies that do not have that. -- Okay, thank you, Glenn.Our next question is from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays Capital. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks for taking the question. Two questions from me. First, growth in brand marketing dollar was lower than last couple of quarters. There's obviously seasonal aspect to it. But can you talk about your current thinking on brand marketing effectiveness compared to prior expectations?And then second question, one of your competitors is ramping supplier acquisition and marketing investment in Europe. Do you think that's driving competitive pressure or maybe peripherally on the customer acquisition side in Europe? Thanks a lot. -- Brand. So we started talking last year about the importance of brand and that we planned to make investments in brand. We talked about the need for technological measurements to make sure we're doing it right and we're going to do it. And one of the things I said several times, I said we would do it carefully. I used the word \"careful,\" I used the word \"prudent.\" I said that we weren't going to just go out and spend a huge amount of money. That we would test our way in and experiment. And we're continuing to do that. And when we find the right formula, when we find out exactly where we think it is doing very well, that's where we're going to open up the spigot more and spend more. But what we're not going to do is spend a huge amount of money before we have a higher certainty that what we're doing is doing well. So that's how we're going to play that one.Your other question about -- people have been competing with us for a very long time getting supply. This is nothing new at all. And I do not expect this to change in the long run. People will continue to go out and try to get more supply. All of our competitors will. We've been doing pretty well generally against that. We're always making sure that we have good relationships with our property partners. We're making sure we're getting great prices and availability. We're making sure we're giving value to these partners. I feel pretty good about our position in Europe right now and I don't -- really, in the checks with partners that we've had, the numbers that we've looked at, I have not seen any anything yet from any competitor in terms of European getting in inroads in there because of any reason. -- Great, thanks a lot.Thank you. Our next question from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Your line is open. -- Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask around non-traditional inventory. How you how you feel about the depth and breadth of supply there going forward? That's it. Thanks. -- Well, I was very happy, Brian, when we did our announcement a few weeks ago about 5 million listings. That was something that the team was happy about and we were all happy about. It's 5.2 million now. I also made a note here and I've talked about this in the past, that while we do like having a lot of listings, we do recognize that we don't have all the right type of listings. I spoke specifically in my prepared remarks about wanting to get more single-home inventory. I talked in the past about we don't have it all in the right geography. Some places, we have great breadth and depth. Some areas not so much. So, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us to go out and get more of that. But just getting inventory isn't enough and we said this. I was just talking about somebody else getting more inventory and how it's going to affect them.Well, it's the same thing with us. I've talked in the past the importance of not only getting that availability and that connectivity in those properties onto our platform, but it's making sure that the customer, when they're thinking about where they're going, is thinking about us for that type of accommodation. The awareness of our non-hotel accommodations in the U.S. is not nearly as high as we would like it to be. We recognize that.I don't know if you've seen some of our recent advertisements by booking.com. They have one going on right now, running right now that is specifically oriented to that type of property, but one of the things recognize to be successful, to be very successful, and to be a leader throughout the world is we need to have the inventory everywhere. -- Great, thanks, Glenn.Thank you. Our next questions is from Justin Patterson of Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Great, thank you very much. Shifting back to the high-level investment themes and technology changes, AI has been one of your investment areas. It sounds like you had some good success with natural language processing. Could you talk about how it's being used in the business today, what benefits you're seeing from that, and how you think that changes the business over the long term? Thanks. -- Sure. One of the areas that I guess, I'm not sure if you read our shareholder letter that wrote for the proxy, but we talk a little bit about how we're using in customer service, the chat bot and how we're very pleased with the result and how that's doing right now. It really is a great thing because customers are happy because it's easier, quicker, faster to get their problem solved. We like it because it helps in terms of our expenses obviously. All good there. And that's one example. There are going to be a lot more examples of that down the road.I'm sorry what was your other question? Do you have no question? -- No, just kind of long term, where do you see the biggest AI benefit? So that piece, you just described as cost side. How do you think about that playing into bookings and other areas of the business? -- Well, obviously personalization is so important. That's part of that whole holistic system that I've talked about. I'm probably getting some of you bored with me talking about it, but it's important so I'm just going to keep repeating it.Then there's the idea a customer, with the incredible amount of choice in all the different things that they could do and such, it's helpful to give them guidance. And I always give the analogy of that old time human travel agent who knew everything about you because they knew the things you've done in the past and they knew your income, they knew what you liked, they what kind of a trip you should, what kind of restaurant you should go to, what kind of attractions you go, the experiences you should have, how you're going to get from your home to the airport, how you're going to get from the airport to the hotel, or the non-hotel, depending on where it was, and all those great things.That's what AI needs to recreate so that when people come to us, we are able to provide them with what really is the perfect trip and make their lives easier. I am certain you have done leisure travel and you've been frustrated. It's frustrating for me too. I still have these issues, but I know that with technology we can cure this stuff and the people who cure those problems first, who get rid of that friction, who make it easier for everybody, those are going to be the people who people are going to direct and are going to be the winners. We want to be that person. -- Thanks, Glenn.Thank you. Our next question is from Tom White of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up on some of the deceleration that we've seen in the growth of the business over the past few quarters, and sort of vis-\u00e0-vis your alternative accommodation product. I guess I'm just trying to understand if there's potential do you think for this product to be large enough over time to reaccelerate your overall growth rate in any meaningful way? Maybe through adding pockets of supply like you mentioned in some geographies or more whole home inventory or maybe just growing consumer awareness of the category? I'm just trying to understand if this is a big enough product to maybe kind of reverse the decel that we've seen recently. -- Could is an interesting word. I mean, yes it could and it might. My interesting issue in that right now, and I'm going to use your questions just to riff on it a little bit. So, clearly we think it's very important right now. We know our customers want it and we're going out and getting that inventory, but we're also making sure that we obey the rules.Not all municipalities want to just let this go willy nilly. They have all sorts of ideas about how this should be regulated and we are fully in favor of working with local municipalities, local organizations to make sure this is done appropriately. Because if it's not, if we just let everybody just do it with nothing regulated, you can end up with the potential, you know, the tragedy of the commons issue, where it causes a problem for the entire city. And we've seen certain cities where people are objecting to that type of tourism because it's making life for the people who live there very difficult.On top of that, there are some municipalities that believe that this type of activity is having effects on rental places for people who live there. I don't know if you saw the recent thing on that. All sorts of issue like that. So one of the things we are very much in favor of much of this, but we want to do it legally and correctly. I was very happy to see a couple of weeks ago when the Mayor of Paris came out and was talking about how we are a role model for doing this the right way. So that's good.Second thing that's interesting, I'm not sure if you saw or heard about or seen about one of the major chain hotels that is out there and is now testing doing home sharing. It's very small, a small test, but they're out there doing it too. So it'll be interesting over time. Where the blending, where you people don't make much of a distinction. That is just I need a place to stay and I look and they come to booking.com and we have all the stuff there. They see which property is right for that particular trip. So I don't want to think about at the end of the day is it going to be bigger or smaller than traditional or not? I just want everything to get bigger for us. -- Okay, thanks for the color.Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn Mr. Fogel for closing remarks. -- Thank you. I want to end by saying that I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. We balanced attractive growth with profit margin expansion and we'll pursue the strategy we've just talked about to give us the highest probability of capitalizing on this very large opportunity that we have in front of us. I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude your program. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For  (NASDAQ: BKNG) -- the newly renamed version of the online travel giant previously known as Priceline Group -- an immediate downward push for the share price overshadowed, in some people's minds, the strong performance that the company had during the first quarter of 2018.Coming into Wednesday's first-quarter financial report, Booking investors were looking for  , but their views on the likelihood of bottom-line gains were more modest. Booking exceeded expectations on both fronts, but it's likely that traders once again ignored the fact that the travel giant often lowballs its forward-looking guidance, in a way that temporarily spooks those who don't have a longer history of seeing its results over time.Image source: Booking Holdings.Booking's first-quarter results continued in the footsteps of  . Revenue jumped 21% to $2.93 billion, outpacing the 19% growth rate that most of those following the stock were hoping for. Adjusted net income of $590.4 million was higher than year-ago levels by almost 20%, and the resulting adjusted earnings of $12.00 per share compared favorably to the consensus forecast of $10.67 per share on the bottom line.Priceline's internal measures of performance were generally favorable as well. Gross bookings rose 21% to $25 billion, accelerating from the growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2017. Agency bookings growth was once again slower than the corresponding gains in merchant bookings, but the figures of 13% on the agency side and 74% for merchant business were solid. Yet naysayers will point out that currency gains played a key role in driving the numbers higher, and constant-currency bookings growth was just 12%, continuing its slowing trend over the past year.Unit-based volume metrics went more clearly beyond the positive impact of the weak U.S. dollar. Room-nights sold rose just 13% to 196.8 million, further eroding what has been Booking's strongest segment. Rental-car days grew less than 1% to 18.7 million, and airline ticket sales amounted to just 1.8 million, up 2% from year-ago levels.CEO Glenn Fogel remained pleased with Booking's performance. \"We are off to a strong start in 2018,\" Fogel said, \"with solid top and bottom line results for the first quarter.\" The CEO noted that optimization efforts for Booking's performance marketing helped to boost operating margin figures, and further gains could be possible.Booking Holdings is optimistic about its future. As Fogel pointed out: \"Our brands are making good progress, deploying investments to position us for continued future growth.\"Yet as we've seen countless times in the past, many investors focused on Booking's guidance for the second quarter and drew dire conclusions. Booking said it expects to see room-nights booked pick up 7% to 11% during the second quarter, with gross travel bookings rising 10% to 14%, due largely to a 5-percentage-point tailwind from favorable currency movements. Adjusted net income of $795 million to $825 million should translate to between $16.35 and $17.00 per share, according to the company. That figure is consistent with current projections from investors of $16.71 per share in earnings, but many who saw the numbers seemed disappointed that Booking didn't have even more favorable projections -- despite the fact that it typically ends up outperforming them substantially.Nevertheless, Booking investors reacted negatively to the news, and the stock fell 7% in after-hours trading immediately following the announcement. Slowing growth is a long-term problem that the travel giant will have to address. But those who are  can take advantage of what appears to be a short-term overreaction -- from shareholders who lack enough experience with the company to understand how Booking Holdings handles its guidance.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Earnings increased 22% year over year but declined 29% sequentially.Revenues of $2.93 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.87 billion. Also, revenues were up 4.5% sequentially and 21% from the prior-year quarter.On a year-over-year basis, both the agency and merchant business showed strong momentum.

Booking Holdings has been talking about doing something similar for some time, but now the wait is over. A deal has been struck to purchase experience and activity reservation provider FareHarbor.FareHarbor is a reservation platform for tour guides, rental businesses, event and attraction managers, and other local-activity businesses. While online travel sites like Airbnb and  (NASDAQ: TRIP) allow local businesses to list their activities and enable booking for travelers, FareHarbor goes a step further and acts as a key partner for the local business itself.FareHarbor's software enables booking directly on a company's website, integrating with calendars and other management tools on the back end. FareHarbor also offers website construction and management, a predictive pricing service powered by artificial intelligence to help optimize pricing for an activity, payment processing, and integration with other third-party travel sites (read Booking Holdings competitors).The purchase price for FareHarbor wasn't disclosed, but the small company will continue to operate independently and report directly to Booking Holdings subsidiary Booking.com.Image source: Getty Images.Airbnb, TripAdvisor, and other travel sites have entered the online-booking experiences industry because of its huge potential. Vacations at resorts and poolside hangouts aren't in as high demand as they once were as  are interested in adventures, sightseeing, and other events local to where they are visiting.Travel experiences only account for about 9% of total global travel revenues, according to research group Phocuswright, but it's the fastest-growing segment of the industry. However, much of the experiences industry is still offline. In 2015, only 11% of tour and attraction bookings were made on the internet. That figure is expected to increase to about 20% by 2020.With the exception of restaurant reservation site OpenTable, Booking Holdings' various travel sites do little to capitalize on vacationers' in-destination activities. Management said\u00a0during the  that it was testing services in a few markets, but that it was ready to do more. As it has done before, the company is getting started late but is making a key acquisition of a fast-growing segment leader to play catch-up.In the meantime, competitors have established themselves in the up-and-coming marketplace. TripAdvisor boasts being the online leader in activity booking, and Airbnb's service is apparently finding early success, too. While it will no doubt leverage FareHarbor to get listings on its own sites, what's really interesting about Booking's acquisition is that FareHarbor's software partners and integrates with Booking's competition. Thus, if early movers like TripAdvisor have success growing their activity and experience businesses, it could mean success for Booking Holdings, too. FareHarbor and Booking, though, would own the relationship with the local company.Booking's management said it wants to build a central hub that manages every leg of a vacation. Plane tickets, rental cars, overnight accommodations, and restaurant reservations were all under Booking's umbrella, and now so are activities and experiences. That will certainly help Booking maintain its online travel industry lead and provides a potentially lucrative new project to nurture.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the last reported quarter, the online travel company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.41%.The surprise history has been impressive in Booking Holdings' case. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average four-quarter positive surprise of 10.05%.We observe that shares of Booking Holdings have gained 15.4% in the past 12 months, underperforming the  's 48.5% rally.Booking Holdings generates bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 19/74% in the fourth quarter.In the fourth quarter, agency revenues decreased 41.2% sequentially but increased 19.4% from the year-ago quarter. We expect agency revenues to increase in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by strength across all its platforms.In the to-be-reported quarter, merchant revenues are also expected to grow, driven by strength across agoda.com and rentalcars.com. While agoda.com is likely to benefit from discounting in markets, rentalcars.com is expected to ride on continuous operational improvements.In the fourth quarter, merchant revenues were down 25.7% sequentially but up 15.6% year over year.Also, room night growth is expected to improve in the quarter to be reported, driven by diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from local and international players.In the last reported quarter, room nights volume increased 16.8% on a year-over-year basis. Also, rental car days increased 5.4% and airline tickets were up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter.For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 8-12% and total gross bookings to increase 14.5-18.5% year over year (6-10% on a constant currency basis).

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Booking Holdings is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BKNG in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BKNG, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.22% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

In fact, per a 2015 Gallup poll, one out of five Americans consider that \"moderate\" alcohol consumption is actually a healthy practice. This belief clearly benefits the alcohol industry because moderation for drinkers varies significantly when it comes to alcohol.In this context, earnings of alcohol companies scheduled for release over the next week, assume greater significance. With both brewers, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV  and Ambev S.A.  scheduled to report earnings on May 9, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both AB InBev and Ambev S.A. carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Other major earnings scheduled on the same day include Booking Holdings Inc.  and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.  .The AB InBev stock has declined 19.9% in the last one year, while the Zacks categorized  industry has gained 1.1%. However, Ambev has increased 7.1%, significantly better than competitor AB InBev and the industry.The price-to-sales ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer-focused industry whose fortunes are dictated by the ebb and flow of sales. This ratio indicates the market value of each of the company's sales dollars.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, both are undervalued compared to the wider industry, which has an exorbitant P/S ratio of 19.24. However, Ambev is the pricier of the two, since it has a P/S ratio of 5.59, higher than AB InBev's reading of 2.74.Profitability ratios acquire greater importance in an industry characterized by low margins. Net margin is a good metric to compare the profitability of companies within an industry, since they are bound by the same business constraints.With a net margin value of 14.11%, AB InBev is lower than the industry average of 21.6%. Meanwhile, Ambev, with net margin of 24.77%, is better placed on this count compared to its rival and industry.The debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of the beer industry, it is an indicator of the company's long-term sustainability.Both AB InBev and Ambev have better leverage positions than the industry, which has a debt-to-equity ratio of 61.22%. Coming back to the individual companies, debt-to-equity ratio of AB InBev and Ambev is 1.45% and 10.36%, respectively. Clearly, with a low debt-to-equity ratio this round goes to AB InBev.Since the alcohol industry is essentially characterized by low margins and high volumes, activity ratios are extremely important when determining the health of a company. All activity ratios are geared toward gauging a company's ability to convert various heads under its balance sheet into sales or cash. The asset turnover ratio examines the level of efficiency with which a company utilizes its assets to conduct sales.With an asset turnover ratio of 0.57, Ambev is comfortably placed with respect to the broader industry, whose value for this metric stands at 0.53. In this context, AB InBev has an asset turnover ratio of 0.45, which places it at a disadvantage to both the industry and Ambev.Considered to be a conservative measure of liquidity, the quick ratio gauges as to how liquid the current position of a company is. In other words, it measures the extent to which liquid current assets can service current liabilities. The measure is conservative since it does not take into account current assets that are relatively less liquid such as inventory.With a quick ratio of 0.66, Ambev is better placed than the broader industry, whose value for this metric stands at 0.63. AB InBev is poorly placed on this count since its quick ratio stands at 0.54.While considering  , there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks for the current quarter as both the alcohol giants having readings of 0. However, taking into account a more comprehensive earnings history, Ambev has delivered a negative surprise in only one of the four preceding quarters and has an average negative earnings surprise of 5%. Meanwhile, AB In Bev is at disadvantage, as it has not only delivered negative earnings surprises in three out of the four prior quarters, but also has an average negative earnings surprise of 12.3%.Our comparative analysis shows that AB InBev holds an edge over Ambev when considering valuation ratio and leverage position. But on all other counts Ambev has a clear edge. Not only does it have a relatively better price performance and good earnings history, it is better placed when considering net margin, debt-to-equity, asset turnover and quick ratios. In this context, Ambev clearly holds an edge over AB InBev ahead of earnings.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

Given the Donald Trump administration's commitment to increase defense spending, Arotech could find itself well-positioned to benefit.However, like all hot penny stocks, this play remains speculative. Its revenues for 2017 stood at $98.72 million. Its 2014 revenues were $103.57 million, so this company has struggled with growth. Arotech was founded in 1990, and one of its divisions came into existence in 1971. Hence, the build to these revenues has been slow.The company earned a profit of 17 cents per share in 2017. Still, profits are expected to grow to 18 cents per share in 2018 and 26 cents per share in 2019. This could indicate this company may enjoy some growth. If the company can sustain that growth and speed up its slow growth trajectory, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13 starts to appear very low.Tulsa-based  (NASDAQ:  ) is an upstream oil and natural gas producer. As an exploration and production company, times are great when oil prices are high. However, in an environment of low prices, revenue generation becomes a struggle.Fortunately for MCEP stock, crude oil now trades in the $70-per-barrel range, its highest price since 2014.MCEP stock traded as high as $27 per share in 2013. The oil price slump of 2014-16 hit its interests hard. By 2016, MCEP had become a penny stock, trading as low as 73 cents per share at one point. The stock has struggled to gain traction since then, but now trades in the $1.75-per-share range.However, company financials may have begun a turnaround. Revenue fell from $96.91 million in 2014 to $56.1 million by 2016. Although revenues rose to $58.93 million in 2017, analysts estimate revenues will remain below $60 million for both 2018 and 2019.Whether those estimates factor in higher crude prices remains unclear. And at these levels, investors should still consider MCEP stock speculative. However, the stock remained consistently above $20 per share while oil traded above $100 per barrel. If oil can continue to climb higher, perhaps MCEP stock will return to 2013 levels and become one of the hot penny stocks.Las Vegas-based  (OTCMKTS:  ) is a marijuana industry holding company. Once limited to vaporizers, it has transformed itself into a full-scale marijuana cultivation construction company. While they had operated only in Nevada, the company landed contracts in California and New York earlier this year.Seeing business come in from across the country shows encouraging signs and could make MCIG one of the top marijuana penny stocks. However, financials also remain sparse. The company saw $1.72 million in revenues in 2016. This grew to $4.78 million in fiscal 2017, and the company made $1.53 million in that fiscal year. The company has brought in over $6 million in the first three quarters of 2018.Still, investors should still treat this as a speculative play. The stock enjoys rapidly rising revenues and profits. However, MCIG stock still trades under 25 cents per share, indicating lingering investor doubts. It has never traded above $1, though it briefly reached 92 cents per share in 2014. Still, it will need to see more growth before becoming one of the hot penny stocks.The current price stands well above the 5-cents-per-share level where the stock traded for most of 2016. If the company can continue gaining traction, its current $91 million market cap could rise much higher.Dallas-based  (NASDAQ:  ) has become one of many retailers which have struggled to stay profitable in a changing retail environment. Founded in 1974, the company expanded across the country, operating in 41 states by 2001. During the past few years, the company has been plagued by high turnover in its top management and struggled to remain profitable.Still, the company operates 724 stores across the U.S., which by itself should make it one of the hot penny stocks. Moreover, revenue grew by 10% in its  . Comparable store sales rose by 9.1% in Q1 as well. Investors should also note that the company relocated 58 stores in the last 12 months. At those stores, sales grew by 65%. This latest report held many encouraging signs for the company.However, given that analysts expect net losses for both the current year and the year after, investors should still treat this stock as speculative.Still, a stock price in the $3.30 per share range and a market cap of about $140 million seems low for a company with 724 stores. Traders should also keep in mind that this stock traded at over $22 per share in late 2014. If management can maintain revenue increases and return TUES stock to profitability, those who buy now could enjoy outsized gains from a dramatic comeback.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (Symbol: XLY) where we have detected an approximate $223.3 million dollar outflow -- that's a 1.7% decrease week over week (from 128,203,252 to 126,053,252).

The share price has increased 16-fold over the last 10 years, and it's up over 200% over the last five years. Shares are up 22% this year while the  index has been flat.As more people move to booking travel online, Booking stands to see continued revenue growth, but it could also invite more competition, negatively impacting profit margins. And with the strong price appreciation in the stock, investors may be wondering whether or not it's a buy.Let's take a closer look.Image source: Getty Images.Only 35% of global hotel bookings take place online, according to research from  . Booking's websites account for around 10% of total hotel bookings, Credit Suisse's analysis finds. Still, there are hundreds of billions of dollars in travel bookings taking place through other channels every year, and that's a huge opportunity for Booking Holdings and competitors like  (NASDAQ: EXPE) .As more people book travel online, it's possible a rising tide will lift all boats. The percentage of online bookings is expected to climb to 39% by 2020, growing 28% overall from last year to 2020. Booking is well-positioned to win a large share of that growth with its portfolio of properties in different geographies.Booking.com is one of the largest online travel agencies in the world, with about 1.6 million property listings between hotels and vacation rentals. Its only competitor with greater selection is Expedia, which boasted nearly 2 million total properties on its platforms, including 1.5 million from HomeAway's vacation rental listings.But Booking has a substantial advantage in Europe, where it first started. Unlike the U.S. market, the majority of hotels in Europe are small boutique hotels, which are reliant on online travel agencies like Booking.com to attract customers since they have relatively small marketing budgets. Furthermore, those small budgets mean they're limited in their ability to work with multiple partners, so most hotels will only list their properties on a single online travel agency.That's great for Booking.com, which has strong consumer penetration in Europe. That's evidenced by the Booking.com app's position in the top 10 travel apps in various European countries. Meanwhile, Expedia's app is a lot harder to find on those top 10 lists.Bringing in more traffic creates a virtuous cycle in that it attracts more hoteliers to the platform, creating better selection and reinforcing the platform as the top destination for travelers.Booking exhibits similar strengths in Asia with its Agoda property and its partnerships with  and Meituan-Dianping. Booking.com also has a fairly strong consumer presence in South America, where boutique hotels are also much more popular than chains.The virtuous cycle means Booking is well-positioned to win more than its fair share of the growth in online travel bookings.There's a risk that as more travel spending moves online, Booking could face increased competition. For now, Expedia is its biggest competitor, and the two combine to take about two-thirds of the online hotel bookings market.That level of scale makes it very difficult for a smaller company to make significant headway in the online travel agency space. Online travel agencies require a lot of marketing to attract customers to their websites and they would also need personnel to reach out to hotels to add listings to their platform.With regard to marketing, Booking is far more efficient than the competition while still spending boatloads. It spent $4.5 billion on advertising last year, 36% of revenue. In comparison, Expedia spent nearly the same amount, but it accounted for 43% of its revenue.Only a few existing internet companies have the audience, personnel, and marketing budget to make them capable of competing with Booking. (And they're kind of busy dealing with data privacy concerns at the moment.) Even then, Google's past attempt fell flat after the  company  a couple years ago. Smaller companies that start to find success might just be acquired by Booking or Expedia, as we've seen in the past.Booking Holdings has developed a portfolio of great properties and established a strong competitive advantage, particularly in Europe. It's well-positioned to keep growing revenue and earnings, but investors need to determine whether or not the stock is worth buying at the current price.The stock currently trades for about 24.5 times expected earnings for 2018 and 21.4 times 2019 expected earnings. That's a pretty high multiple, but with a very strong potential for double-digit average revenue growth over the next few years and expanding profit margin, that actually seems like a fair price.By comparison, Expedia currently trades for 23.3 times 2018 earnings expectations and 19.5 times analysts' expectations for 2019. Booking might deserve a slight premium to Expedia due to its competitive advantages with regard to boutique hotel booking.I think investors could do well with either, and Booking could offer better growth over the next few years. For investors looking to capitalize on the secular growth of online travel booking, Booking is still worth buying at its current stock price.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It appears the booming economy under President Trump has created additional opportunities for people to enjoy vacations, and for businesses to pony up for more travel. Let's dig into these numbers and see exactly what's going on with Expedia, and determine if there are enough long-term catalysts for us to consider purchasing EXPE stock.Gross bookings and revenue both increased 15% year-over-year, the former jumping $27.2 billion, and the latter $2.5 billion. I had predicted that HomeAway would be purchased by Expedia. That purchase appears to be paying off handsomely, as bookings grew 46% to just under $4 billion.More and more lodging locations are joining Expedia, with the total now up to 665,000 properties - up a whopping 74%. This included 25,000 new HomeAway listings, bringing the total to 1.6 million.At this point, Expedia group owns a gigantic portfolio of online travel brands: Expedia, Hotels.com, Expedia Partner Solutions, Egencia, Trivago, HomeAway, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif, Lastminute.com.au, ebookers, CheapTickets, Hotwire, Classic Vacations, Expedia Group Media Solutions, CarRentals.comTM, Expedia Local Expert, Expedia CruiseShipCenters, SilverRail Technologies, Inc., ALICE and Traveldoo.It also appears that international travel and bookings are on the rise. Domestic gross bookings increased 10% but international grew 25%, although 40% of that 25% came thanks to foreign exchange impact. Lodging continues to lead the way for EXPE, accounting for almost two-thirds of revenue.All this great news, however, leads to a very depressing conclusion which the market doesn't seem to care about: EXPE only generated $52 million in operating profit, and that's after adding back $167 million in depreciation.The only saving grace here is that the company generates a lot of free cash flow, just short of $1.5 billion for this quarter alone. EXPE stock also carries $4.7 billion of cash and short-term investments.Obviously, the question we want to ask is \"how can revenue growth be so strong and yet the company not make any money?\" The answer lies in expenses, particularly in selling and marketing. While online travel companies are indeed cash cows, because there is very little capex involved in these businesses, the trick to running a business that makes money is keeping expenses in check.To be fair, these online businesses can't always be judged based on their net income. It is the free cash flow that they tend to be valued by. They are very similar to the many online businesses that John Malone's Liberty Media and  (NYSE:  ) hold - inasmuch as the market tends to look at free cash flow and operating income before depreciation and amortization in rendering its valuation judgment.I'm much more excited by Expedia stock generating a $6 billion free cash flow run rate than I am at an annual net loss, for obvious reasons. To that end, EXPE stock trades at 20 times trailing 12 month free cash flow whereas  (NASDAQ:  ) trades 25 times TTM FFC. IAC stock trades at almost 40x.So on that basis, EXPE stock is arguably undervalued. I will say that owning either EXPE stock or Booking Holdings for the very long term probably makes very good sense, as they basically own the market between them at this point.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ: NFLX) has been a stunning performer in the streaming video era.

Tremendous progress has been made in the past few years in the fight against cancer. One of the most promising recent technologies in that fight has been immunotherapy -- training a person's own immune system to fight cancer. It has  in treating some cancers, and research is continuing on ways to increase the type of cancers and patient profiles that it works for.One bold research company, Cue Biopharma, is working to develop an immunotherapy platform to treat a broad range of cancers, not just the tightly targeted types treatable by it today. It's an incredibly audacious goal, but one that, if achieved, could put us much closer to making cancer a much more effectively combated disease.To be perfectly clear, Cue Biopharma's research is still in early stages, and the company is currently hemorrhaging cash as it invests in that research with no revenue to support it. That makes an investment in its shares incredibly risky and highly speculative. After all, it not only needs to develop a platform that actually works, it also needs to be able to take that platform through the costly and time-consuming FDA approval process before it starts to see revenue.That said, if it's successful and can actually develop, gain approval for, and bring to market a platform that can enable broad-scale cancer immunotherapy treatment, its possibilities are astronomical. Cue Biopharma's growth in that scenario could  put Netflix's returns to shame. If you want to beat Netflix at its own high-growth game, you will have to take some risks. On that note, let me introduce you to 8x8, the most exciting little telecom-like company you've never heard of.8x8 sells voice and video communications services built on cloud-computing concepts. The company mostly serves small and medium businesses at this point, but it has started to sniff around a few huge customers in the enterprise category.  . According to CEO Vik Verma, only 10% of the enterprise communications market is served by cloud-based solutions today, leaving the vast majority of a $50 billion annual sales opportunity untapped.Now, 8x8 is hardly the only game in town. Besides a handful of other cloud communications specialists, the big boys of the telecom world also dip their toes into these waters. There are no guarantees that 8x8 will beat all comers and become the undisputed king of internet-based enterprise communications. But you can't win if you don't play, and 8x8 is most definitely in the game.This company has some high-growth chops. Over the last five years, 8x8's revenues have increased by 160%, closely followed by 184% higher share prices. But shares are trading at a mind-boggling 208 times forward earnings estimates and 109 times the company's free cash flows. At these nosebleed levels, it's a volatile ticker that's prone to sudden jumps -- and the occasional crash.So, I'm not 100% sure that 8x8 is a guaranteed long-term winner. All I'm saying is, if the company keeps up the good work for another few years, it could make shareholders very happy indeed.Don't back up your truck to the buying window. This is a lot of speculation and a certain amount of gambling, but that's what it takes to beat Netflix, in my book.Image source: Getty Images. It's hard to bet against Netflix, especially immediately after the streaming video giant just announced another quarter of strong financial performance. Yet Netflix is having to make a transition away from simply being a conduit for delivering other people's content to a willing audience of viewers, spending billions to come up with its own exclusive content instead. That's a smart move for the company, and it could promote long-term growth, but it still requires a big investment and fundamentally changes the nature of the business.By contrast, Booking Holdings has largely been able to stick with its successful business model of offering a wide range of accommodations and other travel services using the internet. Its  reflects the transition the company has made, with consumers seemingly less enthusiastic in the name-your-own-price propositions that made the company's Priceline segment famous and instead highlighting the highly successful Booking.com hotel booking website.Booking Holdings faces its own growth challenges, as rising competition has led some to fear that hurdles to further revenue gains could prove difficult to overcome. Yet through smart acquisitions, Booking Holdings has been able to answer past competitive threats, and the online travel giant has plenty of financial resources to use if future situations arise that warrant quick strategic action. In the long run, online travel has greater growth potential than entertainment, and that should give the smaller Booking Holdings an edge.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Booking Holdings reports first-quarter results after Wednesday's market close.Kelly sees marketplace trends shifting in Booking's favor, as performance marketing headwinds moderate, allowing it to improve what it has to shell out for leads as well as its search profile. Kelly is naturally sticking to his bullish outperform rating. His new price goal implies 16% of upside from here.Image source: Booking Holdings.It's naturally a good sign when an analyst is getting more optimistic ahead of an earnings report. Oppenheimer's Kelly wouldn't be jacking up his price target days before a quarterly release unless he was confident that the market will appreciate the report.He's not alone. Late last week, it was Michael Olson at Piper Jaffray raising his price goal from $2,100 to $2,300. He feels that European stability -- a big deal since  -- will help prop up next week's quarterly numbers. He sees Booking Holdings once again offering up conservative guidance for the current quarter, and he feels that the stock will continue to be a winner even if the guidance winds up being slightly below where his peers are perched with their second-quarter forecasts.Wall Street is holding out for another period of double-digit top-line growth in next week's report. Analysts see revenue rising 18.5% to $2.87 billion. Revenue has risen at a double-digit clip in 11 of the past 12 years, and that one off year still treated investors to a 9% gain. The same analysts see earnings per share rising a mere 8% to $10.67, but keep in mind that Booking Holdings routinely smokes through Wall Street profit targets.Booking Holdings remains a market winner, and another strong quarter should help it take out the all-time highs it hit in mid-March. It has been a master at building up its business as it collects smaller pieces. Consolidation is the name of the game here as Booking Holdings has snapped up meta-search star Kayak, restaurant reservations specialist OpenTable, and several international travel sites.

Actually, that's for our listeners to decide. I hate when people tell me that something is interesting or funny. You set the expectations high. I know. That's ridiculous. A fascinating moment. This may or may not be an interesting clip. This may or may not be to your liking. What I can tell you is at the time of this interview [this is 2000], Jay Walker was the founder of Priceline. By the end of 2000, Jay Walker has left the board, has left Priceline, and Priceline is trading around $1 a share, so they really got whacked. And now, of course, Priceline has been incredibly successful, but this is Priceline founder Jay Walker in 2000 talking about the future of the internet.____ Long-term Priceline shareholder. And these days it's been renamed. Jay Walker is no longer there, but it's Booking Holdings, and it's been a tremendous winner. I'm wondering here, again. Do we have another #Macsandra situation, Mac? If you were to call up Jay Walker, do you think he would join us on one of our podcasts? I'm hoping so! I think he would and for me one of the first questions is please tell me you held your shares. This almost makes me sad, because the company that he described... He's probably doing great by it. Probably so. Well, let's be clear. He has done very well. I don't actually know his holdings, just like I didn't even know Bezos's holdings, really Tom, and that was great. You brought that fact to the show. Mac, how much money does a person need to be happy? You know... You're taking us to a new place. I think what you're saying is Jay Walker could have probably had billions and billions of dollars more than he does, and you're saying that you feel that's deeply sad. I wouldn't say deeply sad. I think that the entrepreneur who had this vision for this company -- that ended up becoming this incredible company, and who predicted the future, at least in part [the information economy and all that] -- I think he should benefit from his creation. And he did very well. In fact, I don't know if you guys have seen it. I saw either a documentary, a clip that goes inside his house. I believe he lives in Connecticut. I'm looking this up. It's the Walker Library of the History of Human Imagination. It is a remarkable structure and a huge library. And Mac is trying to shrink him... No... ... by saying he probably didn't hold his shares. You're saying I don't need to do the Kickstarter campaign. No Kickstarter campaign. Do you guys remember the pictures by Escher of paradoxical mazes? Like you're walking up one staircase and then you flip over? That's the whole design of his Walker Library -- The History of Human Imagination. And it has priceless tomes. Anyway, Jay Walker's doing great, and he's become a cultural preserver. This is a great American. I would like to say, however, that I think the way history has played out has not flowed in the direction of the conclusion from that statement that he made. And I guess I'll associate it with I believe this. I believe that we all underrate how much we love convenience as consumers. Really how lazy we are. So, if you're telling me a truck will come by and drop it at my house or where I can go walk six blocks and get it... Yes, he was all for that part. I'm going to get the truck dropping it off. I think I told John Mackey, who's on our board [the Whole Foods founder] that if Whole Foods provided a service where they would actually place the food in my mouth for me, I would look at the price tag. Oh, my gosh! If they would deliver the meal and they would actually... Tom, you would like to be spoon-fed? Is that the news you're breaking on this show? Yes. It starts that way and it ends that way. We are close to the end. This clip reminds me a bit of something that Jeff Bezos said, and it's another clip, and so I want to revisit just something Bezos said.____ I like what you're doing, Mac. You are almost hyperlinking from the Walker interview to the Bezos interview. You're creating The Great Conversation on this podcast, and you had Bezos speaking to Jay Walker across time... The public messenger. I think Tom was right, earlier, when he said that Walker didn't necessarily nail it. Actually, a lot of the things that we associate with the real world have been replaced with the internet, and Bezos's line about the biggest, best companies of our time being born right then ... that was true. And to Walker's credit, he did say it's not either/ or. I'm sure he was investing in a way that led to him finding a lot of those winners. I will just say, since I'm sitting here on the  podcast the number of these companies that showed up in  or the original Fool Portfolio, David, is incredible. Obviously, there are some misses in there, but to have found the companies that you found and to have held them as long as you have; what are the next two or three of these over the next 15 years? We've talked about that on all the other shows this year, so there's 51 other weeks for you to listen and get that answer, Tom. OK, good. But this week... I want a free stock pick. ... we are living back in the... For Mac Greer. So, we can see if Mac buys it 10 years from now.

Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["When it comes to  (NYSE:  ), there are two key questions. The first is whether any airline stock, not just DAL stock, is worth investing in. This is an industry, after all, that's struggled with fare wars and bankruptcies - including Delta's own Chapter 11 filing in 2005. The second is whether Delta stock is the best pick in the space, as opposed to rivals like  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ).At the moment, the answer to both questions appears to be \"yes.\" There are concerns in the airline industry, among them rising fuel prices and the risk of the broader economy being near a cyclical top. And there is a case to be made for peers, including LUV and international operators like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ).But Delta stock looks awfully cheap - and it does look like the industry finally has got its act together. With travel demand rising steadily, and the near-term outlook strong, there's a solid case for buying DAL stock at these levels.As the old saw goes, \"focus on the downside and the upside will take care of itself.\" And with DAL, as with any airline stock, it's worth keeping in mind that the downside could be substantial.After all, this is an industry that has been a graveyard for shareholder value. Delta, United, and  (NASDAQ:  ) all have gone bankrupt this century. Online travel agencies like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) have led consumers to focus almost solely on price - and made that pricing public and easy to compare. Frequent-flyer programs aside, there's little in the way of a \"moat\" or competitive advantage among the major airlines.No less than Warren Buffett  that \"if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.\" Over time, airlines have tried to fight over revenue - instead of focusing on profits. And so while DAL stock has risen 531% over the past decade, and 265% over the past five years, the obvious risk is that it will all come to an end as soon as the industry loses its discipline.So far, the industry has been sensible when it comes to capacity. But the obvious question is what happens when the economy turns. Delta itself  from  (OTCMKTS:  ) in December. Those jets will be delivered in 2020. But if Delta has that additional capacity, and the economy has turned south, will the company succumb to the temptation to lower prices to attract business and leisure travelers? And if competitors follow suit, will the hard lessons of the past century of commercial airline flight be once again forgotten?But after the past few years, it does seem as if the airline industry finally has learned its lesson. Capacity is rising, admittedly. Delta itself is projecting a 3-4% increase in 2018.That's a manageable level, however. It's enough to keep pricing discipline in place. Indeed, it's enough to  - including DAL.And there are long-term tailwinds (no pun intended) for the industry. People worldwide are moving  . Millennials prioritize  .\" Economic cyclicality aside, the long-term trend for travel demand seems to be moving in the right direction for airlines.And yet, Delta stock isn't pricing in any growth. In fact, it's priced as if it's near a cyclical peak. DAL trades at 8.2x its 2018 EPS guidance. That's a multiple that suggests profits will  over time. In addition, it's one of the cheapest valuations in the industry. UAL trades at about 9x 2018 consensus. LUV is at 11x. Only AAL is in the same range - and it has a much more leveraged balance sheet.It's not hard to see DAL moving to at least a double-digit EPS multiple. Indeed, the average analyst target price suggests about an 11x multiple, to a price of $73 - some 32% upside. That's one of the biggest gaps in the S&P 500, and an indicator of the divide between investor sentiment and the fundamental value of Delta stock.Should the gap narrow, it seems like that DAL will see solid upside. Admittedly, that requires the economy, and the industry, to cooperate. At this point, that seems a likely outcome - and so does a move higher in Delta stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["mong the underlying components of the Russell 3000 index, we saw noteworthy  volume today in Booking Holdings Inc (Symbol: BKNG), where a total of 10,749 contracts have traded so far, representing approximately 1.1 million underlying shares.

However, there is been some credible discussion lately at Morgan Stanley about the possibility of Amazon moving into online travel. Were this to become the case, the question is whether Amazon should reinvent the wheel or whether it should gobble up competitors  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).When you get a look at the valuations involved, however, it becomes very clear very quickly that the buyout option is not viable. BKNG as a valuation of $103 billion, and wouldn't go out without a significant premium. Expedia is valued at $16.5 billion, and while it wouldn't fetch as much of a premium, it would still demand one. It also is not nearly as profitable.AMZN management obviously has significant financial and technological resources at its fingertips. If AMZN stock management wanted to make this happen, it could. I imagine the biggest obstacle would be time.The question is would airlines, hotels, rental cars and other providers want to be able to do business with Amazon? Are there non-compete clauses for example? Not that I think any of that would matter, because I'm sure Amazon would find financial incentives to work around these issues.The net income between Expedia and booking holdings alone is nearly $4 billion annually. Neither of these businesses, practically booking holdings, has a tremendous amount of overhead. The former also has tremendous free cash flow.This is a business Amazon stock owners would love to have a piece of. Not only that, Amazon's brand name, and the now ubiquitous ability to book online travel, gives it an extraordinary market advantage out of the gate. Whereas existing businesses, including those that have been gobbled up by the two industry gorillas, had to slowly build market share in business over time, Amazon could simply sweep right in and likely instantly take over a large share of the market.That's because Amazon's interfaces have always been very easy to use. There's no reason to assume that would change. Not only that, it fits nicely into Amazon's one stop shopping experience, whereas online travel requires individuals to go to specific websites.However, let's remember that Amazon has twice before try to move into this space with Amazon local and Amazon Destinations. Both of these were organic attempts and both of them failed. The reason they failed is not because Amazon is so easy to use, but building and maintaining this kind of platform is actually far more difficult than anyone, including AMZN, realized.That means we have to circle back to the question of an acquisition. A 20% to 30% premium for Expedia would mean an acquisition in the range of $20 billion-$22 billion for Amazon stock management. It is true that revenues did Expedia continue to grow at a robust pace. 2017 operating income was $625 million. Free cash flow was about $1 billion. Expedia has $4.1 billion in cash and investments offset by $3.7 billion in debt.Amazon stock is backed with $31 billion in cash and $24 billion in debt. It generated $6.4 billion of free cash flow last year. So I can't say that an acquisition is a prohibitive. One would think that the deal could contain a substantial amount of cash, some additional debt and perhaps some Amazon stock, and shareholders would be perfectly happy.The advantage of buying the existing platform that allows Amazon to integrate anything else it wants into that platform. Imagine as you are in your shopping cart if Amazon suggests all kinds of travel accessories and supplies that you need for your trip. Thus, Amazon would be able to leverage its retail operation further by integrating it into the Expedia platform.Do I think this is going to happen? I think it's a realistic possibility. As it is, Expedia makes a lot of money, and is a solid operation. I think you could do worse owning Expedia stock, and whether you hold AMZN stock is not going to make much of a difference whether it chooses to buy Expedia.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (Symbol: XLY) where we have detected an approximate $298.6 million dollar inflow -- that's a 2.3% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 126,903,252 to 129,853,252).

An early entrant in the online travel agency model, Booking Holdings and its family of other travel-related sites have helped shape the industry for years. Changing consumer trends are creating the \"sharing economy\" though, and new upstart rivals taking advantage of it could pose a threat.If you have ever used ride hailing services like  or found a place to stay on  , you have taken part in the sharing economy. The idea is simple: If you have underutilized property like a home, bedroom, office space, car, or even clothes, there is likely an app that will allow you to share it with someone else. \"Sharing\" essentially turns possessions into services, allowing owners to make some money when they don't need their possessions and borrowers the opportunity to use an item on-demand without making a big purchase of their own.This isn't a new concept. Humans have been sharing things for millennia. So what's the big deal? The sharing economy has been growing fast as of late, in large part to the tech savvy millennial demographic -- the roughly 80 million people born between the early 1980s and late 1990s. That's a lot of kids; their numbers even outweigh the influential \"Baby Boomer\" generation. Thus, their preferences and decisions are beginning to wield power over the economy, and \"sharing\" is one of the ensuing trends.Image source: Getty Images.Uber and Airbnb aren't even a decade old but already sport valuations in the tens of billions. Booking still maintains a lead with a market cap of $100 billion, but some areas of business have undoubtedly been affected by the sharing economy. For example, rental car days booked, led by the company's Rentalcars.com site, have slowed to meager single-digit growth the last two quarters. Meanwhile, Uber and other ride sharing services have been growing like weeds all over the world and changing how people get around.That being said, Booking has also been positively impacted by sharing. The largest brand in the stable, Booking.com, just announced it crossed five million homes, apartments, and other \"unique places to stay\" listed on its site. That puts it ahead of Airbnb's four million properties at last report and helped Booking grow its room nights booked by 21% in 2017.Booking Holdings is a big company, but it continues to expand at a double-digit pace. It is the global leader in travel and accommodations and has taken steps to embrace the sharing economy and maintain its lead. The company also has a track record of successfully adding related services to its platform, like restaurant reservation management, and is experimenting with travel experience reservations (like tours or visiting museums), similar to what Airbnb launched late last year. Management's idea is to make Booking the central planner for the entire vacation, something it could feasibly patch together with the breadth of its offerings.Booking Holdings has wasted no time embracing changing consumer preferences. Disruptive competitors are growing in size, but as more travelers make use of technology to share assets with each other and experience new things, the company is well positioned to capture their business.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Welcome back to this special edition of  podcast  I mean, I like to think that every week is a special edition, but even if that's true, this is an even more special edition, and I did foreshadow this toward the end of last weeks' time together when I mentioned we wanted to dig back into the annals, the vault of our radio past and pull some clips that now looked at, in the light of day, more than a decade later, might have anything from high insight to low humor associated with them. And so, I had to go back, bring my brother Tom back to the show and our longtime producer Mac Greer... Ageless. Ageless Mac Greer. Not true! And these days, you know Mac, as a host on  , among other things, he does a lot of things around The Motley Fool. But Mac, back then, what was your job? I was a producer. Hired in 1998. We had a live three-hour  radio show every Saturday. Remember? I'd come in and we'd go and have breakfast at La Madeleine, and we'd have what in theory was kind of a planning/prep meeting. And then we'd tape it in a conference room, and it'd get really hot, and we'd open the windows, and you could hear sirens and all that. Sometimes we'd have callers, and sometimes you guys would put me on air and ask me about my book report on Farrah Fawcett. How many times were you fired, Mac? I was fired -- when did that kick in? That kicked in... . Yeah. That was right around  . Kenny was dying at every episode. Every episode. When Kenny was dying. And fired by some famous people. Jesse Jackson fired me. Yes. Which was great. That was probably the high point of my career. In that era. A man who is dedicated to creating jobs out there. Exactly. I'm about to create another one. I'm about to create another one from you. Let's create another one. That's right. So, we did the  show for three years, and then we did the  show for four years. We did the  show from 1998 to 2001, and  from 2002 to 2006. Were we rule breakers back then? In audio? Sure, we were. Were we audio rule breakers? I think... Was the Earth shaking when we were born? I would say so. I think that's probably right. I think we were probably ahead of our time, but sometimes I think we were behind our time and if you're so far behind your time, then maybe you're almost ahead of your time? I like that. Does it come back around? I like that very much. And would you say that the clips that we're going to hear during this show really effectively communicate how rule breakerly we were. I sure hope so. I mean, there were not many national radio shows on  radio or  that would feature Jeff Bezos and then we would have Soupy Sales. That is true. That just didn't happen... Motley. ... in a lot of places. About as motley as it gets. And that really is what we're going to be doing. This time together this week -- this is experimental -- this could be dangerous. What we're going to do is we're going to play clips. Mac, you cued them up. Tom and I don't even know what you've brought to the table, but we're going to go over each one of these. Reflect. Think. We're going to hope to educate, to amuse, and to enrich. Possibly there will be more amuse than a regular episode of  . We'll find out. Lower the bar, please. Given the danger, what sorts of activities should you not be participating in while listening? Tom, this is a question, clearly, that you need to answer of your own. I would say choose the autonomous vehicle. I think that's right. Heavy machinery -- don't operate. It sounds like a good safety thing. I would say don't be outdoors working on cleaning the gutter right now. I think that would be a mistake. That's good. Good, OK. Well, it sounds like we're ready. And you may doze off unexpectedly for a few of these. I sure hope not. All right, so this is called  This is Vol. I. If our  listeners like this show, we will be happy to bring this back from time to time because there is a deep... Am I right, here, Mac? A deep vault of audio gold. I would say there's a deep vault. I would end the sentence there. So, there's a deep, deep vault. There's a vault. And what we have -- pretty much on every show we've done -- is a more business-centric interview with a CEO or business leader... Sure... ... and then we have a celebrity, human-interest interview that was always near and dear to my heart. Spoiler alert. I will say that that may be the part of the show that didn't always work. My reach exceeded my grasp, or it's the other way around. I don't know. You've created memories. That's one way of putting it. I like it. And we're about to create some more. Mac, without further ado, we're going to go with Clip No. 1. What do you have for us? In one of our early shows [this was back in 1999], we had then-new CEO Jeff Bezos of Amazon. Amazon was a very new public company and he's going to talk about what Amazon is and I guess what Amazon isn't.____ So, guys, this is back when I thought of Amazon as Earth's Biggest Bookstore. That's what my mouse pad said. I still have that mouse pad. Yeah. This was early days, wasn't it, Mac? He was mentioning toys. I don't think they'd gotten to many of the other categories, but had broken out of books, music, videos. And I guess when I think about that, Tom, I just think, \"Wow! He fulfilled on the vision that he had right back there in 1999.\" I mean, here he is 19 years later crushing it. I would guess that if we were to interview him, or listen to an interview with Bezos today, he would be saying almost exactly the same thing. Although he's now understood, and that has played out in a way that makes sense to everyone, rather than being predictive... That's right... ... as it was back then. But the principles have remained the same for Amazon all the way through. It's amazing! It is amazing. Each individual customer, he said, at the center of the universe. Now only one of us purchased Amazon and held it all the way through at this table. It's true. It's only one of us. In fact, I've taken a single action on Amazon in my life. I shorted it in CAPS and made 20%. That's it. It is the worst thing. Buffett said this about Bezos, and Amazon, as well. It is the worst oversight of my investment career. It literally lives up to so many of the principles that I have as an investor that I learned from David, and I learned from our dad, and there it is. And Mac, at least you purchased Amazon along with Dave a couple of years ago. A couple of years ago. Are you a shareholder? I remember. Even though we interviewed Bezos three or four times in the late '90s -- we interviewed him in 2002 -- that was the last time we interviewed him. But I never even came close to buying Amazon, because I was conventional wisdom personified, and the knock on Amazon is they're never going to make a profit. It's probably hard for people to remember this, but back in the '90s, the question wasn't like, \"How big was Amazon's profit going to be or not be?\" The question was, \"Is Amazon going to survive? Will Amazon be a going concern?\" There was no definitive consensus. They used a lot of debt. Right. And some people thought they weren't going to make it. It's so hard to wrap your head around that idea, and I was in that camp. I had  , and the line on eBay was it's got a lighter business model, and everyone was the eBay of something, and I'm like, \"Why would you buy Amazon when you could own eBay?\" Well, and don't kick yourself too much, Mac, because... Let us kick you. We couldn't actually know or understand that there would even be something called a cloud one day, or that Amazon would go that direction. There's no way to connect the dots to 2018 from that interview or from what we were all thinking looking forward, then.One thing we could do, I guess, is say this is a visionary guy. This guy is ambitious, and he's creating a great company. We could definitely have said that, but it's only increasingly true of investing today, isn't it, that we really don't know where the next technology is coming from and how things are going to morph. But you've got to be ready for it. So, how did you know, then? Because there was a  article in the last two years that said, \"Yeah, Amazon. Well, no one bought it and held all the way through.\" And it was like, \"Well, actually, funny...\" Well, I don't read  so maybe it's nobody who reads  Possibly. OK, kick them down. But what is it that caused you... And you could just say, \"It's my principle of finding something great and just holding it indefinitely,\" or you could say, \"I was reaffirmed by this or that.\" What were one or two of the things that caused you to hold this all these years? I think it goes right to  and then we should probably go to Clip No. 2. Briefly, Tom [and you know this already], but basically what you were buying, there, was you were buying a top dog and first mover in an important, emerging industry. The important, emerging industry was e-commerce, and you definitely had the company that was out front. And it's not easy to get a company to be public and get out front of something that big and be that young. They went public very quickly as a company. They did. Sub billion. Sub $1 billion. Sub $1 billion, yes, and relatively early in their life as an entity. Exactly. Because their growth rates were so rapid on the top line. Yeah. So, does anyone here at the table [I know we've got so many other clips]. Does anyone here at the table know what percentage of Amazon Jeff Bezos owned when they went public? I like the long sigh. Long sigh. I'm going to go with 23%. I'm going 50%. The answer is 41%. All right, good. So, wisdom of the crowds. Twenty-three plus 50 divided by two and you get close. So, there may be a few factors that all match up with some rule breaker principles of yours which is a young, dynamic visionary founder who owns a very large stake getting out ahead of a major trend. You ride along. Some of them won't succeed, but the ones that do could likely succeed so fantastically that mathematically you get ridiculously great returns. You bet. Mac, thank you! That was a great clip. What's No. 2? What have you got for us? OK, with No. 2 I want to go to another Amazon clip, because it's interesting. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, as we know in the early years. Amazon sold off sharply a number of times, including the year 2000, so this is Jeff Bezos talking in a 2000 interview we did about the market sell-off.____ Wow! So, Mac, that was late 2000, right? Yup! Because having held the stock from when we bought it for The Fool Portfolio [back then our free portfolio at  ], at $3.21, it hit a high in 2000 three years later of $95 and that's kind of what he's speaking to. He said it's down three-quarters from that point. So, we watched it go from $3 to $95 and then it touched down as low as $7 about a year after that interview. And the rest is history. It's gone more up and to the right as Jeff mentioned since then. Here are the first few sentences of Amazon's letter to shareholders that year. Awesome! Tom, are you bringing some research to this podcast? \"To our shareholders.\" I have some data, too. \"To our shareholders. Ouch! It's been a brutal year for many in the capital markets and certainly for Amazon.com shareholders. As of this writing, our shares are down more than 80% from when I wrote to you last year. Nevertheless, by almost any measure, Amazon.com, the company, is in a stronger position now than at any time in its past.\" So, you have humility, tough year, optimism, belief in the future... Long term... And long term... Exactly. Mac, I'm going to put you on the spot with a little bit of data. What do you think Amazon's sales growth rate has been since that time, and what do you think their stock has returned? Oh, gosh! Since they came public? The stock has returned a lot, and the sales... So wrong! Let's see. Oh, shoot. 20%? I don't know. OK, that's good! The answer is Amazon's sales have grown 43% a year since they came public... In 1997... ... and their stock has returned 36% a year. And it really is just a lesson for all of us as investors that over long periods of time sales growth is a pretty important indicator for creating value, and Amazon has had it in spades. That is astonishing, Tom. Awesome research! I didn't realize. 43% annualized sales growth over 21 years? Yes. Insane! And 36% investment returns. Actually, we'll do this for another  podcast, but you look at companies like Netflix. They're doing the same thing -- 35% sales growth, 45% investment returns growth since they came public. So, sales is a very good indicator of value creation if you're looking out 10 to 20 years. Before we move on, Mac, I'm assuming we're about to say goodbye to Jeff Bezos on this week's podcast. We are. We're moving to stranger places. To Netflix. To the aforementioned Netflix. OK, well not that strange. Nice. But when was the last time you booked Jeff Bezos for The Motley Fool? Yeah! I love the clips from 18 years ago. Where's Bezos been at  since? If you can't get him on the  podcast in the next six months, Mac, you're fired! That's good. He's a tough catch, and in defense, he was on 16 years ago in January of 2002. So, you know, 16-plus. Nice. OK. So, it hasn't been 18 years. So, really, once they started taking off as a stock again, they didn't take Mac's calls. And the same is true for Reed Hastings. We had Reed, and... Ah! I sense a transition line, because we're about to hit the next clip. That's true. CEO Reed Hastings. Netflix? Is that what you have for us? Correct, yes. This is from 2003. They are a new public company and he is talking about his goals for the future.____ For those of you scoring at home, Netflix, U.S. households. Do you want to ballpark the penetration these days? It's higher than 5%. I would say they're 110 million households and I'm going to say they have 40 million U.S. subscribers. Ish. Yeah. That's good. It's around 50%, I think. Around 50%. And then the last stat I saw for globally is 118 million subscribers. Awesome! Now why did you bring that clip? Because I thought you all would have something to say about it. [Laughs] Good. All right, yeah. Let's go with what an incredible stock that has been. I mean, the similarities, as Tom was already drawing to Amazon, are interesting. I mean, obviously they are different businesses although, if you think about who's competing in streaming with original content right now, they feel like one and two. HBO should be included in that mix, but it's fascinating to think that those two companies, and those clips from so long ago [where we bought the stocks, got our members in and have just held all the way through], which is maybe one of the most important points we'll make on this week's podcast, should never be forgotten. At our last Motley Fool gathering in San Francisco, I had the opportunity to interview Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn, who's been a Motley Fool follower for 20 years, now. I asked him whether he thought Netflix was going to be larger than  (NYSE: DIS) , because I think we, around the table, all agree that we think it will be. I think it will be. And he said, \"Absolutely, yes!\"And one of my big takeaways as an investor [because Jeff is a very active investor in his life] is that we should spend a certain amount of our investment time [research and capital allocation] to companies that we think could have hundreds of millions of paying customers or billions of users, given that we are connected like never before in history.It's maybe a factor that we underrate, Jeff said to me. The worldwide population, he said. And the company that stands out there for me, looking forward, is Netflix. I think Netflix, Jeff said, could have an unbelievable number of subscribers 10 years from now. Do you think you're discounting Disney, though? I mean, I've been wrong about Netflix for a long time. I own Netflix, now, but at the time of this clip, Netflix was DVDs by mail. Listen, Disney is a great company. And I thought, \"This is like Columbia House.\" It felt Columbia House. You get a few free DVDs. Yeah, whatever. A perfectly good Blockbuster down the street. Yes, it seemed very fringe. Very fringe. Not going to happen. And then obviously they made the transition. You remember Reed Hastings in that interview -- maybe that interview or another interview -- told us he felt that Netflix aspired and could become the largest media company in the world, which seemed outrageous back then, and it's playing out now, and I don't have anything negative to say about Disney. It's just that they have so many other assets to manage and a lot of physical assets to manage that take time and don't have the same sort of growth rates. Netflix is all digital. So much original programming. Very high margin model where they're able to reinvest their cash flow.So, I think Netflix is going to be larger than Disney and when they get there, I don't think they're going to turn back. I think Netflix will be a larger company than Disney 10 years from now. I love them all, but... And you've made money on them all. One thing that I'm wondering, Mac, is whether you're kind of a Modern-Day Cassandra, now. Cassandra, as you may remember from Greek myth... Is this research? You brought research in? I think you all know this. We're all part of... Were you prepared to bring this out on Mac? We're educated people. You were like, \"I'm waiting for this moment to call him a Modern-Day Cassandra.\" No, this is really not about Mac. No, this is mainly me just getting to talk briefly about Greek myth. OK, I believe you. We'll remember Cassandra. She was the one who was cursed to make the right prediction but no one would believe her. And I feel like maybe, Mac, you are a Modern-Day Cassandra. You are cursed to book CEOs who are so successful after you book them that they won't answer our calls, anymore, or come on our shows. I like that. I like that. That looks good. Is that fair? Is that a compliment? Macsandra? Are we just taking off on the quality of the deep vault right now? Because we've got Bezos and Hastings. I can't wait to hear what's coming next. Oh, it's a lot deeper down there. It must be just one unbelievable visionary CEO winner after another. Yeah. Where do we go now? There are more, but you know what? We're going to save some of those for the next installment some months hence when we do this again. OK, yes. We can't fire it all right now, but great. Mac, you gave us some Bezos. Some Hastings. What have you got next? A wise man once told me happiness equals reality divided by expectations. Ah! Yes. Good. Thank you! Good math. Next up, let's pivot to Jay Walker. This is an interesting clip. Actually, that's for our listeners to decide. I hate when people tell me that something is interesting or funny. You set the expectations high. I know. That's ridiculous. A fascinating moment. This may or may not be an interesting clip. This may or may not be to your liking. What I can tell you is at the time of this interview [this is 2000], Jay Walker was the founder of Priceline. By the end of 2000, Jay Walker has left the board, has left Priceline, and Priceline is trading around $1 a share, so they really got whacked. And now, of course, Priceline has been incredibly successful, but this is Priceline founder Jay Walker in 2000 talking about the future of the internet.____ Long-term Priceline shareholder. And these days it's been renamed. Jay Walker is no longer there, but it's Booking Holdings, and it's been a tremendous winner. I'm wondering here, again. Do we have another #Macsandra situation, Mac? If you were to call up Jay Walker, do you think he would join us on one of our podcasts? I'm hoping so! I think he would and for me one of the first questions is please tell me you held your shares. This almost makes me sad, because the company that he described... He's probably doing great by it. Probably so. Well, let's be clear. He has done very well. I don't actually know his holdings, just like I didn't even know Bezos's holdings, really Tom, and that was great. You brought that fact to the show. Mac, how much money does a person need to be happy? You know... You're taking us to a new place. I think what you're saying is Jay Walker could have probably had billions and billions of dollars more than he does, and you're saying that you feel that's deeply sad. I wouldn't say deeply sad. I think that the entrepreneur who had this vision for this company -- that ended up becoming this incredible company, and who predicted the future, at least in part [the information economy and all that] -- I think he should benefit from his creation. And he did very well. In fact, I don't know if you guys have seen it. I saw either a documentary, a clip that goes inside his house. I believe he lives in Connecticut. I'm looking this up. It's the Walker Library of the History of Human Imagination. It is a remarkable structure and a huge library. And Mac is trying to shrink him... No... ... by saying he probably didn't hold his shares. You're saying I don't need to do the Kickstarter campaign. No Kickstarter campaign. Do you guys remember the pictures by Escher of paradoxical mazes? Like you're walking up one staircase and then you flip over? That's the whole design of his Walker Library -- The History of Human Imagination. And it has priceless tomes. Anyway, Jay Walker's doing great, and he's become a cultural preserver. This is a great American. I would like to say, however, that I think the way history has played out has not flowed in the direction of the conclusion from that statement that he made. And I guess I'll associate it with I believe this. I believe that we all underrate how much we love convenience as consumers. Really how lazy we are. So, if you're telling me a truck will come by and drop it at my house or where I can go walk six blocks and get it... Yes, he was all for that part. I'm going to get the truck dropping it off. I think I told John Mackey, who's on our board [the Whole Foods founder] that if Whole Foods provided a service where they would actually place the food in my mouth for me, I would look at the price tag. Oh, my gosh! If they would deliver the meal and they would actually... Tom, you would like to be spoon-fed? Is that the news you're breaking on this show? Yes. It starts that way and it ends that way. We are close to the end. This clip reminds me a bit of something that Jeff Bezos said, and it's another clip, and so I want to revisit just something Bezos said.____ I like what you're doing, Mac. You are almost hyperlinking from the Walker interview to the Bezos interview. You're creating The Great Conversation on this podcast, and you had Bezos speaking to Jay Walker across time... The public messenger. I think Tom was right, earlier, when he said that Walker didn't necessarily nail it. Actually, a lot of the things that we associate with the real world have been replaced with the internet, and Bezos's line about the biggest, best companies of our time being born right then ... that was true. And to Walker's credit, he did say it's not either/ or. I'm sure he was investing in a way that led to him finding a lot of those winners. I will just say, since I'm sitting here on the  podcast the number of these companies that showed up in  or the original Fool Portfolio, David, is incredible. Obviously, there are some misses in there, but to have found the companies that you found and to have held them as long as you have; what are the next two or three of these over the next 15 years? We've talked about that on all the other shows this year, so there's 51 other weeks for you to listen and get that answer, Tom. OK, good. But this week... I want a free stock pick. ... we are living back in the... For Mac Greer. So, we can see if Mac buys it 10 years from now. Got it. Mac, when we talked about this show ahead of time, you said, \"We're going to start with a meatier course.\" Right. \"Then we're going to go with a palate cleanser.\" Right, and that's where we are now. OK, and then maybe to... Fruity. To light dessert or something crazy. You guys need a pill. Lighten it up.[...] I am excited, Mac, because I've just cleansed my palate. Where are we headed next? Well, we are going to lighten it up here, a bit. Well, not lighten, but love and money. Big topic and one of our favorite guests over the years. I know where we're going. You know where we're going. Every Valentine's show. I'd like to guess where we're going. I could perform this statement, now, I think. I think you could. Dr. Ruth would join us... Bear market. ... every Valentine's Day. For people who don't know, Dr. Ruth was a longtime and is still a sex therapist and can talk about love and relationships. Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Yup, and we asked her about money. This was from a 2000 interview.____ OK, that is one of, I think, our classic clips. Mac, that was pretty awesome. What I love about that is that Dr. Ruth did not even hesitate, as I asked her... She doubled down. She doubled down. ... can you have good sex in a bear market? Yes! And then yes again. Yes, again! I wonder what's in Dr. Ruth's investment portfolio. I'm not sure we'll ever know. I have a feeling she's a seer. I have a feeling she's a seer across a number of industries. Yeah, I think that's probably right. We asked her about it at one point. I remember she was pretty conservative. She did not like to lose money. I remember that part. She wasn't willing to risk going through a bear market. Yeah, I think that's right. Now Mac, was she our most frequent guest on the  back in the day? She was up there. I think Jack Bogle was probably No. 1. Excellent. Who was somebody who came on never to be heard from again? Elvira. Who's an example of the least frequent? Well, we had a number of quits. It was brief and end to end. We had Stephanie Powers. We had Soupy Sales. We had a number of one and done. Kirk Douglas? But was Dr. Ruth an easy book? Like would you call her and she was like, \"Yes, Mac! Let's go!\" Yes, she was great. I mean, Jeff Bezos was an easy book for a couple of years, there. Yeah. He got the word out about Amazon. We've talked about #Macsandra, a developing, trending hashtag right now on Twitter. Hey, I mean a lot of the stuff... In fact, a lot of the stuff that he said holds up, still, so we've got that 2002 interview. Yeah. Are you afraid of Soupy Sales? Soupy Sales, one and done. When I tried to book Soupy Sales [and I was successful]... Will we be running a Soupy Sales clip? No, we won't. No. That will be for  , Vol. II. Can I share what I remember from that that I loved? Yes, and we should explain for people... Soupy had the most popular children's show and it was back with three channels, so that means millions and millions of children watching Soupy Sales. And he gave the advice to go into your dad's wallet and described what it looked like. Or go into your mom's purse... Mommy's purse... ... and look for anything green, and put it in an envelope, and send it to Soupy Sales... Send it to Soupy! At NBC Networks, yada yada, New York, NY. And he got fired for it. Yeah, because... It was like $1 million in ones was sent in. Thousands and thousands of dollars started pouring in. And then he got his job back. He was just joking. He did get his job back. Do you remember the popular dance of that show? Was it the chicken? No. It was the... You know it really, Mac. Are you pretending? No, I'm not pretending. Do you remember it? No. Help me! The mouse! The mouse! No, I don't remember that. Mac, anything more you want to say about Dr. Ruth? So, she is timeless and someone else who is timeless and we're celebrating this year the 50th anniversary of his show. There's a documentary this summer coming out about him. Oh, and it looks like it's going to be great. And there's a movie with Tom Hanks. I don't know why... Plain. ... you would have a movie playing this guy. That's saturation. Presbyterian minister. I think Tom Hanks would play you in  , Mac. That's OK, but Tom Hanks should not play Mr. Rogers, because there's only one Mr. Rogers, and I think that's sacrilege for anyone to play Mr. Rogers. I'm so glad you brought the Fred Rogers clip. Which one do you have? He's so quotable, Mac. Can we roll it? This is from 2002. We've got two clips we're going to share. And this is in the wake of Enron and a number of corporate scandals, and that sets up this question.____ I remember Buffett was asked about Ken Lay or Enron and things that had gone wrong in companies and he said, \"I think that they lack gratitude, because they had far more than they needed, and they weren't thankful enough for it.\" That seems to integrate nicely with Mr. Rogers' comments. And I don't want to make light of this, because that's such a beautiful expression, but it does convince me that we could probably lower your pay this year, Mac. Now, why is that? Because it's you I like. It's not the things you have. It's not the clothes you wear. Well, to your point... It's not the car you drive, Mac. It's your hair! It's you I like. It's that you have hair. I'm not focused on monetary compensation. Is that true? I'm just grateful. I'm grateful! I'm all about gratitude! One of the fun things in life -- and I wouldn't say in any significant way -- but Rick Engdahl behind the glass working on the  podcast is driven a little bit more by capital. So, would you be willing to share some of your resources with Rick? Absolutely! Absolutely! OK, good! So, that's Venmo.com. This segment of  is brought to you by Venmo. Let's make it happen. Tom, I'm really pushing for you. Did you hear your voice as we let in? Yes, I think I weigh more, now. I'm just guessing that I put on some weight this evening. My question -- we can live this rhetorical -- but who knew Tom was slurring drunk? Was I drunk then? Really? It sounded drunk? Just the start of that clip, Rick. Just that one more time. OK, that's good. I think it's fair. I mean, inquiring minds. Drunk? OK.____ You just caught it right there. I think we heard all we need to hear. [Laughs] Yes, I guess maybe it was a night on the town the night before. Well, it was Enron. It was a tough time for all of us. It was hard times. Yeah. And that's why it was so great, Mac, that you brought Fred Rogers to the microphone on the  . That is such a classic. I mean, obviously that was one of his poems, I'm assuming. I'm pretty sure that wasn't off the cuff, but if it was he's even more of a genius than I thought.But I'll say this. That serves as a wonderful trailer for this summer's Fred Rogers documentary. Absolutely. If you haven't already watched that trailer online... It's incredible. ... bring a handkerchief with you as you watch the two minutes that is up there, because it's beautiful. I can't believe I got drunk before interviewing... Fred Rogers. I mean that is... Oh, the legend grows. ... childhood. Everything. I'm not going to judge. Now, Mac, you said there's another Fred Rogers. There is another Fred Rogers clip. This clip is on our show. I think it's fair to say we were not afraid to ask the tough questions or let me rephrase that. To ask questions that other people weren't asking... be they tough or not. So, this is one of those questions for Mr. Rogers.____ All right. I mean, yeah! I mean, I feel bad doing this. Where are you... Could we go back to David asking the questions, because... when he said persona, he sounded drunk to me. Sounded drunk.____ All right. I may be... You were so honest there... I may be. Maybe. A glass of wine. Now, I want to make it clear. Since  -- we take pride in this and I mentioned this before on the podcast -- has a clean lyrics stamp... Mm-hmm... ... on iTunes... Yes, there is no drinking. ... I want everybody to know that we did not drink in or on the shows. This is a mere joke, I thought. I thought you were saying we had to bleep out one or two things that Fred Rogers said. Absolutely not! But he's sure not bad either. As you can see, he was going in a direction that needed... Did you notice he said, \"What you see is what you get.\" That's what his wife said about him. And I think we all know the acronym for that is WYSIWYG. And to think that  ripped that off as badly as they did and never paid Fred Rogers a dime for WYSIWYG. Shocker! And now you're attacking Microsoft. Good point. But it's true. He was... If Microsoft's legal department is listening, that was David Gardner. I don't recall Gates or Ballmer ever joining us on the  , so open season, right? I'm just glad he was who he appeared to be. If you don't show up on the  podcast, your company is at risk. I'll say this. I love my Xbox. What's our next clip? Our next clip is one of my favorite interviews that we've done. She was probably one of the first country music superstars... One of my favorite interviews... ... Loretta Lynn, and we're going to play a clip, here, where we had asked her. You're not going to hear the question, but we'd basically asked her if she could have ever imagined, as a coal miner's daughter growing up poor, if she could ever imagine the success she had.____ One of the great country music couples, Loretta Lynn and Johnny Cash. Just kidding. I love that movie. I thought that was a great movie,  And it was great. No, Loretta Lynn. Also, I remember that she said in that interview... I remember that she said in that interview... We were asking about her investing and what money meant to her in life, and it was something along the lines of like, \"If there is a haystack I can lay down in...\" Yup. \"If I got a small meal on the table...\" Warm bed, hot meal. \"And the people I love are right there, that's all I need.\" That's it. Yeah. She was incredible. Easy to book, Mac. Was what it like? You know the metagame. The behind the scenes for so many of these. Just the talent. Just how much of the value were you creating? Was this easy? I don't remember that one, but I really enjoyed that interview. I think I earned my keep for that one interview. But this is all just a reminder of... I'm going to say it again, guys. The motley. ... a deep vault of audio gold that we will be mining on behalf of our listeners at various points in the coming months and years. Who owns the IP? Is that Mac's? The vault? Does Mac own the IP of all our radio? Are there contracts we signed? I think that... The Motley Fool. We own it. We own it all collectively. Just checking. Just checking if Mac had worked something behind the scenes over the years. Mac, what do you have for us next? In fact, how many more do we have, here? Three more clips. Another company that... Well, it didn't turn out too well. Planet Hollywood. And we had Ben Stein on the show several times... Oh, yeah! Star of  . And  . Exactly. And we asked Ben Stein about Planet Hollywood.____ That is just too great. It's not sometimes the interview itself. It's the stuff that happens around the interview. Yeah. Always winning. Ben Stein. A graduate of Yale Law School. He was the valedictorian of his class, and he also won an Emmy for  . This is a very accomplished gentleman. Ben, these days, is clocking in at about 73 years old. I'm sure hearty and healthy, I sure hope. He was a fun, return, repeat guest on the  . I'm thinking maybe Ben's another guy we should have back. He's a Fool. Yes, indeed.[...] So, yeah, I started in 1998, and in 1999 on our then  radio show we interviewed what I would call a successful... This is like Luis Tiant. Line of sight. ... successful real estate developer who... Very active in Manhattan. Becoming more of a television personality. I have to add that I had literally forgot that we had interviewed this particular person. We had. I'm so glad you went deep! I did go deep... ... into the wide and deep vault of audio gold. And there's a backstory to our then interview with Donald Trump and it was that the stock was a short, correct? Indeed, yes. And it's something that I've covered before on this podcast and \"I Own the Water.\" You can go back and google it. It's probably one of my more enjoyable episodes to put together where I told the story of us shorting the Donald. But Mac, I truly had forgotten that we had him on the radio show a year or two later. I had, too. I think we had John McCain on a number of times... We did. ... and it would be an incredible  podcast later this summer to have the president and Senator McCain on. At the same time. Dick Cheney. That would be a doozy. And Elvira. And Elvira. The Mistress of the Dark definitely made multiple  appearances. She did make a number of appearances. I mean, that is going to be coming, probably,  , Vol. II. I think I recall that she was an incredibly shrewd businessperson. Yes. Nice. She knew what she was doing all the way through in a beautiful, very Foolish and fun way. She bought the rights to that character. I can't believe that that wasn't part of today's. That just shows how much there is. I'm disappointed in myself. Nah! But I appreciate your gratitude. Actually, half an hour before we taped Mac said, \"Guys, I've got it down to 26 clips. I know we need to get it down to about half that.\" He was crying. By the way, he was crying when he said that. It's tough. His glasses were at an angle. He put in a lot of time. He really has, and we appreciate that, Mac. Which kid do you love the most? All right, so let's hear the clip. So, this is our interview with Donald Trump from 1999.____ And that... And that is a pretty great clip. In fact, Tom, I wanted to bring that one out just briefly to celebrate because Tom, you are turning 50 this week. Five zero. You're keeping it really low profile, and this is just a small thing on this podcast, but I asked Mac to go back and grab a fun Tom Gardner clip and you've got our president talking about Ivanka. But seriously, thank you for not just being 50 years a great brother... I'm glad I was born. I'm glad I was born. ... but in this week's context, thank you for being such a wonderful co-host for all those years and, of course, co-partner in our business today. How many years of radio programming did we do, Mac? Seven. Yeah, seven. Three on  , and four on  . So, if you do the math... Then we had the  Special together... Three hundred a show. ... that we worked on. The moneymaking, life-changing special. What, in your opinion, was the single lowest moment for us as a team? Like what did we get through? Tough times. Hard times. We're on the road somewhere. The right way to answer this is, guys, I can't talk about the lowest, but I'll talk about the 37th lowest moment. Yeah. We had some... Tough times. ... shows and interviews that didn't always work. There was some brotherly discord. There was some discord with your producer. There were times where David and I would be arguing. I remember this... It's true. ... and one of us would just go silent for like seven minutes on the show. And it was a live show. I mean, you know. You're there with your brother. Yeah. That's right. It's true. You're working through things. You betcha. It's true. 25 years. But we just had Dan Heath speak here, and he talked about the concept of peak moments and that's really what you hold onto. And that's what I hold onto. When you think of all these interviews, then I forget that we ever interviewed Kenny Baker or Verne Troyer. Stephanie Powers. Oh, Stephanie Powers. We had peak moments. Oh, Stephanie Powers. Totally forgotten. These will come back. My dear listeners, if you've enjoyed this week's zany show, please know that this was  , Vol. I. If you want to request at some point -- maybe late this summer -- guys, bring out Vol. II. And if you really want it to be a couple of years from now, we'd also understand. Let us know.  or you can talk about it in this month's mailbag. This has been a long show, but it's been a long and lovely show, and I want to thank most of all Mac Greer, who dived in, went through hours of clips to come... Clips of all these people. To say nothing of the shows, themselves. Produce the show. But just the work he put in the last two weeks to make this possible. Mac, thank you very much! And Tom Gardner, my brother, happy 50th birthday this upcoming week! Respect! You rock, and it was so much fun to do this with you. Great stuff. Thank you, David! Thank you! Thank you, Mac! That closes out this week's show. Next week I'm going to either and/ or review five stocks picked on this show a year or two ago, and/ or pick five new ones as a sampler coming to  next week. In the meantime, thanks for joining with us. Fool on!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["pparently, it's renaming and rebranding time at the top of the online travel agency (OTA) industry. Last month one of the major ones unveiled a new name,  (NASDAQ: EXPE) , complete with fresh branding. This came very shortly after its No. 1 rival, Priceline Group, spun its own cocoon and emerged as a butterfly named  (NASDAQ: BKNG) .Big companies don't undertake renaming/rebranding campaigns lightly. Booking Holdings' justifications for doing so  ; here's a look at why Expedia Group took the plunge.Image source: Expedia Group.Expedia Group's decision to add an extra word to its name was made, it said, \"to better reflect its identity as a leading global technology company.\"\"At the same time, the changes acknowledge the unique contribution of each individual Expedia Group brand and business to the success of the overall organization,\" the company added.With the new name comes a fresh new logo (above). This change was probably more necessary than the new moniker, as Expedia's previous blue-and-yellow branding looked like a refugee from the 1990s.These modifications seem largely cosmetic, but like any rebranding/renaming project, there are deeper currents at work. Expedia Group has broadened its businesses over time, reducing its dependence on core, traditional travel services like flight ticket and hotel room brokering.For the company, the do-it-yourself, or DIY, accommodation segment -- which exploded only recently -- is growing dramatically in importance (even if it's still relatively small). These days the HomeAway DIY unit is  hot segment for the company, with its gross bookings  in the fourth quarter. That well outpaced the growth figure for the core OTA segment, which improved by 10%.Expedia Group's new name implies a collection of related assets like HomeAway and the core traditional Expedia flights-and-hotel site, rather than a narrowly focused operation.Also, I think it's important for OTAs to appear as solid and dependable as possible. Travelers are generally looking for the best deals on sites that can reliably provide the services they need; there isn't a lot of brand loyalty in this game.The Expedia Group name conveys that there's a suite of offerings such a customer would require (I'd say the same for Booking Holdings). Meanwhile, the company's new branding -- to me, anyway -- implies solidity, comfort, and reliability.Ultimately, what's likely driving this want/need to refresh and repackage is intensifying competition. The broader travel market continues to grow -- global digital travel sales are poised to rise by over 10% this year, according to researcher eMarketer -- and everyone wants a bigger piece of it.Although there are certain differences, at heart all OTAs broadly offer the same services. That's why marketing is so critical in the industry. And with the increase in business, there's more of a need to get noticed.Across the board, marketing expenses are rising notably; in Q4, Expedia Group saw its own advance 16%, against only an 11% increase in revenue. Booking Holdings' last quarter as Priceline Group featured a 15% expansion in total marketing/advertising outlay, although this was  of 18%.Marketing is all about perception, and brand name/identity is a big part of this. Booking Holdings and Expedia Group now have new looks and (somewhat) new names, which will be hammered home with that increased spending. It'll be interesting to see how this will affect their respective businesses.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Expedia wasn't one of them!

The temptation to sell when things take a turn for the worse can be overwhelming. But it's the holding, not the buying or selling, that creates wealth. That's why it's so important to have a long-term perspective.Of course, holding on to the wrong stock for decades can be disastrous, so it's critical that you're picky about your long-term investments.

The world has slowly started turning away from fossil fuels over the past decade, driven in part by growing climate change fears. Those concerns, along with falling costs, will likely spark continued investment in renewables over the next couple of decades, making clean power-focused companies ideal options for those investing with a long-term time horizon. While several renewable options are worth considering, Brookfield Renewable Partners is among the best.For starters, Brookfield's parent company has been in the power business for over 100 years and has built one of the largest renewable portfolios in the world. That company formed Brookfield Renewable Partners in 2012 to grow the platform, which it has done via a steady stream of  . While Brookfield Renewable's focus is on hydropower, which is among the largest portfolios in the world, the company has expanded into wind, solar, and energy storage in recent years.That diversified platform provides Brookfield Renewable with multiple avenues to drive future growth. In the near term, the company's focus is on building additional hydro and wind generating facilities, primarily in Brazil and Europe. These expansions, along with the embedded upside of its current power contracts, position the company to deliver 6% to 11% annual cash flow growth for the foreseeable future. Add in the upside from acquisitions across the renewable energy spectrum, and Brookfield Renewable is an ideal investment vehicle for investors seeking an anchor holding to profit from the world's slow pivot toward a cleaner tomorrow. Under Warren Buffett's leadership over the past five decades, Berkshire Hathaway has transformed from a failing textile manufacturer into a conglomerate valued at nearly $500 billion. The stock has returned 20.9% annually since 1965, trouncing the  by a factor of two and making many people wealthy in the process. It's unlikely that Berkshire will be able to repeat that record over the next 20 years, simply because of its size. The pool of opportunities large enough to move the needle at Berkshire is small because the numbers are so big. Another issue: Buffett is now 87 years old. New leaders will take the reins at Berkshire at some point down the road, and there's no guarantee they can match Buffett's acumen for deal-making.None of this means that Berkshire isn't a solid long-term investment. Buffett's focus on acquiring companies with durable competitive advantages makes messing up Berkshire exceptionally difficult, even if the rate of mistakes goes up under new management. The company's vast insurance operations will continue to provide  , and other businesses like BNSF Railway and Berkshire Hathaway Energy should keep throwing off billions in cash for years to come.Berkshire has been the ultimate buy-and-hold stock for the past 50 years. While the next 20 years probably won't be as lucrative for investors, Berkshire is still a great long-term investment. Back in 1997, still in the internet's infancy, a website called Priceline.com made its debut. The online travel site gained popularity from its \"Name Your Own Price\" tool, and while many dot-com era start-ups never reached profitability and failed, Priceline made it through.Fast forward more than two decades, and Priceline.com still exists. A holding company was created --  as Booking Holdings -- and houses Priceline.com, Asia-based travel site Agoda, KAYAK, Rentalcars.com, restaurant reservation site OpenTable, and the biggest brand, Booking.com. Online travel and accommodations search and booking has grown into a big industry, and Booking is the world leader. 2017 revenues were at $12.68 billion, an 18% increase over 2016, and company management thinks its double-digit growth trajectory will continue.Interest in travel is on the rise, driven by generational changes in the U.S. -- the kids these days value life experiences over material possessions -- as well as rising wealth for countries around the world. Those trends provide a tailwind for Booking, but so does an increasingly connected world. As of the end of 2015, only 35% of  were booked online, according to market researcher Euromonitor. Thus, even if the travel industry stopped growing, Booking has plenty of work to do.Additionally, the company has a track record of innovating new ways to discover vacation destinations and acquiring other fast-growing companies in travel and related industries. Booking Holdings has made it through thick and thin since its debut in the 1990s, and it looks like a solid company worth holding for another couple of decades.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

James Hardiman is kicking off coverage for some of the major online travel companies this week, and while he's tagging market darling  (NASDAQ: BKNG) with a bullish outperform rating, he's actually going with neutral calls on  (NASDAQ: EXPE) ,  (NASDAQ: TRIP) , and  (NASDAQ: TRVG) .Hardiman likes Booking Holdings, the company that used to trade as Priceline until changing its corporate moniker earlier this year. He feels that there's still plenty of upside left for what he considers the best-in-class online travel agent. He's setting a price target of $2,500 on the stock, representing more than 20% of upside off of current levels. He feels that its shrewd investments -- including Kayak, restaurant reservations specialist OpenTable, and several international platforms -- will continue to pay off.Image source: Booking Holdings.Wedbush's analyst isn't as convinced that the other names will hold up as nicely as Booking Holdings. He's tagging Expedia -- Booking's nearest rival -- with a neutral rating. His $117 price target suggests less than half of the upside possible with Booking Holdings. Hardiman feels that elevated costs and a lofty current valuation don't warrant the same kind of optimism that he's glossing Booking Holdings with this week. He sees any potential bounce in Expedia's fundamentals not happening until the second half of this year at the earliest.Hardiman is also lukewarm on TripAdvisor, the popular aggregator of travel reviews. He's holding back until he sees signs of stabilization with its hotel and non-hotel listings. There may be some positives in  -- including its first profitability increase for its flagship hotel segment after six quarters of declines -- but revenue growth continues to be a challenge. He's not encouraged by overall margin trends at TripAdvisor, and his $42 price target also suggests less than half of the near-term upside as Booking Holdings.Finally we have Trivago, the leading hotel listings aggregator. The stock has taken a beating since Booking Holdings and Expedia  , crushing top-line growth at the once-promising Germany-based dot-com. Hardiman sees a difficult path to profitability for Trivago. It's in a pickle. If it reduces advertising expenses to cut costs, it will translate into declining qualified referrals. He's staying on the sidelines until he sees a clearer long-term outlook here. His $7.50 price target suggests slightly more appreciation upside than TripAdvisor and Expedia, but still well short of Booking Holdings.One would think that if the state of online travel improves for one company, it would benefit all of the players, but we've already seen that this isn't the case.

The answer is simple: There are always plenty of growth stocks with upside potential if you know where to look.Today, three of our Motley Fool investors will highlight their favorite growth plays for this market:  (NASDAQ: JD) ,  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , and  (NYSE: MA) .Image source: Getty Images. JD.com is China's second-largest e-commerce company after  (NYSE: BABA) . Between 2014 and 2017, JD.com's share of the Chinese e-commerce market grew from 18% to 33%, according to Analysys International Enfodesk. During the same period, Tmall's shares slid from 55% to 51%.Market share growth was fueled by four factors. First, JD gained new customers as many smaller business-to-consumer marketplaces collapsed. Second, its biggest investor is  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) , which owns WeChat, China's most popular messaging app. Tencent's integration of JD's marketplace into WeChat significantly strengthened JD's position against Alibaba.Third, JD attracted partnerships from a growing list of companies, which  Alibaba's growth, and co-invested  with Tencent. These moves further widened its moat against Alibaba. Lastly, JD owns and operates its own warehouses and logistics network, while Alibaba mainly relies on third-party merchants and logistics providers. This makes it easier for JD to keep counterfeit products out of its marketplace.Revenue rose 40% to $55.7 billion in 2017, while its non-GAAP net income jumped 140% to $0.8 billion. It also reported a GAAP profit of $18 million, compared to a net loss in 2016. Analysts expect JD's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to rise 30% and 64% this year. The stock still trades at a reasonable 48 times forward earnings, indicating that it could still have room to run as it ramps up the pressure on Alibaba. The travel industry proved to be one of the easiest areas for the internet to disrupt, and Booking Holdings has been involved in that transformation from the beginning. Formerly known as Priceline Group,  to reflect the central role that its Booking.com hotel reservation website plays among its extensive group of websites. Yet you'll also find other key players under its corporate umbrella, including the Priceline, Kayak, and Cheapflights travel sites and the OpenTable reservations specialist.Even though the company has grown extensively in the past 20 years, Booking Holdings has still been able to sustain impressive growth rates. In its most recent quarter, the company sported revenue and adjusted earnings gains of nearly 20%, led largely by its core hotel booking activity across its platforms. Consolidation within the industry has put a huge portion of the overall online travel business in the hands of just a few different companies, and Booking Holdings hasn't hesitated to make strategic moves where appropriate. With solid economic conditions across most of the globe and rising interest in travel, Booking Holdings has established itself as a key growth leader and is likely to hold on to that role for years to come. Mastercard's growth in recent years has been phenomenal. A surge in digital payments, driven largely by e-commerce, has pushed the payments processing giant's revenue higher and higher as more and more people across the globe purchase goods and services using the company's co-branded credit and debit cards. Mastercard shares have doubled in just the past three years. In 10 years, the stock has risen sevenfold.Mastercard is a typical growth company that plows back more money into the business than give away to shareholders. The strategy  , as is evidenced by its high 30%-plus returns on invested capital in each of the past nine years. Not surprisingly, the stock has soared.The good news is that Mastercard has tremendous growth potential left as the digital economy expands, especially in populous nations like India that are still primarily cash-driven and where Mastercard has already established a solid presence. Meanwhile, to ensure it stays updated on the technology front, Mastercard is aggressively adopting emerging trends such as artificial intelligence, which should pave the way to a more secure, advanced, and a widely accepted payments network.Given Matercard's solid operational and financial standing and the significant growth catalysts ahead, I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock continue to soar in the coming years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares have added about 9.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BKNG due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Booking Holdings Inc. reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017.Non-GAAP net earnings of $16.86 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $2.74 and were better than the guided range of $13.4-$14.0 per share. Earnings increased 53% sequentially and 19% year over year.Revenues of $2.8 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $103 million. However, revenues were down 36.8% sequentially but up 19.4% from the prior-year quarter.On a year-over-year basis, both agency and merchant business showed strong momentum. Room nights, Rental cars and airline tickets, all performed impressively. On the call, management stated that the company will continue to focus on investments in people, systems and marketing with a long-term outlook.Overall, we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market, Booking Holdings' strong position in international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position.However, weaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs. In a year's time, the stock has surged 10.5%, significantly underperforming the industry's gain of 66%.Revenues in DetailsBooking Holdings generates the bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 19/74% in the fourth quarter (previous quarter split was (16/77%).Merchant revenues were down 25.7% sequentially but up 15.6% year over year. Agency revenues decreased 41.2% sequentially but increased 19.4% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising & Other revenues were down 1.9% sequentially but up 29% from last year. These are basically non inter-company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable.On a year-over-year basis, room nights volumes increased 16.8%. Also, rental car days increased 5.4% and airline tickets were up 3.1%.Booking Holdings' room night growth is attributable to geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from local and international players.BookingsBooking Holdings' overall bookings were up 19% (14% in constant currency) year over year and above management's guided range.Merchant bookings were up 39% from the prior-year quarter and agency bookings increased 15.7% from the year-ago levels.Booking Holdings reported pro forma gross margin of 98.8%, up 16 basis points (bps) sequentially and 189 bps year over year.Owing to the nature of its business and mix of agency versus merchant revenues, management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter.

After Booking stepped up its bidding on Trivago's platform, leading to a jump in revenue at Trivago, Booking began violating Trivago's rules; when Trivago penalized it, Booking reduced its bidding. As a result, Trivago's revenue growth suddenly slowed over the third and fourth quarters of last year.With the company operating at breakeven and revenue growth suddenly slowing, investors continued to seem jittery about the stock.Image source: Trivago.In the beginning of April, Wedbush analyst James Hardiman  those fears, giving an outperform rating to Booking, but neutral ratings to Trivago, Expedia, and  .On Trivago, Hardiman argued that the company was facing a dilemma.

Shares of the hotel-search specialist made its debut at $11 in December 2016 after the company was spun off by majority owner  (NASDAQ: EXPE) and rocketed higher through the first half of 2017, more than doubling to a high of $24.27. However, after a disappointing second-quarter earnings report, the  ,  $7 at one point. Today, it trades around $8.50.Underlying that volatility was the company's erratic revenue growth. After jumping by more than 60% in the first half of 2017, revenue growth slowed to just 7% in the fourth quarter.What gives? That sudden swing rocked the stock, but Trivago should be able to recover. Let's take a closer look at what caused the wild volatility in revenue.Image source: Trivago.As a hotel metasearch provider, Trivago allows travelers to search for a hotel according to their own specifications and preferences with options such as a pool, parking, and breakfast, and it pulls in bids in from other online travel agencies and hotel chains themselves.I talked to Trivago CFO Axel Hefer, who explained there was \"a lot of noise\" in the numbers and said investors should understand that \"data points are relative.\" Trivago's erratic revenue growth was driven largely by how  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , formerly known as Priceline, has used the platform. In 2015, Hefer explained, Booking made up about 25% of the company's revenue in 2015 but started bidding aggressively after that, increasing its revenue share to 44%, driving up Trivago's sales significantly. Direct revenue accelerated from 43% in 2015 to 66% in 2016, largely because of the change in Booking's strategy, which drove up cost-per-click rates.However, Booking began deviating from Trivago's rules. Once users click on a hotel on Trivago's site, they aren't supposed to see any other options, but Booking was showing users alternatives, which reduces clicks on Trivago's platform, since users can just stay on Booking's site. Booking was too strong to kick out of the platform, so Trivago instead modified its ranking algorithm with a score based on user experience, which meant Booking had to pay a higher price. As a result, Booking went back to its old format, reducing its activity on Trivago and moving more of it to Google. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Booking made up just 33% of Trivago's revenue.For the coming year, Trivago sees a decline in revenue in the first half of the year as it laps a year when Booking paid it penalties. In other words, the expected revenue decline isn't due to weakness in the underlying business, but to a one-time windfall from a year ago. Management sees revenue growth returning in the second half of the year as comparisons get easier, and with full-year revenue growth expected at 5%-10%, second-half revenue growth could top 20%.With the shenanigans from Booking Holdings now fading in the rearview mirror, Trivago's growth should stabilize from here. Over the long term, Hefer expects it to continue to outgrow the broader online travel industry, which has been increasing sales by about 10% a year as Trivago builds brand recognition outside its home base in Europe. As a provider of hotel metasearch, the company is unique in the online travel space.On the bottom line, Trivago has been operating around breakeven in recent quarters. If the company can take meaningful steps to profitability and deliver steady revenue growth, the stock should gradually recover.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In a note to investors, Nowak claimed that Amazon's \"focus on selection/service, pricing, and frictionless payment that drive conversion and stronger user economics also translate directly to travel.\"Nowak estimates that over 300 million of Amazon's customers would likely spend money on a potential travel offering. He notes that online travel companies like Booking and Expedia spend about $620 million annually to acquire their global hotel inventories, which would be a tiny investment compared to Amazon's projected revenues of $233.4 billion this year.Image source: Getty Images.Nowak believes that if Amazon builds an online hotel business roughly half the size of Expedia's, it could generate $600 million in profits per year -- which would be equivalent to 20% of Amazon's $3 billion in net profits in 2017. Those numbers sound great, but Nowak also glosses over some important facts.Amazon added hotel listings to its daily deals platform, Amazon Local, in early 2015. In April of that year, Amazon launched a dedicated hotel booking platform called Destinations. The platform also helped customers find nearby \"getaway destinations\" for weekend trips.Amazon expanded Destinations to 35 cities, but it abruptly discontinued the service and pulled its hotel deals from Amazon Local in October. At the end of 2015, Amazon also pulled the plug on Amazon Local, effectively surrendering the daily deals market to  .Amazon's  was surprising, since many analysts had expected the retailer to disrupt the OTA (online travel agency) market and cause big headaches for Booking and Expedia. Amazon never explained its exit, merely stating that it \"learned a lot\" from the experience.However, the most obvious reason for Amazon's exit was the competition. The OTA market in the US is essentially a duopoly between Booking and Expedia.Expedia and its subsidiaries (Hotels.com, Hotwire, Travelocity, Orbitz, and CheapTickets) accounted for 65% of all OTA bookings last year, according to Hitwise. Booking and its main subsidiary Priceline accounted for 33% of all bookings.Amazon's strongest e-commerce market is the US. That's why it uses it as a launchpad for ecosystem-building services like Alexa, Amazon Prime, Amazon Video, and AmazonFresh. If Amazon can't get a foothold in the US OTA market -- as Amazon Local Travel and Destinations failed to do -- it's unlikely to expand the service elsewhere. 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google also tried to disrupt the OTA market by adding flight, hotel, and vacation planning features over the past few years. Those orders are directly booked through airlines and hotels, which cuts OTAs out of the loop.But despite that \"disruptive\" competition, the two main OTAs kept growing their revenues.Source: The reason was simple: just as consumers start product searches on Amazon and online searches on Google, they start travel searches on one of the main OTA sites. Those old habits are  .Nowak admits that \"online travel has proven to be immune to Amazon disruption so far,\" but \"that doesn't mean Amazon won't try again, and they should.\" Perhaps Nowak has a point.Amazon's Prime member base in the US grew from 54 million in 2015 to 90 million last year according to research firm CIRP. The average Prime member spends about $1,300 annually on the site, compared to $700 for non-members. Amazon repeatedly added products like Echo and services like Amazon Video and AmazonFresh to that ecosystem, which locked in its users more tightly than ever.As that expansion continues, the notion of introducing Prime discounts for airline tickets and hotels could gain steam. If Amazon rolls with the idea, consumers could soon be booking travel plans on their Alexa-powered devices -- and gradually forgetting about traditional OTAs like Booking and Expedia.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. It's Wednesday, February 28th. Welcome to  ! I'm Chris Hill. I promised you, Australia Week begins today. With me in studio is Mr. Australia himself, Scott Phillips. Thanks for being here! Thank you, Chris! Good to be with you! I say Mr. Australia. It sounds more impressive than it is, doesn't it? Well, let's face it, Mr. Australia sounds like a bodybuilding contest winner. [laughs] If only this was just audio, people could believe you. Unfortunately for those people watching at home, I'm not going to quite carry that off. But maybe in your younger days. Under the shirt. But, Scott, for those who are unfamiliar, Scott is the general manager of Motley Fool Australia. This gives me a nice opportunity to remind people, because most of our listeners, most of the dozens, are here in the United States -- The Motley Fool has operations in Germany, Canada, Singapore, the U.K., later this year, Japan, and a very nice operation going on in Australia that you're heading up. Things are good. And also the host of  , which we'll get to. But we have news to get to. The Earningspalooza continues to roll on. Let's start with, and bear with me, people, because if you've been listening for the last couple of years, you know that I haven't really made the switch from Google to  , so it's going to take me even longer to make the switch from Priceline to their brand-new name, Booking Holdings. They didn't get the marketers involved with that, Chris. What should we call this thing? We'll get to that in a second. Alright. We're going to see if we can help them. A bit of Australian flair. Exactly. Fourth quarter revenue for Priceline/Booking Holdings came in higher than expected. They wrapped up another great year. The stock is up 9%. I mean, this thing, I kid that we're going to help them. Maybe the one thing we could help them with is their name, because when it comes to running their business, these people are fantastic. They're doing a spectacular job. Interestingly enough, it was partly a case of low expectations. Revenue is up, margins are still down because of their concerns around how much commission they can get from the bookings they're passing through. So, they're still in that weird situation of, top line is growing, that's good. Margins, kind of falling away. I think they'll be OK. And I think there's an Australian operation,  , who most of your listeners won't now, who've been exactly through this thing. When you're getting top line growth, you're struggling on the bottom line a little bit because of some one-off changes, for most investors, that's a good chance to get invested, because when the growth returns, which it will, from a one-off change, then you're off to the races. But it seems like this is a situation where, in any given quarter, they can have those margin pressures. But this is such a behemoth that it seems like, if you are a hotel, if you're anything involved with travel, I'm not saying you bend over backwards to do whatever you can to be involved with Booking Holdings, but you want to be on their platform. And here's the story: $2.3 billion in sales in the fourth quarter of last year, $2.8 billion this year. There was a whole lot more people using this platform. And when you're the go-to place, you can pretty much call the tune. If you're more relevant to more people over a longer period of time, that's absolutely the recipe. And Priceline, or Booking, as we have to now call them, is getting it done. We were talking right before we started taping about companies that have made name changes. And in this form, I mean, I mentioned Alphabet and Google, and I suppose that applies as well. What we were talking about was  (NYSE: TPR) , which is a name that I don't think either of us particularly loves, but it's the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. And I understand the reasoning in a couple of ways. One is, if you're Tapestry, or in this case, if you're Booking Holdings, you have multiple parts of your business, and you don't necessarily want Wall Street analysts focusing on the namesake. In the case of Booking Holdings, yes, they own Priceline, but they also own booking.com, which is a more significant part of their business. Same thing with Coach, and probably even more relevant in the case of Coach, because there were quarters where Stuart Weitzman was doing well, Kate Spade was doing well, but the namesake brand was not, and they got, maybe, overly punished as a result of that. And then there's the internal, where if you work at booking.com, you might have some level of resentment. \"We're bigger than Priceline, why is the company named after Priceline?\" I think that's right, Chris. I have to say, when you go from $2.3 billion to $2.8 billion in revenue, the last thing you should be worrying about is what your corporate name is. If Wall Street can't cope with the fact that you've grown your revenue by $500 million year on year -- yes, the companies will manage the share price, yes, they manage the Street. Your listeners know well that's frankly a short-term and pretty stupid thing to bother with, but companies do. It's going to make a lot more money next year and the year after and the year after that. You'd be wasting time changing your name to try and get some sort of relevance. The business is the business is the business. You can call it something entirely different if you want to, like Tapestry. To change it from one brand to another is kind of crazy. What happens when the other brand gets bigger? Do they change it again? What is the company if it's not the business you're working for? That's where I feel like we could help them. Say what you want about Tapestry, and goodness knows we did, but at least they took a flyer on a brand new name, and it's creative. If anyone has suggestions, you can tweet @MarketFoolery or email  . We'd like to come up with something better. Maybe it's Global Travel something. I'm not sure. I bet we can just go through the Carole King discography and pick another album. There's plenty there. Exactly. Tapestry worked. [laughs] It worked for them. Let's move on from online travel to something a bit more pedestrian but also a bit more delicious, and that's pizza. Papa John's wrapping up a tough fiscal year. Their fourth quarter profits came in lower than expected, their same-store sales falling nearly 4%. I get that the stock was up a little bit today, but over the past 12 months, this stock is down around 25%. Yeah, this is bad. They're not only lower-than-expected, but lower than last year, as well, which makes it worse. Sometimes, too bullish an expectation is one thing. This is a business that's in decline. Same-store sales are down, earnings are down from an adjusted $0.69 to $0.65. That's the reverse of Booking Holdings. You have more people coming through the door, that's a good thing. You deal with a margin in the short-term. When you have fewer people coming through the door, and people saying, \"No thank you, I'd rather go somewhere else, I'll have something else,\" that's a tough business to be in. And on a chain basis ... think about retail stores, we talk about unit profitability. If you have same-store sales falling, that really starts to hurt the bottom line pretty badly. I think they've probably done some work to keep the bottom line in decent shape this year. If they have the same problem next year, you're going to see even more losses, I think, from the top line. And I think at least a little bit of what we're seeing with Papa John's stock today is, maybe, some optimism that, \"We're putting this year in the books. That's done. Among other things, we'll have slightly easier comps in the current fiscal year, in the next 12 months. And, we have a new CEO, so maybe that works.\" Although, the earnings for Papa John's are taking a backseat in terms of the headlines, because the headlines of Papa John's today is the ending of their relationship with the NFL, or, as the official sponsor of the NFL. And Pizza Hut, which is owned by  , stepped right in and said, \"We're happy to be the official sponsor of the NFL.\" Of course Papa John's should cancel it. The NFL with the entire reason for Papa John's weaknesses. We've heard that from the CEO. He's come out and said, \"You know what? Our business would be fine except for that football league over there that's really costing us money.\" If only it wasn't for the NFL, Chris, we wouldn't be talking about Papa John's today. Again, I think a little bit of the outcome with this stock is the founder and now-former CEO John Schnatter stepping aside. I think either he realized pretty quickly, or people around him realized pretty quickly, he made a big mistake by blaming the NFL ratings for falling pizza sales. It wasn't like people ate less dinners because the NFL ratings are down, right? That's true. I'm curious, since I don't know a lot about sports in Australia, other than Australian rules football. I've talked before on the podcast about how, when I was a kid way back in the 1980s and first got ESPN, ESPN was a very young cable network, did not have a lot of money to buy the rights to major U.S. sports programming. One of the rights that they were able to buy was Australian rules football. Which one of my brothers and I watched and were fascinated by, because it seemed like sort of a hybrid of American football and rugby. It was very exciting, and very fun to watch. That's a big sport? Yeah. I'm going to offend whatever portion of the dozens are Australian, or at least half of those guys, by saying, the detractors for Australian rules football call it aerial ping-pong. It's kind of nice. If you think about it, that's kind of what the game is. Those who love it will be throwing things at their podcast machine right now. Yeah, it's the biggest winter sport in Australia. We also play rugby league, rugby union, plenty of ball sports. Not a lot of soccer, but a little bit. It's a different sport. Let's go back to Papa John's and the NFL. What's the relationship between commercial entities and the professional sports leagues? All kidding aside, it was a very big deal for Papa John's for many years that they were the official pizza of the NFL. I think Pizza Hut is going to make as much hay as possible out of the fact that they are now. Is it similar in that regard in Australia, where companies are looking to align their brands with sports leagues? Yeah, definitely. Watching the NFL, watching some American sport, where you have reasonably untouched jerseys, except for maybe a clothing logo in the top right hand or left-hand corner of a jersey ... by contrast, Australian jerseys are walking billboards. You have the front of the jersey, the back of the jersey, the top and the bottom, there's branding all over these things. I think it's partly the fact that we don't have the same size and scope of companies you do here. So, being the official pizza of the NFL is something, and it's a lot. In Australia, you have little local advertising, local businesses advertising on the backs of sports jerseys. It's very much a smaller business story. So, to get value for money, they're putting logos everywhere -- on the grounds, on the billboards, on the players themselves, heaps of that.And, gambling is a big thing in Australia. We joke that we'd bid on two flies crawling up a wall. That's probably pretty true. Gambling is everywhere. Gambling sponsorship is all over the place -- again, jerseys, clubs, painted on the ground quite literally. Plenty of sponsorship. It's all on the jerseys, on the players, not as much reserved as the official food/ beverage/ beer/ whatever it is of the sport. This is interesting to me. Gambling and sports, Matt Argersinger made the point recently that whatever money is spent legally in Las Vegas on sports betting is dwarfed by the amount of illegal betting that goes on. We're getting ready to kick off the college basketball tournament, which is, a massive amount of money will be bet illegally on the college basketball games. Surely. People who are pushing against legalized sports betting in the United States, one of the arguments they make is the influence it will have on the game itself. To what extent, if any, has that played out in Australian rules football, rugby, cricket, anything? There actually has been allegations of what they call spot-fixing. I don't know if you guys are familiar with the term. That's where you don't fix the outright result of the game, but you might fix an over of cricket, or a kicked goal, or a penalty -- Point-shaving. Exactly, right, that sort of thing. And there's been allegations and investigations by police and others of certain games of football, certain games of cricket, where that has been alleged to have happened. We don't yet know whether it's actually happened. But, that's around the place. I don't know that sponsorship is a direct result of that, it's more the fact that the gambling outfits, legal or illegal, are still going to have that. The fact that I can put my $5 down with a bookie to bet on the result of a football game is not going to change the result. The hundreds of thousands of dollars being bet offshore, someone makes a phone call and gets a player to do X, Y, or Z, that's the biggest story. So, I don't know if betting directly impacts it. What people do complain about in Australia is the televised nature of gambling promotion. There's five year old and seven year old kids watching football and seeing ads from a betting agency or an alcohol company. There's more of that impact on the viewers, rather than the game itself. Interesting. Before we wrap up, I mentioned this at the top, for those unfamiliar -- I get this question, I would say, at least once a month or so from listeners outside the United States, and they ask, \"Do you have podcasts in the other parts of the world?\" And I always point them to your version of  , which you -- Stole. What's that? We stole it. We stole the name. [laughs] You're more than welcome to the name. Thank you! You and Andrew Page host it. This is available everywhere you find podcasts.

Even when you look back at the past 10 years and the collapse in the market in 2008, the market has surpassed its old highs by dramatic margins.A few stocks have delivered even better performance over that time period. When you look at  (NYSE: DPZ) ,  (NASDAQ: BKNG) , and  (NASDAQ: ULTA) , you'll find that investing just $7,000 to purchase shares of any of those three companies back in 2008 would have left you now with more than $130,000 each.

That's been enough to turn an initial $7,000 into almost $138,000. The move comes as part of one of the most impressive turnarounds ever. A decade ago, most people had extremely negative opinions of Domino's, largely centering on the quality of its pizza. Some companies would simply have sunk into their low-quality niche and made the best of a bad situation.Image source: Domino's. instead chose to revamp its entire operations. It brought in experts to improve the taste of its pizza and to expand its menu selection. It renovated its store locations to make them more attractive, and it upgraded its technology to facilitate mobile and online ordering to keep up with changing consumer trends. Expansion led to Domino's stores popping up across the globe. The result has been that Domino's now claims to be the largest pizza chain on the planet, and solid gains have sustained the stock's positive momentum. With a successful franchise model that depends on healthy partnerships between the company and its store owners,  in 2018 and beyond. for investors, but the online travel giant formerly known as Priceline Group is an old favorite among growth investors. Gains of about 1,770% over the past 10 years would have turned a $7,000 investment into almost $131,000 today. Booking's success has come largely as a result of its early recognition of the value of building up strong relationships internationally, offering customers a wide selection of hotels and other travel services worldwide. That produced a competitive advantage in an area in which peers in the space have had to rush to catch up.Booking's name change reflects its desire to refocus on its core Booking.com hotel reservation system, but the company's real promise is in its wide array of different online and mobile travel resources. With services that include making restaurant reservations on OpenTable and comparing multiple websites on Kayak, Booking's portfolio of properties will give it an edge in an industry that's already seen plenty of consolidation. Declines in growth rates could  , but there's still room for the company to expand the size of its business.Finally, Ulta Beauty has been a giant in the cosmetics and salon industry, with its innovative retail and salon stores producing an excellent combination of product and services sales. A gain of 1,790% over the past 10 years would have left investors putting $7,000 into the stock in 2008 with shares worth more than $132,000. The opportunity to purchase beauty supplies in the same trip that one actually uses them in visiting the in-store salon has been a successful way to spur business.Of these three stocks, Ulta is the only one that has seen a dramatic pullback recently, with substantial declines over the past year or so that have taken the stock down from even loftier heights.  quickly, but comparable-store sales growth has slowed to single-digit percentage levels, and rising expenses have led to falling margin figures. CEO Mary Dillon has plans to get Ulta moving back in the right direction again, but it could take time for the salon giant to return to its former glory.These stocks are extraordinary, but the benefit of having a 10-year time horizon is that you can afford to let the best stocks in the market keep making money for you. By seeking out great long-term prospects, you can improve your chances of finding the next Ulta, Booking, or Domino's to add to your portfolio.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Instead of being traded electronically with ease, the majority of institutional-level bond trading -- even to this day -- still occurs over email or the phone.MarketAxess Holdings was founded in 2000 to fix this slow and inefficient process once and for all. The company's solution was to develop the world's first electronic bond-trading platform.Given the advantages that come from trading online -- faster execution, better access to data, increased regulatory compliance -- Wall Street has started to embraced MarketAxess' platform. When combined with the company's first-mover advantage, MarketAxess has grown into the largest electronic bond trading platform in the world.The company's scale has been hugely advantageous for investors because this is a  kind of market. Bond sellers naturally want to trade where the most bond buyers are, and vice versa. That fact has created a wonderful  that has allowed revenue, profits, and the stock price to soar. Thankfully, I don't think the company's run will be ending anytime soon. MarketAxess is constantly adding new products and functionality to its platform.

Booking.com was the first mover in the lucrative European hotel market. The company painstaking built out a huge network of hotels in the region, most of which are small mom-and-pop type operations. These hotels often lack the resources and know-how to attract online shoppers, so they happily signed on to Booking.com's platform.Image source: Getty Images.Those early investments in the platform turned out to be a stroke of genius because shoppers quickly learned that Booking.com had the largest selection of hotels. In turn, that drew in more shoppers who favor selection, which incentivized even more hotels to join the platform. This created a  that has fueled rapid revenue and profit growth for years.While Booking Holding's performance has been extremely impressive for years, there's ample reason to believe this business still has a tremendous amount of  . When combined with the company's long history of improving margins, buying back stock, and making smart acquisitions, I continue to believe double-digit profit growth is likely for the foreseeable future.I'm not much of a beauty enthusiast myself, but I must admit that Ulta Beauty's stock looks quite attractive.Ulta is the largest purveyor of beauty products in the U.S. The company sells a huge range of personal care products that include cosmetics, fragrance, skin care, and hair care products at more than 1,000 stores. What's more, each of its stores features a full-service salon that offers a variety of hair, skin, and brow services.Ulta has attracted a cult-like following among beauty shoppers because it provides a shopping experience that isn't easily replicated elsewhere (including online). Shoppers can sample a wide range of beauty products in the store at a wide variety of price points. In addition, Ulta's employees do not operate on commissions, so customers do not have to deal with high-pressure sales tactics that have been employed at department stores for decades.These factors help Ultra draw millions of repeat shoppers each year. More than 26 million beauty enthusiasts have also joined the company's loyalty program which earns them discounts and access to special promotions. When combined, it's no wonder Ulta has been  in the beauty industry for years.So, what's the potential here? Ulta had 1,058 stores in its portfolio as of the end of September 2017, and the company believes this number will eventually top out at 1,700 in the U.S. To hit that number, management plans on adding about 100 stores per year for the foreseeable future. When combined with steady gains in same-store sales, international growth, stock buybacks, margin improvements, and growth in its e-commerce business, I think this business can continue to crank out double-digit profit growth for the foreseeable future.And yet, despite its long-term history of success, Ulta's stock hasn't been immune to  at large. The pressure has compressed Ulta's valuation to levels we haven't been seen in years, which I think is affording opportunistic investors a great chance to get in.All three of these companies are have delivered stellar results for their long-term investors over time and remain in great shape to continue doing the same for years to come. That's why I think all three of these winners are excellent places for investors to park their capital today.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

The stock is down nearly 25% this year, and the fourth-quarter results were another set of worse-than-expected numbers. But despite that, there was a hint of optimism in the market about the company today. Is it misplaced, or are the changes the company has made at the top, and with its NFL sponsorship, going to give it a boost?A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Papa John's International wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! Papa John's wrapping up a tough fiscal year. Their fourth quarter profits came in lower than expected, their same-store sales falling nearly 4%. I get that the stock was up a little bit today, but over the past 12 months, this stock is down around 25%. Yeah, this is bad. They're not only lower-than-expected, but lower than last year, as well, which makes it worse. Sometimes, too bullish an expectation is one thing. This is a business that's in decline. Same-store sales are down, earnings are down from an adjusted $0.69 to $0.65. That's the reverse of  . You have more people coming through the door, that's a good thing. You deal with a margin in the short-term. When you have fewer people coming through the door, and people saying, \"No thank you, I'd rather go somewhere else, I'll have something else,\" that's a tough business to be in. And on a chain basis ... think about retail stores, we talk about unit profitability. If you have same-store sales falling, that really starts to hurt the bottom line pretty badly. I think they've probably done some work to keep the bottom line in decent shape this year. If they have the same problem next year, you're going to see even more losses, I think, from the top line. And I think at least a little bit of what we're seeing with Papa John's stock today is, maybe, some optimism that, \"We're putting this year in the books. That's done. Among other things, we'll have slightly easier comps in the current fiscal year, in the next 12 months. And, we have a new CEO, so maybe that works.\" Although, the earnings for Papa John's are taking a backseat in terms of the headlines, because the headlines of Papa John's today is the ending of their relationship with the NFL, or, as the official sponsor of the NFL. And Pizza Hut, which is owned by  , stepped right in and said, \"We're happy to be the official sponsor of the NFL.\" Of course Papa John's should cancel it. The NFL with the entire reason for Papa John's weaknesses. We've heard that from the CEO. He's come out and said, \"You know what? Our business would be fine except for that football league over there that's really costing us money.\" If only it wasn't for the NFL, Chris, we wouldn't be talking about Papa John's today. Again, I think a little bit of the outcome with this stock is the founder and now-former CEO John Schnatter stepping aside. I think either he realized pretty quickly, or people around him realized pretty quickly, he made a big mistake by blaming the NFL ratings for falling pizza sales. It wasn't like people ate less dinners because the NFL ratings are down, right? That's true.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n this segment from the  podcast, host Chris Hill is joined by Scott Phillips, The Motley Fool's director of research in Australia, to chat about The Priceline Group, which gave itself a new name late last month:  (NASDAQ: BKNG) . The online-travel-site operator's top line is rising, but its margins and the bottom line are temporarily less than ideal, which could be good for investors. And as for that less-than-inspiring name change, the Fools have some thoughts on that, too.A full transcript follows the video.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market. (In fact, the newsletter they run,  has tripled the market!*)Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now. Booking Holdings Inc.  -- but there are nine others you may be overlooking. Let's start with, and bear with me, people, because if you've been listening for the last couple of years, you know that I haven't really made the switch from Google to  , so it's going to take me even longer to make the switch from Priceline to their brand-new name, Booking Holdings. They didn't get the marketers involved with that, Chris. What should we call this thing? We'll get to that in a second. Alright. We're going to see if we can help them. A bit of Australian flair. Exactly. Fourth quarter revenue for Priceline/Booking Holdings came in higher than expected. They wrapped up another great year. The stock is up 9%. I mean, this thing, I kid that we're going to help them. Maybe the one thing we could help them with is their name, because when it comes to running their business, these people are fantastic. They're doing a spectacular job. Interestingly enough, it was partly a case of low expectations. Revenue is up, margins are still down because of their concerns around how much commission they can get from the bookings they're passing through. So, they're still in that weird situation of, top line is growing, that's good. Margins, kind of falling away. I think they'll be OK. And I think there's an Australian operation,  , who most of your listeners won't now, who've been exactly through this thing. When you're getting top line growth, you're struggling on the bottom line a little bit because of some one-off changes, for most investors, that's a good chance to get invested, because when the growth returns, which it will, from a one-off change, then you're off to the races. But it seems like this is a situation where, in any given quarter, they can have those margin pressures. But this is such a behemoth that it seems like, if you are a hotel, if you're anything involved with travel, I'm not saying you bend over backwards to do whatever you can to be involved with Booking Holdings, but you want to be on their platform. And here's the story: $2.3 billion in sales in the fourth quarter of last year, $2.8 billion this year. There was a whole lot more people using this platform. And when you're the go-to place, you can pretty much call the tune. If you're more relevant to more people over a longer period of time, that's absolutely the recipe. And Priceline, or Booking, as we have to now call them, is getting it done. We were talking right before we started taping about companies that have made name changes. And in this form, I mean, I mentioned Alphabet and Google, and I suppose that applies as well. What we were talking about was  (NYSE: TPR) , which is a name that I don't think either of us particularly loves, but it's the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. And I understand the reasoning in a couple of ways. One is, if you're Tapestry, or in this case, if you're Booking Holdings, you have multiple parts of your business, and you don't necessarily want Wall Street analysts focusing on the namesake. In the case of Booking Holdings, yes, they own Priceline, but they also own booking.com, which is a more significant part of their business. Same thing with Coach, and probably even more relevant in the case of Coach, because there were quarters where Stuart Weitzman was doing well, Kate Spade was doing well, but the namesake brand was not, and they got, maybe, overly punished as a result of that. And then there's the internal, where if you work at booking.com, you might have some level of resentment. \"We're bigger than Priceline, why is the company named after Priceline?\" I think that's right, Chris. I have to say, when you go from $2.3 billion to $2.8 billion in revenue, the last thing you should be worrying about is what your corporate name is. If Wall Street can't cope with the fact that you've grown your revenue by $500 million year on year -- yes, the companies will manage the share price, yes, they manage the Street. Your listeners know well that's frankly a short-term and pretty stupid thing to bother with, but companies do. It's going to make a lot more money next year and the year after and the year after that. You'd be wasting time changing your name to try and get some sort of relevance. The business is the business is the business. You can call it something entirely different if you want to, like Tapestry. To change it from one brand to another is kind of crazy. What happens when the other brand gets bigger? Do they change it again? What is the company if it's not the business you're working for? That's where I feel like we could help them. Say what you want about Tapestry, and goodness knows we did, but at least they took a flyer on a brand new name, and it's creative. If anyone has suggestions, you can tweet @MarketFoolery or email marketfoolery@fool.com. We'd like to come up with something better. Maybe it's Global Travel something. I'm not sure. I bet we can just go through the Carole King discography and pick another album. There's plenty there. Exactly. Tapestry worked.

Following a couple of  around 2005, including Booking.com, the brand for which it's now named, the company saw dramatic growth in hotel bookings and elsewhere in the travel sector. As a result, its shares have returned 1,560% over the past decade.Earnings per share increased even more than that during that time while revenue was up 709%. Following a  , the stock achieved an all-time high. After the past decade's blowout performance, though, investors may be wondering if Booking's outperformance will continue over the next 10 years. Let's take a closer look at its prospects.Image source: Getty Images.Perhaps the only guarantee for Booking for the next 10 years is that it will continue to grow through acquisitions. In addition to Booking.com, Booking has swallowed up several other travel companies, and its six primary brands today are Priceline.com, Booking.com, Kayak, OpenTable, agoda.com, and rentalcars.com. However, Booking continues to make smaller acquisitions, including its $550 million  , a European travel fare aggregator and metasearch engine.As the online travel market matures, the company is likely to pursue further acquisitions to fuel growth and complement its other services. The formula has worked especially well thus far so there's little reason to depart from it. In its recent 10-K filing, management said it \"may pursue strategic transactions,\" indicating it will probably make future acquisitions.Still, the online travel market has evolved into essentially a duopoly between Booking and  (NASDAQ: EXPE) , which has acquired brands like Orbitz, Travelocity, and Hotwire. The upshot of the two companies' acquisition history is that there are much fewer travel brands left to take over -- there are now only three other publicly traded online travel companies: Expedia spinoffs  and  and  , a Chinese company in which Booking already has a stake. Booking could still buy one or more of those brands.The biggest change in the travel industry in the last few years has been the rise of Airbnb and the sharing economy. Transportation services like Uber and Lyft have reduced the need to rely on rental cars, and Airbnb has given travelers another option outside hotels. While the hotel industry has continued to grow, occupancy rates have been challenged at times, and the industry has likely benefited from a strong economy. Competition from Airbnb, which tends to be cheaper than hotel rooms, could make a recession especially brutal for hotels, and therefore Booking, which depends on hotel bookings for the bulk of its income.On the  , however, CEO Glenn Fogel dismissed competition from Airbnb, noting that his company has always faced steep competition and that Booking.com has 1.2 million alternative properties like homes, apartments, and other such unique places, up 53% from a year ago. Fogel almost seemed to see Airbnb's growth as an opportunity for Booking to draw business to its own alternative listings, which he thinks have been overlooked.Indeed, the company has defended itself well against the competition, not just from within the industry but from tech giant interlopers like  and  , the latter of which aborted its own effort to build an online travel agency. Airbnb is still growing fast and will continue to disrupt the travel industry, but there appears to be room for both traditional hotels and home-sharing to coexist as they offer different benefits to travelers.Ten years from now, I expect a relatively similar Booking to what it is today. The need to travel and book hotel rooms and flights isn't going away, and will only get larger as global standards of living increase and travel becomes more affordable. Look for the company to continue making acquisitions where it's economically beneficial and to put up steady growth in the coming years. Considering Booking's effective  , the fact that the travel industry's growth is outpacing the broader global economy, and the company's strong position, the stock should continue to beat the market. With its reasonable P/E ratio today, I wouldn't be surprised to see Booking's shares at least triple over the next 10 years.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Data source: Booking Holdings quarterly earnings. YOY = year over year.Though management had called for year-over-year gross travel bookings growth of 9.5% to 14.5% in the  , the actual result was 19%. That capped another year of double-digit top and bottom line expansion for the online travel sites, an impressive feat considering the company's near $100 billion market cap.A loss of $11.41 per share was recorded in the fourth quarter due to a one-time tax expense of $1.3 billion. It was primarily attributable to a $1.6 billion charge related to the repatriation of international earnings under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December. Excluding the charge, earnings increased 19% in the quarter and increased 17% for the full year.The outlook for the start of 2018 was positive, too. Gross travel bookings, the total value of travel booked through the company's sites, is expected to increase 14.5% to 18.5% compared with last year. That should translate to 17.5% to 21.5% revenue growth.Booking Holdings may have recently changed its name, but it's up to the same industry-leading growth strategy it has executed on in the last decade. Its main moneymaker, Booking.com, ended the year with 1.6 million available properties, a near 40% increase over 2016. Included in that number are nearly 1.2 million \"alternative accommodations\" that include homes, apartments, and other unique properties.Image source: Getty Images.Booking.com recently split its property categories into two distinct classifications: traditional accommodations like hotels, motels, and resorts and unique vacation rentals. That change should help travelers narrow their search if they want a unique experience and makes the site more in-line with competitors like  -- the fast-growing start-up known for helping small property owners get their vacation rentals listed.Continuing to add new vacation properties and expanding advertising around that service has been the driving force for Booking Holdings the last few years. Management said it will aggressively expand both this year, especially focusing on making property owners online management and payment collection easier. Added to the mix, though, will be a new type of travel accommodation. CEO Glenn Fogel had this to say:That new area of focus is in keeping with the parent company's name change. Booking wants to become a holistic hub for travel and exploration rather than just a simple travel merchant. That is a wise move, as studies show that younger generations view life experiences as an increasingly more important part of their lives.Though Booking Holdings is already a large company, it's showing no signs of slowing down. With a pipeline of growth in alternative rental properties still going strong and a new initiative in vacation experiences booking just beginning, the stock looks like it has plenty of room to keep going higher.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.
